<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 14, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
        Dear Congressman:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support HR 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty and
        Public Safety Act of 1996.&quot;<p>
        
        We believe the bill was strengthened by the passage yesterday of the amendment offered
        by Rep. Barr of Georgia.  No longer do we have to fear the U.S. government infringing
        on the constitutional protections of our citizens through wire-tapping crusades conducted
        willy-nilly, and no longer do we have to fear being charged with a crime for selling
        perfectly legal property which may or may not later be used in the commission of a crime.<p>
        
        Don't believe the liberal media, which has reported that the Barr amendment &quot;gutted&quot; or
        &quot;eviscerated&quot; the legislation.  It did not.  It strengthened it, by ensuring that in our desires
        to crack down on crime and terrorism, we are not gutting the constitutional rights of
        American citizens.<p>
        
        I urge you to vote &quot;yes&quot; on HR 2703.<p>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Welfare Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 
5, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Congressman:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support legislation embodying the welfare compromise
        crafted by the National Governors Association.<p>
        
        We believe that, alone of all the possible welfare reform alternatives, the NGA proposal
        passes two critical tests:  it ends the entitlement status of welfare (a reform for which
        conservatives have been fighting for years), and it remains true to the principles of
        federalism (for which conservatives have been fighting for decades).<p>
        
        We understand that several of the leading social conservative groups oppose the NGA
        reform.  As we understand their argument, their opposition to the NGA proposal is
        primarily based on the fact that it doesn't mandate a family cap as established in HR 4.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that allowing states to set their own family caps is not as certain
        a method for seeing to their adoption nation-wide as would be mandating a federal family
        cap, it is also undeniably true that 13 states already have enacted family caps on their own,
        and another seven have already applied for the necessary federal waivers to do so.  We
        believe that more and more states would adopt them as their success was demonstrated in
        the states that have taken the lead already.  This is the essence of federalism.<p>
        
        Moreover, the NGA proposal was adopted unanimously at its early February meeting. 
        Why should a Republican-controlled Congress have a problem agreeing to a proposal
        supported by 50 state governors, most of whom are Republicans?  Isn't the essence of
        conservative government the notion that government governs best which governs closest to
        the people?<p>
        
        As Speaker Gingrich said more than a year ago, conservative micromanagement from
        Washington is just as bad as liberal micromanagement from Washington.<p>
        
        Although it is doubtful that President Clinton would sign the NGA compromise -- and it is
        not even necessary to send him a bill -- it is important for the GOP House to go on record
        supporting a proposal supported by all Democratic governors.  The NGA proposal does
        achieve the over-riding strategic goal of welfare reform:  ending the entitlement status of
        the programs, and returning power to the states.  I urge you to support the NGA proposal.<p>
        

<pre>
                              Yours sincerely,
        
        
                              David A. Keene
                                  Chairman

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Product Liability Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
       
        Dear Senator:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I'm writing today to urge you to vote for cloture tomorrow on the
        product liability conference report, and then to support its final passage.<p>
        
        America's current product liability laws are abused by lawyers seeking to make a &quot;fast
        buck&quot; and so-called consumer organizations seeking to shift blame from consumers to
        others with deep pockets.  The result is to drive up prices, make insurance unaffordable,
        and generally to deprive the public of many products which, when used as the directions
        suggest, are beneficial.<p>
        
        Trial lawyers have argued for years against meaningful reform of product liability laws, on
        the grounds that such changes would make consumers vulnerable to the wishes of so-called
        &quot;rapacious&quot; and &quot;greedy&quot; corporations.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The
        product liability laws, when amended, would allow those truly to hurt to seek redress.  But
        they would let those of us who do want to buy products, and use them responsibly, to do
        so.<p>
        
        Vote for cloture tomorrow on this important legislation.  And support when it comes to a
        final passage vote.  America's consumers will thank you.<p>
        
           
        <p>
<pre>

                                Yours sincerely,
        
        
        
        
                                 David A. Keene

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Small Business Deregulation</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support S. 942, the small business deregulation bill,
        when it comes to the floor tomorrow.<P>
        
        For far too long, America's small businesses -- the engines of economic growth -- have
        been laboring under a stultifying myriad of regulations, increasing the costs of doing
        business and making difficult the creation of new jobs so vital to the growth of our
        economy.<p>
        
        The bill's specific provisions, we believe, are eminently reasonable, and simply make
        common sense.  Waive fines for first-time offenders if the violations are corrected within a
        reasonable time period.  Let small businesses recoup their legal expenses if they win a
        challenge against excessive enforcement of existing regulations.  And give Congress a 45-day window 
        in which to review and reject newly-issued rules.<p>
        
        Support S. 942 tomorrow.  America's millions of small business owners -- and the people
        who want to work for them -- will be watching.<p>

   
 <PRE>
                             Yours sincerely,

        Friday, March 22, 1996:

        <P></center>



      <P>
      
<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 18, 1996:<br>                
        
        <p>
        Dear Congressman:<BR>
        <P>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support H.Con.Res. 148 when it comes to the floor
        tomorrow.<P>
        
        The United States must send a clear message that it will not stand aside while tyrants bully
        a peaceful, prosperous, pro-American neighbor.<P> 
        
        H.Con.Res. 148 expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should demand that
        the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) live up to its prior promises to resolve differences
        with the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) by peaceful means, and that the United
        States should assist in the ROC's defense if the PRC attacks.<P>
        
        For decades, the PRC has relentlessly striven to isolate the ROC from the world
        community. Despite the mainland regime's mean-spirited policy, the ROC is an important,
        influential participant in international affairs. It is one of the few rising democracies in
        East Asia, promoting and protecting economic, political and individual liberty. The ROC's
        national legislature and virtually all provincial and municipal officials are chosen by direct
        popular vote in free elections. This month, for the first time in China's long history, a
        direct popular election for president will occur. The ROC's political and economic
        progress is a textbook model of what bipartisan U.S. policy has always encouraged the
        world over.<P>
        
        Both the PRC and ROC agree that there should be one unified China. Each has long
        claimed to be China's sole legitimate government, but only the ROC has taken positive
        steps toward compromise. It conducts itself under a &QUOT;one China, two governments&QUOT; policy
        while working to resolve other differences case-by-case. Regrettably, recent events again
        underscore the fact that peace derives from strength and only constant pressure and resolve
        make untrustworthy Communists abide by their agreements.<P>
                 
        The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 does not obligate the U. S. to assist the ROC should it
        become a victim of aggression. H.Con.Res. 148 can be an important step toward
        clarifying ambiguity and focusing the moral and political imperatives for U.S. policy. The
        choice is clear: if ever there was a stark case of &QUOT;good guys&QUOT; and &QUOT;bad guys,&QUOT; this is it. <P>
               
    <p>
   <PRE>
                            Yours sincerely,

<P><H2>Forbes and term limits' enduring appeal</H2>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
 </CENTER>

<P>To hear the reports about Steve Forbes' prospects in the Republican presidential race in Iowa and New Hampshire, he's a Johnny-One-Note: the flat tax. In fact, Mr. Forbes is a Johnny-Two-Note: He has also been crusading for term limits for the U.S. Congress.

<P>While the media are generally known to be disdainful of term limits, the public has consistently expressed overwhelming approval for virtually every single one of the various proposals to limit the amount of time elected representatives may serve. Whether in the form of state laws that unilaterally limit their own representatives' terms in Congress or a constitutional amendment that would limit the federal terms of all elected officials, public support for term limits is extraordinarily consistent and extensive. One poll last year found 76 percent declaring that they would favor term limits even &quot;if limiting the terms of Congress meant that you would never be able to vote for your current member of Congress or for your senator.&quot;

<P>Before the U.S. Supreme Court last May declared unconstitutional all term-limit laws applying to the U.S. Congress, virtually every state where the issue came to a vote had passed term-limits referenda. By then, 23 states had term-limit laws, including 14 of the 17 contiguous states west of the Mississippi. The historic 5-4 Supreme Court decision, in which both of President Clinton's appointees voted with the majority, means only a constitutional amendment will suffice to impose restrictions on Congress.

<P>Not since the tax revolt issue erupted in 1978 in California with the passage of Proposition 13, which reduced and then limited property taxes, has a political issue gained such resonance among voters. Mr. Forbes' appeal undoubtedly arises from the popularity of both his major issues: tax reform and term limits.

<P>Less than two months before the Supreme Court's decision, the House failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds approval to pass a term-limits constitutional amendment. Many Democratic opponents had hoped - indeed, some of them may have even prayed (in private, of course) - that the court's subsequent decision would make the issue moot for 1996. Well, they had better pray a little harder. The issue is certain to come to the fore in the fall campaign.

<P>At the time the amendment went down in the House last March, a Gallup poll revealed that more of the public held Republicans responsible for the failure than Democrats. No doubt this was a result of the media's spin, gloating about Newt Gingrich's failure to pass a term-limits amendment. In fact, although the idea is not universally endorsed by Republicans, 82 percent of them did vote for the constitutional amendment in the House. Had a mere 50 percent of Democrats supported the amendment, instead of only 19 percent, it would have passed. By the time November rolls around, it is extremely unlikely that the public will be as misinformed about apportioning blame as it was in the immediate aftermath of the March House vote.

<P>In terms of effectiveness of independent efforts, this issue has great potential. Already, term-limit proponents, such as the U.S. Term Limits organization, have said they will exert pressure on 1996 congressional candidates to pledge themselves to vote for a constitutional amendment. These same organizations no doubt will again actively intervene in various races, as Americans for Term Limits did in 1994, helping to defeat then-Speaker Tom Foley, Democrat of Washington, and then-House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas. And they will be joined by Ross Perot's United We Stand America.

<P>In fact, a Newsweek poll recently found that 68 percent of respondents said Mr. Perot's new Independence Party should work toward passing term limits as either its most important goal (17 percent) or one of several important goals (51 percent). Last April, 40 percent of adults questioned by Gallup said they would be &quot;very likely&quot; and another 29 percent said they would be &quot;moderately likely&quot; to vote for an independent presidential candidate if they believed that only he or she would support term limits for members of Congress. Talk about single-issue dominance. On the margin, these kinds of numbers have landslide potential.

<P>So, how prominently do you think Republicans will feature term limits in their platform? And how vulnerable will the 81 percent of Democrats who voted against a term-limits constitutional amendment be? With numbers like this, it might just be enough to get Bill Clinton to try to steal the issue.

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Class Seven -- PFF</title>
<h2>Renewing American Civilization: Class Seven</h2>
<PRE>
>>The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
>>Television, in Waleska, Georgia. From Reinhardt College in Waleska,
>>Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the seventh
>>of 10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct
>>professor at Reinhardt college, will continue his course which presents
>>the foundational principles necessary to the Renewal of American
>>Civilization.  This week's lesson, the Third Wave and American
>>Civilization, focuses on the Third Wave information age, American
>>Civilization, and the rules of human behavior.

>>Let me say good morning. Let me welcome the students who are taking the
>>course from Mind Extension University and remind them and other folks who
>>might be seeing it on cable or on videotape that you can mail your
>>comments to Renewing American Civilization, post office box 6008,
>>Marietta, Georgia 30065.  Or you can fax your comments to 404-528-9806.
>>Or you can e-mail your comments to America Online, renewam@aol.com.
>>Also, that class transcripts and other class materials are available on
>>our Internet web page at http://www.pff.org.  And you either got that
>>already or you don't know what it means, so don't worry about it.  And
>>you can -- if you're in the more traditional mode, you can order
>>"American Civilization" newspaper, video and audio tapes and course
>>readings by calling 1-800-to-renew.
</pre>
And I would point out to all of you, since we're going to talk about the
Third Wave today, that while you all kind of go, "well, that's just an old
800 number," an old 800 number didn't exist 50 years ago, so it's amazing
how rapidly we acculturate and acclimate ourselves to technologies.  I also
want to mention, because it's fascinating for anybody who watches in
Alabama, that Michael Ciamarra, who is the head of quality for the
government of Alabama, is hosting starting, I think, this coming Thursday
night at the state capitol, this course for all the senior leadership of
the Alabama government.  And apparently Governor Fob James has decided to
support it and to be part of it, and it's -- we were sent an article from
the Birmingham newspaper about the fact that the class would be taught at
the capitol in Alabama, which is sort of interesting, and they're going to
try to apply these ideas to Alabama state government.
<P>
And, of course, we start in terms of applying ideas with the notion that
the five pillars of American Civilization are, first, the historic lessons
of American Civilization.  Second, personal strength.  Third,
entrepreneurial free enterprise.  Fourth, the spirit of invention and
discovery.  And, fifth, quality as defined by Edwards Deming.  And that the
four areas in this course to which we will apply these pillars are, first,
the Third Wave and American Civilization, which is today's topic.  Second,
creating American jobs in the world market.  Third, replacing the culture
of violence and poverty with a culture of productivity and safety.  And,
fourth, citizenship and community in the 21st century.  And so each of the
next four weeks, in a sense, this is the payoff period.  We spent a week
outlining the course in general.  We spent five weeks outlining the
pillars, and today is the first of the topical sessions which will be four
in number.
<P>
Today's class is on the Third Wave and American Civilization.  This is
Alvin and Heidi Toffler's contribution to modern American systems.  Let me
say the Tofflers have been very successful authors for a very long period
of time.  Their most famous early book was "Future Shock," which is still
in print and available all over the place, and "Future Shock," of course,
created a title.  I mean, people talk about "Future Shock," they made it
up, but it -- as soon as the book came out in 1970, it made sense to
people.  This is the 25th anniversary of "Future Shock." About a decade
later, they tried to say, all right, if we're going through this, what does
it mean?  And they came up with the book which is the title of today's
lecture, which is "the Third Wave," and their argument, which we'll get
into in a minute, is that the -- that Future Shock can be replaced by
understanding that you are in the middle of a wave of change.
<P>
And it's sort of like thinking that you are trying to understand what is a
giant tsunami, to use the Japanese term for a tidal wave.  Well, if you
know it's a tidal wave, you still have a big problem, but at least you know
what the problem is.  And so they're talking about we're in the Third Wave
of change.  They then wrote a book which I really recommend for people who
care about national security.  This is called "War and Anti-War," and in
their effort to bring together the notion that all international relations
are a continuum where you're always engaged in the tension between war and
anti-war, they point out that from 1945 to the present, there have been
three weeks in which there was not a war somewhere on the planet.  Three
weeks in 50 years.  And since future -- since the Third Wave was, in many
ways, the basis -- intellectually the basis of the army's air-land battle
doctrine, had a dramatic impact, they have several chapters in here on how
the army came to grips with thinking about the future and the intellectual
basis of what we did in "Desert Storm."
<P>
Finally, reissued with a new cover, which we were kidding Jeff Eisenach,
who designed the old cover, this is clearly a much better commercial cover
than the one he had, and all of you can talk to Jeff about that later.
He's a little sensitive.  But this is Alvin and Heidi Toffler's new edition
"creating a new civilization, the politics of the Third Wave," and it is
really -- what they did is they edited together the best of the three books
I just cited, plus "power shift," which is another book of theirs.  Now,
the point -- the reason I'm sharing with you is not just to say, "let's do
a biography of the Tofflers," but they have been, since the late 1960s,
trying to work out what's happening in a big way to the human race.  Is
there an underlying pattern?  Is there an underlying explanation?  It's a
little bit like -- if I can use just a couple of very common human
analogies.
<P>
I have a good friend who went out one day, and he's in his late 40s.  In
fact, you know him, Dr.  Mel Steely.  He went out one day -- he's going to
hate me for having told this, because it's a true story, but he'll hate my
having mentioned his name.  He went out one day and he got all excited, and
this happens often to guys in their 40s, and he said, okay, I can do it.  I
can do it.  And he went out and he cut wood and he did everything for two
days, and he got up Monday morning and he thought he was going to have a
heart attack, and he went to the doctor.  And his doctor checked him and
looked at him a second and he said, "did you do something extraordinary all
weekend?" And he said, "yeah," and he began to list it.  And the guy said,
"Mel, you have middle-aged fat man's disease." And Steely went -- he said,
"you can't go out without any exercise, without any practice, have all
these muscles that have been laying on a couch watching football, work for
two days, and not expect to hurt."
<P>
Now, anybody who's a good runner, for example, will tell you.  I mean, you
run -- my daughter runs marathons.  You run a marathon, it hurts, period.
So if you're halfway through running the marathon and you're hurting, what
it tells you is you're running a marathon.  The reason I'm telling you is
that the Tofflers -- these are patterns.  I mean, all of us learn this
stuff.  If you drink too much the night before, you're probably not going
to die the next morning, but there's a feeling which is directly related to
drinking too much the night before.  And you've got to figure out, what are
these patterns?  I mean, you don't study, you fail the test.
<P>
I'm driving at this because what the Tofflers did is they took the most
human of things, which is to try to understand the patterns which affect
you, how can you predict based on patterns, and they backed way up and they
said, all right, let's look at the entire planet.  Let's look at the whole
human race.  What is happening to us?  And frankly, what they wrote is very
parallel to what Kenneth bolding wrote in "the meaning of the 20th century"
and what peter Drucker wrote in "the age of discontinuities." The Tofflers
believe that there have been three waves of change, from hunting-gathering
to agriculture, from agriculture to industry, and from industry to the
information age.
<P>
Now, they use the term "wave" because they said literally, the wave goes
through everything, and it's not that there's a change up here or a change
down here, but there's a wave which goes through everything.  Now, in order
to understand what we're talking about, again, we're staying at a very high
level of abstractions.  We're talking about civilizations.  And it's
important to understand that civilization is an all-encompassing framework
within which people live their lives.  It has a set of principles which
distinguishes it from other civilizations.  Now, this is something
Americans don't often think about, because we're so big as a country and
we're so sort of self-satisfied that we don't spend much time looking at
other civilizations.
<P>
In many ways, we're an ahistorical society.  But if you were to go and look
at the Greeks, if I gave you a set of characteristics, you'd say, "oh, yeah
that's Greek civilization" or "that's Mayan civilization" or "that's Han
china," and some of them could be very simple, as you'll see later on.  If
I say -- and you can -- it's like a detective story.  If I said "rice," you
would know we had blocked in a series of possibilities.  If I said "potato
before 1500."
<P><Pre>
>>Ireland.

>>can't be Ireland.  Potato doesn't come from Ireland.  Before 1500.  Where
>>does the potato come from?

>>North America.

>>no.  Comes from south America.

>>south America.

>>potato comes from the Incas, and it changes the history of Ireland,
>>because the potato allows you to grow more protein per acre, okay?  But
>>the potato's -- in fact, prior to 1500, it could not have been European.
>>Okay, so you go through -- my point is a rice-eating civilization is
>>different than a potato-growing civilization, because the entire rhythm
>>of growing rice is different.  Rice has to be planted and transplanted.
>>It's a whole different cycle.  A wheat-growing civilization has a whole
>>different cycle based on planting and harvesting.  Wheat-growing
>>civilizations, which is the base of all western civilization, are peak
>>system civilizations.  That is, you work very, very hard to plant.  You
>>then do a little bit of getting rid of the weeds, you then work like
>>crazy to harvest.  How does this relate, for example, to peak cycles of
>>studying just before finals?
</pre>
And look at rice, which requires tending to on a much more regular basis,
and a rice-growing civilization would have a tendency to teach you to study
every day.  A wheat-growing civilization would have a tendency to teach you
to have a peak experience and relax and a peak experience and relax.  Very
different rhythms.  But I'm trying to drive at the notion people begin to
acquire rhythms and patterns.  Why do -- look at the difference, and
there's a wonderful book by V.  O.  Key called "the Mind of the South" that
gives you a similar example prior to the age of air conditioning.  Look at
patterns of life in northern climates where people are literally locked in
for the winter by bad weather.  And you find different rhythms and patterns
than you find in a temperate climate where you can go outdoors all day
every day for the whole year.  And so take a look at -- if I say to you,
"let's talk about a set of characteristics," and you begin to build the set
of characteristics, for example, pyramids can only be two places in the
world.  Where are they?
<P><PRE>
>>Egypt.

>>Egypt.

>>and Mexico.

>>Yeah, and the Mayans.  And then you get into, what does that mean and why
>>does that mean it?  So when we talk about civilizations, we're talking
>>about the unifying characteristics within which people normally live
>>their lives, and that different civilizations have a different set of
>>unifying characteristics within which people live their lives.  Now, the
>>Toffler argument is that you really have had three what you would call
>>super civilizations.  The shift from hunting-gathering to agriculture was
>>a supercivilization, as you'll see in a minute.  Then the shift from
>>agriculture to industry is a supercivilization.  That is, it affected
>>rice eaters and wheat eaters.  Everybody, no matter what your background,
>>you were affected by this transition.  And so the rise of information is,
>>in the Toffler model, a supercivilization.  It transcends and absorbs.
>>The wave goes through all of the more normally studied civilizations.
>>Okay?  Let's take a minute and look at Toffler's explanation of the three
>>waves of change.

>>Alvin Toffler: for uncounted millions of years, human beings lived on an
>>untamed planet.  10,000 years ago, some genius reached out and altered
>>our lives forever.  By planting a seed, that hand launched the first wave
>>of change to surge across the earth.  Everywhere, it turned nomads and
>>hunters into peasants and farmers.  300 years ago, like a hammer blow in
>>history, the industrial revolution spread a new civilization from Europe
>>outward.  This was the second great wave of change in human history.  Now
>>a third gigantic wave of change has been unleashed across the planet.
>>Our machines are evolving at a blinding rate.  We too are changing.
>>These changes seem random, unconnected; some, even familiar.  Yet this is
>>only an illusion, for taken together, they form a dramatic pattern.  They
>>are creating a new civilization and killing an old one.

>>Now, in a sense, this is hunter-gatherer, this is agriculture, this is
>>industry, and this is the information age.  And in a sense, what the
>>Tofflers are arguing is that this is the first wave.  Because, remember,
>>they're talking about the layer of change.  This is the second wave.  And
>>this is the Third Wave.  And, in fact, you never quite get there.  But
>>notice also that because of the way in which the planet works, there are
>>places where agriculture never quite took.  Very dry areas, very
>>mountainous areas.  Guess what you get there?  Hunter-gatherers.  So that
>>as late as 40 or 50 years ago, there were still fairly significant
>>stretches of the planet that had hunting-gathering societies.  There are
>>a handful left today, but mostly as deliberately maintained museums.  I
>>mean, the people who survive in the Brazilian rain forests survive
>>because we deliberately will them to survive, because the sheer reach of
>>modern civilization is now so enormous that if we didn't discipline
>>ourselves, we'd overrun the Bushman of the Kalahari.  I mean, these are
>>people who are -- who will rapidly be absorbed into this.  And you have
>>to raise an ethical question at some point, is it really fair to the
>>human being who happens to have been born randomly into this environment
>>to not let them have a laptop, not give them a vaccination against polio,
>>and not dramatically raise their lives?  And yet the second you do, you
>>blow apart this system.

>>it's like the Masers?

>>huh?

>>that's like the Masais?

>>No, no, no, the Masai would be here.  This would be the Bushman, the
>>Kalahari.  In fact, I have a list here.  Let me just say, I'm putting
>>this up, because what I want to emphasize and go through for a minute is
>>that in each wave, everyone experiences the same general change, although
>>the details are different in each society.  That is, during a period when
>>you're -- hunter-gatherers tend to be similar everywhere on the planet.
>>And then as this wave of agriculture occurs, they tend to all go through
>>the same thing, even though they express it in the ways that are unique
>>to their region.  Agricultural civilizations are, in a way, very similar
>>to each other, and I'll come back to that.  When they start to change
>>into industry, they all go through the same wave-like pattern, although
>>they express it differently in each civilization.  Then when industries
>>arise, for example, male -- you know, males wear suits.  It's almost
>>totally universal in an industrial society everywhere on the planet, and
>>it's an artifact.  No particular reason to be true.  As this begins to
>>break down, guess what happens?  Guess what's the most commonly sold
>>article of clothing as you make the transition into an information age?

>>blue jeans.

>>blue jeans everywhere.  And you see the breakdown of dress codes
>>everywhere.  Okay?  Microsoft is a good example.

>>yeah.

>>So there are identity patterns here.  Now, let me walk you through just
>>some examples.  Hunter-gatherer civilizations is a big item.  I don't
>>believe this is a civilization, but everybody else who puts the class
>>together did, so they made me say it.  But look at the Bushman -- I think
>>these are patterns of life, but they are precivilization.  They don't
>>have the carrying capacity of a civilization.  They don't have enough
>>information.  But look at the Australian aborigines, the Bushman of the
>>Kalahari, the Indians of the Brazilian rain forest.  You could have added
>>Papua, new guinea.  I mean, anyplace where you are forced -- and this is
>>the definition of a hunting-gathering society.  You are forced to keep
>>moving.  That is, you can clear a plot, you plant for a little while, and
>>then you move.  And then you clear a plot and you plant for a little
>>while.  Or you gather food and you hunt.  But you're limited by the
>>carrying capacity of the ecosystem.  What's the number one characteristic
>>I just said that affects the capacity to become a civilization.

>>that they're unstable.

>>unstable in what sense?

>>they have no residency, they have no place --

>>right, and since they have no residency, what is it they can't do?

>>they can't set down roots, establish civilization.

>>right, and therefore, what is it that's very specific?

>>housing.

>>they don't have housing, or they have very, very shallow housing, and
>>therefore, when they move, what do they have to do?

>>they have to move everything with them, so they can't get any
>>possessions, so they have no idea of property rights.

>>exactly.  You can't accumulate.  You can't accumulate.  Since you can't
>>accumulate, you cannot build several centuries of property.

>>that's right.

>>the minute somebody invents -- and it was probably initially not wheat,
>>but related to wheat, one of the cereals -- but the minute you get
>>potatoes or rice or a cereal and you can stay in one place, you now have
>>great grandfather's stool and great grandmother's ceramics.

>>plus the land that you're working it on.

>>But then -- you've jumped to property rights.  We're not there yet.  It's
>>not property rights yet.  It's simply the notion that now you can
>>accumulate, and because you can accumulate, other things happen.  If you
>>read a wonderful book called "the forest people," which is very romantic
>>about the pygmies till the last chapter, where he points out that this
>>society means you die if you have a disability, because it can't afFord
>>to carry you.  Now you suddenly have people --

>>caring for the disabled.

>>right.

>>wait.  Say that again.

>>in a hunting-gathering society, the weakest members die because you can't
>>afFord to carry them.

>>it's termed survival of the fittest.

>>that's right.

>>Ruthless kind of survival.  I mean, it's all wonderful and it's all
>>romantic in the 90-minute film, and then you start thinking about the
>>12-year-old who has a limp and they're not going to make it.  And it's a
>>wonderful book by Colin -- let's see, "the mountain people" and "the
>>forest people." I can't remember Colin's last name.  It will come to me
>>in a minute.  Anyway -- I haven't read it in almost 30 years, but it is a
>>-- it's very romantic, it's very wonderful.  Look how natural they are,
>>and then you realize the cost of being natural.  Here suddenly you live
>>longer because you're not moving.  You suddenly get guess what life span?
>>

>>40, 50 years.

>>sure.  What's the bible say is the natural life span?

>>three score and 10.

>>huh?

>>three score and 10.

>>Right, 70.  We just passed it in the last -- in this century.  Up until
>>this century, the natural life span.  And by the way, it turns out that
>>people historically didn't die earlier, they died younger.  What keeps
>>life -- what keeps average lives low in agricultural society is the
>>number of people who die before they're 5, but if you get through 5 years
>>of age, you have a fairly high likelihood in agricultural society, unless
>>you're a woman who dies in childbirth, of living to be three score and
>>10, because you're not -- you don't have to move all the time.  Now when
>>winter comes, you've got a house, you've got food out back.  You've got a
>>rootcellar, you've got all sorts of things that are natural.
</pre>
And notice how it happens.  Agricultural civilizations include Han china,
pharaonic Egypt, Indus valley, Assyria, Sumeria, Babylon, archaic Greece,
the Hellenistic civilization, the romans, Mayas, Aztecs, Incas.  All of
those are civilizations predicated on being able to grow food.  And they
all have similar patterns.  And you see the patterns begin to evolve.  They
all have priesthoods of some kind.  They all have efforts to understand a
supreme being.  They all have political organizations and structures.  They
all have armies.  They all have policing systems.  They all have arguments
over property rights.  What is a property right?  Who owns the property?
They all have holidays, which, by the way, comes originally from the term
"holy day."
<P><pre>
>>they have the rise of the bureaucracies.

>>That's right.  They all have bureaucracies.  You go back to
>>Nebuchadnezzar at Babylon, you go back to hammurabi, the original order
>>of -- ruling of -- writing of the law.  You know, if you have a law, you
>>have to have an enforcer.  If you have an enforcer, it's a bureaucrat.  I
>>mean, all these systems have their version of the IRS.  They're all
>>patterns.  Now, if then you have those, let's look at suddenly you get
>>the rise of industrial civilizations.  Britain, bourgeois France,
>>imperial Germany, America, the Meiji restoration in France -- in Japan,
>>and czarist Russia.
</PRE>
And by the way, if you want to see really dramatic change, it is looking at
the Meiji restoration which occurs in 1868, when you suddenly have a group
of younger leaders come together and say, "we had better modernize Japan or
we're going to be run over," and they systematically go out around -- they
send teams all over the world and they go and they study the French and the
Germans and the Americans and the British, and they come back -- and the
Italians, and they come back and they say, "here's how to modernize Japan.
"let's take the best of each of these." And it is the most willfully
self-conscious act of modernization on the planet.  And they say, "look, we
are trapped here in agricultural society.  "this will not work.  "we have
to move to industrial society to survive.  "if we don't, we'll be devoured
by the Europeans." And when they do, I'll give you just one example.  The
high watermark in Japanese feudal society of the agricultural system
militarily is what?  What do you call a Japanese warrior?
<P><PRE>
>>shogun.

>>samurai.

>>samurai.  Shogun is the guy who organized it, and samurai are based on
>>the use of what weapons?

>>swords.

>>swords, and they're magnificent.  If you see Kurosawa's great work "the
>>seven samurais," it's amazing.  Okay?  The second you move into here,
>>what do you get?

>>guns.

>>guns.

>>and the swords become obsolete.

>>The sword becomes obsolete, and so does the samurai way of life.  And in
>>1870, there was a deliberate rebellion by the samurai, who get massacred
>>by peasants who have guns, because they prefer death to dishonor.  And
>>it's the symbolic end of the agricultural era in -- again, it doesn't
>>fully end.  In fact, in the information age, you can see Japanese
>>factories next to which there are artificially maintained rice paddies
>>going all the way back to here.  And you see in much of the Japanese
>>drive and energy in the industrial era the samurai spirit of the warrior
>>and of nobility and of doing duty.  But my point is each of these -- as
>>you see the transition here, for example, the word "bourgeois" comes from
>>French.  It means middle class, or comes to characterize what we call
>>middle class.  Actually, it meant originally the small property holders,
>>the small businesses and small manufacturers.  This transition occurs in
>>every one of these countries.

>>breakdown of the monarchies.

>>The monarchies begin to collapse because the power structure of
>>agriculture doesn't make sense here.  Money matters more, land matters
>>less.  Land is really important here.  So if you're in an old family, you
>>have lots of land, so you marry a new industrial -- all sorts of 19th
>>century novels about the new rising industrial class that has cash
>>deliberately marrying into the landed class for status, trying to make
>>this bridge.  Okay?  Now, if that's all true, let's look for a second --
>>since this is the one we grew up in, this is a very important thing to
>>keep in your head.
</PRE>
What I'm going to drive at today is not only is it true that we're going
through the Third Wave, but it is a knowable experience, because we've done
it two other times.  So we can study how people have done it.  And you are
personally doing it.  Because every one of you was born in this system.
This is the dominant system today.  It's still the dominant system.  This
is the emerging system, the information age.  And so if you think about it,
and we're going to take five examples just to give you a way of thinking
about it, five aspects of second-wave civilization, of the industrial era,
standardization, synchronization, specialization, massification, and
centralization.  Now, take a look at these five, and Toffler's now going to
walk you through them, and think about how they apply to way you live your
daily life.
<P><PRE>
>>Alvin Toffler: take that quintessential object of the industrial age, the
>>gun.  The gun was one of the first things to be manufactured out of
>>interchangeable standardized parts.  Take one apart, and the parts fit
>>perfectly into another of the same type.  What did this mean?  Meant that
>>we'd taken the first step on the road to uniformity.  And not just in
>>guns.  The second wave of change not only standardized products, it
>>molded us to fit into a mass society.  The world of repetitive work, of
>>identical products and images, of skyscrapers, factories, and commuters.
>>Standardization became a way of life.  Synchronization, another principle
>>of industrial life.  Millions of people sharing a common rhythm.  And if
>>some archaeologist of tomorrow found a watch, it would tell a lot about
>>what makes us tick.  The watch maintains the rhythm of 9:00 to 5:00.  All
>>mass societies are not only standardized, they are synchronized.

>>announcement: -- has been delayed for two and a half hours.

>>Alvin Toffler: yet everyone hates the 9:00 to 5:00.  "the Wealth of
>>Nations," of which this is a first edition, begins with a famous passage.

This popular amusement park in Vienna, for example, is a place where people
come to enjoy themselves, to get away from the factory and the office, to
bring their children on a Sunday afternoon.  But Prater park is special.
It boasts the world's biggest Ferris wheel, and big is what second-wave
civilization was all about.  From the earliest days of the industrial era,
all of us were inculcated with the idea that heroic scale, sheer size, had
something to do with virtue.  The French rushed out and built the Eiffel
tower.  The Americans, the empire state building.  The British, the queen
Mary, and then the queen Elizabeth.  And the Soviets, well, there's a story
about Stalin that he used to call in his experts and say to them, "what's
the biggest steel mill in the world?  "build me a bigger one.  "what's the
biggest hydroelectric dam in the world?  "I want a bigger one." Hand in
hand with the idea of bigness came another basic principle.
<P>
Alexander Hamilton in the American colonies called for the centralization
of political power.  He wanted a strong central government for the united
states.  Later, at this very desk, in the reading room of the library of
the British museum in London, a German emigre named Karl Marx called for
the decisive centralization of power in the hands of the state.  In
capitalist as well as communist industrial nations, power flowed to the
center.  The power of the state, the power of money.  This concentration of
power was paralleled by the concentration of energy, the concentration of
production, and even the concentration of people.

>>take Toffler's main notion here that there are specific aspects.  You get
>>standardized.  I mean, this is, by the way, covered in Kessler's
>>"darkness at noon," where he says that in order to get people who are
>>used to the agricultural era where you worked from can to can't.  What's
>>the term "can to can't" mean?

>>had gas lights in the 19th century, there's no can't.  You cannot
>>regulate your life by can to can't.  There's a second thing, since you
>>want a lot of people to work simultaneously, they have to arrive at a
>>fixed time, right?  Well, here you had no watches, no clocks.  They were

>>they had calendars?  But they had broader senses of time.  "see you

>>that begins to disappear, and what I want you to understand is as you go
>>through each of these waves of change, each time you're going through a
>>wave of change, civilizational change goes through every society as a
>>wave which affects every aspect of life, economics, politics, family
>>structure, religion, the structure of society and power, government, and
>>military power and warfare.
</PRE>
So you can literally take this list -- and we'll come back to it in the
second hour -- you can take this list and you can say, okay, tell me about
economics in the agricultural age.  Tell me about economics in the
industrial age.  Tell me about economics here.  Tell me about the structure
of family.  What's family like if you're a hunter-gatherer?  What's family
like if you're in an agricultural society?  How does family change here and
how does it change here?  And you begin to get very different patterns
through all of the manifestations of life.
<P>
Now, to give you an example which is, I think, absolutely fascinating,
which Toffler did, and this comes out of a TV show that Alvin and Heidi did
about 10 years ago.  To give you an example of how these changes permeate
everything, I want you to look at what Alvin Toffler calls "the music
factory," remembering that the characteristics here are standardization,
synchronization, people organized.  And you may think about classes you've
been in, show up at the same time, sit in the same desk, face forward, do
the same thing, take the test at the same time, and I want you to look at
what he calls "the music factory."
<P><pre>
>>Alvin Toffler: before the age of the machine, concert music was performed
>>for princes and patrons, by quartets and quintets, by small chamber
>>groups.  As the second wave arrived, however, the first concert halls
>>began to crop up in Vienna, in Paris, London and Tokyo, and eventually in
>>cities everywhere.  With them came the impresario, the businessman who
>>financed concerts and sold tickets.  The more seats he added, the more
>>tickets he could sell.  But the bigger concert halls needed louder sound,
>>and therefore, more musicians.  The small chamber group grew into the
>>full orchestra.  (applause) the players all dressed in standard attire.
>>They were divided into specialized departments, each with its section
>>leader.  (music playing) the conductor with his baton maintained central
>>control and synchronized the sound.
</pre>
And so it was that the Second Wave got its music factory.  Yet mass society
was not just smoke stacks and assembly lines.  It was a rich, many-sided
social system that affected every aspect of our daily lives.  It put the
great willow run factory outside Detroit, but it also put the tractor on
the farm, the typewriter in the office, the refrigerator in the kitchen.
It gave us the daily newspaper, the cinema, subways, and dc-3s.  It gave us
corporations and cubism.  It gave us Bauhaus buildings and Barcelona chairs
and sit-down strikes and vitamin pills and longer life, and it also
universalized the ballot box.  More important, it linked all these things
together, assembled them like a machine, and produced the most powerful,
cohesive, and expansive civilization the world had ever known.
<P><PRE>
>>can you see the parallel between the symphony orchestra and the factory?
>>Organized, routinized.  Now, one example of the electronic age, we go
>>from the concert hall to what?

>>CDs.

>>A CD.  You have your music.  And, in fact, you'll begin to be able to go
>>to a store, buy -- make up your own CD, and say, "I want this song, this
>>song, this song, this song, this song," packaged, they will package it on
>>the spot, and we'll begin to be at the beginning of the next cycle, which
>>is you sit down with your computer and you write your music.  So your
>>computer will literally create for you your symphony, which will then be
>>on your CD.  I'm not going to comment on how good your symphony will be,
>>but --

>>isn't that like chuck Davis does with the synthesized music?

>>huh?

>>chuck Davis and the synthesized music, rather than having, you know,
>>where it's all computerized?

>>yeah.  Well, to be honest, I don't know.  You just opened up a whole new
>>zone.  One question.  Then we've got to keep moving.

>>one question, throughout history, though, civilizations have been adverse
>>to change.  People don't like change.

>>of course.

>>stepping into this Third Wave, is there any way to overcome that or --

>>sure.

>>-- is that just --

>>We're going to talk about that.  But part of it that helps you is to
>>understand this is not radically new.  We have done this before.  It's
>>like the first time you decide to go hang-gliding or the first time you
>>decide to go sky diving.  If you know other people who have done it -- or
>>the first time -- to use something very simple for most humans, the first
>>time you get in a boat.  It's comforting to know that lots of people have
>>gotten in boats.  I mean, think about somebody who has never been on
>>water, and think about a society where you got up to the edge of the
>>river and you stopped, and the first time somebody comes along in this
>>little thin thing and says, "it will be okay." It feels very unstable,
>>any of you who have been in a canoe, very unstable, right?  You might
>>even flip over.  Some of you may have even done this, but if you know
>>it's okay, yes, you'll get wet, but you'll survive, you change things.
>>Now --

>>the first time you eat an oyster?

>>Yeah.  It's too early on a Saturday morning.  Now, what I want to walk
>>you through is a way of thinking about this, remembering that this
>>applies to everything, which is why I wanted to show you "the Music
>>Factory" to give you a sense of culture, everything.  I want to show you
>>Daryl Conner, who lives here in Atlanta.  He has a model of change I
>>think you'll find very helpful.  He talks about being frozen, thawing,
>>and refreezing.  Now, this is at the heart of how you make the
>>transition, and we'll come back later to his book "Managing at the Speed
>>of Change," which I recommend.  It's a very, very useful framework for
>>looking at this and having some sense of how you -- how resilient
>>managers succeed and prosper where others fail, and he talks about this.
>>
</pre>
Now, here's his concept.  Normally you're frozen.  You get up in the
morning, you have a habit.  The habit's fixed.  Then things begin to
change, and it's almost like watching -- you can think about this with a
popsicle.  It's almost like watching -- or with an ice cube.  It begins to
thaw, and you're changing and pieces fall apart, and it doesn't feel right.
It's what Drucker means by a discontinuity.  See, as long as you're
frozen, it's predictable.  Now it starts to change.  Then you begin to
figure out the future and you begin to refreeze, because people normally
have to have stable conditions of effectiveness.  People are very good if
most of what they're doing is stable.  They are very bad if they have to be
constantly inventing.  So there's a natural drive for, okay, so what works?
You know, if I'm not going to use gold and I'm now going to switch to
checkbooks, fine.  Teach me how to do a checkbooks.  If checkbooks are
beginning to disappear and I'm going to use a credit card, fine.  Teach me
how to do a credit card.  But I want to know the pattern that works.
<P>
Okay?  And one of the things that makes us a society of extraordinary
efficiency is that we shorten everything into habitual patterns very fast.
That's why it's very hard to have long terms in America, because we shorten
them all the time.  I mean, Al Gore has "Reinventing Government," which
within weeks became "Rego" in Washington language, because "reinventing
government's" too long a phrase.  Okay?  Now, what you don't know in a
discontinuity is, what are we going to refreeze like?  Are we going to be
lots of tiny triangles instead of a big triangle?  Are we now going to be a
brand new thing called a circle?  Are we going to be a square?  We don't
know.  By definition, if you're going through this, but if you know, "hey,
it's okay.  "Yes, the system's breaking down, but the other end of the
breakdown is a new system," it's psychologically incredibly easier to go
through change if your job in this phase is to find the new system.
<P>
Okay?  Everybody understand this concept of frozen, beginning to thaw out,
and then refreezing?  This is at the heart of thinking about how you manage
change.  And it allows you to now see the thawing without going, "oh, my
god, we're all going to collapse." No, we're going to find a new, more
powerful, more appropriate way to refreeze.  Now, in that framework, then,
what I'd like you to be thinking about is, what other aspects of life would
you add?  In other words, we talked earlier -- remember we talk about
economics, politics, family structure, religion, structure of society and
power, government, military power and warfare.
<P>
When you start going through this, you need to start saying, all right,
what are -- and you can do it much like Drucker's advice on how you take
care of your schedule, which is you keep it.  Just as you go through a day,
think, is there something we've missed in the class that is a major aspect
of life?
<P>
I mean, transportation, for example, or communications.  You communicate in
a hunting-gathering society face-to-face or maybe by certain signals, like
"the water hole is near here," which would be a series of sticks on the
ground or something.  Very few signals.  As you move into early
agriculture, how do we communicate?  What's the key to cultural artifacts
in early --
<P><pre>
>>writing.

>>no.  Pre writing.

>>oh, hieroglyphics?

>>no.  Hieroglyphics is just a form of writing.  How was the odyssey and
>>the Iliad first maintained?

>>oral tradition.

>>stories of.

>>it's oral.

>>that's right.

>>there's an era -- if you go back to archaic Greece, there were a handful
>>of people who literally memorized the entire story, which meant when you
>>went to school, what did you practice?

>>oratory.

>>Oratory, memory, right?  Can you remember 35,000 lines?  Now, frankly, in
>>the age of the computer, it would be fairly dumb to have a large number
>>of people -- it's a wonderful thing to do as a hobby, but if you had
>>somebody who walked in and say, "hi, I can recite the entire "Odyssey"
>>and "the Iliad," you'd say, "fine, but I'd rather buy the book." That
>>begins to change with writing.  And then in 1432, with the rise of the
>>movable type -- why do we have teachers stand up and lecture while
>>students take notes?  Because prior to 1432, writing was very expensive.
>>There were very few books.  A book took a year of a person's life to
>>copy.  It was copied by hand.  Only rich people had books, or important
>>institutions.  So every student came to class, and in a pattern which
>>went back at least as far as Greece and china, the teacher stood up here,
>>wrote on the board, you wrote it down, you were creating your own
>>textbook.  After Gutenberg invents movable type, textbooks become cheaper
>>and cheaper, but we keep this, in part, because we can't figure out how
>>to break out of the cultural framework of the professors.
</pre>
And while this makes sense as a way of teaching a class that assimilates
new information, it is -- this is one of the reasons I tape the class.
It's irrational to reteach this class.  I mean, it's silly for me to stand
up here and repeat exactly next time what I said this time.  So it depends
on what you're trying to accomplish and how you're trying to get it done,
and so you go through what the new communications are.  Right now, we send
faxes, but faxes are simply electronic transmissions of traditional
writing.  Faxes are an interchange, in a sense, between -- they're part of
the breaking down.  When you start to send e-mail, you're moving to the
next stage.  And so these things keep cycling.
<P>
What I'd like you to think about doing and the way I'd recommend you do it
is as you take each of these aspects, then you start applying it to each of
the three transitions.  How did family change in each wave?  How did work
change in each wave?  How are things different?  And it's very important to
understand, when you start talking about the Third Wave, that we are not in
the mature phase.  We are as developed in the Third Wave as the airplane
was in 1908.  That is, because people will start -- you'll run into really
smart people who say, "oh, well, we're over here.  "let me tell you, it's
going to be a square." They haven't got a clue.  Where we are is here.  The
old world is breaking down and the new world is vaguely emerging.
<P>
One of the most interesting books on this, by the way, is Huizinga's "the
Waning of the Middle Ages," which is a study of the psychology of
transition and how did the renaissance look if you were a medieval
Christian.  Because the renaissance was always written by secular
historians as a good thing.  It was a terrifying thing if you were a
medieval Christian, because it was the breaking down of the known world.
It's a brilliant book called "the waning of the middle ages" by Huizinga.
But my point is, what you can know is you're here.  You're not here.
You're no longer back here in the Second Wave, you're not frozen, but we
don't have a clue what a mature Third Wave civilization will look like.
What we know is things are dying, things are breaking down, and other
things are emerging, and we're in this middle zone.
<P>
Now, in that sense, what you've got to try to think through is, how should
you think, analyze, plan, and act in a period of decisive change?  Notice
they're separate.  First you have to think.  Then you analyze, then you
plan.  Only last do you act.  And it's -- and you've got to know where you
are in terms of the cycle of change to know what's an appropriate behavior.
In a sense, there's a -- the Third Wave offers dangers and opportunities.
It is like the Chinese character for "crisis," which is made up of two
characters, one for danger and the other for opportunity.  And we were
trying last night to find the character.  We didn't have it.  If we can
find it by next week, we'll show it to you retrospectively.  But literally,
the word in Chinese for "crisis" is actually made up of two words, danger
and opportunity.
<P>
And so it is literally fair to say, as you were, in a sense, implying, this
is a big problem.  I mean, if you're a big winner here, you are now at
risk.  So that one person's -- the rise of Microsoft is enormous
competition for IBM.  The rise of e-mail is an enormous competition for the
post office.  The rise of an expert system for home diagnostic is a big
threat for the family doctor.  And so you've got to look at, how do people
emerge and change and evolve and recognize that everything is both a danger
and an opportunity simultaneously?  But to grasp that, to grasp the dangers
and opportunities of the Third Wave information age, we have to understand
its characteristics, learn its principles, invent new habits, institutions,
and systems, and sometimes invent new words and new meanings.  Go ahead,
Mai.
<P><PRE>
>>is this going to be as solid as this?  Because when you stop and think
>>about the agriculture, it lasted much longer, and then the industrial age
>>lasted 300 years, and because it changed so rapidly, is it always going
>>to feel like it's in a melting stage?

>>truth is, we don't know.  I mean, this could last for a generation or it
>>could last for a thousand years.  We don't know.  Because we don't know
>>-- and it could turn out to be something that is never like this but is,
>>instead, very, very flexible and fluid and permanently changing.

>>I don't know.  My answer is I don't know.  No one does.  We've never been

>>but it's not possible to go back, though.

>>It is highly unlikely, because this system, this is part of the

>>Kalahari?  Why is it that the only people who survive in
>>hunting-gathering are in marginal ecosystems?  Because they all get
>>crowded out of the good spaces because they can't compete.  I mean, the
>>Bushman of the Kalahari can't compete with the roman legion, they can't
>>compete with the Zulu force.  And so they're literally squeezed out of
>>the good spaces into the last -- the desert Shoshoni can't compete, and
>>so they were pushed into the desert because the bigger agriculture
>>system.  What happened?  And this is what the Meiji restoration's about.
>>All of a sudden, the young leadership of Japan, when Perry arrives from
>>America in 1854, they look around they go, wow, what happens to every
>>Asian agricultural civilization?  It collapses in the face of Europeans.
>>And they suddenly say, we had better change fast, because if we don't
>>make the transition, we will be non-competitive.  We will be run over by
>>the Europeans.  And so the question is -- I mean, what happened in"desert
>>shield"?  In "desert shield" -- I mean "desert storm," you had a
>>second-wave Iraqi army dealing with an American army that is at least
>>beginning to move into the discontinuity.  It was a non-competitive
>>environment.  They were just two different worlds.

>>it gets right back down to survival, it's the survival instinct.

>>Yes.  That for the civilization to survive, I think it almost has to
>>shift and make that transition.  And what I want to walk you through when
>>we come back -- because we're going to start right here -- is I want to
>>start with the notion of, how do you under -- you know, what's the
>>difference between understanding characteristics and understanding
>>principles?  And how should you think about this scale of transition?
>>And we're going to stay for a little bit right on this model, because
>>this is the thing that I think people find the scariest.  Their first
>>reaction to a period of thawing is to cling to the old and to be
>>frightened.  Whereas the most effective reaction may be to be very
>>curious about the thawing.  To say, "gee, that's interesting," rather
>>than, "boy, does that terrify me," and to try to understand, what does it

</pre>
It goes back to, listen, learn, help, and lead.  You've got to go into a
phase where you can't start thinking about your vision of the future until
you listen for a long time and learn what the options are.  So it's a very,
very important model.  And what we're going to try to do then is say, okay,
how can I think about this scale of change on a planet-wide basis?  And
what does it affect -- what does it do about me?  I mean, if there are
billions of people on the planet and the whole planet's going to go through
this thawing process and the whole planet's going to go through this scale
of change, then what does that mean for me, for my business, for my family,
for my country, for my community?  And how can I begin to figure out
patterns that are helpful in going through a change on this scale?  I think
that's the key thing.  Okay?  So we'll take a break and come right back and
pick up right here.  (break)
<p><PRE>
>>That's increasingly true.  Let me say we're going to go back and pick up
>>where we were.  Before we do, I just wanted to say Colin Turnbull is the
>>author I was mentioning earlier who wrote "the Forest People" and "the
>>Mountain People." And "the Forest People," in particular, is both a
>>wonderfully romantic introduction to the pygmies of Zaire, but also has a
>>very poignant description at the very end of what happened to those who
>>had any kind of weakness in that kind of world.
</pre>
Let me go back.  Remember we talked about the notion that to grasp the
dangers and opportunities of the Third Wave information age, we must
understand its characteristics, learn its principles, invent new habits,
institutions, and systems, and sometimes invent new words and new meanings,
and I want to start with the very first of those, because each of them is
different.
<P>
So I'm going to start by talking about understanding its characteristics.
The best way to learn characteristics is the "listen" part of listen,
learn, help, and lead.  I mean, people say, "how can I learn this? " My
answer is, go around your hometown.  You don't have to go to M. I. T.  Or
Georgia tech.  I mean, who in your hometown is doing something interesting?
Go listen to them.  People love to talk about what they do well.  So just
start listening.
<P>
And what you'd ideally have around the country, and this is something
Benjamin Franklin helped create when he founded the American philosophical
society and the public library and all sorts of voluntary associations, and
you'd have people who got together, said, let's study this.  What does it
mean?  What is everybody in our community doing?  What's happening in our
industry?  What are the characteristics?  And you just start listing them.
<P>

You know, for example, laptops clearly are going to give people a greater
level of freedom.  Why?  Because they are dealing back with an embedded
base.  It's not that the society is freer.  It's that the individual's
freer because there's this huge embedded system of the telephones and of
the Internet and of various bulletin boards, so it's actually very
sophisticated, but the net result for you is you can be very freestanding.
How can you first pick this up?  I mean, I first picked it up watching
people in airplanes.  You all of a sudden find on virtually every airplane
you fly on, there are six or eight or 10 people now using a laptop.  Well,
you say to yourself, "oh, this is a characteristic." And so part of it's
just keep your eyes open.  Characteristics bubble up at you.  And if you
start making lists of them, you begin to say, "gee, I'll bet these are
characteristics of the thaw." That's why I mentioned blue jeans earlier.
Somebody mentioned during the break women also wear -- now wear -- more and
more women wear suits.  That's true, but it's -- again, go around the
planet and look at differences in levels and speed of adaptation.  It's
truer in America than it is in Europe.  It's truer in western societies
than it is in Asian.  And then look at the enormous stress in a place like
Iran and their view of women in the context of this emerging world and how
non-competitive it is to isolate slightly over half your population from
being productive.
<P>
So when you go to a truly fundamentalist Islamic society, they are
literally ruling out of the game over half their population in terms of
competitive skill, competitive ability.
<P>
And so you've got to look at this whole pattern.  As you begin to think
through the characteristics, and that's the scouting phase, just list them.
Don't even try to make sense of them.  When you start to get enough
characteristics, you want to learn the principles.  Why are these things
there?  One of the principles is electronic is going to replace paper.  And
you're just seeing it happen.  So if your choice was to hire somebody who
could use a manual typewriter or somebody who was used to software packages
and you were trying to get clerical work done, which one is more likely to
be responsive to where we're going?
<P>
You know, more and more things are freestanding with 800 numbers.  800
numbers are cheaper and cheaper, and if you combine that with fed ex and
ups and other overnight delivery systems, you can now set up a very small
business in your basement connected to the entire world by an 800 number
using, again, the embedded system.  I did an interview this week for fed ex
which will be seen by 100,000 workers worldwide.  So you have this huge,
complex, sophisticated system that lets your single little business be
successful, which might teach you to look around and say, "what are the big
systems that are available that I can use pretty cheaply? " I mean, your
investment's $11.  They've got to take your package from you, get it to
where you want it to go, do it on time, and they get to make money if they
can do it for $11.  So you have an $11 system which is a worldwide system,
and suddenly small businesses can be connected to the planet.
<P>
Now, consider that with the industrial-age vision of what a small business
was, which was a local mom and pop operation that only had a local
marketplace.  So you get into more and more of these kind of things.  Then
as you see the characteristics -- and I describe them as putting dots on
the wall.  You know, like, remember the dot, connect the dots, when you
were a little kid, and you'd go from 1 to 2 to 3 and it would turn out to
be a rhinoceros or something?  So you're putting dots up.  That's the
gathering of the characteristics.  Then you're trying to figure out, what
are the principles that tie the dots together?  Is this an animal or is
this a spaceship?  Because you're trying to guess ahead, you're trying to
get ahead of the dots.  Okay?  Then you say, okay, now that I'm beginning
to get the principles, what are the new habits, institutions, and systems
that matter?
<P>
I'll give you an example.  In the high watermark of the industrial age,
which included television, you could be a couch potato.  As longas you
could turn the TV on, you could lay there and the TV would amuse you.
Can't be a couch potato and interact on a computer bulletin board, because
you have to respond.  And, in fact, reading will go up in the Third Wave,
and so will typing, so will writing.  Because you won't be able to get out
of it.  So you could make -- and when I got laughed at the other week for
talking about laptops for poor kids, you could make an argument that
getting people interactive systems which can only be communicated with by
typing and can only be communicated with by reading would probably be the
most powerful way to get people to be literate.
<P>
Now, how much are you willing to spend for each literacy?  Well, if you're
talking about the total number of teachers you'll hire, the total number of
hours you'll spend on this child?  And you said, what if I could find a
freestanding device that that child could use that had the same effect;
would it be okay?  How do we get them to cross that bridge?  Because the
truth is in the information age, you have to be more literate, not less.
And all of the high end of industrial age, we're all going to cease to be
literate, we'll all sit around MCluhan's vision.
<P>
Now, that doesn't mean TV's going away.  If there's an earthquake in Kobe,
that's the fastest way to see the earthquake.  And, in fact, if you watch
stockbrokers now and money managers, they have a little screen up on the --
up on their computer, so they're typing away but they've got the TV on.
And they can switch.  Or they've got a screen where they're running the AP.
Stories, and as soon as a big one breaks, they can turn on the TV in their
own screen.  You've seen the commercials now where you have the TV and the
telephone and the fax and the e-mail and all of your records all on the
same computer screen.  And you're watching four windows simultaneously.
<P>
Which is why, by the way, if you go back and look at a Strauss Waltz and
then you look at the speed of MTV, you look at a movie made in the '30s and
the rhythm of the movie, and then you look at a movie made today.  People
are in the habit of looking on the surface at more things faster and
getting absorbed in fewer of them.  It's a very different pattern of
relationship.  As you start to invent the new habits, sometimes you're
going to have to invent new words and new meanings.  Microwave.  Cellular.
Internet.  Now, this is not new.  Horseless carriage.  Automobile, which is
French.  It means "self-moving." Electric guitar, which was, in fact, not a
guitar at all.  It's a totally -- it's an electronic instrument which
resembles a guitar.
<P>
But notice how very often we'll use bridging words.  So part of the bridge
will be back here to the frozen so we still feel secure.  But, in fact,
we're beginning to move through to a different world.  The lessons of
history include parallel evolutions of the same kind of changes in other
transitional waves.  In other words, you can go back and say, all right, a
very good way to experience what you're living through is to go to somebody
who's going from agriculture to industry or from hunting-gathering to
agriculture.  James Michener's book "the Source" is a great novel for doing
this, because it takes you through a spot in Israel for 4,000 years and it
gives you a feeling for -- and starts with hunting-gathering, and it gives
you a really good feeling.  It's a pretty good novel.  Look at the early to
Old Testament as a fascinating record of the transition from a
hunting-gathering nomadic society to an established agriculturally based
society.  Isn't that exactly what's happening?  What is the meaning of the
story of Abraham and his son laying on the rock, and the angel comes down?
<P><PRE>

>>sacrifice.

>>Yeah.  It is the end of human sacrifice.  This was a people describing to
>>themselves the moment at which they decided they would no longer
>>sacrifice their children, something which the Aztecs never got to,
>>although they didn't sacrifice their children.  They sacrificed
>>prisoners.  But notice this moment in the old testament, and you literally
>>see the nomadic agrarian Israelis becoming city people and becoming
>>farmers.  And much of the fight in the old testament is between the
>>Israelis and the more urban and more commercial Mediterranean gods.
>>That's what the whole fight with Bayle is all about.  It's a style of
>>life.  And so they go and they take Jerusalem, which becomes their city.
>>And if you read the Old Testament in that sense as a historic document,
>>it is a fascinating study of the transition of a people from nomadic into
>>agricultural to having an urban high civilization with a temple and a
>>kingship.
</pre>
And that's why -- and you see literally the transition to kingship, don't
you?  Saul's the first king.  And so you see these patternings, and it's
well worth looking at in that sense literally as a study of the transition
into an agricultural society.  What you've got to look at is, what are the
characteristics of the Third Wave information age?  And you've got -- and
literally, we need for people to be in a habit of looking around and
talking about this and saying, okay, what did I learn this week?  Because I
find in my case, every week that goes by, I'm learning new things, I'm
seeing new experiences, I'm having new data come forth that I had never
thought about.  And you do it by looking at the newspapers, by listening to
television, by talking to people.  And literally just sort of gathering.
And not trying initially.
<P>
Don't try to force them into a pattern.  Don't say, "oh, wow, now I see how
we go back." Or equally bad, "boy, I see how it" -- you know, "my model's
the circle.  "now let me take all this new data and make it fit the
circle." What you want to do is literally just let it be data.  Let it tell
you.  Don't you tell it.  Then you want to try to build the principles.
What are the principles going to be?  One is that it's going to be global.
Another is it's going to be very personal simultaneously, so both you and
the planet simultaneously.  Now, how does that work?  Well, we don't know
yet.  Then you've got to look at, what are some of the new habits?  One of
the habits had better be learning.  I mean, learning -- another habit, by
the way, is exercise.  And there's a very profound reason why exercise is
suddenly emerging.  Why do people think about exercise?  In an agricultural
age, what did you have to do?
<P><pre>
>>work.

>>work.  In an industrial age, what did you have to do?

>>work.

>>I mean, I had an uncle who was a steelworker.  He thought the idea of
>>going to a gym was insanity.  He wanted to go to a bar.  I mean, he'd put
>>in eight hours in the gym.  It was called the steel mill.

>>some things are never going to change.

>>Ah, but now you go to the gym first.  Why do you go to gym first?
>>Because you don't do hunting-gathering.  You don't pull a plow, and you
>>don't work in a steel mill, so literally as a biological organism, again,
>>at the risk of getting in trouble, you have a genetic need to exercise.
>>You don't stay healthy if you don't exercise, so suddenly in a Third Wave
>>society, you have a whole new habit, which will then lead to new
>>institutions.  Which may well lead to whole new ways of thinking about
>>the tax code.  I mean, you know, what if we encouraged you to stay in
>>good enough shape that you didn't get a heart attack?
</pre><P>
Which is cheaper, to keep you in good shape or to give you a triple bypass?
Just think about it.  See, we don't even think that way over here.  That's
a stupid idea.  Well, why?  I mean, let's do a mathematical study.  Why is
it a dumb idea?  Why isn't wellness a learnable, trainable, habitual,
incentivized system?  Because it can be if you work at it.  And the
companies that are doing it, by the way, have dramatic drops in costs.  Why
do they have a gym?  Not because they're being nice and coddling people.
Because it lowers the cost of their health insurance.  Now, it takes three
years, but in three years' time, they are making money by getting everybody
to be well.  Well, what if you did that as a society?
<P>
Now, as you look at the new habits and the new institutions -- and I would
argue that gold's gym, in that sense, is an emerging Third Wave
institution, and that you find others.  I mean, I think Fed Ex is, frankly,
a Third Wave institution.  And the great power of Fed Ex and UPS is not the
airplane or the truck.  It's the computer that tracks the package.  It is
the human training.  I once spent a day in a ups uniform in a truck, and I
followed the package from picking it up to , sorting it and bringing it
back, and it was amazing.  And a ups or fed ex delivery person, man or
woman, is a full-service, holistic small business standing right there.  I
mean, they deal with the customers, they take the material, they take the
money, they do the recording.  It is an astonishing system, and is, I
think, very much a Third Wave.
<P>
And so you've got to look at some of the new systems of the Third Wave.
And we've got to look at the -- and you've got to start -- and you can
start looking around you and saying, what's going to work?  Telemedicine,
distance learning are emerging systems.  The kind of ambulance or
helicopter where you have -- all the diagnostics are in the vehicle.  And
you're literally doing the diagnostics with the best brain surgeon in the
world as you're going from the accident to the hospital.  And so when you
arrive at the hospital, you've done everything we used to do in the ER.
You go straight to the operating room, because we've already done
everything.  You've done it with a technician who is not a doctor, but who
is working electronically under the doctor's direction.  Now, that's the
Third Wave.  And it's going to happen all over the place.  And you've got
to look at new words and meanings of the Third Wave information age.  I
mean, as I said earlier, microwave.  Fax.  Which, by the way, again, in the
American tradition, was facsimile.  It became fax.  I don't know what
cellular phone's going to become.  Is there a word yet that -- "cellular's"
too long.
<P><pre>
>>personal communicator.

>>well, personal communication system, which was, by the way, PCs.

>>read-only memory, CD-ROM.

>>what about the French, who are trying to freeze their culture by making
>>non-French words crimes?

>>they'll lose.  They'll just lose.

>>they're going to have trouble communicating.

>>sure, and they'll just lose.  I mean, you can't in the long run keep an
>>entire supercivilization out of your society, so, you know, they can go
>>through a very elaborate -- and the German, I think, for telephone was
>>"far speaker." Huh?

>>is that what you are, the far speaker?

>>Yeah, I guess I'm the far speaker.  It had different speaker.  I'm the
>>far speaker from the far side.  Right.  That's a different meaning --
>>that's a different meaning.  (laughter) that's a different meaning than
>>the German.  But the point is to create, you know, to create that kind of
>>a -- and by the way, that is part of what the problem is.  In terms of --
>>and I said it as a joke because it was too good not to say.  The truth
>>is, because we're used to politicians who are here, what I'm trying to
>>do, which is understand and discuss this, does mean that by the standard
>>of this, I am outside.  And so that -- in that sense, I mean, your
>>comment was, in a different way, true.
</pre><P>
Now -- and you've got to look for dangers and opportunities that you can
see as the Third Wave evolves.  I mean, there is a real danger we'll leave
the poor behind.  There's a real danger that 45- or 50-year-olds who
invested their whole life in their company are now going to find themselves
temporarily obsolesced.  Now the question is, can you rethink the system so
it's temporary rather than permanent?  Because I would argue you need to --
we need to focus as much on lifetime learning for 50-year-olds as we do on
lifetime learning for 5-year-olds.  Because if you grew up and were trained
here and had a sense of stability, you feel really cheated here.
<P>
And so we really have to come to grips with, how are we going to make
lifetime learning real?  How do we help people start their own businesses?
How do we help people make a new career?  You can't --if you're going to
live to be 90 or 100, you can't say to somebody, "you're obsolete at 50."
You cannot have a society which says to an entire generation of people,
"sorry that you were born a little bit too early.  "you don't quite get it.
"good luck." And instead what you've got to do is think, how are we going
to reintegrate and reabsorb all the energy and talent, remembering people
are going to live a lot longer?  And that's going to have all sorts of
implications on pension plans and retirement, and what does it mean and how
much do you have to -- to save all your working life to live for five years
after retirement is one thing.  To save all your working life to live 40
years after retirement is a different thing, and probably unsustainable.
Probably means that, like Drucker -- I mean, like Drucker and Deming, that
there's some level of activity involved for most of your lifetime, because
it's inconceivable that you can get people to save.  I mean, the level of
savings you'd have to engage in in order to be able to retire for 40 years
is going to be a very small number of people.
<P>
And so as all these changes occur, we've got to be open and available to
rethinking them.  It also means that the same event can occur, and one
person can see an opportunity while another sees danger at the exact same
moment.  So the software writer at Microsoft thought it was wonderful, and
the centralized hardware computer at IBM thought it was terrible, and the
same event's occurring and you're getting two very different descriptions
at the same moment.
<P>
The rise of integration was wonderful if you were black, and if you were a
white segregationist, it was terrifying.  The sudden level of change -- I
mean, here you had -- and it's something Drucker wrote about 30 years ago.
You had blacks who were finally entering the industrial era and finally
getting a good job in Detroit the week the factory closed.  And was being
replaced by white upper middle class software writers.  And all the terms
of engagement changed just as people began to succeed.  So you've got to be
very sensitive to the fact and you've got to listen carefully, because you
can both be describing the same event, but your viewpoints are so
different.  That you've got to know -- you've got to walk -- I describe it
as walking all the way around the tree.  You've got to be willing to stop
and walk all the way around the tree and see the event from their
viewpoint.
<P>
Daryl Conner's term for it is "appreciative understanding." You don't have
to agree, but you have to appreciate why they would feel that way and why
you might feel that way if you were in their shoes.  That doesn't mean
they're right, but it means it's real.  For them, this is true.  And you've
got to work at that if you want to hold your society together.  And you've
got to study the earlier transitions.
<P>
We can learn lessons from Britain between 1720 and 1850.  We can learn
lessons from America 1750 to 1915.  From Japan, 1854 to 1930.  Germany,
1830 to 1914.  Russia, 1850 to 1917.  All those were transition periods for
those societies as they left the agricultural era and they went into the
industrial era.  Now, what did they do?  How did they respond?  What were
the tensions in their periods?  How did people respond in family structure,
in politics, in entrepreneurship?  And I think that there are also lessons
to be learned about how countries, companies, and individuals change.
Daryl Conner's work which I mentioned to you earlier, "Managing at the
Speed of Change." What Daryl attempts to do here based on about 25 years of
consulting is to show you the consistent patterns by which human beings
tend to respond as human beings.  How do people respond to the process of
change, and how do they go through it?
<P>
Another book I've seen recently that's helpful, and that is Morris
Schechtman's "Working Without a Net" in which Schechtman walks you through
the scale of change we're living through.  Dr.  Barbara Lawton, who you met
last week who helped us do the red bead experiment, wrote a note about this
week's lesson.  She had a bunch of specific ideas we'll share with you in
detail, but for example, she says, "coming into the transition, it seems
like all the structures, institutions, relationships, the pillars of our
everyday existence are threatened.  Pensions, lifelong employment, jobs and
manufacturing, traditional teaching-learning relationships, things in life
must be broken apart before it can be rearranged into more effective ways
of living." In other words, you'll see the thawing at a rate faster than
you'll see the refreezing.
<P>
So early on, the insecurity will increase and the threat of tension to old
institutions will increase.  From numerous early experiments, successful
patterns will emerge.  This is a very important part of this.  One of the
reasons you want to decentralize is so you have lots of parallel
experiments, and then it's not like you can predict the winners, but you
notice the winners as they occur, and you orient to the winners as they
occur.  Nobody in 1950 could have predicted McDonald's, but it's easy to
find McDonald's at a later point.  And you suddenly say, "wow, this must be
working," because you see more and more of them.  As you saw more golden
arches, it became pretty obvious.  "now," she says, "what it demands from
all of us personally, it breaks our expectations about our future.  We live
within a framework of implied contracts," like if I do a good job and I'm
loyal, my company is going to keep me forever.  But what if your company
can't?  What if the whole world changes?  What if the market replaces your
product?  "the change seems unfair." I've done my job.  How come it's
changing?  But the objective fact, it's that big a world.  There are that
many things going on.  She said, "we need the understanding to recognize
that what we're experiencing is not someone else trying to cheat or deprive
us, but is the result of our own collective actions."
<P>
That is, that the Third Wave is so huge, that it's not about somebody else
conspiring to take away your stability.  It's about the world changing and
us going with the changes.  Sort of like being in the middle of an
earthquake and saying, boy, I'll bet, you know, the rich did this to us or
the unions did this to us, or, you know -- no, it was an earthquake.  I
mean, the planet did it to us.  And in a sense, the Third Wave is that big
a change.  It's a planetary change.  She said, "we need the personal
strength to put our energy into creating the new experiments and developing
pathways into the future, rather than into denying the change and finding
ways to patch a system whose time has past.  We all need the understanding
of profound knowledge," which is Deming's term, "to develop new methods of
working, processes, and systems for the Third Wave world.  We must be
active learners looking for the new patterns underlying the themes."
<P>
And so I think this concept, one of the habits of the future will be that
we have to all be active learners, that we have to take responsibility.
And in the process of that learning, what I'm suggesting is that how we
apply the five pillars of American Civilization help us think through the
process of change from a second to Third Wave civilization.  Remembering
that the five pillars of American Civilization are, first, the historic
lessons of American Civilization.  Second, personal strength.  Third,
entrepreneurial free enterprise.  Fourth, the spirit of invention and
discovery.  And, fifth, quality as defined by Edwards Deming.  And what I'm
suggesting is that we literally go back through and that you get a habit in
your head when you bounce into a new situation, a new problem, a new
opportunity, of trying to apply all.  Start with applying the historic
lessons of American Civilization to the emerging Third Wave information
age.
<P>
And here, what I would suggest is that you go back and you say, all right,
how did we change the last time?  Fulton's invention of the steamboat.  The
rise of the railroad.  What was it like to go from the stagecoach through
the pony express to the railroad?  How did people adjust to those changes?
What about towns that died because they weren't on the railroad?  Towns
that exploded, like Atlanta, because they were on the railroad.  The
importance of the rail heads in Chicago and buffalo.  And you suddenly have
a whole different pattern, okay?  Second, personal strength in a Third Wave
information age.  It seems to me pretty clear that if you're going to make
it through the freezing, I mean, the rethawing and the refreezing, it takes
a lot of personal strength.  And those people who have the personal
strength to be active learners, those people who are able to go out and
actively do the right kind of things, are going to face dramatically
greater opportunities than people who get up in the morning and passively
wait for somebody else to invent the future.
<P>
Daryl Conner, along that line, has a model of change which I found very
helpful in which he says that resilience is the key factor.  And what he
means by "resilience" is -- and his whole point is this kind of change is
never easy, so if you get in a habit of when you make a mistake, you get
back up.
<P>
Think about learning how to ski.  If you have the resilience to get back up
after you fall down and get back up after you fall down and you have the
sheer energy and the optimism and the drive to say, "okay, so I've fallen
down nine times; I think I'll try a 10th time," you are much more likely to
learn how to ski than if the third time you fall, you say, "that's it; I
can't do it," and then you leave for two days or a week or a year and come
back.
<P>
Well, the same thing's true of all kinds of active learning and all kinds
of inventing of the future.  Leading an organization.  What we're doing in
the house today.  I mean, all these things, the more resilience you have,
the greater your capacity to get things done.  Which leads you, of course,
to entrepreneurial free enterprise and the process of entering the
information age.  That the more rapidly you can invent and develop the
future, the better off you are.  Did you want to --
<P><PRE>
>>what is the fundamental -- what is the best way to explain what the
>>fundamental product in the information age is going to be?  I hate to --

>>the fundamental product's going to be what people buy.

>>we're still going to need material production, we're still going to need
>>aircraft --

>>huge quantities, yeah, you'll have huge quantities of it.

>>are those things going to be produced more easily and with less human
>>resource so what the fundamental product will be --

>>what's the largest industry in central Florida?

>>entertainment.

>>huh?

>>entertainment.

>>tourism.

>>tourism.

>>the service is not good.

>>It may well be services, it may be the layer beyond services.  It may be
>>developing virtual reality games.  May be being a gamemaster.  I can
>>teach you how to play virtual reality faster than anybody else.  For
>>$5,000, you know, I'll be the equivalent of a ski instructor.  You know,
>>come to me, because the game's get to be so sophisticated.  It may well
>>be entertainment.  I mean, look at Nashville.  Look at Atlanta, which has
>>become a fairly big music center.  Look at the amount of money for
>>"Jurassic park." It may be producing items of self-identity.  You know,
>>you wear a certain kind of t-shirt.  Why?  Because you want to belong to
>>the group that wears those t-shirts.  I mean, the truth is we don't
>>really know what's the other side of this, and that's part of why
>>entrepreneurship and the idea of a free market where the market defines
>>where you're going.  I mean, who could have guessed that coca-cola would
>>be the most widely known single symbol of the industrial age?  But it is.
>>I mean, more people across the planet recognize coca-cola than any other
>>trademark.  You could never have predicted that in 1870.

>>when you look -- it's kind of interesting that when you look at these
>>various ages and changes, all of the things in hunter-gathering and
>>agriculture and industry have to be accomplished.  These things don't go
>>away.  They're just more easily accomplished kind of thing.

>>Oh, but if you had said -- but if you had said at the beginning of the
>>industrial era that only 3% or less of the country will grow food, the
>>answer would have been, gosh, we'll have 95% unemployment.  And if you
>>had said at the beginning of the industrial era -- at the high point of
>>the industrial era that we'll be down to 17% of the population
>>manufacturing goods, matter of fact, I can show you all the static models
>>where people said -- where by looking backwards people said, my God,
>>we'll all be unemployed.  It's turning out, by the way, the information
>>age doesn't mean what John Kenneth Galbraith said in "the Affluent
>>Society," more leisure time, people who are bored.  Turns out you work
>>longer hours.  You are more absorbed by your work.  But you tend to find
>>a job you like.  So you tend to self-select, so you end up -- you know,
>>you say, what's your hobby?  For a lot of people, their hobby is their
>>work.  They like what they're doing.  It's the game they want to play.
>>And they'll play it for absurd lengths of time.  You almost have to wean
>>them from it.  You know, quit doing it.  Go away for a week.  It's not
>>necessarily because they're gaining -- you know, in the industrial era,
>>people did that to score high.  They wanted to make more money.  A lot of
>>people do it now because they love it.  But I want to do my business.
>>You know, this is who I -- they identify themselves with what they do.

>>the whole big brother theory has become obsolete, as well, if this -- in
>>the information age because it's not so much --

>>you mean the state telling you, big brother in the sense of the state
>>telling you what to do?

>>well, not so much that.  Big brother being able to track what you do.  It
>>seems like now it's more little brother.  We can access what you guys are
>>doing now.  You see what I'm saying?

>>it may be.  I mean, it may be that everybody can track everybody, in
>>which case you'll be tremendously bored.  Because it turns out most
>>people don't do all that much stuff you want to know.  But, but, it also
>>means that the government can track every credit card, every phone call.
>>

>>that's what I was saying about George Orwell.

>>You then have to discipline yourself with things like the privacy act and
>>say, yes, we could, but it will be illegal.  We will not do it.  And it
>>also turns out, by the way, that in the scale of an information society,
>>you have so many ways of communicating that a government capable of
>>tracking everything you do would itself be so confused by its information
>>that we don't know how to organize it.  So that, in a sense, Gorbachev
>>found that he had less information over time, not more.
</pre>
Look also at the notion, which is fairly self-evident, of the spirit of
invention and discovery in creating a Third Wave.  I mean, obviously, Bill
Gates is a good example, but so is Spielberg and George Lucas.  So are the
people who are developing the biotechnology of the 21st century.  So are --
so is the development of the DNA and the double helix and Watson and
crick's work on inventing modern biology.  You know, and so you've got a
tremendous spirit of what's coming next.  That is particularly important as
you enter this kind of an era.  I mean, in a stable high civilization, in
the roman world, there was remarkably little invention and discovery by our
standards.  In our era, we are exploding the rate of research and the
number of things we're learning.
<P>
It also means -- and I think that Deming, in this sense, is a very
transitional figure -- that Quality and Profound Knowledge are key parts of
the transportation from an industrial era to an information age.  That, in
fact, what Deming was doing was creating the first systems insight into the
most powerful patterns of the information age.  The kind of teams that
Deming is describing, the kind of human interaction, the notion of
continuous improvement, is a very big part of where we're going.  In this
framework, what you need to ask yourself -- it goes through a series of
questions.
<P>
First of all, individuals.  You and your life.  And you can literally sort
of put a page in your notebook and start just making notes.  How will this
affect you?  How will your life be different?  Second is, how does it
affect families?  What's the structure of families?  In a sense, we may be
rebonding extended families, because the telephone and the fax and the
e-mail allow a level of communications that rebonds us, and as the cost of
transportation drops, we fly to see each other more often, or we drive on
the interstate.  So that, in a sense, we may be rebuilding an extended
family in a different way.  We're also inventing electronic families and
electronic neighborhoods.
<P>
Most of you are not as close to the person who lives next door to you as
you are to somebody on your telephone list.  You live in an electronic
neighborhood.  If I asked you to tell me the 20 people you talk to most
often, it will not include the person next door.  That's true for almost
everybody.  And you can try that out as an experiment.  I mean, start down
the list of who do you -- you know, just keep track of who do you talk to
in a week, and see how far down you have to get before you get to one of
your physical neighbors.  And you'll be very surprised.
<P>
But we live -- but it's not that we don't have a neighborhood, it's that
our neighborhood's now electronic, which gets us to the whole notion of
volunteerism in the Third Wave.  We may have all sorts of new ways of
coaching and helping and working with each other.  You know, and it may
well be that a lot more of it's by telephone.  I mean, I don't know of how
many places have tutoring by telephone.  But it could be done very easily.
I mean, you know, kids who talk on the telephone all the time could be
tutored on the telephone.  You could actually -- you could have senior
citizens in Florida who when they get bored are tutoring kids in Detroit,
and the cost is trivial compared to that kid not learning math.  They might
only meet once a year.  But it's the whole notion of weaving together new
patterns.  Which also leads then to business and job creation in the Third
Wave.
<P>
Had a woman come by last night who has invented an entire environmental
recycling company out of boredom.  She was tired -- she put -- her children
were growing, she was tired of shopping, she believed in the environment,
so she began -- she went out on her own, using the local library, found a
particular recycling possibility, created a product, sold it to Disney and
coke, and is now off and running and creating t-shirts out of coke bottles.
Now, the two liter coke bottle has a plastic that can be reprocessed into
fiber.  The fiber can be used exactly like cotton, and she now has an
entire company that she built out of her one room in her house.
<P>
And that's that process of creating new jobs.  Which, by the way, then
means you can start talking about local government.  I mean, government is
a lagging indicator of the Third Wave, because bureaucracies don't face the
same pressures, and they have no incentives for change.  You could
revolutionize virtually every small -- every local government, every school
board, every county government, every city government in this country could
be revolutionized, and then you have state governments where we're
beginning to get some impact.  But state governments are a tremendously
long way from being as efficient as American Express or as customer
oriented as McDonald's, or as able to deliver per dollar as Federal
Express, so think about state government in the Third Wave information age
and what could it be like if you made the transition?  Because you'll find
governments rival the academic world and some parts of medicine as among
the most trapped in a frozen environment and the most resistant to thawing.

<P>
And what you're looking for is, how do you get through this process of
thawing and get people to start breaking down?  And then, of course, the
area where I'm most directly involved is, what is a Third Wave information
age federal government like?  You know, and what would you do to -- and
that's where, frankly, Vice-President Gore is reinventing government.  He's
asking the right questions.  Whether you agree or disagree with the
details, he is beginning to put us in the right direction of saying, look,
we've got to rethink this whole thing from the ground up.
<P>
But it's beyond the United States.  There are implications of the emerging
Third Wave information age for the world system and for national security.
That's part of why I mentioned Toffler, Alvin and Heidi's book, "War and
Anti-War," because you've got to think about, you know, what would have
happened if Saddam Hussein had hired 10 hackers at the beginning of "Desert
Shield" and had decided to electronically try to break down American
systems?  Not killing people, not setting off bombs, but, for example,
issuing 500,000 new American express cards.  Or simply charging absurd
fees.  Breaking down telephone systems.  Sending signals to turn off
Georgia power company's electric plants.  I mean, how much damage could you
do on the information side?
<P>
And what does it mean that you now live in a worldwide system where when
something happens somewhere, CNN is there live, and if CNN is not there
live, that there's now such a ubiquitous flow of video cameras that
somebody will be there.  I mean, how does that change things?  You know,
what's a -- I tell military classes that I teach, you're going to be in a
firefight, where it's going to be live on CNN, your cellular phone's going
to go off.  You're going to say, "mom, it's not as bad as it looks on TV.
"I'm very busy.  "I can't talk now.  "can I call you when the fight's over?
" Now, it sounds funny.  It's not a joke.  I mean, you're going to have
people who go into the field carrying cellular phones.  And since you have
more and more married people and more and more husbands and wives in the
military and they're sometimes drawing straws -- I mean, which one stays
home with the kids?  They both leave.  You know, the kids are with grandma.
Now they're both worried about the kids.  They're about to go out on
patrol.  They call in, you know, "oh, Timmy has a fever." I mean, in the
old days, there was a certain virtue of a wall between your civilian life
and the war, because you could focus on the war.  Now you're going to have
real-time flow of information all day every day.  You get in a fight with
your boyfriend or girlfriend just before you go on patrol.  What are you
thinking about?
<P><Pre>
>>because if the Third Wave does go broke, wouldn't that almost in some
>>respects render warfare obsolete?  I mean --

>>no.

>>what would be the -- what would be the advantage of going to war with a
>>trade partner or, you know, I mean --

>Ssame as it was in 1914.  Germany's biggest trading partner was France.
>And the fact is -- and this is what makes me a conservative.  The fact is,
>power in the end come from power, and somebody who has a gun at your head
>or a knife at your throat has an enormous advantage in winning the
>argument, and you have to have -- and you have to have a society capable
>of stopping that.

>>but isn't that a little humanistic?  I mean, that --

>>no, and I think it's a fact.  I mean, it is a -- just like you were
>>talking about earlier, don't you have to go through these changes?

>>yes.

>>It is a fact that if one society is prepared to annihilate the other, it
>>has an enormous advantage, and that what you've got to worry about is
>>that somebody out there who's really bad is going to get into the Third
>>Wave before you do.  I mean, Nazi Germany had an atomic bomb in '41,
>>okay?  The Soviet Union that made the information breakthrough before we
>>did.  I mean, and the theory here is simple, there is evil.  And evil has
>>to be dealt with, okay?  Now, what you've got to look at is as you think
>>about from you personally up through family, business, government, to the
>>world, how can we learn more about the changes we're living through and
>>the changes to come?  Okay.
</pre>
And before we start talking about that, I'm proud of the team.  Here is --
I assume I'm holding it up right, okay?  Here is the symbol for "crisis,"
which is made up on "danger" and "opportunities." It's Chinese.  This is
the symbol.
<P><PRE>
>>I know, but which is danger and which is opportunity?

>>Beats me.  There are limits to what I can -- and I won't fake it, because
>>somebody will call in next week and say, "boy, did you get that wrong."
>>But the point is that I think that it's very important to have this sense
>>of balance.  I mean, you know, people who are self-described futurists,
>>innovators.  I mean, when I was younger, a lot of people said, "oh, this
>>is all going to be wonderful." Maybe.  There are dangers and
>>opportunities.  Some of it will be good.  Some of it will be
>>heart-breaking.  Some of it will extend life.  Some of it will destroy
>>life.  Air conditioning, on balance, has made life easier in the south.
>>It's also increased pollution.  There is a cost to air conditioning.
</pre><P>
And so you've got to go through cycle after cycle.  Vaccinations against
various diseases have been wonderful for the human race.  They've also led
to an extraordinary population explosion, which has not been as wonderful
for other species, and so you've got to go through these kind of thinking
about what works, what doesn't work.  And I think you've got to always have
a sort of balanced sense that there's nothing that comes as a totally free
gift.  But there's also very few things that come totally bad.  And so
you're constantly trying to balance the dangers and the opportunities.
<P>
Now, what I want you to do -- if you think about going back to the core
structure of thought that we talked about, you'd like to think through what
are your vision, strategies, and projects for the transition.  How are we
going to go through the thawing and the refreezing?  What's our vision of
making the transition?  What are our strategies for making the transition?
What specific doable projects are out there that you could go and do that
would help you make the transition?  And then finally, what should you do
every day?  And, of course, as you're doing that, it's important to keep
reminding people that the basic model for leadership is listen, learn,
help, and lead.  I mean, what's the best way to learn about the emerging
Third Wave?  Listen.  And just constantly be probing.  How do you find the
characteristics?  Let people tell you about them.  And as you do that,
you'll begin to learn things that begin to piece things together, and then
you'll be able to say, gee, I wonder if that's a principle.  I wonder if
that really does give me -- remember, the value of a principle is that it
allows you to predict.
<P>
Remember, Deming says every management action has to start with a theory,
okay?  I've noticed every time that when we put the water on the fire, the
water eventually boils.  That could lead to a principle.  Water when heated
will boil.  Now, that sounds obvious because you've learned it, but it's
not obvious.  So you come over here and you start saying, all right, what
are the characteristics I am discovering by learning, by listening and
learning, and what do they start telling me about the principles that might
emerge?
<P>
And by the way, it's possible to be all three.  That is, you could end up
in a Third Wave civilization which is a global civilization and which is so
complex that you have multiple patterns interacting simultaneously.  Now,
you do some of that already, don't you?  You can walk, you can roller
skate, you can ride a bicycle, you can drive a car, you can ride in a bus,
you can get in an airplane.  And you're able to integrate all those into
your personality.  Yet they're very different, aren't they?  But you don't
even think about it, because you're used to it.  See, the great power of
being frozen is you get used to it.  And so as we start emerging over here,
we may have an extraordinarily complex system, but it may reflect itself in
very simple habits.  Again, go back to ups and fed ex.  Ups and fed ex are
unbelievable.  I mean, you try to design the complexity by which they
actually get it to work overnight on a worldwide basis, and it's immense.
On the other hand, what's your experience of it?  You pick up the phone.
They show up.  You give them the package and money.  They leave.  So for
you, it's a very simple experience.  Yet hidden behind that simple
experience is a very powerful, complex system.  Okay?  Questions, comments.

<P><pre>
>>okay, I can see that model some -- you know, in some way, but to me, it
>>seems like it's like the egg theory.  You've got the egg over here and
>>you want it cooked.  And so over here you've got to get a pan and a water
>>and everything, and so this is -- to me, this is the thawing portion,
>>where you bring all the elements together to make it --

>>right.

>>and then you come up with a product which would be this intangible.

>>but that implies you already know this game.

>>no.

>>see, you know you want a cooked egg.

>>but you don't know if the egg's going to come out cooked like you want
>>it.  I mean, you're just --

>>No, but you already have a theory of a cook.  No, I'm suggesting to you
>>that the truth is, this is so big, that we only have glimmerings, to use
>>Fred Franks, who was the commander of the seventh corps in "Desert
>>Storm," we only have glimmerings of the future.  I mean, through the fog,
>>we sort of see a little of this and a little of that, and we think it's
>>going to be this way.  But I'd carry you back a stage further.
</pre>
How do we know it's an egg?  How do we know it's food?  I mean, what if, in
fact, it's a Faberge Egg and we now put it in a pot and we start cooking
it, thereby ruining a very valuable art object.  And that -- and I'm not
trying to disagree with you, except to say, this is -- I mean, I have
certainties about the fact that we are thawing, and I have certainties
about the fact that this is going to be global and it's going to be
information.  And I have concluded -- one of my conclusions after 20 years
of thinking about it is that American Civilization will turn out to be the
highest way of organizing humans to liberate the maximum amount of energy
so you have the maximum creativity, so I'm now sort of convinced that at
that level, I know where we're going.  I can't tell you many of the
details.  I can't tell you that we'll get to a -- not just a hard or soft
boiled egg.  I can't tell you what it will be like.  I'm still in the
observation phase of, gee, the water is boiling, isn't it?  That is the
fifth time we've learned that, and just seeing how it plays out.
<P><pre>
>>but I think it's just as frustrating for the people that's here to keep
>>being in a society that's so frozen, because I have --

>>sure.  Of course it is.

>>for example, I have a daughter, or my three children are Montessori
>>trained, and it's a very -- it's more of a dialogue learning-type
>>situation, and when they go to age -- I mean, grade 6, and all of a
>>sudden they're forced back into this.

>>sure.

>>and all of a sudden this system over here's telling them, I'm the
>>teacher, you're the child, don't interrupt my class.

>>right.  Of course you're right.

>>I think they're more frustrated here than they are there.

>>And in a sense, this is one of the interesting things we're going through
>>right now.  This is the first grade crisis.  The first grade crisis is
>>not here.  The first grade crisis is, for example, the power of obsolete
>>education systems to coerce taxpayer money to continue to fail.  I mean,
>>it is astonishing the amount of money we spend on systems that are
>>totally failing.  The dc.  Schools spend $9,600 per child.

>>what's the national average?

>>much lower than that.  About 4400, 4500.  For $9600 per child, you can go
>>to an elite private school.

>>is that per year?

>>Per year, per year.  A class of 20 is $192,000 in the room.  I mean, one
>>of the studies I want to get done is to say, if we just said to a
>>teacher, "here is $192,000.  "rent a room, buy the books, and feed them
>>lunch.  "you get to keep the rest." Teacher's pay would change radically
>>overnight.  I mean, just think about that.  Literally it's -- I mean, I
>>had these numbers checked, because I knew it was going to be amazing.
>>$9600.  And that's not the highest.  The highest may well be in Newark,
>>which is, I think, like, 10,500.  I mean -- and you're not getting --
>>you're getting about $1200 worth of learning, and yet we have been
>>convinced by this system that the only answer is, why aren't you spending
>>more?  I mean, what you need to do is dissolve it.
</pre>
Lawyers are the same way, as you're going to see next week.  I mean, we
accept levels of litigation that are insane.  Why do we do it?  Because it
-- because at the high water mark of the industrial era, it's what the
lawyers could get through, because guess who dominated the legislatures?
Okay, so you go through a whole series of these things.  Now, I mean, on
the other hand, you're going to threaten people.  There's no question in my
mind that the idea of self-diagnosis will be bitterly resented and will
absolutely happen.  Just as self-learning will happen.
<P>
I mean, you're seeing it with home learning.  I mean, nobody's yet figured
out home schooling is part of the Third Wave.  I mean, if you can get the
best computer software, the best textbooks, the best videotape, and your
parents are willing to invest in your learning -- and it turns out, what
was the number, 15 out of the 17 top scorers on the sat.  Were home
schooled?  Some number like that I saw the other day that I -- don't -- the
media that normally takes this off, they should check it before they take
it out of my class, but there is some number that's amazing about the
number of home schoolers who are now doing, very, very well.  Well, why is
that?  Part of it's because it's the emerging Third Wave environment.
<P>
I mean, the embedded base of learning is so enormous, you take your child
to a great museum, then you take them over here to a great zoo.  Then you
take them down and they get to see a factory.  Then they get to read about
it.  Then they get to watch the videotape.  Then they get to use the PC at
home and use the best software in the world, and you're personally
nurturing and interacting with them.  And I'm not arguing for home
schooling.  My children and my wife and I are all products of traditional,
regular public schools, but I am saying that's a characteristic that is
bubbling here that is telling us something.  And for 9600 bucks, you can do
a lot of home schooling.
<P><pre>
>>have there been any returns on that?  I believe it was Boston that opted,
>>you know, in a certain community to give the parents -- the students the
>>money that they were spending on the children.

>>I don't think it's in -- there is in Milwaukee where, again, Polly
>>Williams, a black welfare mother, who had been Jesse Jackson's
>>CO-chairman of state legislature, created vouchers for the inner city.
>>Tremendously bitter fight.  And the republicans made her the chairman, or
>>chairwoman, of the education committee in the legislature.  But what you
>>get right now is from public managed public schools to corporate managed
>>public schools.  The Baltimore experiment, or the HartFord experiment.  I
>>think that's only a very tiny step.
</pre>
I mean, I think -- there's something happening here for doctors, lawyers,
and educators that will dissolve this system.  You're going to see the same
thing in the news media.  I mean, every person is going to become a
reporter.  And you'll just have -- you'll have an explosion of, you know,
why don't you contribute to your own newspaper?  The newspaper will be
electronic.  And you see some of it -- you see it with auto accidents,
don't you?  I mean, somebody calls in, they've got -- you know, they're --
at least in Atlanta, they're on the Bellsouth mobile phone, they get to
call, you know, wsb for free, and they go, "wow, I'm right here, and there
is a big tanker truck problem right here," and they're now the live,
on-the-spot volunteer reporter for the opening two minutes.  Doesn't that
sort of fit what you hear?  You've got traffic updates from the 37,000
people who call us.
<P>
You know, I'm now -- and it's interesting, because what you're getting is a
total redefinition of what it means to be a reporter.  You still have
professional reporters, but now getting all sorts of people who are random.
And when we shot down the airbus over the Persian gulf, there was, in
fact, a video camera in a boat just held by an amateur, and they filmed the
plane crashing.  Well, they immediately sold it, probably to CNN.  That
person was, for that moment, a temporary reporter, weren't they?
Similarly, you're going to have a lot of self-law, you're going to have a
lot of self-health, you're going to have a -- you know, where you get up in
the morning and you sit in an armchair or something and you -- it says to
you, "your cardiovascular's not good enough.  "go exercise a little bit
more.  "add -- you know, add a half mile to your run," or "add 10 laps to
your swim," or, you know, "go do stairmaster longer."
<P><pre>
>>we're talking about change, and I guess it could be argued that we're
>>change -- change is inevitable and change is constant, but why are we so
>>resistant to change?

>>Because you want certainty.  Humans operate best when they're secure.  So
>>you spend your lifetime trying to find out, what can I do?  I feel this
>>way.  I'm a very public figure, as you all know.  I hate arriving late.
>>I got into some kind of a goof-up the other day -- well, the national
>>prayer breakfast.  I arrived late because of something else we had to do,
>>and here's this huge crowd, and I was going to have to walk in late.  I
>>literally for a half second thought about leaving just because I hate
>>walking in and being embarrassed.  So people have a very high propensity
>>to be insecure, and, you know, you say, you know, what do you mean I have
>>to learn a new career?  Or what do you mean we just changed power
>>companies and now they're billing differently?  Or I'm going to change to
>>a new cable system and I can't find my favorite show?  Or they no longer
>>do checkbooks the way they used to, and now -- I mean, anything which
>>makes us insecure goes at this core notion which is, we want to build
>>boundaries around us that are stable so that we know what we can do and
>>have a sense of certainty.
</pre><P>
That's very human, and it goes back to chimpanzee politics and to Franz de
Waal's work on primates.  I mean, that people want orderly structured
environments in which they have what Yankelovich called a giving and
getting contract.  I'll do my share, and now you owe me.  That's why when
you run into the steelworker who basically thought, if I was a good
steelworker for 20 years, you're not allowed to close the factory.  You
can't make me learn a new career.  And what we're describing here is a
much, much more decentralized society.
<P>
I told Morris Schechtman that he ought to change the title of his book from
"Working Without a Net" to "Building Your Own Net."

So we will pick all of this up and go in to the Third Wave and the world
market and creating next -- creating American jobs.  And for that, we're
going to ask you to look at "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt,
chapters I, II, XI, and XII.

<TITLE> "IT'S DRUGS, STUPID," ACU SAYS </TITLE>

<BODY>
<strong>For Immediate Release</strong><br>
August 22, 1996<br>

<center><h2>"IT'S DRUGS, STUPID," ACU SAYS</h2></center>
<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA, VA.</strong>--- "At a time when the latest statistics indicate marijuana use among teen-<br><br>agers is up 37% and as we face a national crisis on drug abuse, Bill Clinton fiddles while Rome <br><br>burns talking about tobacco use," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. <br><br>Keene. "The way the Clinton Administration and its liberal allies portray it, tobacco is the greatest <br><br>scourge affecting children since the dawn of time and nothing short of a full-blown crackdown by <br><br>the Federal government can solve it. But the real problem is drug abuse and all its associated evils, <br><br>and the Clinton Administration has exhibited a scandalous indifference to the appalling increase in <br><br>illegal drug use."
<p>Keene noted that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services statistics released earlier this month show overall drug abuse among teens is up 78% between 1992 and 1995.  Marijuana use by teen-agers is up 37%, LSD use is up 54%, and cocaine use is up 166%.  He also pointed to a second new government report showing hospital emergency room visits resulting from marijuana abuse is up 96%.  Before Clinton took office, teen-age drug abuse had declined for a decade according to a third survey, conducted by <em>USA Today</em>.
<p>"What's really at work here is a cynical attempt to gain political mileage at the expense of addressing the real problem," Keene continued.  "The Administration, knowing it lacks credibility when it comes to waging the real war -- the war on drugs -- thinks it can cover itself with a phony war on tobacco.
<p>"As early as the 1960's and 1970's, the science was conclusive about the hazards of illegal drug use," Keene said. "But the then-youthful liberals who today occupy top positions in Washington, Hollywood and elsewhere ridiculed the dangers of marijuana and rejected society's disdain over 'hard' drugs.  They agitated to decriminalize marijuana cutlivation, possession and use.  They attacked, then as now, conservatives and other advocates of traditional cultural and moral values.  Today, as adults, they minimize and rationalize their own dalliances in the illegal drug scene.  For example, the President did not say that his own marijuana experimentation was wrong because it was illegal, or dangerous, or manifested anti-social behavior -- he excused himself by saying that he 'didn't inhale.'
<p>"No one, not even the tobacco companies, who are clearly on record about it, think it's a good idea for young people to smoke," Keene added.  "But the liberal establishment's election-year hysteria over tobacco is hypocritical in light of its record on illegal drug policy.  After all, the permissive social and political attitudes of liberalism gave birth to the drug culture.  Many liberals seem unwilling to offer more than lip service when it comes to fighting it and belittle those who try -- as former First Lady Nancy Reagan can attest from experience.  Should anyone take this Administration seriously in its 'holy war' against tobacco in light of disturbing reports of illegal drug use among the White House staff? What moral authority does the President -- a cigar smoker -- bring to bear? Why is the Administration bent on expanding government power and imposing new layers of regulation on the American people in this instance while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the critical problem of illegal drug use?
<p>"The American people should be asking tough questions," Keene concluded. "If the Administration should make a Federal case out of anything, it's national drug policy. Apparently Clinton has none, since the statistics speak for themselves. We therefore urge the Administration to wake up to the real and growing threat of illegal drug abuse and stop offering political sideshows to sidestep its real responsibilities."

<h2>FLAT TAX, SALES TAX, WHATEVER: FOCUS MUST STAY ON<br>
JUNKING CURRENT NIGHTMARISH TAX SYSTEM, ACU SAYS </h2>
</center>

<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--- "Some conservatives favor a flat tax, others support a national sales or
value-added tax, still others have different ideas on how best to pay for the legitimate
functions of government. The main thing is, we must not allow differences over those approaches
from causing the tax reform movement to lose sight of the real goal: elimination of the current
Federal income tax non-system, with its enormous bureaucracy, byzantine rules and regulations,
and abuses and outrages. That's why ACU is happy to join forces with those who also recognize
the importance of staying focused on the larger objective," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the
American Conservative Union (ACU), at a "Commitment to Tax Reform" press conference in
Washington, D.C., hosted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
<P>
     "This year's Tax Freedom Day- - May 7 - - was the latest ever," Keene continued. "When you
add in the hidden costs of government, such as regulations and other expensive burdens,
Americans must labor until July 3 before they're in the clear and able to keep all of what they
work hard to earn. That's an outrage to cause every American's blood to boil. The 105th Congress
cannot allow this level and scope of taxation to continue. The current tax structure is
hopelessly beyond repair and the only sane, fair thing to do is scrap it entirely.
<P>
     "ACU has already launched its own long-term project with the objective of abolishing the
IRS and repealing the 16th Amendment, which authorized the Federal income tax. Yet that does not
mean we cannot join with our friends who argue persuasively for a flat tax in saying with them
that what exists now is a nightmare that must end and that the American people deserve tax
justice," Keene concluded. "The issue is no longer whether or not to end taxation as we know it,
but how soon we will get there. Once we get there, we may find that a flat tax is the way to go,
or that the best option is the national sales tax, or that some other approach is better.
Whatever the outcome, we simply must not lose sight of the objective, we simply must not let
Congress dodge the issue any longer, and we simply must make sure that the American people don't
stop pressing for reform."

<h2>ON TAX FREEDOM DAY, ACU URGES 16TH AMENDMENT REPEAL </h2>
</center>

<p>


 
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "It's Tax Freedom Day. Starting now, Americans can keep what they 
work so hard to earn after having spent the past four months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax 
bill," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. "With this year's Tax 
Freedom Day being the latest ever, the need for comprehensive tax reform has never been greater. 
That's why ACU is making tax reform its top long-term priority." 
<p>    Keene said that a cornerstone of the ACU effort will be a grassroot-oriented lobbying and 
public education campaign to rally support for repeal of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which instituted the Federal income tax. 
 
 <p>    "Federal spending, the deficit, the national debt, and the growth of government have been 
spiralling out of control for decades," Keene said. "While the current Republican Congress has 
shown more determination to attack those problems than any in modern times, we have a liberal 
President who refuses to break with the past - - he vetoes every important reform and every 
serious attempt to bring needed change to the way Washington does business. Since the surest way 
to stop the big spenders is to not let them get their hands on the money, the current tax system 
has to go. The enormous tax-gathering bureaucracy, the byzantine rules and regulations, and all 
the abuses and outrages that go with it simply cannot be fixed. The slate must be wiped clean by 
repealing the 16th Amendment, and a sane, fair, workable means of paying for the essential 
functions of government should replace it." 
 
 <p>    Keene said ACU's strategy includes national "Town Meetings" on the tax reform issue, 
distribution of hundreds of thousands of citizen petitions to Congress calling for repeal of the 
16th Amendment and abolition of the Internal Revenue Service, direct lobbying of Congress, 
cooperation with public interest groups also interested in tax reform, and other projects. 

<p>     "The issue is no longer whether to drastically reform our tax non-system, but when," 
Keene added, noting that the issue was a major topic among GOP Presidential candidates and 
continues to rank high on the agendas of key Congressional leaders.  
 
 <p>    "ACU is preparing to buckle down for the long haul," Keene concluded. "We know it may 
take a few years for Congress and the states to complete the process of repeal and for a 
national consensus to be reached on a new and better tax system. ACU's job will be to help make 
sure that Washington does the right thing for the taxpayer, and we'll stay on the job for as 
long as it takes." 
 
<p>     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying 
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide 
range of issues before the Congress.

<title>WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?</title>

<h2> WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?<br>  
                    SURPRISE! IT'S TED KENNEDY </h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "Ted Kennedy built a career out of portraying every problem, however 
minor, as a crisis of mammoth proportions requiring immediate, massive government intervention. 
How ironic, then, that this same Ted Kennedy is the only one standing in the way of further 
Congressional action on S.1028, the health care legislation of which he is the chief 
co-sponsor," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Obviously, 
the Senator from Massachusetts isn't the least reluctant to fiddle while Rome burns when it 
suits his liberal political agenda." 
 
<p>     Keene referred to Kennedy's thus-far-successful parliamentary ploy blocking the 
appointment of Senate conferees on S.1028, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill. Kennedy's 
delaying tactic is an attempt to pressure Senate leaders into not adding supporters of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs) to the proposed list of conferees. 
 
<p>     "Kennedy and his fellow ultra-liberals really aren't interested in true reform, which MSAs 
represent," Keene continued. "They only want to give the American people another dose of the 
same old Big Government elixir. They want to maintain government power and control, limit health 
care choices, and micromanage health care decision-making by patients, health care 
professionals, and the private sector. MSAs offer consumer choice, not government control - - 
and that is why the liberals oppose them. 
 
<p>     "In his vendetta against MSAs - - the most promising health care insurance reform idea 
proposed in years - - Kennedy shows he's all too willing to play inside-the-Beltway politics 
with people's health care. This is hypocrisy at its worst. The American people should insist 
that Sen. Kennedy either get on board for true reform, or get out of the way and let the rest of 
the American people's elected representatives deal with this issue promptly," Keene concluded. 
 
<p>     The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots 
conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters,

<h2>AX GAS TAX, ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "A few months ago, President Clinton admitted that he raised taxes too
much and that it was a mistake. That's all the more reason why he should start making amends
now by supporting the growing movement in Congress to repeal his unnecessary 4.3-cent
gasoline tax. If not, the least he ought to do is make a public commitment not to veto a repeal,"
said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. 
<P>
     "The current increases in gasoline prices stem from many factors," Keene added, "and as
the marketplace deals with them, prices will eventually decrease - - but only to a point. The
marketplace can't make tax burdens disappear. The public has been forced to get along with less
thanks to Clinton's various tax increases. ACU says it's high time government went on a diet,
and a good place to start is by junking the Clinton gas tax."

organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies Congress on

<title>ACU Press Release - REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, 
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</title>

<h2>REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, <br>
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</h2>
</center>

<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "The tax-and-spend crowd couldnt escape this time," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene, commenting on the tax limitation Constitutional amendment vote in the House of Representatives this week. "This was a real test of who wants to make it harder for the government to get its hands on the peoples money and who is a big spender. By and large, Republicans passed the test and the Democrats failed."
Republicans voted 219 to 24 to support limits on the taxes government takes. Democrats voted for business as usual by a vote of 160 against tax limits and only 16 for tax limits.
<P>
"All it takes is a simple plurality to raise taxes and increase spending," Keene said. "Because its so easy for Congress to spend other peoples money, thats why were in the fiscal mess we face today. If Congress claims to be serious about getting taxation and spending under control, then it should be prepared to vote for serious measures to do that. The Tax Limitation Amendment was just such a measure. Were pleased that it won the support of a majority in the House, but disappointed that it fell short of the necessary two-thirds. 
<P>
"We urge the American people to ask some tough questions of Congressmen who opposed this measure, to find out why they think it should continue to be so easy to tax, spend, run up the deficit and expand the national debt," Keene continued. "They also should ask these politicians, especially Democrats, why they insist on maintaining a tax-and-spend policy so out of control that Congress needs to pass a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Isnt it more sensible to change that system so that we dont have to pass laws to protect people from it?"
<P>


Keene rejected a chief argument of opponents that limiting the ability to raise taxes means   restricting the ability of Congress to use taxation as one way to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit.
<P>
"Too many tax-and-spend liberals think taxes first, spending cuts last - - if they think of spending cuts at all. If you give politicians easy access to the money, theyre going to spend it and then some. The answer is to cut off the gravy train. Americans already pay plenty in taxes. Even if Democrats and a few Republicans dont get it, the American people do: cut government spending and stop raising taxes. The two go hand in hand. ACU will keep up the pressure and work to make sure that next time, there will indeed be enough votes to enact this important remedy," Keene said.
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the countrys oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization, with nearly one million members and supporters.

Reinhardt College<P>
<PRE>
>>The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
>>Television, in Waleska, Georgia.

>From Reinhardt College in Waleska, Georgia, this is "Renewing American
Civilization." In this, the ninth of 10 class presentations, Congressman
Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at Reinhardt College, will continue his
course, which presents the foundational principles necessary to the renewal
of American Civilization.  This week's lesson, Replacing the Culture of
Poverty and Violence, focuses on replacing the culture of poverty and
violence with a culture of productivity and safety.

>>Let me welcome everyone this morning, and in particular, welcome the
>>students of Mind Extension University who are joining us by television.
>>Let me remind them that you can mail your comments to: Renewing American
>>Civilization, post office box 6008, in Marietta, Georgia 30065.  Or you
>>can fax your comments to 404- 528-9806.  Or you can e-mail your comments

</pre>
And I'd remind everybody that the last would seem so obvious, would have
been impossible 50 years ago, and probably our grandchildren will regard
all those except the computer on line as sort of irrelevant.
<p>
The five pillars of American Civilization are, first, the Historic Lessons
of American Civilization.  Second, Personal Strength.  Third,
Entrepreneurial Free Enterprise.  Fourth, the Spirit of Invention and
Discovery.  And, fifth, Quality as described by Edwards Deming.
<p>
And we are applying these five pillars to four areas: the Third Wave and
American Civilization.  How will the information age affect us?  Second,
creating jobs, American jobs, in the world market.  Third, replacing the
culture of violence and poverty with a culture of productivity and safety.
And, fourth, citizenship and community in 21st century America.
<p>
Now, today's topic is actually the third of those four topical areas,
Replacing The Culture Of Poverty And Violence With A Culture Of
Productivity And Safety.  And if you'll notice, we've described this in a
very specific way, which I'll come back to.  But that is a replacement of a
culture with another culture.  So it's not just helping the poor or
focusing on the inner cities or anything narrow.
<p>
But this is literally a discussion about two cultures.  We start this
analysis with a belief that the current welfare system has failed.  And
this is at the heart of it.  That the system we're currently paying tax
money to pay for has simply not achieved the results we want.  In fact, I
would assert that no civilization can survive with 12-year-olds having
babies, 15-year- olds killing each other, 17-year-olds dying of aids, and
18-year- olds getting diplomas they can't read.
<p>
And these are not just apocryphal sort of things, but if you watch your
local evening news, you know that every one of these tragedies is happening
in America today.  This particular session is based on the premise that
efforts to repair or improve the current welfare system are doomed to fail
because they misunderstand the holistic nature of the problem.
<p>
Now, holistic's an important word for -I'm going to take just a second.  In
a holistic model, everything inside the model has to be taken into account.
Whereas in a reductionist model, you can break it down into a series of
building blocks, and you can say, okay, which of these do we want to deal
with first? It's a very big difference between the two.
<p>
In this model, the holistic model, every piece depends on the other pieces.
And so if you don't deal with the totality, it doesn't work.  In this
model, the pieces can be fixed independently of each other.
<p>
Now, we're going to come back to this in a minute, but I want to start with
the notion that the very first problem is that it is the system and the
culture which are the problems.  And that piecemeal efforts to repair the
system and its culture of poverty and violence are, therefore, irrelevant
and doomed to fail.  So that every time we say, "well, let's do a specific
small piece, because at least we will make progress," no, the answer is
you'll have no impact at all, or virtually no impact.
<p>
Because let's say we'll go in and we'll say, okay, "we're going to really
work on 4-year-olds in Headstart." That's fine.  When they are 8-year-olds
in the same culture of poverty and violence that they were in back when
they were 4-year-olds, but now they're outside of the environment of
Headstart, they start to revert very rapidly.  Not because Headstart wears
off, which is what people said at one time.  But because the power of a
culture to attract you, to say, this is - what cultures do is they tell
you, this is the right behavior.
<p>
This is the thing you'll be rewarded for.  This is the thing people will
praise you for.  And so what happens is the culture of poverty and violence
is so powerful that if all you do is try to change one piece of it, the
whole rest of it will come back in.  We say, why don't you go to work? And
you say, "fine," and so we create up here the work program.
<p>
What we don't do is check and find out that if you go to work, you lose
Medicaid.  So the minute you go to work, you lose Medicaid.  One of your
children gets sick, you promptly lose all the money you just worked for,
all of your neighbors then laugh at you.  You got -- you were a sucker.
Why did you go do that?
<p>
If you just sat -- you know, if you just stay at home, don't worry about
it, why do you keep listening to all these people who try to improve you?
So what you have is an interlocking system in which both the structure of
rewards and by the system, part of this is, what is it that actually
happens when you engage in behavior?  You go tell the police something.
Are you better off, or are you more likely then to be shot or beaten up or
killed for having squealed?  Are the police capable of protecting of your
house, or are the police incapable of protecting it?  Are you better off to
keep your mouth shut and not be a target?
<p>
We had a girl in Washington, D. C. , who dropped out of school because she
witnessed a stabbing.  And the girls who participated in the stabbing were
saying they would kill her if she talked to the police, so she's
cross-pressured between the police and her parents saying, "gee, why don't
you do the honest thing," and her immediate peers saying, "why don't we
just kill you if you do the honest thing"?
<p>
Now, to change any one piece of this without thinking through the change of
the whole piece doesn't get you anywhere.  So we have to start, I think, by
looking at four key realities which define any solution to the problems of
violence and poverty.  Reality one is that when individuals are caught
within a dysfunctional culture, they must transfer their loyalties,
beliefs, and behaviors to another culture to truly change their behavior.
This is why if you look at Al-Anon or Alcoholics Anonymous or any of those
programs, they are a conversion experience.  They say, yesterday I was an
active alcoholic.  Today I am a recovering alcoholic.  Yesterday when I
felt anxiety-ridden, I took a drink.  Today when I feel anxiety- ridden, I
go to my AA's meeting and talk to my friends, or I pray or I -- but there's
a conscious effort to rebuild the entire person and to recognize that the
transition from this system to another system is a decisive moment.
<p>
And if you don't have a support structure, if you don't have something
which helps you when you start to slide back, you're going to break down.
The folks at Covenant House, which is the leading Catholic program for
girls who have run away or who are pregnant, teenagers who need help, they
have arule that you have to work from day one.
<p>
They also talk about the inevitable Tuesday Syndrome, and they say what
happens to every person is there comes the Tuesday morning they don't want
to go to work.  Either they got in an argument with their boss or they
don't feel very good or they're just depressed or whatever.  That they
really need a hand that reaches out at that point and talks to them and
nurtures them and carries them across their depression.  Or they break down
and they leave.  And that that's the crisis.  They say that it's absolutely
inevitable, and almost always occurs on Tuesdays.  That they make it
through Monday on willpower, they've had the weekend off, but then Tuesday
morning, they just say, "I can't do it."
<p>
So what you're trying to do -- and I'll use this as -- the symbols mean
nothing.  I'm using a circle here.  I'll use a square here.  Okay -- is you
are literally saying to people, we want you to go from this holistic model
to this one.  Different culture and system in the two models.  In this one,
working is dumb.  In this one, working is good.  In this one, going to work
means you lose economically.  In this one, going to work means you win
economically.  Different culture, a different system.
<p>
To show you an example of that culture, Samuel Golden wrote a book about
growing up on the East Side.  And I just want to -- in terms of everything
you've heard about poor neighbors, poor problems, people who have
difficulties, this is his description of the turn of the century in New
York city in the poorest neighborhood.  Quote -- now, I want you to just
listen to the optimistic, positive tone of his description of exactly the
same neighborhood.  These both can occur at exactly the same income level.
Not a change in money.  Being without money and being poor are two
different things.  This is the core problem we're faced with because we
don't -- we have messed up these two distinctions.  This is what Samuel
Golden wrote about his childhood, "where else on earth among the poorest
people did you see in every home a blue and white box where you were
supposed to drop your pennies?  "once a week, an old woman would come
around and empty it, and off it would go somewhere overseas.  "the poorest
of the poor helping still poorer ones across the Atlantic somewhere.
"hundreds of sweat shop employees, men and women who sat at machines for
nine and 10 hours a day, came home, washed up, had supper, and went to the
lodge hall or settlement houses to learn English or to listen to a fellow
read poetry to them.  "paid readers of poetry.  "I saw it.  "I saw
gangsters and bums, but I also saw poets, settlement workers, welfare
workers, scribes, teachers, philosophers, all hoping and striving for one
goal, to break away.  "and they did too.  "America gave them all hope in
life, and they repaid America.  "there has never been a more even trade."
<p>
Now, he was talking about the same level of despair, the same level of
poverty, the same level of hopelessness, the same level of confusion, but
because it was optimistically oriented towards a better future, it changed.
He's talking about people who worked all day and then took a couple of
pennies, maybe an hour's work, to go and pay the poet reader to the
community center to take -- to give them part of their soul as well as
food.
<p>
This was the real world.  This is not mythical.  This is not some theory.
This was America at the turn of the century.  And I want to thank Kathleen
Minnix for finding that, because I really think it begins to make vivid the
healthy world of being without money which led to two generations of
strength, versus the unhealthy world of being without money which has led
to two generations of disaster.
<p>
But part of the reason I think that it's hard for us to really change
things is that we underestimate the second reality, cultural change is very
hard.  It requires tremendous persistence over time, and can often only be
achieved one person at a time.  I think part of what happens to us is we
say, "okay, I'm willing to do this for, like, up to a year and a half."
Well, at a year -- it's a little bit like a farmer who says, "I'll grow
corn as long as it makes it in three weeks.  "doesn't make it in three
weeks, I'm throwing that sucker out and replanting."
<p>
You know, the fact is, breaking through in a culture and getting people to
start dramatically changing their behavior and then getting to enough
individuals, because first what happens is you find one, and then two and
then three, and then they find one, and then gradually you begin to peel
away the whole culture.
<p>
The greatest study of this is the rise of the Wesleyan movement in Britain
in the 18th century, which changed the entire habit of the industrial poor.
And probably is the major reason Britain did not have a political
revolution in the 18th century.
<p>
But if you go back and look at the chapel movement of John Wesley and how
Methodism, as it was called, impacted on the English working poor, it is
astonishing, but it starts small, it's very frustrating, and it doesn't fit
either the news media or the government's need for instant gratification.
It's just very hard, very difficult work.
<p>
The third reality is that this kind of cultural change is best done outside
government.  And I would argue that with the exception of the military's
ability to have boot camp, there is virtually no government program that
gets the level of cultural change you need inside government for the very
reason that governments are very bad agencies of acculturation.
<p>
I mean, all of you would be furious if you had some bureaucrat trying to
acculturate you.  You'd say, wait a second, I pay taxes.  Who are you to
tell me whether I ought to be in the circle or the square?  Are you nuts?
You work for me.  I don't work for you.  And so you'd have a very hard time
ever getting an agreement for this kind of cultural change delivered by
government, and this kind of change requires missionaries.
<p>
This requires the person who sits there at 3:00 o'clock in the morning
holding the hand of the person who is about to commit suicide.  By
definition, I mean, you find wonderful government employees.  You find
people who are individually fabulous, but you can't recruit to a
bureaucracy on the premise you'll stay there as long as they need you.  You
can recruit to a volunteer organization on that premise.  Very different
models.
<p>
And so we sometimes get mad at the bureaucracy, because we ask it to do
things it can't do, instead of being more careful about what government can
do and what other sections can do.  I would argue that government and
politicians have found the first three realities unacceptable.  They have,
therefore, tried to find piecemeal short-term improvements that at least
meet their political needs and the public's desire to get something done.
<p>
So what you've had is, for 30 years now, a series of underfinanced,
short-sighted, small efforts to get one thing or another to work, when, in
fact, this requires a big effort.  You know, if you think back to our --
looking at the Normandy Invasion, 74 small invasions would not have added
up to Normandy.  Normandy required that you consolidate all the effort into
one massive, all-out effort.  This is the same way.  Having 74 different
tiny programs just means you've thrown the money away.  Doesn't mean you
can break through.  And what you have to have -- you can have a tiny
program, but the tiny program's goal has to be changing the whole thing.
It has to be to move people out of this culture and system into this one.
<p>
Which is the fourth reality, that the cultural change must be from one way
of life to another.  Individual changes within the old culture are often
overwhelmed by other aspects of the culture.  Now, this also means we're
saying something that would have been vehemently rejected 20 years ago.
We're saying, basically, that the culture of poverty and violence isn't
acceptable.  There are millions of Americans who live in that culture right
now, and what we're saying to them is, look, it is better to work than to
be dependent.  It is better to be safe than to be in danger.
<p>
Now, the word "better" is very argumentative.  I mean, who are we to start
imposing these what would once have been called middle class, bourgeois
virtues?  And the only good answer is, we have tried a technique of
allowing this to grow, and we can't stand what we see on television.  We
can't stand the pain we're inflicting on the children.  We can't stand the
4-year-old being thrown off the tenement house balcony.  And we just know
that's not right.  And so we have to reluctantly come back to finding some
way of saying, looking, there has to be an improvement.
<p>
Now, the encouraging thing, and this is -- this will surprise people who
are very tired of this, including people, frankly, who have what I would
call compassion exhaustion.  You know, people who have spent 20 years
trying to help, it's never quite worked, they're terribly disappointed.
They ought to be optimistic, and the reason is in America, very powerful
reform movements can emerge very quickly and have very powerful impact.
<p>
You can go from the Montgomery boycott of buses in 1955 to the civil rights
acts of 1964 and 1965 in 10 years and you get to a catalytic moment, you
suddenly begin to have real change real fast.  And you see this by looking
just back at the American history.  Great American reform movements
starting with the great awakening of the 1730s, which was a religious
revival, the revolutionary generation, the Jeffersonians, the Jacksonians,
the abolitionists and the founding of the Republican Party, the progressive
movement, almost every one of those was a 5- to 10- year cycle of beginning
to speed up and consolidate.
<p>
In the more modern era, you had the New Deal, which did most of its best
work in about five years.  The civil rights movement, the Goldwater- Reagan
conservatism, and now, we would argue, Renewing American Civilization.
That each of these are belief systems that emerge, they codify, people say,
"yeah, that's right," and with amazing speed, the country changes itself.
<p>
If you look at the rise of the Abolitionist movement and the Republican
Party, it literally goes from being a sort of fringe idea in the late 1840s
to a major idea by the early 1850s to this best-selling novel of the 19th
century, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," in the 1850s, which also then becomes a
widely seen play to the breakdown of the Whig Party, the creation of the
Republican Party, and the election of the first Republican president in a
six-year period.
<p>
That's how fast things can change when, in fact, you have people beginning
to make their minds up.  The way that has to happen, I think, at an
intellectual level, is you've got to go back to the model we've used before
of vision, strategies, projects, and tactics in order to replace the
culture of poverty and violence with a culture of productivity and safety.
<p>

Now, that is, you've got to think through, what's our vision of
replacement, what are our strategies for replacement, what are the projects
we think will work for replacement, and then what do we do every day to
make that happen.  However, when you think you know what you're doing and
you think you have thought this through, then you have to go out and
practice listen, learn, help, and lead in order to check out the ideas.
<p>
I mean, just because you think it's smart doesn't mean it's smart.  It
means you think it's smart.  Now, you've got to go test it out with lots of
other human beings.  And in particular, I would argue we should listen to
experts, experienced practitioners, and the poor themselves in order to
test out the ideas of replacement.  And I would argue this process should
be ongoing and should lead to Deming's concept of continuous improvement.
That every day we ought to be trying to do slightly better.
<p>
Now, notice the three groups I listed, experts, that is, people who study
it; experienced practitioners, that is, people who are living it.  So at
one level, you say, who are the best five college professors in America who
study missionary efforts among the poor?  But then it's pretty useful to go
out and findfive or 10 people who are missionary efforts among the poor.
Because it may well be as you listen to the actual practitioner, that their
experience is more complicated and more human and has a different quality
to it.
<p>
It's like talking to a football quarterback versus reading the "Sports
Illustrated" version.  Or talking to a gourmet chef and reading a good
cookbook.  Then, frankly, you need to sit down and listen to the poor for a
while.  Now, the poor are not definitive by definition, because the poor
are trapped in this culture.  And you're trying to describe a culture they,
by definition, don't -aren't in.  So they can't by themselves tell you
that's right or wrong, but they can raise a ton of questions and they can
tell you what doesn't seem right about it.  And they can force you to keep
thinking through your model.
<p>
Because remember, you're outside this world by definition.  Now, one or two
of you may have grown up in it and may well have grown out of it, in which
case you have a very useful ability to help, although even there you've got
to be very cautious, because sometimes the person who had the unique
personal strength to rise doesn't quite understand why their brothers and
sisters and cousins didn't make it.
<p>
So there's no -- this is not a simple thing.  I'm going back to what I said
a while ago, this is very hard.  We have failed at it because we keep
trying to reduce it to a level of simplicity that will make it easy.  It
isn't, and it won't be.
<p><PRE>
>>and on that note, how come the former poor aren't listed in that list of
>>people that we should listen to, people that have actually climbed out of
>>the system?

>>For the very reason I was giving, because unless they are in some way
>>actively engaged in helping the poor, they may have learned exactly the
>>wrong lessons, because they're learning lessons about very strong
>>personalities.   When you talk, for example, to somebody who says, "well,
>>I used to be an alcoholic but I woke up one morning, I quit." Any of you
>>who have ever been smokers who talked to somebody who said, "well, I just
>>quit"?  That person has a unique useful experience, but it may not be
>>very relevant to a more normal person for whom -- you know, for whom
>>breaking an addiction or breaking alcoholism or breaking the habits of
>>poverty and violence is a more formidable and more frightening challenge.
>>So they're useful to listen to.

>>I would argue that the unique experience is that of the person who broke
>>out, who's made good, who has developed a whole new set of --


>>Maybe.  I'm just saying to you that person may be helpful.  I'm not
>>against talking to them.  I would suggest to you that they probably come
>>under practitioners, because they've actually made it out.  But I
>>wouldn't automatically accept their view, because they may have such
>>unique personal strengths.  It's worth listening to them and it's worth
>>saying, now, how did it happen to you?  And what did you do?
</pre>
And I'm all -- I'm for that.  I work with a lot of people who fit that
category, but I wouldn't just accept them, because they very often are very
strong personalities.  They're very smart.  They have a lot -- they may
have had the one unique relative who helped them, okay?  What you're trying
to also figure out is, what about the ones who aren't as smart or they
don't have strong habits or they didn't have an aunt who raised them?
<p><PRE>
>>I think Arnold Schwarzenegger can literally do anything in the world that
>>he -- that he -- I mean, he has an amazing power of concentration.  That
>>doesn't mean everybody can come over from Austria, win a physique
>>contest, and take over Hollywood, right?

>>But I would argue that -- I would argue that not all people that climb
>>out of poverty have those unique traits.  Sometimes all it takes is just
>>integrity.  I mean --

>>no.

>>-- it doesn't take anything --

>>No, no.  Okay, I can't argue with you for very long, but individuals can
>>go from here to here because they're individuals.  And America's a
>>country where this happens every morning.  And by the way, it also goes
>>the reverse.  I mean, one of the things that's fascinating to study in
>>America is people slide out of success into having no money on a regular
>>basis.
</pre>
I mean, this is a country where people go bankrupt routinely, so you have
people - in any generation, you have some people who rise and some people
who fall and so forth.  That's -- what you're trying to do here, though, is
walk into a community and take 20,000 people in downtown Atlanta and figure
out, under what circumstances will we help them one by one move?
<p>
Now, it's useful to talk to people who have done it, and I think it's also
particularly useful to bring them back here.  I mean, one of the great
tragedies, frankly, is that when very successful people leave the inner
city, they won't go back.  It's a very real problem of getting them to come
back in and having them be witnesses who say, look, I made it.  You can
make it, too.  That's helpful.  But they may not fully understand the
complexity of helping a person who is weaker than they are, has less will
power than they do, and isn't just purely as intelligent.
<p>
In terms of making -- it wouldn't hurt to add them in here, but don't
overstate the ability of somebody like that in and of themselves to do it.
They're very helpful as witnesses more than they are, I think,
automatically as analysts.  Let me also suggest to you that the vision that
we want to establish is that every American is endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.  So it will seem obvious to you until you take
seriously every American.
<p>
But if we actually mean that sentence as our vision, it then has a second
sentence, we owe it to every American citizen to involve in a culture and a
system which ensures their god-given rights and responsibilities as full
citizens.
<p>
Now, again, the key here is "every American." We all sort of say it, well,
of course that's true.  Ah, but are we determined to -- are we really
determined to live it out?  Are we really determined to say every child
born in 1995 should absolutely grow up in that kind of framework?  That's a
big order.
<p>
Now, I think it leads you to three really simple principles that are the
visionary principles, every citizen is an American, every neighborhood is
part of America, and every child is an American child.  But the minute you
accept that, then you have to say to yourself, wow, this is a big
challenge.  And you can't avoid it.  Because every time a child dies for
lack of prenatal care or a child gets killed in a drive-by shooting or a
child ends up in a room where they're not going to learn anything, we have
failed in our vision-level commitment that every American has the right to
pursue happiness.
<p><PRE>
>>so what you're saying, in essence, the difference between one culture --
>>I mean, one culture together is more responsibilities.  Over here you're
>>giving them their rights to have those, but over here --

>>No, not just responsibility.  What we have done is we have basically cut
>>a deal with the poor.  We said, starting in the late 1960s, we'll
>>maintain you.  We'll send you money.  Now, being selfish middle-class
>>people, we never sent enough money, but the theory was, we'll send money.
>>We won't demand you change your behavior.  You want to have your kids
>>born in total ignorance?  Hey, it would be inappropriate for us to
>>interfere.  You want to go to a local school that doesn't work?  Well, at
>>least it's not a school we send our kids to.
</pre>
So we'll give lip service to changing it, but the truth is, we won't change
it.  We'll just have study commissions that will say, yes, they should do
better.  And the result is what you have allowed to happen over a 30 --
what we have all allowed to happen over a 30-year period, is these people
don't have -- they do not have what the declaration of independence
guarantees them.
<p>
Now, to do that, you've got to, for example, reestablish safety.  Any
American who's physically threatened is being cheated of the constitutional
provision to provide for the common security.  Because danger can be
domestic as well as foreign.  I mean, I swear to uphold the constitution
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  Well, if it's a person walking
into your room to kill you, whether that person's wearing a foreign uniform
or blue jeans, your rights as an American are about to be exterminated.
<p>
So you have to start with the idea, are we prepared to protect you
physically?  How much are we prepared to protect you physically?  When
you're born, do we want to encourage a system where you actually have --
where your mother has a sense of responsibility?  There you're right; there
you start getting into responsibility.  But do we also want to figure out
some way to make sure that health care is nearby if your mother's willing
to be responsible?  When you show up for school the first time, should it
actually be a room where you might learn?  Does that matter?
<p>
I mean, these are -- by the time you start thinking through how the system
works and how today we coerce people into monopolies that fail, you will
live in public housing, you will go to the public school, you will be on
streets that are unsafe.  Gee we're really sorry, but after all, life's
hard.  You know, there's a huge, huge change from here to here.
<p>
This is, again, one of the things we keep kidding ourselves about.  If you
truly want healthy inner cities, if you truly want healthy Indian
reservations and you truly want healthy West Virginia Appalachian poor
neighborhoods, you're talking about a big change.  This is not a small
change.  This is one of the largest changes in American history.  And we
just don't take it seriously.  We pay lip service to it, and then we say
-then we walk off and then the kid gets killed and then we say, "gee,
that's sad."
<p>
And what I'm suggesting is, if we take that child seriously as an American
and we take the declaration seriously as a document and the constitution
and then we decide in our generation we're fed up with it and we're going
to actually shoulder the responsibility as a country, all of us, including
the poor, of making the transition, we're taking on a big challenge.  Maybe
in some ways as big as the Cold War.  It's not going to be a small thing
and it's not going to happen overnight.
<p>
Now, I think that to understand our strategies of replacement, we must
revisit the five pillars of American Civilization.  We have to look at the
historic lessons of American Civilization.  We have to look at personal
strength, at entrepreneurial free enterprise, at the spirit of invention
and discovery, and at quality as defined by Edwards Deming.
<p>
Now, I can give this lecture this time totally different, or not --
dramatically different.  I won't say totally, I'll say 60% different than a
year ago because of the help of several people, and the first one I want to
thank is Marvin Olasky.  This is "the Tragedy of American Compassion." It
is the book which, frankly, for me, unlocked the key to how to do this, and
I think it is one of the most extraordinary books written in our
generation.  Olasky went back, and you'll understand my bias in a second, I
mean -- and by the way, I want to thank Marvin Olasky, because he helped
write this -- today's session and was very generous in giving his time and
outlining how he would approach it.  What he did -- and this fits my bias
as a history teacher -- he went back and looked at 350 years of how
Americans dealt with poverty, tragedy, and addiction with much greater
success than the current welfare state.
<p>
When you begin to read his book, those of you who are not used to reading
lots of history, you're going, why does he have me in the founding of the
colonies?  And why does he start here at the very beginning with Jamestown
and with the early American model of compassion?  Now, when he says early
American model on page 6, he's talking about Plymouth in 1620.  I mean,
he's really gone back and you're kind of going, why am I reading this?  He
talks about Fairfield, Connecticut, in 1673.  But what he shows you chapter
by chapter is a consistency about how Americans thought about poverty and
how they thought about helping the poor that is astonishing.  What the
traditional reformers warned against is precisely what the welfare state
did, and when you read Olasky, you realize that based on American history,
the welfare state is virtually a design for guaranteed failure.
<p>
I mean, I found -- I read this over Christmas at my mother-in-law's, and I
found myself so startled by the warnings.  Let me give you an example,
"Mary Richmond of the Baltimore charity organizing society summed up in
1897 the wisdom of a century of work, quote - - and I want you to think
about this in terms of the system your taxes pay for today.  Quote, relief
given without reference to friends and neighbors is accompanied by moral
loss.  Poor neighborhoods are doomed to grow poorer whenever the natural
ties of neighborliness are weakened by well meant, but unintelligent
interference.  Let me go back to the key sentence, "relief given without
reference to friends and neighbors is accompanied by moral loss."
<p>
Now, what is the very definition of AFDC, food stamps, et cetera?  An
anonymous person walks into an anonymous office to deal with an anonymous
bureaucrat to have an anonymous transaction.
<p><PRE>
>>faceless bureaucratic --

>>right?  You have the faceless poor and the faceless bureaucrat engaged in
>>a faceless interaction.  By con --

>>there's also a lack of accountability on their part, because --

>>Right, totally.  But it also leads to a depersonalization that's
>>devastating.  Here's what the magazine "American Hebrew" in 1898 wrote
>>about how one man was sunk into dependency, but a volunteer, quote, with
>>great patience, convinced him that he must earn his living.  Soon he did
>>and regained the respect of his family and community.  A woman who had
>>become demoralized but, quote, for months she was worked with.  Now
>>through kindness, again through discipline, until finally she began to
>>show a desire to help herself, close quote.
</pre>
I mean, imagine the average caseworker with 200 families on their caseload
trying to deal in this kind of intense relationship.  It states further,
quote, intelligent giving -- this is the New Orleans charity organization
society of 1899 -intelligent giving and intelligent withholding are alike
true charity.  Now, imagine saying to your local welfare office,
intelligent giving and intelligent withholding are alike true charity.  Or
saying at the same time, quote, if drink has made a man poor, money will
feed not him, but his drunkenness.  We send supplemental security -- just
think about it.  We send supplemental security insurance checks to
alcoholics and addicts.  Let me repeat the quote from the new Orleans
charity organization, 18 -- if drunk -- if drink has made a man poor, money
will feed not him but his drunkenness.  Poverty fighters a century ago
trained volunteers to leave behind, quote, a conventional attitude toward
the poor, seeing them through the comfortable haze of our own intentions.
<P>
I mean, one of the things that comes through the Olasky book again and
again is there are many poor people who will game the system.  When you let
them game the system, you are helping them destroy themselves.  You have an
obligation to love them enough to be firm with them, not just to love them
enough to give.
<P>
Barriers against fraud were important not only to prevent waste, but to
preserve morale among those who were working hard to remain independent.
And I want you to think about this quote and what happened to poor
Americans in the last 30 years.  Quote, nothing is more demoralizing to the
struggling poor than the successes of the indolent.  In other words, if
you're a working poor and you get up every day and you go to a job that
isn't all that much fun and you're out there trying very hard to make a
decent living and your cousin is sitting at home doing nothing, drinking
every night, and getting as much money as you are, the moral devastation as
you try to teach your children to follow your path of sobriety and hard
work while your cousin makes fun of you every day for being stupid, when you
could be gaming the system.
<P>
Okay?  Saying -- it was an important quote, and I want you to listen to
this.  This is a very harsh quote, and I want you to think about all the
nice people you know who have automatically given money to the homeless.
It was important to, quote, reform those mild, well-meaning,
tender-hearted, sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging in
indiscriminate charity.
<P>
This was a reformer of the late 19th century.  New York charity leader
Josephine Lowell said, quote, the problem before those who would be
charitable is not how to deal with a given number of the poor.  It is how
to help those who are poor without adding to their numbers and constantly
increasing the evils they seek to cure.  And what the modern welfare said
is, we're not going to worry about that.  Anybody who shows up, take care
of them, here's the money, and the result was a system which has been, in
human terms, devastating.
<P>
And again, Olasky's "he Tragedy of American Compassion" is far and away the
best single statement of this I've read and is -- I think a work of epoch.
I mean, it will change the whole way we think about this.  Now, for 350
years, reformers had a remarkably similar set of requirements and judgments
about how to help the poor and the addicted and what would actually hurt
rather than help, and it's very important to look at the lessons they set
up and the codification, which we'll come back to, which Olasky made of
them.
<P>
The lessons of American history are, one, we should expect the welfare
state to fail.  Two, there is an historically proven model of American
success with which we can replace the current failure.
<P>
Now, let's move then -begin to look at that, and if you'd look at pillar
two, which is personal strength, we're going to come right back to Olasky.
There are three key aspects of personal strength in replacing the culture
of poverty and violence.  One, there are seven characteristics of personal
strength the traditional reformers understood and applied.  This is the
Olasky model.  Two, personal strength is ultimately spiritual, and
therefore private rather than governmental.  And, three, compassion
requires your personal strength more than your money.  And I'm going to
come back to that one, because it will put a little burden on all of us.
<P>
Interestingly, Olasky said that the seven characteristics the 19th century
reformers put together were from "a" to "g," and that they codified them
that way.  They said that you can literally set up a list of steps from "a"
to "g" in how you think about helping the poor.  "a" is for affiliation.
Who is there out there who knows something about this person?  Who can you
-- do they have a friend?  Do they have a family?  Do they have a neighbor?
Who can rebond with them as a human being, which is what "b" is.
<P>
"b" is for bonding.  That if you decide you have to help this person
because nobody they're affiliated with is helping them, then you need to
have one person who truly gets to know them.  And according to Olasky, in
the 19th century, we averaged one volunteer for every two poor people.  We
didn't just take your tax money and say, "stay home, the welfare worker
will take care of them." We said -- and I'm going to come back to this --
"if you truly care, find somebody and help them," and the result was the
average poor person knew a middle-class person.  There was a relationship.
We broke down the barriers.
<P>
"c" is for categorization, things like using work tests and background
checks to distinguish.  For example, they routinely required everybody to
work before they got fed.  If you were homeless and you showed up at the
door, you had to cut wood, and you usually cut wood both for yourself and
you cut wood for a widow woman, because you ought to have dignity.  If you
were a woman and you showed up, they often had a sewing room very often
next to a nursery area so there was a place where you could watch your
children while you did work.  But their principle was if you're not
prepared to do some work, you're a bum.  Why are we feeding you?
<P>
Now, a bum, I realize, is a politically incorrect term that will soon rival
giraffe and other things, but I want you to think about it.  I mean, you go
through Olasky's book and over and over, they're prepared to categorize
people, and they say to them, you want to help yourself, we'll be partners.
You don't want to help yourself, I owe you nothing.  And again, I mean,
try sometime walking through a major city and every homeless person that
walks up to them and say, "I will give you $20 if you'll work for me for
one hour" and just see what their reaction is.  Say, "I'm glad your here.
"I have a job right this minute.  "let's go.  "I'll pay you 20 bucks." Now,
if they won't do it, why are you giving them a penny?  What is your
obligation to subsidize their addiction?  And in fact, isn't that the least
caring thing you could do?  Let me get you off my mind.  I'll feel better,
you'll get -- you'll get whatever drug you use.  The fact that you may die
isn't my problem.  I did my thing.  I gave you money.  I'm a good person.
<P>
And the reformers of the 19th century drove at that attitude very hard and
said, that is false charity.  That makes you feel good.  It does not help
the person.  It's what Morris schechtman describes in "working without a
net" as caretaking rather than caring.  The caretakers feel kind, fine
about themselves.  I did a good thing.  The person they supposedly cared
for may die.  It's not my fault.
<P><PRE>
>>but you may die in the process, too, because, I mean, there's been so
>>many incidents of taking poor people, knocking on your door, asking for
>>work, and then the next thing they do is kill you and rob you.

>>they have some instances of that, but I would argue for most of us, we
>>could find ways to help the poor that don't run that risk. I didn't
>>suggest you take them home necessarily.

>>well, no, they knock on your door all the time, but, you know, you're
>>hesitant to let them in because of personal safety and the safety of your
>>family.

>>yeah.  There's some of that.

>>that's not the only element that we see in the inner city, and the
>>question is this, because what we're talking about's great in theory, but
>>because we're an incentive, motivated civilization --

>>why don't you let me finish?

>>I'm sorry.

>>Yeah, that's right.  "d" is for discernment, and discernment is learning
>>how to say "no" in the short run so as to produce better results.  It's
>>literally saying there are times you deliberately turn people down
>>because you're trying to get a lesson across, you're trying to show them
>>a different way of thinking.
</pre>
"e" is for employment.  They required work from every able-bodied person,
period.  They thought it was inherent in being a human being.
<p>
"f" is for freedom.  In their mind, once you got into government programs,
you were enslaved.  And so they worked very, very hard to help people
remain free in a way that was powerful and effective.
<p>
And finally, "g" is for God.  That all of these -- all of the systems
emphasized the spiritual, not just the material and said, you know, I mean,
if you have no relationship -- if you have no spiritual -- they didn't
necessarily emphasize a particular sect, but they said, if you don't pray,
you have no spiritual life, you have no sense of a larger being than
yourself, why shouldn't you be an addict?
<p>
I mean, look how bleak your world is.  And so there was a constant -- so if
you take those seven, and let me just reread them for one second, because I
do think they're useful just as a set, affiliation, bonding,
categorization, discernment, employment, freedom, and god were the core of
this.  Now, compare the Olasky seven with the principles of the welfare
state: affiliation versus isolated individualism.  Bonding versus
impersonal bureaucracy.  Categorization versus automatic maintenance.  Just
look at those to start with.  In the 19th century, we said, who are you
related to?  In the 20th century, you say, oh, that would be an
inappropriate question.  After all, it's not the bureaucracy's business.
Do you need a check or not?  In the 19th century, we would have said, we
are going to have a personal relationship, and we are going to try to help
you and we're going to get to know each other.  In the 20th century, the
bureaucrat has 200 families.  They can't possibly get to know people
individually.  In the 19th century, there was a very deliberate
categorization, are you really capable of working?  Should you really be
helped?  What kind of help should you get?  How can we get you back on your
feet?  In the 20th century, you deserve AFDC, you deserve food stamps.  Who
are we to interfere?  And again, the government can't interfere at this
level, because you'd have to be setting up virtually a dictatorship.
<p>
There are other standards.  Look at discernment versus automatic sympathy,
or employment versus no work requirement.  Freedom versus dependence, or
god versus indifference at best, or hostility at worst, to religion and
spirituality.  I mean, this gets so bad, Olasky tells a story of spending
some time in Washington as a homeless person and ending up in a church
basement at a breakfast looking like a homeless person; he'd spent three or
four days on the street.  And he mumbled to the young lady who was serving
breakfast could he have a bible?  And she said, "do you want a bagel?  "we
have a bagel." He said, "no, no." He said, "I want a bible." And she said,
"we don't have any bibles here." This was in the basement of a church.
<p>
But he said in the entire time he was homeless in Washington, there were
plenty of places to sleep, plenty of places to eat, plenty of clothing.  He
did not once have a person talk to him about his spiritual life, about the
need to somehow be saved from what he was going through, or about the
notion that god mattered.  Even though a great deal of the time he was in
religious institutions, but they thought -- they had broken down so far
from their traditional mission that they thought as long as they fed you,
it didn't matter.
<p>
Now, just take those differences and then -- and then recognize that we're
talking about two very different systems.  The one system says, you're an
isolated individual.  We will pay for an impersonal bureaucracy.  It will
automatically maintain you.  If you have a good sob story, we'll
automatically sympathize with you.  We would never dream of requiring you
to work.  We expect you to become dependent.  And your spiritual life is
your own problem, and of course, we're not going to talk to you about it.
<p>
The other model says, we believe you're part of some kind of extended
affiliation with other human beings.  We want to bond with you as a human
being.  We want to understand your problems enough to help you solve your
unique problems.  We're prepared to be very tough-minded with you, because
we actually like you enough to say "no" to you.  We're going to require
that you work so you have a sense of dignity.  We're going to emphasize the
importance of your remaining free and not becoming dependent.  And we
believe that your spiritual life is as important as your physical life.
<p>
Now, it's -- what I said earlier about holistic, it's pretty hard to get a
broader gap in the two models at the core of the two cultures.  And then,
of course, you start building a system that reflects the cultural values.
So we've built a government structure that punishes work, that gives away
money automatically in an anonymous manner.
<p>
But if you're going to change the values, then you've got to shift the
whole structure.  Because one of the arguments of the reformers is if you
create an anonymous way for people to maintain themselves as they decay, a
significant number of people will do just that.  Because to be changed is
hard.  And again, I can't overstate this.  None of the reformers believed
this was easy.  And they all said, if you create in here a center of public
support that makes it easy to avoid change, people will simply destroy
themselves.  They won't automatically change.  People only change when, in
fact, they have very few choices.  And so you've got to decide whether or
not you're willing to toleratethe cost of allowing people to continue to
decay.
<p>
The essence of the Olasky model is that personal strength is inherently
spiritual and explains why private charities rather than governments must
be the primary helpers of the poor.  That if, in fact, you're really going
to have the level of personal involvement we're talking about, first of
all, you could never hire enough bureaucrats to do it.  You have to have
volunteers.  Second, you have to have a voluntary relationship, because the
government represents power on such a scale that if you gave the government
this kind of power, you'd be creating a potential dictatorship.
<p>
So you can't afford to have a government that can interfere in your private
life on this scale.  It would be intolerable.  So if you're going to have
people who are actually out here being that detailed in their interest in
your life, it had better be private sector and you'd better have the option
to say "no." Now, when you say "no," there's a consequence.  They don't
have to give you food.  They don't have to nurture you.  You'd better go
find somebody else to play your game with.  But it's a very, very different
model.
<p>
Lastly, what it says in terms of you as a healthy person with a pretty good
life, your personal strength is more important than your money.  That what
the system really needs is not another $100 billion, it needs about 50
million Americans who are willing to do something as a human being.  But
that enough -- enough Americans who are healthy, who are work-oriented, who
do have pretty good habits, enough Americans willing to reach out and just
help one person.
<p>
Don't try to save Atlanta or don't try to save Washington or don't try to
save Waleska.  Try to save one person.  That the difference you can make in
that process is enormous.  Now, if you save one person, then hopefully,
you'll go on to another person, and you'll challenge the one you saved when
they're on their feet that they'll help somebody, too.  Because what you
began to build was an extended chain of goodwill, where people felt, look,
people helped me when I was young.  I'd better help somebody else.  I will
repay.
<p>
Remember the way Golden described it.  He said, "America gave them all hope
and life, and they repaid America.  "there has never been a more even
trade." And so in a sense, if everybody who is well -- doing well would
then say, "I'll help somebody, but then when I help you, you help
somebody," you create a gradually -- a pretty rapidly expanding cavalcade
of people helping each other.  Okay?  Comments, questions.
<PRE>
>>okay, well, let's go back to this one.  If we are incentive- based, what
>>is the possible incentive for these inner city kids to lay down their
>>guns and their drugs for the money that they're making?  I mean, here
>>we're going to go and offer them an eight- hour-a-day job where they can
>>make three times as much --

>> sure.

>>-- selling horse on the concord.

>>a, they won't die.  B, shame beats cash.

>>we don't --

>>No, but that's the point.  That's why you make the transition.  I mean,
>>read the life of Malcolm X.  I mean, it's -- one morning people say -- I
>>mean, this is what Adam Smith meant when he talked about the man in the
>>mirror in the theory of moral sentiments.  Inside all of us, except the
>>most psychotic -- I mean, there are some people who are psychotics.
>>Those people you frankly just lock up for life.  That's the lesson of
>>"the Silence of the Lambs," is that the doctor who ate people should not
>>have been let out.  It was a bad decision.  Okay?  Hannibal Lechter,
>>right?  And, yes, it is true, I am for the death penalty for Hannibal
>>Lechter, if they ever capture him.
</pre>
The point here is, one, most human beings have an internal compass.  What
Smith said was the man in the mirror, the woman in the mirror.  When you
look in the mirror, are you really happy being that person?  Two, you want
to raise the disincentive for illegal behavior.  You want to make it
dramatically harder to sell drugs and to get away with those kind of
things.  But, three, most -- I mean, mostgirls don't turn to prostitution
even though it pays.  Most kids -- most young men don't turn to
drug-running even though it pays.
<P>
Even in the poorest neighborhoods in America, there is a minority doing bad
things.  In the poorest neighborhood, the vast majority of people are
decent people, who want a chance to earn a living, who want self-respect,
and who want to live as a neighborhood, and so what you've got to do is
reestablish the legitimacy and the authenticity.  And what somebody said
the other day is "reestablishing shame." I mean, you can turn to somebody
who is staggering down the street as a drunk and say, that is shameful.
You shouldn't let your children see you like that.  You've begun to make
the transition from this to this, and in a sense, at one level, I
deliberately used a square, because, of course, this was a joke in the '50s
and early '60s to be square, and what turned out to not be square may mean
doing other things that hurt.  But we'll be back in about 10 minutes, I
reckon.  I'm told we have to take a break or they'll yell at us.
<P><PRE>
>>We're going to pick back up now with how you replace the culture of
>>poverty and violence with a culture of prosperity and safety.  And
>>working our way through the five pillars that are at the heart of
>>American Civilization, we're on pillar three, which is entrepreneurial
>>free enterprise.
</pre>
And again, if you think about everything we talked about when we spent two
hours on entrepreneurial free enterprise, it won't surprise you that almost
by definition, a decentralized, entrepreneurial system will be inherently
more effective than a centralized government bureaucracy.  Now, on the
surface, people will read that and they'll say, "well, yeah, we know that's
true."  That if you have lots of small units each operating on their own,
if they have entrepreneurial incentives and if they have entrepreneurial
leaders who are out there trying to get the job done, it will do better
than a large bureaucratic structure managed by 9:00 to 5:00 bureaucrats.
<P>
People say, "yeah, that's true," and then you say, "okay, so what are we
going to do now? " And the answer is, well, build a bigger bureaucracy, and
there is a huge -- it's called cognitive dissonance.  There is a breakdown
where everything says we ought to go over and do this, but we find
ourselves going over here, and so it's a major problem in, how do you break
down.
<P>
And it's very -- I find it -- if it weren't so tragic and if it wasn't
costing human beings their lives and if it wasn't allowing people literally
to be betrayed and left behind unnecessarily, I think it would be
hysterically funny.
<P>
Now, again, the example I'm going to give you is one we've talked about for
two years.  It absolutely works.  We all know it works.  It actually
changes peoples lives, it actually saves the taxpayer money, and it is
almost impossible to get the government to be willing to use it, because it
eliminates one of the government's functions.  And this is a
private-sector, entrepreneurial model of helping the poor developed by two
former social workers who decided that the social work system they were
engaged in was doomed to fail, and they wanted to design a model to
actually transform people.  This is not a theory.  This is a real program.
It's in New York.  Its called "America Works," and I want you to take a
couple minutes and just take a look at "America Works."

The whole -what about if you said that to schools?  I recently suggested
that all the remedial work in college ought to be charged to the public
school system that failed to do it.  I mean, why are we paying on
achievement?

>>are you suggesting that we provide some incentive for the government to

>>Yeah, I'm suggesting that incentive -- in fact, it's a very simple
>>phrase, to go back to something you'd asked about earlier.  I'm
>>suggesting that incentives work.  And we think that incentives, in fact
>>-- but incentives at every level and again, you've got to think this
>>through.  This is why it is a cultural change.  Okay?  The people who

>>they put 10,000 people a year at work instead of a thousand, guess what's
>>going to happen to the two founders?

>>They're going to be rich, which means, of course, they'll be
>>inappropriate.  You know, they're not being good social workers.  Good
>>social workers are grateful for their underpaid job and would not dream
>>of being entrepreneurially responsible.  So when they drive in their
>>Mercedes or their Lexus back to see their friends on their way to their
>>place up in the Adirondacks, they will be socially deviant, because
>>they'll be running a business.  But if that business actually saves the
>>people that this system has simply maintained in decay, which is a better
>>human program?  It takes a whole different mind set.
</pre>
Notice also who takes the risk.  They keep the person on their payroll the
first four months.  So they're going to a business and saying, you get to
try this person out for four months.  You pay us.  You don't have to fire
this person.  You don't get any lawsuit.  This is designed to get around
lawsuits.  If you don't like this person on Thursday afternoon, they will
not show up on Friday morning, because they stay on our payroll.  So they
can go to the business.  They have lowered the risk of hiring the
marginally unemployed.  They're now walking in and saying, "hi."  Remember
the ladies you're talking about here.  15 years on welfare.  Now she's
going to go for first time and show up and work?  You're the average
employer?  This person has not been at work in 15 years, in fact, since
ninth grade, so she may never have been at work.  She's now showing up at,
you know, 32, 33 years of age saying, "hi, I'm ready"?
<P>
Well, what "America Works" does is they internalize to them the risk of
putting this lady at work.  So the business has a much lower threshold of
risk so it can gamble bigger, but they've thought through an entire system,
which fits this model.
<P>
And the thing I've been fascinated by is, it has not led 50 states and the
district of Columbia to automatically set up a similar incentive program.
They just don't get it.  I mean, they say, "well, I understand all that,
but here's how we operate."  It's just astonishing to me.  And that's why I
say generically, incentives work in America.  And if you don't -- if you
see a program that doesn't have an incentive, you ought to ask yourself why
it thinks it's working, and then you ought to check to see if it is.  And
what you'll find is it's usually very inefficient, it usually achieves far
below what it claims, because this is a society drawn forward by
incentives.
<P>
One of the projects we developed in order to test out this theory was a
program called Earning by Learning.  It's a project we designed to
implement a strategy to fulfill a vision.  Our vision is that every child
should know about free enterprise, should have a chance to earn a living,
and should know about reading and writing.  We wanted to set up a strategy
of saying, let's move towards an inventive-based model that combines free
enterprise and education in the same model, and the specific project we
designed was what's called Earning by Learning.
<P>
Earning by Learning is a model where we go into public housing projects or
public schools and we say to second and third graders who are likely not to
learn how to read, "we'll pay you $2. 00 a book for every book you read in
the summertime."  We just announced it, in fact, this week at Moten Middle
School in Washington, D. C. , where we're going to be doing it.  We use
adult volunteers, so there's no bureaucracy.  We use public library books
or public school books, so there's no capital investment.  The only money
that goes in is to the kids.  We use a room which is made free either by
the school or by the housing project.
<P>
And one of the reasons I became, frankly, a revolutionary was we went into
Douglas county and we went to a public housing project, and 8-year- old
kids said to us, "you're going to cheat us."  And we said, "what? " Just
regular old kids.  They said, "you're going to get us to read all summer,
and then you won't pay us."  Now, two things happened.  The first was I
decided if we're losing them at 8, if they're already so cynical at 8 they
just assume we're lying to them, we're in big trouble.  This is a huge
cultural crisis and requires a revolutionary response.  It requires a
replacement response, not, let's have a smaller circle or a slightly
different circle.  Let's get rid of this culture of poverty and violence
and get to one you can trust and that is decent.
<P>
But second, in Douglas county, we said, "fine.  "we won't ask you to trust
us.  "we'll pay you every week."  And what happened was every week, they
increased the number of kids who were reading.  Because when the ice cream
truck arrived, the kids who had money to buy ice cream were standing there,
their friends would come over and say, "how come you have money? " They go,
"well, I read, you know."
<P>
Now, I want you to think about the health of a notion that says, you should
be proud of yourself and you have some little cash in your pocket because
you're a reader, versus this system where there's no incentive, no sense of
dignity, no sense of resources, no chance to become a customer.
<P>
We also found, a little bit to our surprise, that these are actually pretty
smart kids.  When they'd earn 30 or $40, they'd mostly buy clothing.  The
number one expenditure was back-to-school clothing.
<P><PRE>
>>on the other hand, how did you confirm that they were reading to teach them --
>>You had adult volunteers who went in who made them answer questions about
>>their books.  Now, Moten middle school has gone a stage beyond me.
>>They're tied into a program from Indianapolis which is a computer reading
>>program where the computer asks you the questions and you actually take a
>>computerized test, and the computer's programmed to ask questions about
>>7,000 different titles.  It's pretty amazing.
</PRE>
I watched a couple kids taking the test.  And so the kid gets this sense
of, hey, they're just like all those fancy middle-class kids because
they're sitting right here at their computer in their school and they're
working on a computer, and you have to be able to read to use the computer.
And the computer's asking them whether or not they took the -- whether or
not they read the book, so they've got to get five questions right about
the book in order to pass the test.
<P>
<pre>
>>they're getting several layers of lessons there.

>>Right, and they're being taught free enterprise.  It's okay to work.
>>It's okay to make money.  It's okay to do it honestly.  You actually
>>improve yourself while you're working.  Because you can become more
>>literate.  And we give them a big incentive.  I mean, if you read at $2.
>>00 a book, our top reader read 83 books and earned $166.  She was an
>>8-year-old girl in villa Rica, Georgia.  Her dad took a day off of work
>>just to protect her, because we paid her on graduation day, and, I mean,
>>she got $166 in cash as an 8-year-old.
</pre>
It's just -- but I'm trying to give you just a sense of a different -- a
totally different model.  The principles of Earning by Learning are, first,
that incentives work.  Second, that poor children are smart in practical
ways.  You've got to let them grow.  You've got to give them a chance.
And, third, that money is a powerful incentive.  Now, this, by the way -- I
get in amazing arguments with people who are more traditional folks who
say, "oh, gee, isn't it sad you have to give them an incentive."  And then
I say, "well, now, if you're middle class, did your child have any
incentive if they got straight A's?  "did you reward them in any way if
they did really well? " "oh, yeah, of course I did, yeah."
<P>
What's the difference?  It's okay -- but they don't get the idea that if
you -- that if you have in this model of the welfare state no incentives,
why would you expect people to behave in positive ways?  In addition, the
principles of Earning by Learning include that a social good, learning, can
be reinforced by a personal good, earning, and that people given a good
idea will voluntarily follow up on their own, but can be held by a
supportive rather than controlling structure.
<P>
In other words, that you can get into an approach where you help people
learn how to do it, you give them good tips, you encourage them, but you
don't have a bureaucracy that micromanages and has reports and tries to
look over their shoulder.  The central theory is that efficiency in a
democracy is very hard, but effectiveness is pretty easy.  And I'm going to
draw that distinction for a second.  And, frankly, persistence,
persistence, persistence.
<P>
Let me draw a distinction between efficiency and effectiveness.  I don't
know an efficient way to arouse 35 million volunteers.  But I know if we
could inefficiently get 35 million volunteers helping the poor, we'd begin
to mop up the problem.  Because even though they would individually be
inefficient, the collective weight of that many people helping on the
weekend, helping in the evenings, talking about it in their church or
synagogue, talking about it over lunch at work, the sheer human energy
involved would mop up the problem, even though it would be very
inefficient.
<P>
And I would argue that's how democracies work.  They're not necessarily
efficient.  Dictatorships are more efficient.  They're just not very
effective.  But what democracies do, they mobilize so much energy, they
arouse so much excitement, that they are able to overcome their
inefficiency by their enthusiasm.  And again, that it takes tremendous
persistence.  None of this is going to happen without a level of
persistence that it's hard to normally get, and that's why when you --
remember I listed the reform movements?
<P>
What happens is in a period of a reform movement, you have an explosion of
energy, a sense that you've got to change things, a tremendous commitment
to do something, the invention of a whole new series of structures and
systems and habits.  They change things dramatically, and then they leave
behind at the end of the decade systems that are new and more effective
than the ones that they replaced.  You see this happen again and again in
American society over the last 300 years.
<P>
Earning by Learning, for example, just out of our speeches and things, is
now in 17 states.  It originally started with Dr.  Mel Steely at West
Georgia college and myself, and we ran the entire project, with Mel getting
a very tiny amount of money, working part-time out of his home, and I'd
wander around the country and make speeches, and people would call them and
he'd then send them a package of material, and they would then say "well,
this is all exciting," and it works.  It's a remarkable system.
<P>
Now, we have a foundation, and Don Jones of Wisconsin is organizing it,
working with the Library of Congress.  It's the Earning by Learning
foundation, and it's easy to call.  People can call 1-800-214-earn.
<P>
And for example, Governor Roehmer's wife in Denver is now going to be
actively leading an Earning by Learning program this summer.  He's a
Democratic governor of Colorado.  In Cabrini Green, one of the biggest
housing projects in America in Chicago, they're going to have an Earning by
Learning program this summer.  As I said, at Moten Middle school in
Washington, they're going to have Earning by Learning, so this is an idea
that we're continuing to push, to evolve, to grow.
<P>
Take a look at, for a minute, at "earn to learn," which is one of the
particular TV coverages of this concept
<P><PRE>
>>the earn to learn program provides students with an incentive to read.
>>Second and third graders read a book and write star reports.  Then give
>>an oral report to dealership employees.  Students and volunteers discuss
>>the book title, author, central theme, characters, and favorite passages.
>>The volunteer then signs the student's reading record, entitling second
>>graders to earn 25 cents per book and third graders, 50 cents per book.
</pre>
Texas Commerce Bank provided, free of charge, savings accounts for all
students participating in the earn to learn program.  Account books are
kept at school, and each child is responsible for recording deposits and
maintaining their account balance.  The result is a program that teaches
the students a connection between learning and earning, a tangible reality
in our adult world.
<pre>
>>and so far, I have read about between 20 and 30 books for the earn to
>>learn program.

>>Mike Smith and C.  W.  Kahn of Kahn's appliances, the school's business
>>in education partner, presented the program to Betty Cooper, Lucas
>>Elementary School principal.

>>Betty Cooper: and it sound like a good idea, but we didn't know it was so
>>much work involved, getting the bank statements set up and all the things
>>that we had to do.  We got permission from our school district, and
>>everything went well.  And I guess the best part about all of this was
>>when Mr..  Smith said that he would, in turn, give us the tools for the
>>program so that we wouldn't have to take any of the teachers or
>>volunteers from any other program to do this.

>>Mike Smith committed to the earn to learn program even before he had a
>>chance to talk to his employees about it, but the worthiness of the
>>program was plain to see, and since October, more than 80% of the
>>employees at Mike Smith auto plaza have volunteered to participate in
>>earn to learn.

>>Betty Cooper: we have approximately eight to nine tutors per Tuesday to
>>come out and listen to the children read, and the kids have really
>>enjoyed it.

>>well, I think they do it because they love children and they want us to
>>learn.

>>I leave here every time I come with such a peaceful feeling, and can't
>>wait to come back the next time.

>>George Mulkey: when we first started this program, Mike set it up where
>>we come mainly every six to seven weeks, and I find myself coming every
>>week now because I've gotten so close to the children.  I see the
>>benefits in the future of the children by watching them grow week in and
>>week out as they learn to read better and write better.  I see children
>>going farther in life.

>>what I like about this earn to learn thing mostly is that I get to read
>>more books than I usually do.

>>why do you say that?

>>because I like to read a lot, and I like to read all kinds of books.

>>Betty Cooper: academically, these kids have just improved tremendously.
>>The math has gone up, the reading skills, the writing skills.  They're
>>communicating better.  Their vocabulary has broadened, and we must
>>remember, these are at-risk kids, and the big picture is that these kids
>>later will be productive, contributing citizens to our community.

>>I'm going to be a good student whenever I grow up.  Because I'm going to
>>try to be the best that I can be.

>>Now, notice over here in this model if you read, you may get beaten up.
>>In this model if your choice is to read or practice basketball, there's
>>no question which is the higher value.  In this model, not only is it
>>good to read, not only do you get prestige out of reading, but in the
>>Earning by Learning version, you get money.
</pre>
So you take the number of hours you want to go and read, and you suddenly
-- and part of what we do, by impacting on a particular housing project, is
you suddenly have 60 or 70 or 80% of the second and third graders carrying
books around, so it suddenly becomes okay to carry a book.  And why are you
carrying a book?  Because you're going to be able to be part of what works
in the free enterprise system.
<P>
And so suddenly, the kids who are the smartest kids aren't the kids who can
beat each other up, they aren't the kids who might belong to a local youth
gang.  They're the kids who are going to have the most money at the end of
the summer, and you begin to change the whole psychology.  But it's got to
be seen as an entire system.
<P>
Now let's look at another area which has been just tragically not used
effectively, and that's pillar four, the spirit of invention and discovery.
I happened yesterday to meet with the Federal Aviation Administration, and
you remember last week I think I showed you, this is the M. I. T card, the
little dot that's dark, actually has 70 electric engines on it.  The sign
of micro- miniaturization.
<P>
Now, as an example of why governments find it very hard to use new
technologies, we are the largest purchaser of vacuum tubes left in the
world.  This is a vacuum tube currently used when you fly in an airplane.
This is part of the air traffic control system you're flying in.  In fact,
I think a large number of them are now made in Poland, because we're
running out of places to make vacuum tubes in the united states.  Now, this
is a vacuum tube, and again, I want you to think about the notion, these
are 70 electric motors.
<P>
Well, the same mind set which has made our -- and this is not the fault of
the FAA.  This is the fault of a federal government procurement policy of
incredible density and lack of rationality.  But the same pattern that
makes us obsolescent here also means we don't think about how to help the
poor.
<P>
I -- you see revolutions around you.  The fact is, if you look at Terry
Terrell, who's a student in this class, all of you now, I think, have your
copy of the student guide for the class which he put together.  This is
laptop publishing.  This is an entrepreneurial -- but the point is, we live
in an age where there's no reason every public housing project in America
can't have its own newspaper, can't have its own way of communicating with
itself for almost no money, but we don't think about how to create
technological breakthroughs.
<P>
I got laughed at a few weeks ago because I went to the Ways and Means
Committee and I said, "at least at the vision level, we ought to be
thinking about how do we get a laptop computer to every poor child in
America."  People said, "well, they don't need laptops."  Well, you're
right.  If they're in this model, they don't need laptops.  But if you're
in this model and you want them to participate in the 21st century, they
need laptops as much as anybody does, because you want to think about
wiring the poor neighborhoods.
<P>
You can't just have a country where the only people who get wired are upper
middle class, and then we say, "now, time to go look for a job.  "everybody
who gets to go look for a job "has to be able to use a computer.  "raise
your hand."  Nobody in this group has a clue.  Furthermore, if they know
they don't have a clue, they have a lower incentive in learning how to
read.  Because we're asking them to go back to a Second Wave industrial
model of learning, and we're saying to them, all the really clever people
who are going to be successful in America, they're down here now.
<P>
They're already doing Third Wave information-age stuff, but, of course, we
don't expect anybody who's poor to participate.  But you ought to work as
hard as these people, because you ought to at least pretend you're going to
participate.  And then you'll have self-esteem.
<P>
And so I would argue just the opposite.  That part of going to this new
culture of productivity and safety has to include wiring the poor and
thinking it through in a very specific way.  What do we want to do to
ensure that fiber optic is available?  What do we want to ensure that dish
satellites -- I talked to a corporation which is probably going to announce
in the near future that they're going to take a public housing project in
Washington and they're going to put a dish receiver in every house -- in
every apartment.  And they're going to do it as a pilot project to bring
500 channels to the poor, including educational channels, job seeking
channels, learning channels, just to say, all right, I mean, let's have an
explosion of knowledge.  It doesn't cost much.  And if in the process 24
hours a day, seven days a week, the poorest child in America has access in
their living room to the world and they begin to think, "wow, I can be
somebody, because I have the same access as anybody else does," you change
things.
<P>
But it's deeper than that.  We need to be thinking about safety in the
information age.  And about health care in poor neighborhoods in the
information age.  I'll give you just two quick -- two or three quick
examples.  If you know there are some neighborhoods that are very, very
unsafe, one of the things you do is you put cameras up.  You find ways to
have the kind of surveillance you need to provide real protection.  Another
step you do is you begin to provide some kind of call device, and you get
volunteers and you get lots of volunteers.  And you see something
suspicious, call the cops.  It's better to have the police arrive early,
it's better to have the police arrive early and see what's going on than it
is to have them arrive after the crime.
<P>
Most of the time today, police are crime reaction rather than crime
prevention units, because you have to integrate them into the neighborhood
and have anonymous people who can just call and say, "I think there's a
teen gang at the corner and I think somebody's going to get hurt in the
next half hour."  The police then drive by.
<P>
That -- again, you could literally give away devices to call in to create a
network of information.  It ain't that hard to computerize databases.  It
should be relatively easy to track who are the teen gangs to simply know
who's who.  To go to thumbprints for a whole range of things, including
food stamps and other things.
<P>
And I'm totally in favor of instant identity for buying guns.  I mean, we
ought to know if somebody who has been in a mental institution or is a
convicted felon shows up and they want to buy a gun, I'd like to know that
while they're standing there, and I'd like to have policemen visit with
them while they're still in the store and say, "hi, you know, we probably
want to take you away for a long time."
<P>
And I would say it ought to be illegal for a felon to try to buy a gun.  I
mean, I put a very high stake -- I mean, we're told 70,000 felons showed up
and got -- you know, were trying to buy guns.  Why are they trying to buy
guns?  Why don't we drum into their heads it is illegal.  We will not
tolerate you buying guns.
<P><PRE>
>>isn't it already illegal?

>>It's illegal to have bought it, but we just warn them away without saying
>>to ourselves, let's make a note here.  This is the third time Freebie's
>>tried to buy a gun.  I mean, at some point you begin to think there might
>>be a pattern here.  Maybe if something happens in Freddie's neighborhood.
>>
</pre>
And again, when you're out on parole, we could easily have you wearing an
ankle bracelet that was connected by satellite that tracked you precisely
the way we track, for example, large mammals in endangered species.  And
while you're on parole, if you happen to be at the local 7-eleven at the
exact second it's being robbed, we might say to ourselves -- we know that
up to 84% in some of the cases are going to be recidivists, and yet we do
nothing to track them.  I mean, these things are all -- the technology
exists today for a revolution in public safety.
<P>
Similarly, you can set up very inexpensive neighborhood clinics connected
electronically to the best hospitals, the best doctors in the world.  And
you can have very inexpensive people who are trained to screen up to a
point where we then call in the doctor.  What we have today is a model that
says, if you can't afford to set up a full clinic with full standing
doctors, meeting every possible requirement of a nice upper-middle-class
neighborhood, we really shouldn't provide any health care at all.
<P>
And it's not that hard to build a series of things.  We're doing it in the
military now, where we're going to be able to go from a field unit that has
a person who has just been wounded directly by satellite to the best doctor
for that kind of wound in the world and get them help immediately.  You
could do the same thing for the poor at not much money, and you could
actually guarantee screening for things and you could guarantee prenatal
care and you could do things dramatically less expensive than the current
model.
<P>
Beyond the information age, pillar five is Deming and Quality.  And the
first point I'd make, if you look at the Deming model and you think at a
systems level, the first point I'd make is, we are looking at a system of
failure.  Very important principle.  That it is the system which has
failed, not just individual cases.  That's why I talk about a replacement
of a culture and replacement of a system.
What we want to do is build a system of success with continuous
improvement, teamwork, customer orientation, and continuous measurement.
<P>
So we're constantly finding out are, in fact -- when we're told, well, this
school didn't succeed very well, and so 70% of the kids aren't learning how
to read, so we'll now have a study plan, and maybe a year from now we'll
have a new proposal.  In the intervening year, of course, 70% of the kids
won't learn how to read, and then maybe we'll start seeing whether or not
there's some improvement, that's crazy.  If you have a school that you find
out this morning you know has 70% of the kids not learning how to read, the
crisis meeting ought to be at lunch.  The first new plan ought to be
Monday.  You ought to be measuring whether or not you're changing behavior
by Friday.  You ought to be working every day to change things.
<P>
And yet you've got unionized work rules, you've got tenure, you've got all
the impediments to rational behavior, and again, it fits the difference in
these two cultures.  In this culture, you change every day, where you have
the red bead experiment every day.  You work very hard at finding how to do
things better.  And you're very flexible and creative.
<P>
In this culture, you fill out the paperwork and it ain't your fault.  You
did what the bureaucracy told you.  Why should they blame you?  Why pick on
you?  Totally different models.  In this culture, you have only one
ultimate test, are the kids taken care of?  Are they safe?  Are they
learning?  Do we have a community doing the right things?  In this model,
you have only one test, did I fill out the paperwork so they can't fire me?
Totally different models.
<P>
And if you take Deming's vision of how quality works and you apply it to
the current bureaucracies, it just makes you want to cry, and that's why I
don't think you can reinvent them.  I think you've got to basically
transform the system to a dramatically more decentralized, less government
system.  In a sense, I guess I would suggest that we really do have two
visions.  The welfare state versus what I would call an opportunity
society.
<P>
Now, if you accept the systemic difference, what I would like to suggest to
you is that there are seven strategies for implementing the opportunity
society.  First, holism.  And I'm going to walk through all these.  Second,
individual and community responsibility and involvement.  Third,
productivity and safety.  Fourth, putting children first.  Fifth, creating
diverse communities, de-ghetto-izing poverty.  Sixth, real compassion and
volunteerism.  And, seventh, an effective and appropriate role for
government.
<P>
And again, you have to think of these as seven integrated strategies.  All
seven of them have to fit together into a coherent whole.  Doesn't do you
good to do four of them.  You need to do all seven.  Strategy one is
holism.  And this essentially goes back to my earlier point, that we have
to approach the total change of the culture and system.  But if you're not
looking at the totality of it, if you're not taking a person from here all
the way down to here, you're not getting anything.
<P>
Having an indolent drunk who no longer drinks but hasn't changed any other
behavior, a, means that within a year, they're probably going to start
drinking again, and, b, you still haven't solved the rest of their
problems.  They still are illiterate, they still don't go to work, they
still don't know how to be independent.  So to change them from who they
are today to the person we hope they'll be in a year is a holistic, it is a
total, a transformational change.
<P>
It's like going from water to ice, which is the best example I can give you
of a holistic transformation.  You know, water is liquid, ice is solid.
They are different.  And you want to make that big a change in the way
people live and in the way they spend their lives.
<P><PRE>
>>that was the thawing portion that we were talking about a couple of weeks
>>ago.

>>yeah, yeah.  So if you think about it, what we're saying is we want these
>>people to take -- to thaw out from this version and then to refreeze into
>>this version.  The transformation is the thawing phase, but they're
>>literally different shapes.

>>morphing.

>>Yeah, in a sense, I mean, morphing, to use the modern computer term,
>>would be an example.  But you do become different.  An antelope is not
>>just a short-necked giraffe.  You know, and a lion isn't just a giraffe
>>that eats meat.  They're different.  Well, a productive citizen in a
>>healthy family living in a safe neighborhood with their children going to
>>schools that work and with all of them having an expectation of having a
>>better future through having good jobs is totally different from being
>>trapped in a neighborhood of violence with a system that won't let you go
>>to work, being dependent on a bureaucrat who doesn't have a clue what
>>your name is or who your family is, and having to send your kids to a
>>monopoly that will destroy them.  I mean, they're different structures,
>>different behaviors.
</pre>
Strategy number two is that to get to here, you have to have individual and
community responsibility and involvement.  This cannot just be imposed from
the out.  People who are in here have to be recruited, attracted, drawn to
wanting to do this.  They have to have both involvement and responsibility.
They are changing their lives.
<P>
We're not magically intervening and giving them good citizen shots.  I
mean, they're full- grown -- you know, a lot of them are full- grown human
beings.  They've got to reach the decision inside themselves that the time
has come to change their lives.  The time has come to do something
different.
<P>
I should say in terms of developing these new ideas, I want to mention that
Jane Fortson, who's here today, is a senior fellow at the Progress and
Freedom Foundation, and that she and Marvin Olasky, who's also a senior
fellow there, have been enormously helpful, and that Victoria
Durant-Gonzalez, who's with the Atlanta project, has been an advisor and
critic and debater, and in many, many different ways has helped us think
about all these things over the last two weeks, and the Atlanta Project is
a good example of what we're talking about.
<P>
The Atlanta Project is an effort which I think is halfway between these
two.  I think it's the largest effort in a comprehensive way heavily using
volunteers to try to impact on helping the poor transform themselves.  And
I think to the degree it will succeed, it's going to succeed because it has
some of this in it.  To the degree it's not succeeding right now, it's
because it's not radical enough.  It's got to go one more layer of being
clear with itself about how big the change is.
<P>
But the Atlanta project is a very heroic effort which was launched by
president Carter, when, frankly, he could very easily have done nothing.
And I have often said I think he has been the most influential of our
former presidents in modern times, because he has stayed active, he's
stayed involved, and he's done things.  And I'd like you to take just a
minute and look at the Atlanta project and what it's trying to accomplish.
<P><PRE>

>>Jimmy Carter: we felt that somewhere in god's world, there needed to be
>>some proof that in a major metropolitan area, something could be done
>>about human deprivation and suffering.

>>Maynard Jackson: so lo and behold, here comes the most active
>>ex-president in the history of America, who says that he's going to bring
>>his vast resources to bear on the problem of fighting poverty in this
>>city, in Atlanta.

>>Johnetta B.  Cole: this notion that each of us has the ability to make
>>life better not only for ourselves but for others is, I think, at the
>>base of the Atlanta Project.  I think we are going to see an absolutely
>>amazing outpour of volunteers, folk who honest to goodness believe that
>>they can create a better Atlanta.

>>Ted Renner: when Bill and Richard Marriott were approached by President
>>Carter, it didn't take much of anything to get them really turned on and
>>committed to this particular endeavor.

>> Dan Sweat: the C. E. O.  Said, we not only will give you half a million
>>dollars or a million dollars, but we want to be personally involved, and
>>we want our corporations involved and our employees involved in a real
>>meaningful way.

>>Ken Lewis: we believe as our communities thrive, we thrive.  We also
>>believe that we're only as strong as our weakest link.  So as we
>>strengthen that link, we all benefit.

>>Jane Fortson: Jimmy Carter has brought a dream and a vision not only to
>>Atlanta, but I believe ultimately to the country.  It's, to me, his
>>greatest quality, is his ability to dream and his ability to articulate a
>>vision and to gather people around that vision.

>> Andrew Young: I think what the Carter project does is give us a time and
>>say, wait a minute.  We've gone as far as we can go alone.  We've got to
>>reach down and take the rest of god's children with us.

>>Joe Martin: if the Atlanta Project can help to take these huge problems
>>and break them down into pieces so that individuals can say, well, if I
>>work on this piece, I'll have some confidence that somebody else will be
>>working on that piece, and together, we can make a difference.

>>Jane Fortson: we'll make a difference, because people are going to deal
>>with people.  Regular people, black and white, rich and poor, young and
>>old, will come together to solve the problems.

>>Johnetta B.  Cole: you know, you can't help but remember, when we won the
>>Olympics, folk really didn't shout and scream, "I am an African-American,
>>and I am proud that we have the Olympics."  Folk didn't say, "I am from
>>the poor of Atlanta, and we got the Olympics."  People said, "I am from
>>Atlanta, and this is what we won."  My hope is that something called the
>>Atlanta Project will, in fact, as best as any action can do, erase those
>>lines, sometimes terribly deep, between and among our communities.

>>The Atlanta Project, by trying to bring together government, business,
>>private volunteerism in a collaborative effort with the community, I
>>think is a very, very important experiment in the right direction.  And
>>we do a number of things to try to work with them, and I think that to
>>the degree it's got a problem, it's because it's only a piece of this.
</pre>
Jane Fortson really developed the seven strategies, and as you go through
all of them, you begin to realize, okay, community and individual
responsibility and participation is important, but there are a bunch more,
and you've got to have all seven working simultaneously in order for us to
have even a chance at winning.  Strategy number three, in that sense, is
productivity and safety.  We listed them together for this reason, they're
about reality.  The reality is you either have a way of making businesses
that are profitable and that survive, or you don't.  The reality is you're
either physically safe or you're not.  Now, if you're not safe, it's a lot
harder to create businesses.  If you can't create businesses, it's a lot
harder to convince people that they ought to follow a path of non-crime.
<P>
So they're linked together, but they're about genuinely having to solve
problems in this system that you can't just kid yourself about.  Doesn't do
you a lot of good to put money in here if when the money's gone, there's no
business there.  So you've got to start asking yourself, under what
circumstances can we make businesses succeed?  How -- what changes in tax
law do you need?  What changes in the regulation do you need?  How can we
make it profitable to have a business that is permanently in the inner city
because it makes money being there?
<P>
Which, by the way, means at least intellectually, if you want to help the
poor, you have to worry about helping the businesses that help the poor.
And you cannot love those who get -- create jobs, but hate those who create
jobs.  You've got to decide -- we have a schizophrenia in America today,
and we've got to say, "okay, I want 100,000 jobs for poor people, and if I
could find 100 people each of whom would create a thousand jobs, that would
be a good thing."  Well, then, you may have to change the law to encourage
those hundred people to do it.  But if you do that, then you get into the
whole question of, but what if they get more money out of getting more
money?
<P>
Because it just -- should the fact of creating a thousand jobs be a good
thing or a bad thing?  Should we reward it, back to incentives, or should
we punish it?  Similarly, you can't tolerate violence, because if you have
violence, when you start creating the jobs, they'll leave.
<P>
Jobs will -- it's very hard to create an economic incentive worth getting
killed over.  And so people will be very risk averse, so you have to make a
neighborhood safe, you have to make it desirable in tax and regulatory
terms for jobs to go in there, and then you have to go back and reach out a
helping hand so that the local person in that neighborhood can get the job,
because otherwise, what you'll do is you'll just crowd out the poor.
<P>
They'll sit across the street from the employment office, but they won't be
employable, and therefore, even though you now brought a thousand jobs into
the community, you still haven't solved it.
<P>
Now, the person who is really doing pioneering work on the question of how
do we create a productive inner city is Michael Porter at Harvard Business
School, the author of "the Competitive Advantage of Nations."  He says the
following, I quote, "we believe a sustainable economic base in inner cities
will only come about through private, for-profit initiatives and investment
based on economic self-interest and true competitive advantage, not through
artificial inducements, charity, or government mandates.  "the central
task, then, is to identify the unique existing and potential competitive
advantages of inner cities, which can translate into genuinely profitable
businesses that have the potential not only to serve the local community,
but also to export outside it.  "the inner city must become an integral
part of the regional and national economy, rather than an island surrounded
by it.  "unless we start with the premise that inner city businesses should
be genuinely profitable in position to compete on a regional, national, and
even international scale, they will forever be relegated to second-class
economic citizenship.  "economic development policies and programs must not
fall into the trap of only redistributing wealth, but focus instead on how
to create it."
<P>
Very important distinction.  Here the focus is, let's take the existing
wealth and redistribute it.  Let's take from the rich and give to the poor.
Here the focus is, let's make everybody richer.  Totally different models.
<P>

This, by the way, was the dominant model of the united states until 1965.
I mean, there was no question about it.  I mean, even Franklin Roosevelt or
John F. Kennedy would have argued this.  It's John F.  Kennedy who said, "a
rising tide lifts all boats," because he argued for a giant tax cut so that
everybody had a better chance.  But these are very different psychological
and family models.
<P>
Strategy four is to put children first.  Partially for the reason that you
see in the beginning of "Boys Town," where Father Flanagan goes into his
settlement house and realizes that he can't -- that he can't save
40-year-old alcoholics.  But he has an obligation to try to save 9-year-old
kids.  And if we simply had a very effective program of measuring backward
from the children safety, learning, jobs, income, making sure that their
lives have a chance to work.
<P>
Now, to do that, you've got to help their parents.  Remember, it's not
reductionist, we'll take care of the kids.  Tough luck, mom.  Can't just
be, we'll take care of the children in their box.  But it has to be in
order to re -- to transform this into this, the children are the perfect
bridge where you can focus your energy and focus your test.
<P>
Obviously, for the children to be in a better housing project, you have to
have a better housing project for everybody else.  For the children to be
in a safer neighborhood, it's going to be a safer neighborhood for
everybody else.  But by starting the focus on the children, I think we can
have a very powerful model.  It's also, quite frankly, the place we have
the greatest moral imperative.
<P>
I don't believe any American can be comfortable with what happens to the
poorest children in America today.  I just don't think anybody's
comfortable.  So I think if you start with the moral imperative, "yes,
we're going to organize ourselves as a country and we're going to make this
change happen, and if we fail to do so, here is what it means for the
children," gives us, frankly, the greatest moral power to make the change.
<P>

Strategy number five is to create diverse communities, in a sense, to
de-ghetto-ize poverty.  This, by the way, also applies to the American
Indian reservations and to Appalachia, and is one of the ways in which some
of it could be done electronically.  I mean, there's no reason you can't
have telephone friends.  You don't have to physically drive somewhere.
There's no reason you can't do a lot of things that work for everybody else
in America.
<P>
But again, I mean, how many of you call your best friend more often than
you see them face to face?  Raise your hand.  Okay.  Over half of you.  I
mean, so you can have a big brother-big sister program that has a lot of
impact, you know, that has a lot of continuity, that's not just getting
together on Saturday morning, but it's also chatting in the evenings, it's
also doing a lot of things that are electronic hand-holding and electronic
reinforcement and electronic communications.
<P>
But it's more than that.  One of the tragedies of this model is that we've
basically ended up tying the poor up in big centers of poverty so that they
don't see anybody go to work.  One of the virtues of Earning by Learning is
you begin to get healthy adults coming out of this society sitting down
with a child so that the child begins to relate to somebody who's orderly,
disciplined, has a sense of values that are appropriate to an information
age, and you want to do everything you can to begin to break down the
isolation of the poor and to begin to link them in with people who are in
the habit of having and leading healthy lives.
<P>
It's an enormous difference, and one where, frankly, I think the policy of
concentrating the poor ultimately has been tragic for the poor.  Strategy
six has to be real compassion and volunteerism.  And again, real compassion
includes the willingness to say "no," it includes tough love, it includes a
kind of volunteerism which tries to bond you directly to the people you're
trying to help, and which emphasizes the principles that Olasky outlined
earlier, that we used earlier today.
<P>
But I don't think you can succeed without that.  I think if all you do is
the government stuff and if all you do is the private business stuff and
you have not made the transition here with volunteers holding hands,
remember what I said earlier about covenant house on Tuesday mornings?  You
have to have somebody you know who talks to you who you trust, who carries
you across there.
<P>
I mean, how many of you at some point in your life learned something where
if you did not have another human being holding your hand and helping you,
you would just not have done it?  Okay.  Most of -- overwhelming, right?
And so it's that process of volunteerism which I think is an integral
building block.
<P>
Finally, strategy seven is an effective and appropriate role for government.
 We are not ever in this course talking about weak government.  We're
talking about limited, effective government.  I mean, if government,
frankly, could just provide public safety and have a tax code that
encouraged job creation and minimized the bureaucratic destruction of jobs
and be in a position to ensure that public learning took place whether it
was in a public bureaucracy or not, government would have done all it needs
to do in the inner city.   If then that was interfaced with the private
sector creating jobs and that was interfaced with voluntary associations
helping make the transition, you'd begin to have a team, if you will.
<P>
Think of it as a -- a box, which we'll talk about next week, where you have
up here the basic values of your civilization that have to be repeated over
and over again, because that's how values are transmitted.  You send them
over and over again.  Then you have to have the voluntary associations,
what we think of as freedom, what de Tocqueville described, whether it's
Kiwanis or business and professional women or Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts or
churches and synagogues.
<P>
Then you have private business.  In this model, which Gordon Woods helped
me understand and is derived from Jefferson, here you have limited,
effective government.  But it is the last and least of -- in a free
society.  It's very important in wartime.  And it has to be effective.  But
notice the way it's only a piece of the whole pattern.
<P>
Now, if we could get this to all work, I think within a decade, we can have
made a dramatic reduction, maybe as much as 70%, in poverty in America.
But I can't overstate, this is very hard work and will take a tremendous
effort.
<P>
Next week we're going to keep picking up on this, because we're going to
talk next week about citizenship and community in 21st century America, and
that will give us a chance to come right back at these same topics and how
we organize ourselves as a free people.  Next week's reading is Don
Eberly's "Building a Community of Citizens," the introduction, and then
chapters 1, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.  And at that time, we will take up
further on how we get America to work.

<h2>The CDC &quot;IMPACT&quot; Grant Program: Cash Cow for America's Health Charities?</h2>
<p>
For fifty years the federal government's Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta has been concerned with curing disease through 
research, public education, and inoculation.  But recently the CDC has shifted its 
focus from the practice of medicine and medical research to politics.  The agency now 
spends tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars 
annually <I>to train lobbyists</I> in how to enact gun 
control laws, how to ban smoking or tobacco advertising, and other politically correct 
causes championed by the political left.
<P>It is illegal to use tax dollars for partisan politics, so there are serious concerns 
about not only the propriety but also the legality 
of the CDC's political initiatives.  This report examines a major ongoing program funded 
by the CDC that in 1993 alone spent $85 million in tax dollars to initiate a program in 32 
states and the District of Columbia to train 
lobbyists and build political coalitions that will 
advocate banning tobacco products.
<P>No one today denies the health hazards of smoking.  The issue here is not whether or 
not smoking is healthy; it is whether or not prohibition is wise public policy and, more 
importantly, whether or not tax dollars ought to 
be used to promote it.  
<P>Once tax dollars are used to promote one kind of &quot;politically correct&quot; consumption 
behavior, there is in principle no end to it.  Today, smoking happens to be the 
most politically incorrect behavior, but the consumption of fast foods, alcohol, red meat, 
and myriad other products has already been attacked by various self-appointed 
national nannies.  
BR>
<I>The author, Thomas J. DiLorenzo, is a Senior Fellow with the Capital 
Research Center and a Professor of Economics at Loyola College in Baltimore.</I><BR>

<P><B>Florida Leads the Way</B>
<P>1996 marks the midterm of a five year (1993-98) program sponsored by the CDC Office 
on Smoking and Health.  In 1993 the CDC awarded an initial $85 million to 32 state health 
departments as part of its &quot;National Tobacco 
Prevention an

d Control Program,&quot; which the agency labels 
<B>I</B>nitiatives to <B>M</B>obilize for the 
<B>P</B>revention <B>A</B>nd <B>C</B>ontrol of 
<B>T</B>obacco Use (IMPACT).  IMPACT grants to state 
health departments are renewable for up to five years.  
<P>At first blush there does not seem to be anything objectionable to state health 
departments helping people  especially children  quit smoking or discouraging 
them from taking up the habit in the first place.  
But the primary emphasis of the program is not medical treatment or education but politics. 
 The essential purpose of the grants is to mobilize a &quot;comprehensive and 
coordinated nationwide effort&quot; to enact 
prohibitionist legislation through &quot;local, state, and 
regional initiatives.&quot; 
<P>The grants fall into two categories:  
&quot;planning awards&quot; for states that have not 
yet established a political coalition, and 
&quot;core awards&quot; to assist states that have 
already established the political infrastructure 
for such a coalition.  The targeted states are listed in the accompanying box.
<P>Florida is one of the states that has received significant funding 
(approximately $250,000 per year since 1993) from the 
CDC's IMPACT program.  Because Florida is essentially a role model for what the CDC hopes 
to achieve in the other 31 states and the District of Columbia, it will be the focus of this report.  
<P>In its initial 1993 grant proposal to the CDC, the Florida Department of Health and 
Rehabilitative Services (FDHRS) &quot;project 
director,&quot; Mr. Joyner Sims, explained that 
the <HR>


 meetings,&quot; &quot;meeting room costs,&quot; the printing 
of a semi-annual coalition newsletter, and 
&quot;mini grants&quot; to local political coalitions 
throughout the state.
<P>The proposal also describes the precise role of the tax-funded Tobacco Free 
Florida Coalition.  The Coalition will &quot;Provide 
advocacy&quot; for &quot;tobacco prevention and 
control legislation,&quot; &quot;develop new legislation 
specifically targeting restrictions on outdoor 
advertising,<B>&quot; </B>and create<B> </B>a political 
&quot;training and technical assistance plan&quot; to 
provide &quot;coordinated support&quot; for lobbyists.  It 
will fund the travel of its members to political training conferences and establish &quot;a 
linkage with the Florida Association of Broadcasters.&quot;
<P>The Coalition will also seek to change Medicaid so that it covers &quot;tobacco 
cessation services&quot; that are provided by the 
health charities, among others.  This last policy objective would funnel millions of tax 
dollars to the major health charities.  Why should government subsidize smoking 
cessation when most smokers who quit (35 million 
by some estimates) do so on their own?
<P>Taxpayers' funds will also help finance the Coalition's participation in SCARCNet, 
an on-line communication network used by anti-smoking political activists that &quot;allows 
state officials to coordinate with CDC officials 
in countering major tobacco industry announcements.&quot;
<P>Florida's CDC grant application also makes clear the role of the major health charities 
 the ACS, American Heart Association (AHA), and American Lung 
Association (ALA)  and the political nature of the <HR>
<BR>
<B>For decades the political Left has used children as an 
excuse to enact public policies whose major effects are on adults. <HR>
</B><BR>
money would be spent mobilizing a &quot;Tobacco Free Florida Coalition.&quot;  At the 
time, this political coalition was known as 
&quot;The American Cancer Society's Lung Cancer 
Task Force,&quot; indicating that the apparent 
purpose of the grant was to use taxpayers' dollars 
to fund this ACS program.  The grant paid the salary for a &quot;Tobacco Free Florida 
Coalition Coordinator,&quot; a position that &quot;is located 
at the American Cancer Society (ACS) in Tampa, Florida,&quot; according to the grant contract.  
<P>Thus, even though the ACS has long denied receiving government funding of 
any kind (why should individuals donate if their tax dollars are already supporting the 
organization?), it does receive federal tax 
dollars that are filtered through the Florida 
health agency and, in all likelihood, through 
dozens of other state health departments as well.   
<P>In its application to the CDC, the FDHRS indicated that it intended to fill certain 
political &quot;gaps&quot; in the state, including the lack 
of a comprehensive statewide political coalition, limited funding for local 
coalition-building, local coalitions needing more direction 
in &quot;cultural diversity,&quot; and inadequate 
state government staff to help build political coalitions.
<P>If it received the CDC grant, the FDHRS promised to use its federal tax dollars to 
lobby for the following policies:
<P> Local ordinances that would ban smoking in the workplace;
<P> Educational campaigns for lawmakers;
<P> Bans on cigarette vending machines;
<P> Restrictions on tobacco products advertising;
<P> Tobacco excise tax increases, with some of the revenues earmarked for members of 
the Tobacco Free Florida Coalition
<P> Banning promotional give-aways of tobacco products
<P> Banning the sale of cigarettes by pharmacies; and
<P> Raising the legal smoking age to 21.
<P>The CDC grant would pay at least part of the salaries of Florida Health 
Department employees, American Cancer Society 
staff, and newly-hired political activists and consultants.  It also covers &quot;travel expenses 
for coalition members to attend quarterly
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->

IMPACT grant program in a table that lists Coalition personnel.  It shows that the 
health charities are effectively receiving 
taxpayers' dollars as Coalition members, and that 
arguably they are engaged in illegal, tax-funded political advocacy.  The FDHRS grant 
application lists the members of the Coalition and describes their roles (see box).
<P>The list of coalition members also includes medical professionals, but in virtually 
every instance their role is listed as liaison to 
fellow professionals, i.e., as political operatives.  
<P>
<P><B>The Role of the Robert Wood 
<P>Johnson Foundation</B>
<P>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in Princeton, New Jersey 
complements the CDC's political activities.  The Foundation was founded in 1972 and is 
the largest private foundation in the U.S. devoted exclusively to health care issues.  
Its assets approach $4 billion and its major 
health policy initiatives are almost exclusively 
aimed at drastically increasing the amount of government intervention in health care.
<P>Lawsuits filed against Hillary Rodham Clinton's secret health care task force 
have forced disclosure of the powerful influence RWJF exerted over the 
promotion of the Clinton administration's failed attempt at a government takeover 
of health care in 1993 and 1994.

In addition, RWJF's &quot;State Initiatives in Health Care Reform&quot; program put millions 
of dollars behind political lobbying efforts to pass state-level health care laws that 
contain such Clinton plan features as price 
controls, mandated managed care, &quot;community 
rating&quot; of health insurance, and massive regulation of health care markets.  Florida, 
Minnesota, and Washington passed legislation favored by the Foundation.  As 
Genevieve Young, an attorney specializing in 
health law, has argued in past issues of 
<I>Organization Trends</I>, these laws enable state 
officials to circumvent a U.S. Congress that is 
unwilling to do what the Administration and RWJF know is best.
<P>RWJF now wants to use these methods in the anti-smoking crusade.  In Florida and 
in twenty other states, RWJF is supplementing CDC taxpayer funding with its own 
&quot;Smokeless States&quot; grant program.   A brochure 
on the program indicates that the Foundation &quot;will make new grants to up to 21 
statewide coalitions working in partnership with 
community groups.&quot; RWJF plans to spend $20 million on the program over the next 
four years.
<P>To qualify for the RWJF grants, as Florida has, a state or nonprofit entity must 
demonstrate the existence of a &quot;strong, 
broad-based state-wide coalition,&quot; a &quot;state 
government commitment to the effort including 
support <BR>
Alaska, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, 
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah<BR>
from the governor, key legislators, and other public officials,&quot; and &quot;recent or 
proposed local and state policy and financing 
changes&quot; designed to achieve tobacco prohibition. 
 Despite occasional protests that they are not &quot;prohibitionists,&quot; prohibition is what 
RWJF and the health charities want.  What else, 
after all, can &quot;Smokeless States&quot; mean?
<P>In Florida, RWJF provides in-kind as well as financial support:  A FDHRS 
&quot;progress report&quot; to the CDC this year observes, 
&quot;The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Advocacy Coordinators are assisting the 
[CDC] funded tobacco coalitions.&quot;  These 
&quot;advocacy coordinators&quot; organize media 
campaigns, conduct opinion polls, and train citizens in political advocacy.  The RWJF 
grant also is used in Florida to bring in 
&quot;nationally recognized experts in the tobacco 
control movement.&quot;  These efforts are 
consistent with the RWJF's record of attempting to &quot;solve&quot; public health problems with 
more government bureaucracy, regulation, and taxes.  
<P>
<P><B>Using Children as Political Pawns</B>
<P>For decades the political Left has used children as an excuse to enact public 
policies whose major effects are on adults.  The Children's Defense Fund, for example, 
spends virtually all its resources lobbying for an expanded welfare state.  But its name is 
useful when it chooses to attack critics of failed welfare state programs as &quot;anti-children.&quot;  
<P>The CDC and RWJF have adopted this strategy.  Even though most of their 
policy recommendations, such as higher excise 
taxes, affect everyone, they are careful to 
highlight <HR>
<BR>
<B>Is not something unsavory occurring when officials of 
the Florida Department of Education pay other peoples' children 
to entrap hard-working, tax-paying citizens?</B><BR>

<P><I>(continued from page 3)</I><BR>
 taxpayer funds are spent on public education programs, the 
lion's share goes toward tax-funded politics.  
From September 1993 to May 1994 the FDHRS boasted that it lobbied for a $1.00 increase 
in the state's tobacco products tax, working closely with the AHA lobbyist Scott Ballin. 
 This effort was unsuccessful.
<P>Florida could report success with the sting operations conducted by &quot;underage 
operatives who are observed by a special enforcement agent.&quot;  These resulted in the 
entrapment and citation of hundreds of convenience store clerks; dozens of 
businesses were subject to &quot;administrative actions&quot; 
that were taken against their business licenses; and a &quot;total of $136,000 in fees were 
collected for the Department of Education.&quot;
<P>Is not something unsavory occurring when officials of the Florida Department of 
Education pay other peoples' children to entrap hard-working, tax-paying citizens?  
Are Florida's law enforcement resources appropriately spent arresting clerks who sell 
cigarettes to teenagers?  Is criminalizing 
behavior the best way to advance public health?  
<P>Perhaps the most important political &quot;progress&quot; that Florida reported to the 
CDC is the news that the Tobacco Free Florida Coalition helped lobby for a new state law, 
SB 2110, which was enacted on May 25, 1994.  It allows the state to sue the tobacco 
industry to recover health care costs from tobacco-related illnesses incurred by Medicaid 
recipients.  Florida becomes one of fourteen 
states, as of this writing, pursuing this legal 
strategy and arguing that tobacco companies 
should be liable for the negative health effects 
of their product even if smokers know full well  as they undoubtedly do  that 
smoking increases health risks.

programs aimed at children.  In Florida and in other IMPACT states schoolchildren 
are encouraged (and sometimes paid) to join the Student Coalition Against Tobacco (SCAT). 
 A SCAT campaign involves students in a wide range of activities that organizers 
say are &quot;considered youth political advocacy, which is at the very base of 
the Student Coalition Against Tobacco.&quot;  
<P>The ACS, AHA, and ALA oversee SCAT activities, and they teach 
children to demonize their political opponents.  Join SCAT, children are 
told, and begin &quot;counteracting immoral tobacco industry tactics.&quot;
<P>There is nothing wrong with schoolchildren advising their friends to 
avoid smoking.  But SCAT pays junior high and high school students to 
conduct private sting operations, often against convenience stores.  SCAT reports 
that it sends &quot;minors out into the community in an attempt to purchase

or other locations.&quot;  Such activities have become an integral part of the 
CDC's national coalition-building campaign even though some California law 
enforcement officials have criticized it as &quot;vigilantism.&quot;  
<P>Moreover, health charities are giving young SCAT recruits questionable 
information.  For example, one instructional guide advises children to &quot;make the public 
aware that young people are being attacked by toxins whenever we eat in a restaurant, 
play pool or bowl, or attend school.&quot;  There is 
no solid evidence that second-hand smoke is as hazardous as such a statement implies  
if, indeed, it is hazardous at all, being one of countless indoor pollutants.  Such 
language is needlessly frightening.

<P>The logic of this argument, if it is accepted by the courts, is likely to have 
far-reaching effects.  It is not hard to imagine that 
plaintiffs' lawyers will file similar class-action 
lawsuits against the alcoholic beverage industry, the fast food business, and many 
other industries.  Overeating, overdrinking, even overexercizing can be hazardous to health.  
If courts reject the principle that adults are responsible for their own consumption 
behavior, the resulting liability crisis will 
rival the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.
<P>The federal government's National Cancer Institute (NCI) has joined with the CDC 
to fulfill this promise.  NCI grant # CA-94-15 (obtained through a Freedom of 
Information Act request) provided $1,119,678 to 
Northeastern University Law School in Boston in 1995 for a four-year legal research project. 
 The project will &quot;produce policy papers&quot; 
on `states' ability to sue tobacco companies for the medical expenditures caused by 
tobacco-related diseases&quot; and paid by Medicaid.  
The grantees  university law professors and their students  will also research &quot;the 
optimal design and constitutional validity of state legislation that would strengthen 
legal procedures for obtaining such reimbursement of health care costs from the 
tobacco industry.&quot;  Additional government 
funding for the project is provided by the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
($324,500 annually) and the Americans With 
Disabilities Act ($284,804).
<P>The plaintiffs lawyers who take such cases on behalf of state governments can 
well afford their own legal research, especially since they stand to earn hundreds of 
millions of dollars in contingency fees.  It is likely 
that they will benefit more than any tobacco smoker, courtesy of NCI and other 
government agencies.  
<P>Florida reports one final bit of 
&quot;progress&quot; to the CDC.  The Coalition intends to 
use federal tax dollars to &quot;actively support 
employee litigation against employers who fail to implement meaningful smoking policies.&quot; 
 FDHRS recently recruited an attorney who will help employees harass their 
employers who fail to enact politically correct 
anti-smok<BR>
ing policies along the lines suggested by the state coalition.  
<P>
<P><B>Resurrecting Alcohol Prohibition</B>
<P>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recently announced a new four year, 
$10.2 million grant program that follows the same format as its &quot;Tobacco Free States&quot; 
grant program.  The new program will fund statewide political coalitions as well as local 
coalitions to encourage alcohol prohibition.  Like the anti-smoking programs, this one 
contains plenty of rhetoric about children.  Indeed, the program's name is &quot;Reducing 
Underage Drinking Through Community and State Coalitions.&quot;  But the public 
policies highlighted in its brochure affect 
<I>everyone</I>  legal as well as underage drinkers.
<P>For example, among government interventions &quot;shown to be effective&quot; are 
&quot;restrictions on the distribution of alcohol&quot; 
through state government monopoly liquor stores, regulatory limits on &quot;outlet density,&quot; and 
the elimination of advertising.  Perhaps because State liquor monopolies charge higher 
prices than private, competitive liquor stores, 
the Foundation considers them a positive benefit to adult purchasers of liquor.  
Similarly, limits on competitive advertising are sure 
to lead to higher liquor prices.  But won't limits on &quot;outlet density&quot; increase accidents 
as purchasers drive further away to drink?    
<P>Another &quot;effective&quot; intervention, 
according to RWJF, is &quot;increases in taxes and 
the relative price of alcoholic beverages.&quot;  
This, too, is proposed for the sake of children, 
even though sales to minors are already illegal.  Increased taxes and the other proposed 
laws and regulations apply to all liquor sales.   RWJF literature says nothing about 
parental responsibility. 
<P>The last paragraph of the RWJF grant announcement offers this disclaimer:  
&quot;Grant funds may not be used ... for lobbying 
or otherwise attempting to influence legislation.&quot;  This statement cannot be accepted 
at face value when the primary purpose of the program is to fund statewide coalitions 
<I>of lobbyists</I> whose mission is to enact 
prohibitionist policies.  Grantees are &quot;expected 
to mobilize existing or new statewide or local coalitions&quot; to enact higher alcohol 
excise taxes and other legislated restrictions on alcohol consumption.   Among the 
&quot;selection criteria&quot; for the grants is the 
&quot;<I>political feasibility</I>&quot; of the state's project (emphasis added).
<P>The RWJF brochure claims its prohibitionist policy proposals are &quot;seen as the 
most successful approaches.&quot;  Perhaps this is 
why it has allocated $10.2 million to finance such campaigns in twelve states.  
<P>
<P><B>Conclusions</B>
<P>It is illegal to spend tax funds on partisan political activity.  Yet this is what the CDC 
is doing when it allocates hundreds of millions of tax dollars for anti-smoking coalition 
building.  These amounts are comparable to the amount spent on congressional campaigns. 
 Similarly, individuals and organizations that contribute to candidates cannot deduct 
their contributions from their taxes.  But a tax-exempt foundation like the Robert 
Wood Johnson Foundation spends millions of dollars constructing a &quot;political 
infrastructure&quot; for assorted prohibitionist movements 
in dozens of states.
<P>Self-interest reinforces ideology in the actions of the major health charities  the 
ACS, AHA, and ALA.  As documented in this study and in my book, 
<I>Unhealthy Charities</I> (Basic Books, 1994), with James T. 
Bennett, health charities receive federal 
government funds to build political coalitions.  They, 
in turn, lobby state legislatures to require educational programs for adults and children 
to be administered by   none other than the health charities themselves.  
<P>The CDC's reputation is built on its work in health research, education, and 
disease innoculation.  By undertaking to finance 
lobbying campaigns sponsored by various tax-exempt organizations, it is denying 
Americans the right to make their own decisions with regard to personal behaviors that 
have been deemed politically-incorrect.  And it is diverting millions of dollars from 
important disease research.  This abuse of 
taxpayers' dollars should be stopped.

<P><B>Briefly</B>Noted<BR>
In response to the increasing practice on the part of some large foundations, including the ROBERT WOOD 
JOHNSON FOUNDATION, of using grant monies to &quot;leverage&quot; public funds, the Pennsylvania General Assembly is considering a 
measure that would sharply curtail the ability of state agencies to solicit or receive funding from nonprofit foundations.  More details to 
be provided in future issues.
<P>
<P>Liberal intellectuals and labor leaders are attempting to revive the old alliance between organized labor and &quot;progressive&quot; academia. 
 Recently, a series of &quot;teach-ins&quot;  modeled on the anti-war conferences of the Vietnam era  have been held at various 
campuses around the country as a means of inspiring students and professors to devote more of their energy toward helping the union agenda. 
 At a Columbia University event, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney declared, &quot;We need your help in telling millions of 
unrepresented workers that while it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a union to get a raise.&quot;

<P>
<P>The CENTER FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY in Washington has published a new monograph entitled 
<I>Race and the Criminal Justice System:  How Race Affects Jury 
Trials</I>.  It includes a series of essays that debate whether race continues to skew justice in 
the courtroom and what role, if any, race should play in jury selection.  Contributors include Walter Berns, Joan Biskupic, 
Randall Kennedy and Jeffrey Rosen.  The final essay by Robert Lerner suggests, contrary to conventional wisdom, that blacks are 
actually more likely than whites to be acquitted in jury trials for most felonies.  Contact the Center:  202-639-0803 / www.ceousa.org

<P>During the recent presidential campaign, press reports revealed that the Clinton administration exploited a Justice 
Department program called &quot;Citizenship USA&quot; (designed to accelerate the naturalization process for new citizens) in order to register 
hordes of new Democratic voters before election day.  Further reports show that the White House gave most of the Citizenship USA 
work to liberal &quot;community advocacy groups&quot; like the UNITED NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATION, which has close ties to both 
the President and Mrs. Clinton.
<P>
<P>A &quot;third wave&quot; of free market think tanks has begun to emerge.  Following the rise of Washington and state-based policy 
groups (the first and second waves respectively), the ALLEGHENY INSTITUTE in Pittsburgh is blazing the way for a new generation 
of market-oriented groups that will focus on local issues.  The Institute's executive director, Gerry Bowyer, writing in The 
Heritage Foundation's <I>Insider</I> newsletter, reports that the new group is working to restructure the government of Allegheny 
County, Pennsylvania, focusing on privatization efforts (including privatization of an airport and property assessments) and deregulation.

<P>
<P><I>Z Magazine</I>, the entertaining publication for the unreconstructed leftist, is in trouble.  An urgent appeal warns that 
&quot;various circumstances&quot;  including the fact that Z hadn't filed IRS forms for four years  have put the brash magazine  
&quot;publication home&quot; of such notables as Noam Chomsky, Barbara Ehrenreich, and Sara Diamond  in a precarious situation.  
Emergency appeal donations may be sent to 18 Millfield Street, Woods Hole, MA  02543.

<P>Drugs and Welfare:  Billionaire financier George Soros, prime benefactor of the drug legalization movement, plans to give 
$50 million to immigration rights organizations across the country.  He is doing so in response to the welfare reform legislation 
enacted earlier this year, which Soros believes to be unjust and part of a &quot;mean-spirited attack on immigrants.&quot;  The funds will be 
dispersed through his newest charitable foundation, the EMMA LAZARUS FUND.  
<P>
<P>Can't we just get along:  In a full-page ad in the 
<I>Nation</I> magazine, five environmental groups (Earthtrust, Endangered 
Species Project, Friends of Animals, Marine Mammal Fund, and Sea Shepherds Conservation Society) attack GREENPEACE 
for supporting what they call the &quot;Dolphin Death Bill,&quot; which they claim weakens the U.S. dolphin protection law.  The groups 
accuse Greenpeace of being AWOL in the tuna/dolphin battle while &quot;mailing millions of letters appealing to the public to `save the dolphins.'&quot; 
 Thousands of dolphins will die, they say, because Greenpeace acts &quot;hypocritically.&quot;  For our part, we've always been 
more concerned about the neglected rights of the tuna.<HR>

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Lecture One  -- PFF</title>

Renewing American Civilization <br>
Class One -- American Civilization January 7, 1995 Adjunct Professor Newt 
Gingrich Reinhardt College  <br>
<P>
The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College 
television, in Waleska, Georgia. From Reinhardt College in Waleska, 
Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the first of 
10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor 
at Reinhardt College, will begin his course, which presents the 
foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American 
Civilization. This week's lesson gives an introduction and overview of 
the course and lays the building blocks for a solid understanding of how 
to rejuvenate and strengthen the fabric of America.  
<P>
Good morning. Let me welcome you to Reinhardt College for the very first 
session of "Renewing American Civilization." Let me start by introducing 
two people who are absolutely invaluable and without whom this course 
simply wouldn't exist. First of all, a man of great courage who stepped 
in and who gave us the opportunity to teach and to continue developing 
ideas, President Floyd Falany of Reinhardt College. And, Floyd, I just 
want to say thank you for allowing us to be here. And then my co-teacher 
here on campus, a fellow historian, Dr. Kathleen Minnix. And, Kathleen, 
again, she'll be teaching -- for those who watch this later on videotape 
or those who might be seeing it through Mind Extension University, Dr. 
Minnix actually teaches the second half of this course in terms of the 
Reinhardt College students and experience here. I also do want to take a 
moment to welcome the students of mind extension university, which is a 
satellite system that's available on many campuses across the country, 
and which is now offering "Renewing American Civilization." And I want to 
let everybody who sees this who's not in the classroom know that you can 
mail your comments to: Renewing American Civilization at post office box 
6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065. And, frankly, we want to get your 
comments, because that's how we improve the course. That's how we learn 
what to change and what needs to be done. And if you're too excited to 
mail it, you can fax the comments to: 404- 528-9806. 
<P>
And nowadays, we frankly get an awful lot of comments that are faxed to 
us. One of the interesting comments about the modern world is we'll have 
somebody, particularly in rural America, who will be on a dish receiver 
picking it up by satellite, then using their fax to send it to us. 
However, there's another generation coming along, so if you'd rather 
e-mail your comments, they have that. It's America on-line. It's 
renewam@aol.com. And I'll let those of you who go into that stuff know. 
I'm sure that for every one of those folks, that was a very obvious 
address. And then for those who are really at the cutting edge, the class 
transcripts and other class materials are available on our Internet web 
page. Just for the fun of it: http://www.pff.org. And that's effective as 
of January 13th, so don't get frustrated trying -- if you're watching 
live trying to do that today. Finally, for people who are into a much 
simpler world, to order American Civilization, the video and the audio 
tapes and the course readings, you can call 1-800-to-renew. 
<P>
Let me stop for a second, because I think as we go through that, here's 
the first place I can make a key point about why we teach this course the 
way we're teaching it. We now live in a world where the most advanced of 
us understand computers at the Internet level. But almost all of us 
understand calling an 800 number to get the audio tapes and the 
videotapes. Now, when you realize that 800 numbers didn't exist, audio 
tapes didn't exist, and videotapes didn't exist about 50 years ago, and 
now we take those as sort of the basic building blocks of civilization -- 
"well, of course you can do those, but what about this new stuff" -- it 
gives you the sense of pacing, of part of what we're going to come back 
to again and again, why we talk about entering a third wave of 
civilization and why we talk about the information age. And we'll get 
back to that. 
<P>
But what we're doing here today where we are both live on videotape, on 
audio tape, connected by computer, by fax, and by e-mail, as well as by 
U.S.. mail and the telephone, gives you some sense of the sophisticated 
world of the 21st century that we're just beginning to invent. Now, today 
we're going to talk about American Civilization, and we're going to lay 
out the premise of this entire course. And what I want to talk about, I 
have to give credit, frankly, to Dr. Everett Carl Ladd at the University 
of Connecticut, who's one of the leading students of what he calls 
"American Exceptionalism." And he uses the term "American 
Exceptionalism." I think it's a very helpful term, because it gives you a 
sense of where we're going. 
<P>
And so we're going to today spend our time on the introduction, the 
overview, and the outline of the entire course. So I'm going to introduce 
the course, give you an overview of what we're going to try to do in the 
course, and then give you an outline of what will actually happen in the 
course. And what I want to suggest as a starting point is that the 
concept of American Exceptionalism which Dr. Ladd developed, in essence, 
that there is a unique American Civilization. Now, on a lot of college 
campuses, we could have some terrific debates -- and I'd be willing to 
debate this topic -- a lot of people will say to you: first of all, are 
we really a civilization? Well, there's a wonderful book by Max Lerner 
called "America as a Civilization." Lerner was an anti-communist liberal 
writing in the 1950s, and it's his arguments. It's a massive book. I'm 
sure you could go look at it. It's about 1500 pages. But his whole 
argument is that there's a way of being that is called "American." That 
you learn to be an American. 
<P>
Now, the key to this is to understand -- and I think this is the 
distinction. This is what confuses those of our friends who are into 
multi-culturalism. American Civilization is multi-ethnic, but it is one 
civilization. Now, this is the central assertion of the course and 
something you'll have to think about. In other words, you may be 
Korean-American. I serve with a Congressman Jay Kim from Southern 
California who's a first-generation Korean-American, born in Korea and 
now lives here. You may be European-American. I obviously am. You may be 
African-American. I serve with J.C.. watts of Oklahoma. You may, in fact, 
be blended from a lot of different racial stocks. You may be Hispanic. I 
serve with henry Bonilla from San Antonio, Texas. And yet each of them 
would describe themselves as an American. They know what they are 
descended from, they know their background. And of course, if their 
children met at a congressional social event and married, then you'd 
start having to say, "well, I'm a European-Korean-American 
African-American-Hispanic." It's easier to just say, "I'm an American." 
<P>
It's a very core question, because what I'm suggesting to you is: we are 
multi- ethnic. We are the first world civilization in that sense. Because 
everybody on the planet can show up here, and did Tuesday. I mean, go to 
Disney world and stand for a half hour. Or go to any -- frankly, north 
Atlanta. Go to any one of our major malls and just stand for an hour. 
This would be -- I'm not recommending it for this course, but if 
somebody's trying to teach the course and drive this home or if this was 
being taught at a high school level, just send students out to stand 
somewhere at a busy mall and write down the number of nationalities that 
walk by in a half hour. 
<P>
And it's astonishing. Or walk -- go to the Atlanta airport and watch who 
goes through the airport. So we -- now, we have to focus on: why is it 
worth studying American Civilization, other than the fact that we're 
Americans who want to know about our past? I have an argument, and the 
argument is that American Civilization, when you compare it to other 
civilizations, it has certain very positive characteristics. It has 
empowered more people from more backgrounds to pursue happiness. In the 
process, our people created greater opportunities to pursue happiness. If 
I were to summarize it into one phrase, it would be that America is a 
great country with good people. And I would argue that American history 
has more people getting more rights and more opportunities. We started 
out with only wealthy white males who could pay a poll tax being allowed 
to participate, and we've added layer by layer until we now reach out to 
virtually every person with a disability, every person of every ethnic 
background, every person of every racial background, every person, you 
know, males and females. 
<P>
You think about the degree to which we now reach out to try to be an 
inclusive system. That that has been a hallmark of 300 years of American 
government. In addition, American history has led to more prosperity and 
property for more and more people. Now, what I want to do, let me just 
take a minute, because I really think it's important to drive this home, 
because it's one of the basic building blocks of why I'm teaching the 
course and where I think you've got to decide for yourself whether you 
intellectually agree. Part of the argument here is that for most of 
American history, from the -- and I am -- when I talk about American, I'm 
not talking about the north American continent, because you could argue 
that the history of the north American continent begins when Asians 
crossed the Bering strait about 11 to 15,000 years ago, and you could -- 
there's some wonderful books. Peter Farb's "man's rise to civilization as 
shown by the Indians of north America" is a good example, because he 
tries to go into that very long history of the geographic site. 
<P>
When I talk about American Civilization, it essentially begins with the 
arrival of the English-speaking peoples in Virginia in 1607 and in 
Massachusetts around 1620, and then spreads across the continent. Now, 
it's a very important distinction. We can talk about it later. But I'm 
not arguing about a geographic term. I'm arguing about the rise of a 
civilizational pattern of behavior which became multiethnic over time. 
What I'm suggesting to you is you can go back and you can take from 1607 
till 1965 and you have certain long sweeps that are more and more 
positive. We go from slavery to segregation to integration. We go from 
empowering wealthy white males to giving women the vote to eliminating 
the poll tax and then giving women the vote, then making sure everybody 
can vote. We go from the -- right from almost the very beginning to 
acquire property. Free blacks as early as the 1740s and 50s could acquire 
property not only in the north, but in new Orleans. And you actually had 
an entire class of people in new Orleans who were of African-American 
descent but who were free and owned property and businesses and could buy 
and sell and were part of the commercial environment. 
<P>
Racism is not only anti- black. You not only have anti-catholic racism 
and anti-Mediterranean. That is, people who were Italian or Spanish or 
Greek had more hostility than people who might be catholic but were 
German or Irish. You then had very bitter anti-Asian hostility, 
particularly in California, but in many ways across the country. If you 
go to Augusta, Georgia, today you see a Chinese community that is now, I 
think, seven generations old that originally came to build railroads in 
the Augusta, Georgia, area. That is, their great, great, great, great, 
great grandparents did. And yet what happens over time is -- and this is 
a very important question. It was part of, I think, a big debate in this 
country in the last 25 years. Dr. Ladd would argue, and I think that 
people who believe in American Exceptionalism would argue, that America 
essentially -- and I used the phrase a while ago -- is essentially a 
great country with good people. That on any given day, most Americans are 
decent. Most Americans care. Most Americans want to raise their children. 
Most Americans would like to be good neighbors. It's part of how you can 
have this very free society with all the different things that go on 
where you get to go out and choose what you want, how you want to live 
your life, what kind of clothing you want to wear, what you want to 
learn, how you want to earn a living, how you want to spend your money. 
That there's an enormous level of trust in each other and that what's 
been happening, we would argue, is that from 1965 to 1994, that America 
went off on the wrong track. 
<P>
Now, that's a very important distinction. There's a large block of 
intellectual thought that would argue America was really a sexist, 
racist, repressive, vicious society, and we need government to correct 
the bad habits of the American people. Those people basically took power 
around 1965 and increasingly tried to redesign America. And my argument 
in this course is going to be that after 1965, the government and elite 
culture adopted ideas that are dramatically different from the traditions 
and principles of American Civilization. That if you look at the first 
300 years of American history, we're going in one direction, and then all 
of a sudden around 1965, with the rise of the great society, the 
counterculture, et cetera, you suddenly have a tremendous burst in a 
direction which is different from every other period of American history, 
and that there's one core critique, and this is a very -- you're going to 
see me come back to this concept a number of times in the course, because 
this is at the heart of being American. The critique is not ideological. 
It's not, "I'm a conservative, they're a liberal." The critique is: these 
ideas don't work. That it's pragmatic. 
<P>
Do you think the inner city's better than it was? Do you think American 
Indian reservations are better than they were? Do you think being poor in 
west Virginia works more? Do you think our schools produce more people 
who know calculus and can speak Latin? Or do you think, as measured in 
the real world, things don't work? Now, it's a very important question, 
because intellectually, you can get into terrific course about: what does 
the word "work" mean and why is Gingrich being judgmental? And I want you 
to understand up front in this course that I am arguing that there are 
obvious objective judgments. If you turn on a water spigot and no water 
comes out, it doesn't work. If you turn on a water spigot and the water 
comes out, you can't drink it, it doesn't work. If you have a school and 
the people who leave it can't read, it doesn't work. If you have a public 
project, housing project, and the people in there are likely to be 
killed, it doesn't work. 
<P>
Now, you have -- this is a very important test question in your own head; 
not in the course, in your own head. Can you objectively measure 
something very simple in result but very sophisticated in measurement? Is 
it working or not? Of course, this means judgments, rights and wrongs, 
yeses and nos. It's not situation ethics. I mean, who are we to say that 
if you never studied in your whole life and you haven't learned a single 
thing and you're totally illiterate, that you're somehow less than those 
of us who read and studied and learned? That's judgmental, to which my 
answer is yes, and you can't have a civilization without judgment. You're 
just talking about chaos. To have a civilization is to judge. You can't 
avoid judgment. Because that's how civilization tells you what you should 
do. I would argue, and Dr. Minnix will later on cheerfully argue, knowing 
history is better than not knowing history. Now, that's a really -- 
that's a very core question. Knowing math is better than not knowing 
math. If you don't know math, you are at the prey of every person you buy 
something from the rest of your life, because you can't check whether or 
not they cheated you. So let's just start at the basics. 
<P>
That's what should be said to every first grader: if you don't learn 
math, you will be cheated the rest of your life. If you refuse to learn 
math and you're cheated, it's your fault. You are not a victim. Zebras 
that run up to lions and beg to be eaten are not victims. They're dumb. 
Okay? So that's a very important concept. Now, why do I say the elite 
ideas have failed? Well, let's go through it. The elite ideas of the last 
generation have failed, and in failing, have left America with more 
poverty, more violence, more red tape, more bureaucrats, more litigation, 
more power in Washington. And ironically, after all those mores, with 
less ability to actually get problems solved and less ability to get 
opportunities developed. 
<P>
Now, those are all measurable. Are there more lawsuits or less? Is there 
more violence or less? I mean, these are not random observations by 
somebody who has an ax to grind. Go out and measure them and you tell me. 
Are more families broken down? Are more one-year-olds likely to suffer 
child abuse? These are measurable, documentable facts. And yet I think 
the system has had a hard time dealing with it. And one of the reasons I 
really wanted to teach this as a course is that moving from the wrong 
track to the right track is largely a cultural and an intellectual 
problem. I want to take a minute and explain what I mean. The problem in 
America today is not money. We have plenty of money. The problem in 
America today isn't even courage. People will say, "oh, politicians are 
gutless." That's nonsense. You've just had the courage to run for office 
and take the beating you take from the press corps. The person I disagree 
most in public life, who I will not name, but would say something to the 
congress I would disagree with, I respect the fact that they have the 
courage to run for public office. It's not absence of courage. It's 
absence of sound ideas. We don't know what to spend the money on. We 
don't know how to structure the spending. We don't know what rules to set 
up. And I spent years trying to sort this out. Why are we having such a 
hard time helping people get off poverty? Why are we having such a hard 
time establishing safety? Why is it so difficult to get schools where 
kids are learning? And we came up with for what was for me one of the 
great breakthroughs. 
<P>
I was spending part of an afternoon actually at a hotel near the Atlanta 
airport with Dr. Jeff Eisenach of the progress and freedom foundation and 
Dr. Steve Hanser, who's a historian and good friend of mine. Eisenach is 
an economist, but we still talk to him even though he's not a historian. 
And we were trying to wrestle with why is it -- and this was back during 
the bush administration. We were trying to figure out: why is it that 
American governmental bureaucracy doesn't work? I mean, you can make a 
good argument that outside of elite groups like the FBI and the national 
park service, and outside of the military, where failure means you die, 
so you have a very high incentive to change, that if you take those away, 
that American bureaucracy has an astonishing pattern of decay that is 
almost universal. You build a big bureaucracy of Americans and it fails. 
And this is what we came up. I'm going to walk you through a challenge 
you can take back home and check with people. In fact, if you would this 
week, this will just be a fun thing for you to do just to see what 
happens when you tell your friends. 
<P>
We're going to talk for a minute about the cultural challenge of speed 
limits and Americans. This is the heart of the course in terms of the 
core ideas. Have any of you ever been to Germany? You have, you have, you 
have. About a third of you. In Germany, there is no speed limit on the 
autobahn outside of congested areas, right? You get on the autobahn, you 
rent a car, you're doing 100 miles an hour, you think you're really 
something, and a Mercedes goes by at 160. You want to pull over and cry. 
You know you don't have the guts to do 160 miles an hour, so you just 
think, you know, "I'm just ruined here." But you know that tomorrow, if 
the Bundestag adopted 100 kilometers, or 62 miles an hour, as the speed 
limit, that virtually every German would obey it until the next election. 
They would then massacre the current generation of politicians and they 
would adopt -- elect the "no speed limit" party. Now, I want you to walk 
through this with me for a second, because it's going to sound silly, but 
it's very, very profound. I want to suggest to you that the American 
challenge to the cultural concept of speed limits is remarkably different 
from the German response. 
<P>
For most Americans, a speed limit is a benchmark of opportunity. Let me 
just give you the test here for a second. Remember, we're not going to 
learn anything if you lie, okay? So you've got to be honest here for a 
second. How many of you will routinely look at the speed limit sign so 
you can add either 5 or 10? Come on, raise your hands now. Be honest. 
Okay? Two-thirds of the course, three-fourths of the course? Now, what 
does this tell you? By the way, I have done this everywhere. After we 
came up with this idea I began testing it, and what I'm teaching you 
today and what I'm sharing with you in this 10 weeks are ideas that have 
evolved over a long period of time, in some cases 36 years, where we've 
actually gone out and talked to them and I talk to enough different 
groups, I've really tested this. I once asked this question, and this is 
-- enough of you live on campus, this would not have been as effective, 
but I'll try it out. How many of you might have gone over the posted 
number to get to this class this morning? Okay. 
<P>
You now know who drives to campus. I did that one time in South Carolina 
with Carroll Campbell, the governor, sitting at the head table. He raised 
his hand. The governor had broken the speed limit to get to the meeting. 
He said well, he was on the golf course, it ran long. The place went 
nuts. Now, why? Because America is not -- and this is at the absolute 
core of the critique of where we are today -- America is not as a 
civilization rule dominated. America is incentive dominated. If you want 
Americans to change, change the incentives. If we said: we'll pay $1,000 
to every first grader who can read the day they walk into school, you 
would be at 95 or 98% literacy within two years like that. Instead, 
because we have this European, bureaucratic, top-down government 
mentality in charge, we'll spend $50,000 on the child trying to get an 
adult in a bureaucracy to coerce them through regulation to do something 
they're not going to do because there's no incentive for them. They're 
going: hey, I don't want in. Glad you got paid. I didn't get paid. And 
people -- I've had teachers say to me, "this is horrible." Now, in the 
middle of a baseball strike. These are little kids, right? They watch 
television. They say to themselves: why is there no baseball? Because 
guys who are getting $7 million a year are out on strike. Okay, I 
shouldn't get paid anything as a little kid because that would be bad. 
<P>
I'm not arguing for the payment here.  I'm arguing for the concept. I'm 
not saying -- I'm not here today as speaker of the house saying we ought 
to have this proposal. I'm trying to get you to think -- this is -- 
because I want you to think about this conceptually. You give Americans 
-- think about your own life and think about middle-class families. "you 
get straight A's, we'll go to Disney world." "you do really well, we'll 
get a bicycle." I mean, how many of you had at some point in your career 
when you were growing up your parents give you an incentive to do 
something? Okay. Three-quarters of the class? Punishment is an incentive, 
but if you're a very poor child in a neighborhood where nobody cares 
about learning, getting an "f" is not a punishment. It's an irrelevancy. 
Being spanked as has an impact, although today you'd better do it 
carefully or you'll be taken into court. 
<P>
But I'm just trying to suggest to you here: very core distinction, which 
doesn't start with government. It starts with civilization. If you're a 
civilization where rules matter and people obey the rules, having a 
government designed around rules works. If you're a civilization of 
freedom where incentives work, you better have a system designed around 
incentives. And so we have a totally misdesigned European-style effort to 
impose into America a government designed to change people and designed 
antithetically to the American Civilization. To design the system for 
Americans, you have to study American Civilization. Now, my point here 
would be that American Civilization is a historically based fact, not 
intellectual theory. And let me explain, and I'll come back to this 
later. I'm a historian in part because I believe history teaches you 
things you don't learn in the abstract. 
<P>
That is, if you really want to understand America, read about American 
history. Don't read a contemporary theoretician's 10-page outline. How do 
Americans behave? How has America functioned? "Renewing American 
Civilization" in that sense is a course designed to explore what works in 
America and why it works. And at the heart of that, I want to suggest to 
you, is the very core American concept which you'll see us come back to, 
and that is that pragmatism is the American philosophy. Remember, 
pragmatism goes back to that question I asked earlier: does it work? If 
you read William James -- and I will be quite honest, I've read 20 pages 
of William James in my life, because it's fairly hard to read -- but if 
you read William James' original work on pragmatism, his whole argument 
is that Americans have a unique philosophical test in the real world: 
does it work? Not: is it theoretically right? Not: has some great person 
said it? Not: is it established wisdom? But: does it work? I'm also going 
to suggest to you that being American is a learned set of principles. 
It's a very important concept. It's not like being French. And it's part 
of what confuses many of our intellectual friends, because a lot of our 
intellectual friends don't quite get it. 
<P>
They keep thinking: well, you were born here. Therefore you're an 
American. No, you're born here. Therefore, you have the legal status of 
being a citizen of the united states. I don't know whether you're an 
American or not till I find out how you function. Because, after all, Jay 
Kim was born in Korea. He is clearly an American. Iliana rose-Letinen was 
born in Cuba. She is clearly an American. Now, how did she become -- and 
they're both, by the way, American in a way that neither could have been 
Japanese or neither could have been French. The reason is found, I think, 
in G.K.. Chesterton. Chesterton was an Englishman who traveled the U.S.. 
and he said: America's the only nation in the world founded on a creed. 
Let me read the exact quote from Chesterton. He says, "America is founded 
on a creed. America is the only nation in the world that is founded on a 
creed. That creed is set forth with dogmatic and even theological 
lucidity in the declaration of independence." 
<P>
I want you to listen carefully to this. "perhaps the only piece of 
practical politics that is also theoretical politics and also great 
literature. It enunciates that all men are equal in their claim to 
justice. That government exists to give them that justice, and that their 
authority is, for that reason, just." Now, Chesterton is saying 
literally, if you don't -- how many of you spent serious time reading the 
declaration of independence in high school? Okay, about half of you. 
Chesterton's argument is that you start with the declaration of 
independence and it begins to define being American, and we'll come back 
to it. Similarly, Margaret Thatcher said, "no other nation has been built 
upon an idea, the idea of liberty." And let me quote from Prime Minister 
Thatcher. She said, "Americans and Europeans alike sometimes forget how 
unique the united states of America is. No other nation has been created 
so swiftly and successfully. No other nation has been built upon an idea, 
the idea of liberty. No other nation has so successfully combined people 
of different races and nations within a single culture. Both the founding 
fathers of the united states and successive waves of immigrants to your 
country were determined to create a new entity. The European nations are 
not and can never be like this. They are the products of history and not 
of philosophy. You can construct a nation on an idea, but you cannot 
reconstruct a nation on the basis of an idea." 
<P>
Her point is -- what she's saying is: why are you French? You're French 
because you are descended from the franks. Why are you American? You're 
American because you start with the declaration of independence, the 
constitution, you learn how to be an American. Radically different ways. 
Now, we're not talking here about lawyer talk. We're not talking about: 
do you have a certificate of citizenship in a polity? We're not talking 
here about geography. I object, for example, to the term "native 
American." We're all native Americans if you're born here. In fact, 
native Americans as used by the counterculture really refers to Asians, 
who happened to come over earlier and mostly walked rather than took 
boats. But we're all native Americans if you were born here. 
<P>
The question is: you can be a United States citizen without knowing much 
about America, but to be an American, I would argue, is a way of being. 
It's a way of thinking. It's a way of approaching it. Now, it's a very 
broad, complex, and some people would say crazy way of being. I mean, 
it's very diverse. I'm not arguing that we all wear little uniforms and 
we're stamped, you know, "made in Disney world." But I am arguing that 
you can tell -- if you go around the planet and you watch people in the 
marketplace, you can pick out the Americans. It's a very different way of 
thinking. Now, George Santayana said it when he said, "to be an American 
is of itself almost a moral condition, an education, and a career." I 
want you to think about this, because what I'm suggesting to you here is 
that you as a citizen have a real obligation. I mean, think about the 
words Santayana used: moral condition, an education, and a career. That 
you live out the process of being an American. 
<P>
Now, what we're going to talk about in large part in the early phase of 
the course is becoming "we," learning American Civilization. I found it 
fascinating when I first began talking about this in public audiences 
about three years ago, the people who responded the most were 
first-generation immigrants. The other day -- and this was a fascinating 
sign of how the world's changed. The other day I was at a speech for 
freshman state legislators, and an Indian-American from India, a woman, 
brown-skinned, about this tall, wearing a sari, who, by the way, had won 
a seat in Wyoming, where she was probably one of the 12 Indian- American 
families in her entire district, she came up to me and she said, "for 30 
years I've been afraid that we were ceasing to be the reason I came here. 
But," she said, "I now have new courage." And her point was she didn't 
come to America to bring Indian civilization with her. She's proud of 
being Indian, she thinks it's a wonderful civilization, but she came to 
America because she wanted herself and her children to be Americans. 
<P>
So this concept of becoming "we." And what really struck me was that each 
generation has two waves of immigrants: geographic, called foreigners, 
and temporal, called children. And that both waves of immigrants have to 
be taught. So "Renewing American Civilization" will be an intellectual 
outline for students, and a practical guide for citizens. And it's 
designed to say: here is how American Civilizations worked. Here are the 
principles of American Civilization. Here's what's worth knowing if you 
want to be an American. And if you want to design solutions for American 
problems or you want to gather up the energy for American opportunities, 
here is a way of doing it based on how Americans work. The course will 
occur in 10 sessions and is based on five books and two documents. This 
is the syllabus: "learning how to prepare for the future." And it 
includes in it the constitution and the declaration of independence, 
which we'll use fairly extensively at key points in the course. In 
addition, we have five books. I think by the way, I assigned a number of 
these to members of congress, and so I'm interested to see how many of 
them read them. 
<P>
First of all, "the Federalist Papers." It comes out in many different 
editions. This particular edition is the penguin classics, but there are 
a lot of different edition. This is actually political pamphlets. 
Remember, "Federalist Papers" were written by John Jay and Alexander 
Hamilton and James Madison as political pamphlets to explain why you 
should vote "yes" on the constitution. Now, for those of you who think of 
the age of 30-second TV ads and nine-second sound bites, educated people 
all over America read this. I mean, everybody can read this, by the way. 
This myth about how the founding fathers were all these geniuses, about 
60 of them were out of three and a half million people. There were also 
probably at least a million people in rural America who could barely 
read. 
<P>
And I'm not suggesting to you that the average person said, "oh, I think 
I'm going to go vote on the Constitution Tuesday. Can I have a copy of 
'the Federalist' to read over the weekend?" But for those people who were 
opinion leaders, these were real publications, and they came out in 
serial form in newspapers, and people sat around the coffee houses and 
argued about them. In addition, we're going to look at the book -- the 
founding fathers tried to create a roman republic. They are very 
conscious of the roman concepts. They wanted what they called an 
aristocracy of virtue, and you'll hear us talk about that. But underneath 
this roman republic, this aristocracy of virtue, classic market-oriented 
democratic America emerged. 
<P>
And as it began to emerge and change -- and I would suggest to you that 
Gordon wood has written the two best books. They're both pretty heavy 
reading. One is on the origins of the American revolution. The other is 
on the radicalism of the American revolution. We're not going to use 
those as reading books, but he gives you the sense that the America that 
Washington and Franklin and Jefferson envisioned was a republican 
aristocracy of virtue by 1830 that had been replaced by the America we 
are, which is a very wide-open, individualistic, democratic society. 
<P>
And in 1831 and 1832, in order to explain the future, a French aristocrat 
visited America and wrote the preeminent book explaining how America 
works, which captured precisely American Civilization as it existed up to 
1965, and it's called, "democracy in America" by Alexis de Tocqueville. 
There are three or four different versions. Again, it's been in print 
ever since. But de Tocqueville, because he was literally going around as 
a tourist simply recording what he was seeing, which was so different 
from Europe, and I quoted from de Tocqueville on Wednesday in my speech 
accepting the Speakership because it was so wonderful. He talked about 
how we were vulgar people. But remember, the word "vulgar" back then 
meant "not aristocratic." And, of course, he was right. Anyone in America 
can rise. So we want you to use "Democracy in America." 
<P>
In addition, we want you to use "Creating A New Civilization: The 
Politics Of The Third Wave," by Alvin and Heidi Toffler. They are very, 
very important folks who have really thought through where they're at. In 
fact, they've thought about we're now at the beginning of what they call 
a third wave. The first wave -- we'll talk about this later. The first 
wave is agriculture. The second wave is industry. The third wave is 
information. It's a fairly short book, but it's very, very helpful. 
Fourth, we're going to use "the effective executive," paperback edition, 
by Peter Drucker. This book is the most effective book ever written on 
how to be effective. And an effective book on being effective is worth 
your reading. And I'll talk at great length about that later. 

Finally, a new work by Don Eberly, the editor, "building a community of 
citizens: civil society in the 21st century." This book goes back in a 
series of readings and reestablishes the connection to how America really 
worked in its healthiest periods and what the principles are of a 
successful America. Now, we're going to take those books and we're going 
to apply them in a series of 10 classes, and the 10 class topics start 
with American Civilization, which is what we're working on today, the 
concept of: what are we trying to deal with? What is American 
Civilization? Then we're going to go -- the second class will be actually 
pillar one. We use the term "pillar" to elicit the idea that there are 
five pillars of American Civilization. And pillar one is the historic 
lessons of American Civilization. And again, Dr. Minnix and I have a bias 
which we share with Dr. Hanser in designing this that to know history, to 
understand history, to study history, is helpful. We'll spend a lot of 
time next week on that concept. 
<P>
Pillar number two, which will be the third course, is personal strength. 
And we'll argue there that you cannot have a free society without a 
tremendous emphasis on personal strength, because in the end, freedom 
comes down to the individual. And so if you don't have the personal 
strength to be free, you, by definition, can't remain free very long. 
<P>
Pillar three is entrepreneurial free enterprise, the spirit of going out 
and getting it done. Now, this does not just mean marketplace. But 
whether it's somebody founding the red cross or it's somebody founding 
Wal-mart or it's somebody inventing a new breakthrough in medicine, the 
spirit of getting the job done, of taking on the responsibility of being 
creative, pillar four, which is the fifth class, is the spirit of 
invention and discovery. Not science, not technology. I started out that 
way, and Jay Keyworth, President Reagan's former science advisor, said to 
me, "you know, that isn't right. This is not about science and 
technology. This is about a way of thinking." 
<P>
The sixth course is going to be pillar number five, quality as defined by 
Edwards Deming. Edwards Deming is the man who taught the Japanese the 
concept of quality. Point at this stage that I want you to just stop and 
think about is that you now have five pillars. When we get through those 
five classes -- this opening class lays out the whole course. We then 
spend five classes, one on each pillar, and what we're trying to 
understand: why does America work? What is there about America that is 
American? Why has it been successful? Then we're going to go to courses 
of application, to the lessons on application. 
<P>
Number seven is going to be: looking at the third wave and American 
Civilization. If you're entering an information age, if this is a change 
as big as the shift from hunting-gathering to agriculture, or the shift 
from agriculture to industry, then what does that mean for American 
Civilization? How do we Americans do it, and what will America be like? 
<P>
Class eight is: creating American jobs in the world market. If we truly 
have entered a revolution in economics, if we are no longer primarily a 
national economy, but instead, every job is related to the world market, 
and both in imports and exports, our life is tied to the fabric and the 
rhythm of the world, then as Americans, how do we make sure that we are 
at the top end of that world market? How do we have the best jobs? How do 
we have the most creativity? How do we have the best take-home pay? How 
do we have the greatest range of choices so we can take the best 
vacations? Very important questions if, in fact, we've entered a brand 
new era. Lesson nine is going to be on replacing the culture of violence 
and poverty with a culture of productivity and safety. 
<P>
Now, notice here what -- how we focused that. We're talking about 
cultures. To live in poverty and violence is a cultural behavior. It's a 
set of learned habits and skills. It's a way of being. But to live in an 
area which is productive and safe is also a cultural behavior. It's a set 
of attitudes and habits. It's a way of being. And part of our argument in 
the course is going to be that starting in the mid '60s, we allowed a 
culture -- we actually paid for a culture -- I'll give you, again, an 
example I just happened to learn two days ago. 
<P>
I testified at the ways and means committee at the opening session of 
this year, and I said, you know, I'd been told that under the earned 
income tax credit, if you earn $11,000 a year and you marry somebody who 
earns $11,000 a year -- this is an interesting minor test for you for a 
second. I want you to just think about this, okay? Two people, think of 
it as yourself, you're earning 11 grand. That's your total income. You 
run into somebody you really like earning 11 grand. You get married. 
Anyway, that's $22,000 a year joint income, right? They confirmed in the 
hearing -- this is so -- what I'm about to tell you is so dumb, I can't 
believe it's true, even though I've now been told in public at the ways 
and means committee this is true. $22,000 total income, what would you 
guess is the financial cost annually in the change -- the earned income 
tax credit says if you're below a certain income level, that we will, in 
effect, rebate a tax credit to you to bring your income -- your take-home 
pay up. You all with me so far? You all understand the concept? What 
would you guess the united states government charges you for the act of 
marriage per year at $22,000? Very close. $4,600 a year. Yes. It's real 
money. And then you have of course politicians who say, "gee, we have too 
many births out of wedlock."  And your government wants to encourage you 
to get married by taking from you 25% of your income. 
<P>
>> if you don't get married, they get you the other way with the child 
support guidelines. If you don't get married, they take 21% of your 
income. And if you do stay married and remarry somebody else, they take 
the 25% right off the top, then another 22%. >> are you meaning to 
suggest that the system is rigged so that it doesn't work? >> yes. >> are 
you beginning to understand the underlying concept of this course? >> 
yeah. >> notice what I'm saying here again. I want to go back to this 
concept we use. Pragmatism: does it work? Don't tell me theory. Don't 
tell me abstract intellectuality. Tell me history. In the real world, is 
it working? And you go up to a real-world person -- and you'll see us get 
into this in the second hour -- and you say to them, "tell me why you 
aren't married." And they say, "because I'm not stupid." And you say to 
them, "what do you mean?" And they say, "it would cost me $4,600." You 
know, from my perspective, my girlfriend and I, from your perspective, my 
boyfriend and I, but we're doing okay. We're both getting all the money. 
We don't mind paying $50 for a wedding license, but $4,600 every year? 10 
years is $46,000. Maybe you'd like to test yourself in terms of your 
moral strength here. At what point is it enough? You say, "hey, what's 
the big deal?" My society's signal to me isn't: get married. My society's 
signal to me is: don't be dumb. How do you measure being dumb? In the 
real world. 
<P>
Now, the last one we're going to do is then say: all right, if America is 
changing but it is still at its heart a great country with good people, 
if America has a tradition and a set of patterns that work, if we're 
entering the world market, if we're entering the third wave information 
age, then what should citizenship and community be like in the 21st 
century? And that's a very important question. Because, you see, we have 
gradually shrunk citizenship to mean: do you vote? And you'll discover as 
you read the materials in this course that that is explicitly wrong. That 
in a free society, citizenship is 365 days a year, except for leap year 
when it's 366, and it's much richer and deeper than: do you vote? And 
it's not just the citizen and the state. This is one of the key points I 
want to make that you'll see really does change things. What you've had 
in America has been a debate that says: here is the private sector. 
<P>
And we've often talked about this as the right. I think I'm actually 
putting these on wrong in terms of where they are on the board. Here is 
government, by which we normally mean Washington. Okay? In de 
Tocqueville's description of America, there is this vast, rich middle 
section which is community. I mean, the boy scouts aren't really private 
sector. The boy scouts or the girl scouts or the YMCA or the salvation 
army or Bnai Brith or a thousand different groups are efforts -- you 
know, I'm a big -- I'm a nut about zoos, as you'll learn over the course 
of the next 10 weeks, and zoo Atlanta is a privatized community 
institution. It's not really a profit-making business, but it's no longer 
-- it's actually under lease from the city of Atlanta, but it is run by a 
private corporation, and as a result, is, in fact, a dramatically better 
zoo than if it was run by the government. 
<P>
Disney world, of course, which is the largest single site of 
entertainment in the world, is a -- it's private sector. It's a 
profit-making institution. Callaway gardens is a community institution. 
It's a nonprofit foundation established by the Callaway family. Kennesaw 
mountain battlefield park is a government institution. And what we're 
going to argue in part in this course is that as this has grown bigger 
and bigger, it's crowded out more and more of what works in America and 
replaced it with bureaucracies that fail. And so what we're going to try 
to do in this course is take you back to the very beginning, walk you 
through the principles of American Civilization, lay out how they apply 
in the real world, measure them pragmatically. Does it work? 
<P>
And then talk about reinventing an America, renewing an American 
Civilization by reestablishing the legitimate relationships, shrinking 
the failed bureaucracies of the systems that objectively don't work. I 
mean, this is not right or left. This is not ideological. This is 
pragmatic. You're paying "x" number of dollars. Are you getting the 
result you want? We found out -- last year we had hearings, and we found 
out that the supplemental security income program was sending checks to 
alcoholics to liquor stores. There was one store in Denver that had 40 
alcoholics on the roll. The liquor stores would cash the checks for them. 
Now, I would argue that a great nation with a good people doesn't send 
checks to the alcoholics at liquor stores. They can drink themselves to 
death. We may be extraordinarily generous helping them get off their 
alcoholism. We may want to do many things to help them improve their 
lives. But giving them the monthly opportunity for a drinking binge to 
get killed is wrong. And so we need to think through this scale of 
change. 
<P>
And what makes the -- what makes this course, I think, unique is not only 
do we assert that America is multiethnic, but one civilization. Not only 
do we assert that it's basically good, which in many camps is to be 
considered a radical and probably an idea so heretical you could have a 
riot. But we're asserting that it is a learned set of principles, and 
that the best way to learn the principles is historic, not theoretical. 
It's by actually going out and saying, "all right, how did they do it?" 
You know, when you talk about "let's invent government," if you immerse 
yourself in the founding fathers, you are studying people who, by the 
way, weren't all that brilliant automatically. 
<P>
And let me give you just one last example so you can understand this 
pattern of thinking and learning and over time seeing how things evolve. 
Well, you might someday want to figure out a way, again, to privatize it 
in the sense of private sector, not to find a way to make it a community 
function rather than a government function. The question's legitimate. 
You do it for anything. I would argue that virtually everything should be 
on the table to at least think about. Thinking about something can be 
very bold and daring. Doing it ought to be cautious and careful. But for 
the purpose of a course, we ought to be allowed to think about almost 
anything. But remember, we tend to look backwards. 1789, they did good. 
They swear in Washington. Big deal. Founded a system which is the longest 
standing free society in the history of the world. Remember, the debate 
begins around 1760. The first continental congress is 1774. I'm doing all 
of this off my head, so, Dr. Minnix, if I get it wrong, just feel free to 
yell at me. Because I'm -- I've not looked at these numbers, but I think 
this is a helpful thing if we look at. By 1776, we've declared 
independence. We go through waves down here of writing state 
constitutions. Sometimes as many, I believe, as five or six. This will be 
a useful paper for somebody just to look at. But you'll find that a lot 
of the founding fathers had written two or three or four state 
constitutions. Finally -- and they write the articles of confederation, 
which, remember, failed. So by the time they come around to writing the 
constitution, which is 1787, I believe -- as I say, this was off the top 
of my head -- what you have by here is a group of very experienced people.
<P>
 And by the way, we talk about professional politicians, these guys were 
all professional politicians. Washington won elections from the 1760s on. 
Jefferson was governor of Virginia. He was a consistent elected 
politician. Madison was an elected politician. Franklin had been active 
in Pennsylvania politics for 50 years. But they were other things. They 
were also businessmen. They were also farmers. They were also generals. 
They were also writers. They weren't narrowly professional. It wasn't the 
only thing they did, and they fairly often left office and came back. It 
was a different world. There's nothing wrong with studying the profession 
of how free people govern themselves. There's everything wrong with 
selling out your values because you want an office. But my point, to give 
you heart, is: we're probably around here. So there's no reason to say to 
ourselves, "we have to have a higher standard than they had. Let's do the 
constitution by 1775 or, boy, are we failures." Life occurs organically, 
and we'll come back to this.  Over time, you can accomplish many things 
you can't accomplish in the matter of a day or two. 
<P>
I think we have a minute or two before we have to take a quick break. Any 
questions or -- I've thrown a fair amount at you to start though. 
>> you say for the answers you go back and you look at history. But 
there's so many people who have different perspectives on what really 
happened in history. You have to read all of them. Being free -- I'm 
going to come back to you again and again with two concepts: life is 
hard. Freedom is frustrating. And if you don't start out every morning 
and understand that, that's part of why I'm so cheerful. The worst that 
-- I mean, the worst thing, I get up in the morning, I figure life's 
going to be hard, so when life is hard, I go, "see? Proved I was right." 
And I get up in the morning I say, "to be free is to be frustrated," so I 
go into meetings, I get frustrated. I go, "see?" I'm very serious. 
<P>
I had a meeting yesterday morning with all the senior staff of the house 
republican party, including all of the committee staff directors, and I 
said to them, "the next eight months are going to be really hard. So when 
it's really hard, say to yourself, 'ain't it great being in the 
majority?' don't whine. Just relax, go home, take a break, come in the 
next morning and go, 'wow, this is neat. It's going to be really hard all 
day.'" and so -- because you're coming to the core of this, and we're 
about to run out of time, but this is really the core of the course. We 
can have a partnership in America. Partnership means we both have to do 
it. We can't have a system where people say, "I've got this great idea: 
I'll vote for you, I'll do nothing, you take care of me." It won't 
survive. It will die. 

So a free society, I really am allowed to say to you, "maybe you haven't 
read enough," and then you've just got to go read more. Now, you can read 
more in lots of ways. Or maybe you ought to go find a good historian like 
Dr. Minnix and say, "which two books would you read?" But I'll also tell 
you, just as in life, you can walk around this room a week from now and 
get different opinions from different people about each other, same 
thing's true in history, because history is just a reflection of life. 
Now, let me ask very quickly: how long are we taking a break for? We have 
a 10-minute break. This is all brand new to me. It's very exciting. And 
after 10 minutes, we've got to be back in here, because we're live on 
mind extension university, so we can't just hang out. Thank you very, 
very much. See you in a couple minutes. 
<P>
(10-minute break) 
<P>
Let me tell you again a very key principle here that makes this very 
different from a lot of what you're going to see. I'm going to share with 
you over the course of the ten weeks, very specific things that in my 
experience work. I'm going to talk to you later on today by what I mean 
by work. What I want you to think about for a second -- my credentials 
for being here are several. I'm a Ph.D..... in history. I've taught for 
years, I'm a national leader. I've been working on the question of 
self-government for 36 years, and I think you can make an objective 
argument better than we could the first time we taught the course, that 
there's some evidence that I actually know some things that work based on 
the fact that it's worked. But the principles I'm going to tell you about 
and share with you are designed for you, because the core of my belief 
here, the reason I'm teaching it as a course, is that a free society 
operates based on each free person.  So that if we're entering an 
information age -- the reason I'm sharing Drucker with you which is "the 
Effective Executive," is Drucker's argument that in the information age, 
every citizen is an executive, every person -- you can literally figure 
this out. 
<P>
Two examples: it has been estimated that as late as 17th century Britain 
if you lived in a small village and you were a peasant the total amount 
of new information you got in a lifetime was less than the Sunday "New 
York Times." That in your lifetime, the total amount of new ideas, new 
information, you know, what happened to King John -- who's King John? I 
mean, people had very limited oral traditions of varying local 
information. You're now in a totally different world, the number of 
situations you could make. Well, it's time once again to plow, it's time 
once again to harvest. I guess once we invented canning, which is 
actually a product of the French revolution, I guess it's time to can. 
Okay? Now what happens? You wake up in the morning. Which of the 60 
channels would you like to watch if you want to go to your cable or your 
satellite receiver as opposed to putting in a VCR or listening to a CD or 
putting on your record -- or your radio. Or what would you rather do? 
None of those, because you are now going to work on your computer 
terminal. Or do you want to do none of that because you are going to go 
over to your exercise club, or you don't really do that because you golf. 
I mean, it's very interesting. You could easily take a day and just make 
a list of all of the option choices. 
<P>
This is why Toffler's first great book was called "future shock," because 
Alvin and Heidi argued, what's going to happen to people is you are used 
to making five decisions a day, now you're going to make 3,000. Okay. 
Furthermore, the argument we're going to make is if truly we're a great 
country with a great people, then in order to solve problems you don't 
want to hire the smartest person to be President, the smartest person to 
be secretary of health and human services, you want to figure out what's 
smart and you want to communicate it to every one of you. By the way, 
this is why we beat nazi Germany. I mean, go back and see the movie 
"sergeant York" with Gary cooper. Go back and look at any world war ii 
movie made before 1965. What you had was, you picked up people off the 
streets, they were normal Americans. But of course they knew how to use a 
telephone, they knew how to drive a vehicle, they knew how to take 
orders, they knew how to give orders, they organized -- they are 
self-organizing systems, so guess what? 
<P>
The finest tactical army in the world the Wermacht lost, lost to a bunch 
of people who were not professional soldiers, who it knew couldn't beat. 
Our theory was you just get good Americans and they go out and do good 
things; and they don't do it all that good the first day, but they keep 
learning. And after a while, no matter how smart the other team is, if we 
keep learning and they don't learn, we will beat them eventually. Now, so 
I'm going to start with -- I'm going to share with you two essential 
systems for leadership, remembering that when I say leadership, I mean 
you. Every citizen is a leader in a free society. So I'm talking about 
every citizen. You could call it citizenship. Since you wouldn't be near 
as excited if I called it citizenship, I decided to call it leadership. 
<P>
Since I'm now speaker of the house you probably think I actually know 
something. I'm going to show you an essential system for planning an 
essential system for leading. There are two different behaviors: planning 
is in the end done inside you. Planning, in the end, is done inside you. 
You can have a planning committee but sooner or later it comes to let's 
put something on the board and that's inside. It can be inside the 
committee. Or it can literally be you listen to the whole committee then 
everybody else takes a break and you write the first draft. But leading 
is by definition outside you, for a very practical reason. If I lead and 
you don't follow, I ain't leading. So if I'm going to lead and you're 
going to follow -- in other words, I can plan inside me for me, but if 
I'm going to lead you to follow me, I've got to find some connection 
between us, that gives you a reason to want to come with me. You all with 
me so far? 
<P>
So the first thing I am going to teach you is inside. The second thing is 
by definition outside. Now, the model for planning is four layers and 
it's four words: vision, strategies, projects and tactics. I absolutely 
unequivocally want you to learn these four words in this order. It is a 
hierarchy. That means the top one dominates the other three. The second 
one dominates the other two. Now what do I mean by that? First of all, 
I'll use a very simple couple of examples. What is your vision of dinner? 
Okay? We say, what's your vision of dinner? We are going to do dinner 
tonight. Dinner is a our project, we're now planning, I don't care what 
you make. What's your vision of dinner? 
<P>
>> fried chicken and potatoes. >> 
<P>
fried chicken and potatoes. There's a good southern answer. What's your 
vision of dinner? 
<P>
>> roast and carrots and potatoes. >> 
<P>
roast and carrots and potatoes. Big on potatoes this year. What's your 
vision of dinner? 
<P>
>> pizza. >> 
<P>
pizza. Okay. Now, my writing is fairly bad, but I'm a doctor after all. 
This is the vision level answer, all right. If we do this long enough, 
you'll start to get hungry. Now, what are some strategies we could use in 
order to achieve our vision? Ah, see, the word "strategies" stopped you. 
Strategies, a planned technique for achieving a result. >> shopping. >> 
<P>
shopping. What do you mean by shopping? 
<P>
>> pick up the ingredients. >> 
<P>
now grocery shopping, grocery store, right. We're going to build a matrix 
here, any of these answers could go under any of these three solutions. 
You follow me? So put this across, we're not saying you have to go 
grocery shopping for fried chicken, because of course there are other 
techniques, right. But you could use the grocery store. What else could 
you do? 
<P>
>> reservations. >> 
<P>
he stole my answer. 
<P>
>> this is a non-sexist course, I'm not automatically going to favor you 
just because you are a woman, it was a tie. What does reservations mean? 
<P>
>> call a restaurant. >> 
<P>
telling you are coming. 
<P>
>> you go to the kind of restaurants that take reservations. Oh, okay. 
We'll put down restaurant. We'll have two alternative strategies here, 
fancy and normal. Am I right here? Are we -- okay. How many of you would 
not have said reservations? I just want to find out rapidly we can get 
into class warfare here. Now, what's another technique? Take out. Is this 
late 20th century America or what? 
<P>
Notice -- by the way we're in Waleska, Georgia, at Reinhardt College in a 
region which was historically what? Rural, rural and -- 
<P>
>> farming. >> 
<P>
how come they didn't go out and get their own chicken, huh? 
<P>
>> notice none of you even said it? It didn't occur to you. We're in the 
second or third largest chicken producing area in the united states. 
Let's go out in the backyard, right, lots of luck. I used to teach 
students who thought chickens came in plastic. They had no idea there was 
actually a bird attached to it. Actually at West Georgia I had a 
professor who had a class, it was a psychology class that actually killed 
chickens, it was very strange. You begin to see how you begin to build a 
pattern here. So you now have your vision, but if we take vision number 
one, fried chicken, and we don't teach the vision and we simply say, 
let's go out, and we end up, -- who had the pizza -- we end up at Pizza 
Hut, we're not going to get your vision. You all with me? You see how it 
begins to relate? Okay. 
<P>
Now, projects. And this is a key concept. This is the essence of 
management, which is management, by the way, is different than 
leadership. Management is the effective use of resources already created. 
Leadership is the creation of leadership and is the creation of resources 
and using them the right way. There is a big difference between the two, 
okay. So management is using something right, leadership is making sure 
it's being used for the right reason. Very big difference. Projects are a 
definable, delegatable achievement. Achievement, defining the achievement 
so you can delegate, not the process. So you don't say at this level, go 
shopping. Because after all you could go shopping and come back with a 
dress. You say, I would like you to go to Kentucky fried chicken and get 
dinner for six people. That's a definable, delegatable achievement. 
<P>
Or I would like you to call Domino's and have them deliver by 6:00 this 
evening. You see how you define it, and you are defining the end state, 
what is it that has occurred if I've successfully done my job? So this is 
a definable, delegatable achievement. Then at the bottom you have 
tactics. Now, tactics are daily behavior. What do you do at the actual 
point of contact? For example, we're going to go to pizza hut, you put on 
blue jeans, you're going to Nikolai's roof in Atlanta, you probably don't 
put on blue jeans because they won't let you in. So you have to figure 
out what is tactically acceptable. You are on a very limited budget, you 
are closer to here. You're on an unlimited budget, we're here and we're 
at a big fancy gourmet restaurant. 
<P>
But, I mean, think about it: you want to run McDonald's, you don't hire 
people to wear tuxes. You want to run Nikolai's roof so it looks like a 
late 19th century, early 20th century czarist restaurant. You don't hire 
people to dress like they do at McDonald's. So there is a very important 
relationship between this and this. I mean I have a permanent problem. I 
have a vision of myself as a thinner person. I have two tactics, I eat 
ice cream and I drink beer. Even at 51, I am not mature enough to 
reconcile these two problems. Okay? You all understand the concept now of 
vision, strategies, projects and tactics? This is very central as an 
intellectual tool for everything else we're going to do, because it 
allows you to figure out which of these layers are you talking about when 
you read a newspaper. Or you discuss an issue and when you try to solve a 
problem. And it gives you the ability now to do planning in a very 
powerful way. Now the second part of this, you've got a plan here, you 
think you know what you want to do. 
<P>
Now I'm going to teach you the second part. Can I just get you to do this 
while I'm talking to save some time. The second thing I want to do is 
walk you through the leading part of this now. We have our plan and I 
want to make a real point here. People who've never led, teach leading as 
though it this autonomous -- I'm up here, I'm the leader, look at me. 
That's nonsense. That's the opposite of real leadership. What I'm going 
to teach you absolutely works. And again, I think I have visible proof 
this week that I'm talking from a background of experience. But it is the 
opposite of the stupid way we currently teach leadership and it is 
opposite of the elite culture's depiction of how you lead. Effective 
leadership is four words: they are a process, they are not a hierarchy, 
that is the first word comes first, but it's equally as important to the 
other three: they are listen, learn, help and lead. 
<P>
Now ideally, we have them on the Chyron because it doesn't fit the TV 
screen right. I normally write them so they are across like this. I would 
normally say: listen, learn, help and lead. By the way, when I give my 
speeches, those of you who watch me speak, I speak from notes. The way I 
normally represent it, I do this to remind me it's a hierarchy, and then 
I'l do this. First you listen to people. Notice how I started, what do 
you want for dinner? When you listen to people you genuinely listen and 
this is, by the way, a very hard thing to learn. Lots of people listen 
transactionally. All of you have been to a cocktail party parties or to 
events where you listen transactionally, right. You're standing there, 
pretending to listen while thinking how do I get away from this idiot? 
That doesn't count. That's not listening. 
<P>
I mean, you try to understand, why do they say what they're saying? What 
do they mean? If they said pizza then they really don't mean fettucini. 
You have to actually listen, which means you got to stop yourself. You 
got to discipline yourself to truly listen and if you don't understand 
them, the trick is to then say, gee, I didn't quite get that. So you have 
to get them, draw them out, ask them questions. As a general principle, 
we're a lone enough society if you want to listen to people and learn 
from them, they love talking to you. If you listen to them and learn from 
them you can almost always help them. You help them, first of all, 
transactionally, they listen, they must think I'm okay. You learn second 
because you just have a different viewpoint. You can actually share with 
them. Here's the feedback on what I heard. You may know something with 
them they don't know. Oh, you want pizza? There is a place right down the 
street. 
<P>
Now in a rational society if people know that you're willing to listen to 
them, you're willing to learn from them, you actively are trying to help 
them, then they want you to lead. Notice how backwards that is from the 
way people normally think it works? Leadership is not "I have this great 
vision, follow me." Leadership is, "I think I've got a vision, but before 
I tell you mine, what's yours?" If I were trying to lead this room I'd 
start by spending over an hour listening to you telling me your vision 
and I would list all your visions up here, then I would summarize and try 
to bring together the best of the visions. And then I'd say, "now that we 
have all invested in our vision, how do you think we could implement it?" 
By the time that process was over you would want me to be your leader 
because you'd know I was willing to put in the time and energy and the 
patience to make sure then you were part of what you're being led to. 
Yes. 
<P>
>> what's the -- >> depends on the circumstances. 
<P>
>> you find out what direction the group is getting it from, that old 
joke about leadership. >> 
<P>
I almost never do that. I think that's nonsense, I think that's 
counterfeit. It also depends on how important it is. If the group says we 
don't like the fact Gingrich drinks beer, we're into diet coke this week, 
I don't care. I mean, we'll do diet coke. But if it was, let's go into 
cannibalism, I mean, you got to draw lines. Again, a leader who imposes 
the detail is stupid. What you ought to be is generous in sharing with 
people as much as you can so that everybody has ownership. So if you 
really want to help the poor, part of it has to be listening. I'm going 
to get into this a lot when we get to that session. You cannot offer a 
solution that people can't apply in their lives. Back to pragmatism. Will 
it work? Well, you don't know cause it ain't you. I mean, you may have 
the neatest idea in the world but is it neat for the real person in the 
real world doing the real thing? So it really is constant, all right. 
<P>
Now this next section I thought I'd toss in given all the coverage of 
recent weeks, I thought -- for two reasons, one is I figure this is the 
best way to get it all out in the open. But the second is, I think one of 
the things we undervalue in the modern world is just sheer experience. I 
was turned on to this by Gary will in his book "the declaration of 
independence." He describes George Washington, and he says no modern 
political scientist or historian can fully appreciate Washington because 
the most important fact of Washington doesn't count in the modern 
academic world. It was his character. This was the man you could build a 
country on. And since character doesn't exist in the modern world, you 
can't count it. So you can't value it. So you can't understand him. So he 
becomes this funny guy with wooden teeth. And it's very interesting, 
Flexner in the paperback edition of his one volume biography of 
Washington talks bitterly about how Washington has been degraded by 
modern cynicism. Says this was a man so noble, so incredible, so 
unbelievable in ways we can't measure and therefore we make fun of him 
which tells you about the pathologies of our society, not George 
Washington. 
<P>
So I thought I would start with this notion -- I'm going to make a couple 
of assertions that are unacademic. I am the speaker of the house. I have 
won and lost elections for a long time. I have studied history for a long 
time. I actually know a fair amount. I have raised two children. And so I 
want to do two things here: I want to tell you my biases. Because a lot 
of people say how can you have somebody who's a national figure teach? 
After all, they have biases. I'm going to argue that not only should you 
know the biases of professor Gingrich, but I want to argue that all 
professors have biases. So it's good to share with you the biases. I also 
want to give you at the beginning of this course the sense that this is a 
unique course, that far from what the university system did when the 
board of regents said we should let no elected officials teach, which has 
got to be the dumbest single rule I've seen. We should be going in the 
opposite direction. 
<P>
I mean, if you want to have a business program and a local millionaire 
who made it in one generation is willing to share with your students the 
fact that this is how you get to be a millionaire, maybe even if they 
don't have a Ph.d.  It's a good course. You know, Bill Gates would like 
to do a course on inventing companies, it would be okay. Even though -- 
he is a drop out, didn't get his college degree, just made $7 billion or 
$30 billion, whatever the number is, okay. Now, here's some of my biases. 
First of all, you have to understand my biases are largely created 
through 51 years of living, experience and reflecting. I really value 
pragmatism. If you really want to understand my ideology, it is that I'm 
an American pragmatist. The "American" is the important modifier. I am 
pragmatic within the American experience. I was born in central 
Pennsylvania, which is a very work- oriented Amish Pennsylvania Dutch 
region. If you saw the movie "witness" it gave you a really good flavor. 
These are people who work very hard. 
<P>
So I come out of a work ethic that's very intense. I worked in my 
childhood. We believed in work. My family believed in work. They thought 
it was noble. They thought any job is a good job. When you hear somebody 
say, well, that's a pan -- that's a hamburger flipping job. You know, 
that's somebody that doesn't understand American. Any job is noble in 
America. Any job is better than welfare. Any job is better than doing 
nothing, and it's better to work when you're young. A recent "wall street 
journal" paper that interviewed a first generation millionaires, the 
average, the average started work before they were ten. They ran -- 
delivered newspapers, they ran lemonade stands, they learned how to have 
a market. They learned to deal with customers. They learned to discipline 
themselves to show up very early. 
<P>
My aunt Loma, my aunt Louise and my grandma Dougherty had a lot to do 
with training me. I am a product in many ways of very strong women. My 
grandma Dougherty had been a teacher and because of the modern 
certification techniques, she only had two years of college. When they 
said you had to have four years of teaching, she quit teaching. I showed 
up and I was her only class, so I got 30 students' worth of attention and 
she beat into me how to read by the time I was 4. My aunt Louise and 
uncle Bruce -- my uncle Bruce was the garage attendant for in the state 
of Pennsylvania. He's the guy who checked the cars out. That meant he had 
access to the Pennsylvania state library which was the largest library in 
central Pennsylvania. So at 13 years of age I had a library card and 
stack permit and I would spend my summers wondering through this giant 
library, which is a reminder, it doesn't matter who you are, it matters 
what you care about. It cares what you're willing to do. You could've 
said uncle Bruce was only a garage attendant. No, he was a very loving 
uncle who did what it was he could do. My uncle Cal Troutman, who was 
aunt Loma's husband, was a very partisan Republican and had been a 
precinct worker since the 1920's. 
<P>
And I grew up in a Theodore Roosevelt-Gifford Pinchot Republicanism which 
ironically was the conservation republicans. I used to teach in a studies 
program. My family's -- I have a broad extended family, my families 
generally were without money, but they were not poor. They would never 
have occurred to them to think they were poor. They just didn't have 
money. They were middle class except there wasn't much cash at the end of 
the week. Very important psychological distinction. We had a very strong 
extended family. A lot of my education was sitting around the kitchen 
table listening to all my older relatives talk to each other in a very 
rich oral tradition. For example, I had a grandfather, great grandfather 
Triester -- Triester valley, which is below state college, in a poker 
game in 1903 when he was drunk, which led my grandmother to hate alcohol. 
I mean, you learn these things. You learn these stories, again in 
history. You learn how did we get here, who are we, what are the lessons 
of life. It was a very sustaining family. Now, both my fathers were 
basically foster children. My mother was divorced and remarried. I'm 
adopted. I was born a McPherson, my stepfather is Gingrich, but he was 
adopted.  He lived as a foster child till he was 16. 
<P>
When I talk about strengthening the family, it's not because I'm some 
upper middle class country club guy from a perfect family with a perfect 
background, I'm divorced and remarried. But it's because I lived through 
these societies. I mean, I understand we're talking about human beings, 
we're talking about trying to find ways to be human. I think probably the 
most important formative moment in my life when I was about 3 or 4 years 
of age, I saw my great grandfather as he was in the process of dying. I 
didn't see him actually die, but he was very, very sick. I watched him 
being cared for and for some reason it got through to me that that's the 
way it is. I mean, sooner or later, you end. So at a very young age I 
became a very sober child, and I concluded life is hard. But to quote 
Faulkner's Nobel prize winning speech "mankind will endure and prevail," 
that is, yes, it's hard, but you can make it work for you. If you're 
prepared to start accepting it's hard, you can do it. 
<P>
Charles Krauthheimer, who is a great national correspondent -- you may 
have seen him on television -- one of the smartest guys around, dove the 
into a swimming pool at 19 and became a paraplegic, he's in a wheelchair. 
Yet Krauthheimer today, you'll see him on national television, you'll see 
him doing things. It's a reminder to me when I see Krauthheimer and how 
hard he has worked to have a full life and I run into somebody who is 
able-bodied, has no problems and cannot walk from their apartment we have 
given them to their public library a block away to borrow a free book, I 
try to figure out how do I get Krautheimer's psychological zest and 
commitment for life in every American, because that's what I grew up with 
the sense of you get knocked on your back, get up. You get knocked on 
your front, get up. You fall down, get up. What do you mean, you wouldn't 
get back up. It may go back again to this work ethic concept. That 
established my prejudices about work and struggle. I'm very tough-minded 
about what you have to do to be a free person. 
<P>
I think that character matters. I think this whole debate over the bell 
curve is silly, it's nonsense, it's a bunch of academics. And right wing 
academics are as dumb as left wing academics. And the fact is what 
matters in life is your character not your i. Q. And group IQ's are 
irrelevant. I don't want to know how well whites score. I want to know 
how well you work. Are you willing to show up? And I don't want to know 
that you could in theory learn very fast except you are a drug addict and 
you are unwilling to do anything while the person next to you learns much 
slower but, by the way, they put in nine hours a day and they are totally 
reliable. So guess which one I want to hire? 
<P>
So all this stuff about IQ is I think nonsense. Tell me about your 
character. Tell me whether or not you are willing to learn. Tell me 
whether or not you are willing to do things. In addition, I was taught 
very early that persistence defeats all other characteristics in 
politics. A wonderful newspaper man named Paul walker, who adopted me and 
he was my mentor when I was young, gave me one time an article about 
Lincoln's five defeats, and I carried it in my wallet for years, because 
I couldn't guarantee I was smarter. I couldn't guarantee I was prettier. 
I couldn't guarantee I was more articulate. I could guarantee I'd get up 
earlier. I'd work longer and I'd never stop. I got defeated twice. I ran 
for five years and there were long days when it was very lonely and I was 
very scared. And I'd pull out that article and I think it's okay, just 
keep going. 
<P>
And so I have a very high value of persistence. I really do believe 
freedom is frustrating. I also believe it's very, very dangerous to 
protect a free society. My dad served in Korea and I went as an army 
brat, I went to see "the sands of Iwo Jima" four times in one day. If you 
ever see the movie, it's john Wayne as a marine drill sergeant. He is a 
very lonely and he's very tough because he's having to do to these young 
people what they have to do learn to survive on the battlefield and at 
the end of the movie he gets killed. And I think it absolutely imprinted 
on me the idea that you've got to be prepared to sacrifice everything for 
your country if your country's going to survive. And part of what I see 
public life is about is the survival of your country. We then lived in 
fort Riley and I didn't even think about it until I was preparing this 
class, but the people who taught me, I was nine or ten years of age and I 
was hanging around with my dad and his friends, the people who taught me 
about life had served in World War II in Korea, they believe there's a 
term hard training, easy mission; easy training hard mission. I would 
argue that's what's wrong with modern schools for the poor. Schools need 
to be tough so life gets easy, when schools are easy, life is tough. 
<P>
And these guys, I didn't realize until I was thinking this through last 
week, these guys were all tough because they'd all been through real 
combat and they'd all been real problems and they knew if you didn't 
train right and you didn't care enough for your men to be tough on them, 
they were going to die. I just acquired that when I was nine or ten years 
of age by hanging out with them, listening to my dad talking, going out 
in the field with these guys occasionally and watching what they did. 
Then we moved to France and lived there during the Algerian civil war. 
There was 100% inflation. 1957 and 1958. They paid us in script. They 
didn't give us u. S. Dollars because it would have destroyed the French 
currency. So I was a young kid by this stage, I'm 13-14 years old, I'm 
being paid in this funny money. We're living on the French economy. I'm 
playing with kids who's parents who were killed in World War II. We went 
to school past World War II bomb damage. And then in the decisive moment 
probably of my live, we went to the battlefield of Verdun, which was the 
largest battlefield of World War I. I saw damage done in 1916 that had 
not been repaired. 42 years later. 
<P>
And I began to think about, you see Bosnia, you see Rwanda, I began to 
think about my hometown. What would it be like in America? What's it 
worth to not have it happen? I was once asked by Edward teller, the 
father of the hydrogen bomb, how hard would I work for my family to 
survive after a nuclear war? It's a good question to ask yourself. A 
nuclear war occurs. How hard would you work to survive? And I said, "you 
do everything." He said, "fine." "doesn't it make more sense to do it now 
so it doesn't occur?" And for some reason it got -- it penetrated me 
totally because it was the only morally correct answer. In the same way 
we faced, I think in the spring of 1958, the concept of the death of 
civilization. That summer we moved from Orleans, France, to Stuttgart 
Germany. Literally, the day we arrived in Stuttgart, we walked in, 
ordered breakfast, we were changing stations, my dad picked up the 
morning "stars and stripes," the United States army and marines had 
landed in Lebanon. He said, "I'll be back when I can." And he went and 
reported in and came back four days later. To me this was all real and 
you better have people who care enough about their country that they're 
prepared to do this or you don't keep your country. In that context, we 
really worked very, very hard in trying to put all of this together. 
<P>
And I can tell my staff for a second we're missing three pages of my copy 
of the Chyron, so you may want to figure out how I got three missing 
pages here. I also want to talk, though, about as that went through, I 
came to the conclusion after a while that I wanted to be in public life. 
I came to the conclusion that it was very, very important that we reach 
out and that you learn constantly. I mean -- just walk over here. You 
make mistakes, you just accept them -- actually the reason I told you 
that, john, it goes from page 18 to page 21. Either you and I are both 
missing -- it goes from Chyron 56d to Chyron 62a. You may want to have 
somebody walk in here for a second. The point I'm trying to make is that 
when I started out I found myself growing based on my understanding of my 
mission in life, I mean I was not a natural politician. I'm basically a 
book worm and my basic attitude is to run and hide. I'm looking forward 
this afternoon to watching the Pittsburgh game. 
<P>
I'm going to take a break for two hours and go do a town hall meeting but 
I'll get to see the first half of the Pittsburgh game. But I had to learn 
the skills and the habits necessary to do the things that were required, 
because I really believe the country's at stake, not in a 
republican-democrat sense, but in an historic sense and that 
civilizations die and that every generation has to arouse some people who 
try to make sure that they understand what it takes to not die. So what 
I'm going to share with you in these ten sessions is literally 36 years 
of work at this question. Now, in that context, I think that you also 
should know that I have raised two children, Kathy and Jackie sue. There 
are a lot of lessons of life of raising children. I stayed home with my 
older daughter for a while and my wife worked. And then I went to night 
school and we had -- so I had a fair amount of intimate relationship with 
my oldest daughter when she was very young. 
<P>
And that's -- it is an interesting experience looking back. It means we 
are both very bonded and males always react different than females. At 
one point my oldest daughter was spitting her pea back out. You put it 
in, she dribble it out. I got frustrated so I just put it on top of her 
head. She sat there and stared at me. This created a certain trauma which 
we still lived through. I also -- I have to say I learned a lot and I 
changed a lot about being female in the modern world for both my two 
daughters and for Marianne. And because I had grown up in an army 
environment that was male dominated and was very different, so that was 
for me very different. We also part of what I mean by life was hard. Both 
Marianne and I each have lost our best friend. She lost her best friend 
about five years ago to liver cancer and I lost my best friend two years 
ago, a man Jim Tilton who I'd known since high school, to pancreatic 
cancer. So I think we have been through part of this and we speak from 
some background. 
<P>
Now in that context, given those biases, I want to work a lot at 
empowering you as an individual. I think this is a very, very important 
part of where we're going and what we're doing. And one of the things I 
want to empower you with -- okay, that's fine. -- is the notion of 
thinking of life over time, this is by the way, I think, the greatest 
problem of having a generationally driven education system. The notion of 
-- because the fact, is life occurs over time. If you are 12, you don't 
know that because you haven't lived very long. If you are 51, you know 
that but you don't know how to say it in a way that people who are 12 
learn it. If you say to me what can I get done by tomorrow, my answer is 
not much. If you say to me what can I get done in a decade, my answer is 
a lot. If you say what can I get done in 30 years, the answer is an 
enormous amount, and you'll do different things at different points. 
<P>
Now what happens is people all to often in the modern era say, okay, I'm 
good for a week. My answer is so why would I pay any attention to it? We 
used to have a rule in the house that if you hadn't been there at least 
six years, the older guys didn't even learn your name because they 
weren't sure you were going to stay around to be worth the effort. So 
it's very important to think through that what happens over time. That's 
why there are no hamburger flipping jobs, there are first jobs. Any first 
job is good because it teaches you to go to work. That only makes sense 
if you're thinking about it in a continuum. Makes no sense, if all of 
life -- it's the difference between a Polaroid and a movie. The Polaroid 
you're caught right here. Well, if I'm caught right here, I don't want to 
be there. Well, but what if it's a movie, and this is act 1 of a 20 act 
play? Well, then act 1 may be cool, that's all right. In addition, I want 
you to think of learning as a form of power. This is a very, very 
important core concept that I don't think we teach enough. Every time I 
start to do something, my first step is to learn. It's not to go do it. 
It's to stop and learn. Now, how do you learn? 
<P>
And this, by the way, violates all of the academic disciplines, almost 
all of which by definition I think are inadequate. I would argue you want 
to follow knowledge as it is needed to solve problems. One of the great 
moments of my life is -- I was at Emory, I was a history major, actually 
I was originally a political science major and then I switched to 
history. I was at a liberal arts college and I knew I didn't understand 
computers. And a friend of mine who was a state senator said, "you ought 
to go over to Georgia tech and meet a guy named Pete Jensen at the rich 
computer center," this is 1965. And I walked in to see Jensen, and Jensen 
said, "don't learn how to program a computer." He said, "by the time 
you're going to want to use them, programming is going to be obsolete and 
you're hire somebody to program them.". He said, "that would be like 
teaching you how to drive by becoming a mechanic." He said, "learn how to 
think about computers." And he said, "now the first thing I want you to 
do I want you to go read Drucker and I want you to learn to think about 
what's called project evaluation and review technique or a pert chart," 
which is a way of thinking about doing a job I'll show you later on. And 
I never took a course under Jensen, I just read about 50 books and talked 
to him for hundreds of hours because I wanted to learn. I wanted to 
follow the knowledge. 
<P>
Don't associate credentialing and learning. Learning occurs by learning 
what you need to know and going to whatever discipline you need for the 
next building block of learning. Credentialing occurs by sitting long 
enough somebody stamps you with approval. They are not related. 
Similarly, I think there is a cycle that's involved which I have 
literally lived through. You study, you apply, you get immersed and then 
you reflect. So first of all, you study, you think through, what are the 
principles, then you apply it to your planning. Then you are immersed in 
doing, then you reflect on doing. For example, on Wednesday when I got 
sworn in, I was purely in the immersion phase. I didn't have any time on 
Wednesday to do either studying or reflecting. We began reflecting late 
Wednesday night. 
<P>
But if you think of this cycle, you want to do something, first you study 
it then you apply what you've studied to your particular project, then 
you immerse yourself in trying to get it done, nd then you reflect on 
what knew you learned based on the cycle. Then you go back and start over 
again by deciding what you want to do next in studying again. I also 
believe passionately in apprenticeship, friendships and the importance of 
permanent learning and permanent growth. I believe that you need to reach 
out. You will hear it again and again during the course. Find people who 
have already done what you want to do and learn from them. People love to 
teach. You go to somebody, say teach me what you know. And the trick is 
simple, what do you want to do, who's done it, go find them. I believe in 
real professionalism, which is the application of systems that work 
rather than either bureaucratism or disciplinism. The bureaucratism is 
purely the idea that the bureaucracy says do x even if it's stupid, so 
you got your hole punched, at least you did what they told you to even if 
it was dumb. Credentialism is, you may not be able to speak German but 
you have a credit that says you can speak German so you can teach German 
even though you can't speak it. You may be able to speak German but don't 
have the credentials, so you can't teach it even though you can speak it. 
<P>
So we're now going to put the kids in a German class with a non- German 
speaker with the right credentials. We do that every day in this country 
today and it's stupid. We should abolish it tomorrow morning. And I want 
you to understand the difference between the two models. I also 
understand that this is the moral purpose of this course. This course is 
essentially a moral course. It is essentially arguing there is an 
America, America is good, that that's it's worth doing but there's 
citizenship and citizenship is your responsibility. That it's a 
partnership, which means you have to meet your half of the partnership. 
In that sense this is, well, that's a history course, Dr. Minnix has a 
history degree and I have a history degree and I think we can reasonably 
match our standards in the amount we've read with most historians and we 
can match the course preparation. The truth is this is in the best sense 
of the old-fashioned word a liberal arts course. This is a course of 
trying to think through life and trying to think through society and 
trying to think through culture and whichever discipline we need to 
borrow from for the purpose of the course, we'll just borrow it. They can 
sue us later. 
<P>
The essence is -- the essence of the course is applying American 
Civilization's principles to problem solving. So first you got to figure 
out what are the principles of American Civilization and now how do we 
apply them to solve problems? Example: list five rules, I want you to try 
to do this for a second. List five rules you would tell an immigrant the 
first day they arrived in America. How would you teach them the children? 
Just think about it. Somebody walks up to you says, "hi, I landed today, 
I got off the airplane in Atlanta." "I came from country x." "I want to 
be an American." Give me an example. What's one example you can give me? 
<P>
>> learn the language. >> 
<P>
learning. See, you are already in -- you already made a very key point. 
Should they really learn English? Isn't that sort of discriminating 
against their own language? 
<P>
>> yeah, they should. >> 
<P>
yeah, they should. There's a very practical reason they should. There is 
a very pragmatic reason they should. If you are going to be in this 
commercial economy, you better speak the language of the people who have 
the money. 
<P>
>> learn the social customs. >> 
<P>
learn the social customs. Give me an example of the social customs. 
<P>
>> well, modes of dress, things that we eat, times that we eat. >>
<P>
okay. Of course when you say things that we eat, this is the most diverse 
world civilization on the planet about things we eat, but there are 
limits. We don't, for example, practice cannibalism. So if you were from 
new guinea or from the Brazilian rain forest, that might be an important 
point. I mean, you may laugh about it. As late as the 1840's, the British 
sent an officer to the Nash country in India to convince them to stop 
eating people. They had a habit of getting an annual slave, they fattened 
the slave, and then killed the slave and someone ate them. And this young 
British officer was sent there. This is referenced in Drucker's book, 
"the Effective Executive." Young officer sent there 24 years old, sits 
down with the tribal chief, the tribal chieftain says, this is very 
important about what I mean by civilization, the tribal chieftain says, 
"of course you respect our customs." He said, "of course, I do." He said, 
"our custom is to eat people." "I respect that." He said, "of course you 
old chief will respect our customs." And he said, "but of course I do." 
"our custom is to shoot people who eat people." They had a big tribal 
meeting. Gave it up. They didn't -- do you see how it weaves together? 
<P>
So what I want you to do, what I want you to be thinking about and 
practicing is list the five values, or habits or principles of American 
Civilization that you think might really happen. Once I would like to do 
next week, and I hope Dr. Minnix will help me remember because, again I'm 
pretty busy in between classes -- is I would like to very early next week 
come back to you and say, okay, let's spend ten minutes, as we get into 
American history, what's your list? Just come in with five. Any five. I 
don't care what they are. Five principles or habits you would tell an 
immigrant on their first day are useful. And then as we go through 
American history, let's see if we can find examples of your habits. I 
will give you one, by the way, that's truly radically American, that if 
all of you are going to be honest, you'll admit to, shopping. To be 
American is to learn to shop. It's literally true. This is the most 
mall-oriented, not necessarily to buy, but just to shop. More Americans 
spend more hours wandering around stores going, "wow, I'd like that." 
Goes back to incentive. Why are Americans so driven? Because they're 
pursuing happiness. What's one of their versions of happiness? A big 
mall. Yeah. 
<P>
Now, we're going to take key problems. One of the ones we're going to 
really focus on is solving poverty and violence. This cannot be a healthy 
country until we have found a core cultural solution to the challenge of 
poverty and violence. The way we're going to do this is we're going to 
apply vision, strategies, projects and tactics. And then we're going to 
apply listen, learn, help and lead, so that people can truly learn. And 
then what we're going to do with every challenge, challenge of the world 
market, the challenge of the information age, third wave society, the 
challenge of citizenship, the challenge of the culture poverty and 
violence, for every challenge, we're going to use the five pillars. So 
we're going to go down through and say, all right, what can we learn from 
American history? What can we learn from personal strength? What can we 
learn from entrepreneurial free enterprise? What can we learn from the 
spirit of invention and discovery? And what can we learn from quality as 
defined by Deming. And then we'll apply those pillars to the problem. So 
as you look at the last four sessions of the course, as you're thinking 
through where we're going, you look at the last four sessions of the 
course you can say to yourself, okay, when I get to the information age, 
third wave society, and American Civilization, I'm going to want to go 
back and think through my vision of it, my strategies for getting there, 
my projects to implement my strategies, my tactics, and then I'm going to 
want to turn to other people say, "what do you think." 
<P>
And I'm going to go through listen, learn, help and lead. And as I'm 
thinking through the implementation for that third wave information age, 
I'm going to be saying, well, what did we learn in American history? When 
we went from an agricultural to an industrial society, what was the 
transition like? What are the lessons out of that period? How does 
personal strength relate to being able to use a computer? I mean, we know 
personal strength meant in the, you carried a big club and you had a 
rock. What does personal strength mean in the age of the laptop? Which, 
by the way, is a major reason for the rise of power for women. If upper 
body strength matters, men win. They are both biologically stronger and 
they don't get pregnant. Pregnancy is a period of male domination in 
traditional society. On the other hand, if what matters is the speed with 
which you can move the laptop, women are at least as fast, and in some 
ways better. So you have a radical revolution based on technological 
change and you've got to think that through. If you talk about being in 
combat. 
<P>
What does combat mean? If combat means living in a ditch, females have 
biological problems staying in a ditch for 30 days because they get 
infections, and they don't have upper body strength. I mean, some do, but 
they're relatively rare. On the other hand, men are basically little 
piglets, you drop them in the ditch, they roll around in it, doesn't 
matter, you know. These things are very real. On the other hand, if 
combat means being on an aegis class cruiser managing the computer 
controls for 12 ships and their rockets, a female may be again 
dramatically better than a male who gets very, very frustrated sitting in 
a chair all the time because males are biologically driven to go out and 
hunt giraffes. So you got to look at these kind of background, what do 
these transitions mean, how do they apply, what does it mean for personal 
strength. 
<P>
Entrepreneurial free enterprise, isn't it interesting that at the end of 
the industrial era when large systems dominated that the explosive growth 
of the last 20 years is, guess what, tiny companies, start-ups in 
garages, people in back rooms. That's people who drop out of college and 
go create Microsoft or go create apple computing. It's Spielberg's 
invention of "Jurassic park." But it's people just do their thing. It 
very entrepreneurial. Talk about the whole concept of the spirit of 
invention and discovery. Well, obviously if you're entering the 
information age, inventing and discovery, but it may not be inventing and 
discovering the way that's obvious. We did -- one time we had post-its, 
those little yellow things you stick on things. That's an invention. 
Somebody got fairly rich off that. Invention doesn't have to mean you are 
a Ph.d.., you advance math and you are sitting in a lab some day. 
<P>
Invention can just be an egg McMuffin which was invented by a particular 
franchise operator who wanted to find a way to use McDonald's in the 
morning. So he literally invented egg McMuffin, which is a social 
invention. And then finally, we look at the whole co ncept of quality and 
how do things pull together, how do we make it -- what did Deming teach 
the Japanese, and how do we work as a team to learn every day to improve 
our productivity. So I think these things are very, very important and 
you'll see us go through in the next nine weeks that kind of systematic 
effort to understand America, understand ourselves, apply our vision of 
the future, and see if we can come up with solutions when we get to the 
last four. 
<P>
But to get to the last four we've got to spend the next five weeks really 
reimmersing ourselves in America. And the reason is, for the last quarter 
century we haven't talked much about America. We have all these modern 
counterculture myths about America. We have politically correct 
interpretations of America. That's not the way America works. I mean, 
just -- one of the things you can do as a test of this. Is look at the 
work ethic which I would argue is at the very center of being American, 
and then read your newspapers for the next week and see how often you 
find things referred to as work as good rather than as bad. I'll give you 
one example, because one of the last stands -- I'm going to be male for a 
second because I'm going to talk about sports which is much more a male 
kind of thing -- but think about football, the end of the football 
season, which coaches do we study on the sports page? The winners, right? 
Who would we study on the front page about politics? The losers. 
<P>
You have an interview with the most losing coach in America, the 
psychological trauma I felt as my team lost its 70th consecutive game. I 
mean, why should Joe Paterno or Tom Osborne be allowed to win all the 
time? Shouldn't we have some kind of fairness here? You only get to win 
six out of ten. It wouldn't be nice if you won ten out of ten or 12 out 
of 12. Think about it. On the business page you still have a bias toward 
the winners but it's not total because we're gradually having the social 
creeping over of the biases of the editorial page. But historically, the 
business page is about who is breaking through. The greatest 
breakthroughs of modern times: computers, biotechnology, molecular 
medicine, it's very hard to get them covered, why, because they're just 
dull. They're about success. 
<P>
So it's much harder to get those on page one in a way that's readable and 
understandable, but those are going to break through your life. O.J. 
Simpson is now involved in a trial which is interesting enough and 
violent enough and sexy enough and has a big enough celebrity. You take 
the total number of inches printed about O.J. last year in any major 
newspaper then take the total number of inches about molecular medicine, 
that's a pathological society that runs around chasing bad news. You 
don't find that on the sports page. And it's very important because in 
classic America it was Lindbergh's getting to Paris that worked. It 
wasn't the guy who didn't make it. Now next week, we're going to start 
with pillar one, the lessons of American history and the use of history 
for analysis and problem solving. We'll again try to give you tools and 
give you ways of thinking. The next week's reading assignment is the 
declaration of independence, the constitution of the united states, the 
federalist papers nos. 10 and 51, building a community of citizens, from 
that book we're going to use chapter 6. Tocqueville's democratic 
prescription self-interest, rightly understood. 
<P>
So I would like -- the volume on community of citizens chapter 6, 
Tocqueville's democratic prescription self-interest. We're going to take 
those papers, which I would really like you to read. I would operate as 
though you have read them. That's what you ought to do, okay. Because in 
the long run this course is for you, it's not for me. Thank you. And I 
look forward very much to being with you next week.

<b>Gun Control:  Is the Tide Turning?</B><BR>
<I>Battleground Shifts to the States</I><P>

<DD>Gun control is one of our society's most contentious issues.  It 
arouses strong opinions and inflames emotions on both sides of a debate that 
has become inextricably linked to concerns about crime.  Both factions in the debate see 
crime as central to their respective arguments.  
Does the availability of firearms contribute to crime? 
 Or does gun control leave law-abiding citizens defenseless against armed criminals? 
 Much more is at stake than the answers to these questions.  For some, guns are a 
symbol of all that is wrong with our 
violence-prone society; for others, gun-ownership is a 
fundamental right, an indispensable element of a free society.  
<DD>Much of the gun control debate has focused on the edges of the issue, as the 
opposing sides try to define the limits of the country's acceptance of firearms.  In 
recent years, attention has been focused on gun control measures at the national level.  
In 1993, after seven years of lobbying, Handgun Control, Inc. finally succeeded in pushing 
the so-called &quot;Brady Bill&quot; to passage.  The bill, named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, mandates a five-day 
waiting period between purchase and delivery of a handgun.  A year later, as part of the 
1994 Crime Bill, Congress passed a ban on the importation and domestic manufacture of 
a number of semi-automatic firearms, so-called &quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Anger over the 
passage of these two pieces of legislation helped 
fuel the backlash against congressional Democrats that led to Republicans taking control 
of Congress for the first time in forty years.
<a name="debate">
<P><B>The Debate Over Concealed Weapons Packs A Lot of Heat</B>
<P>
<DD>Despite gun control activists' success in tightening gun laws at the national level, 
a broad-based and little-noticed movement has been working in the states to liberalize 
restrictive gun laws.  This &quot;Quiet Revolution&quot; in the states has focused primarily on 
changing state laws to allow individuals to carry 
a loaded, concealed firearm.  
<DD>In 1987, Florida became the first state in recent times to relax its concealed 
weapon laws.  Shortly thereafter, a number of 
other states followed suit, and the trend continues. 
 In 1995 alone, ten states liberalized their requirements.  Most of these states now 
have what is known as a &quot;shall-issue&quot; 
system, under which applicants are deemed to have a right to obtain a CCW (Carrying 
Concealed Weapon) permit, and the state must 
provide an affirmative reason to deny the issuance 
of one.  For example, states may deny applicants who have prior felony convictions or a 
history of mental illness.  They may also require proof of a certain level of proficiency with 
a handgun.
<DD>Naturally, such changes have not come without considerable controversy.  
Opponents of the Florida measure predicted carnage in the streets and suggested that 
the state's new moniker would be the 
&quot;GUNshine State.&quot;  One hysterical newspaper 
editorial summed up fears about the new law:  
<blockquote><I>&quot;[A] pistol-packing citizenry will mean 
itchier trigger fingers . . . South Florida's climate of 
 smoldering fear would flash like napalm when every stranger totes a piece, and 
every mental snap in traffic could lead to the 
crack of gunfire.&quot;</I></blockquote>  
<DD>The facts paint a far less frightening picture.  Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI) 
argues that CCW reform &quot;has not made Florida 
a safer place.&quot;  While conceding that the 
homicide rate has decreased, HCI observes that violent crime in Florida increased by 
17.8 percent in the five years following enactment of CCW reform.  But this tells only part of 
the story.  While violent crime did increase in Florida, it rose by 22.3 percent 
nationally, noticeably higher than the jump in Florida.  
In addition, fears of legally licensed firearms carriers turning minor disputes into 
deadly confrontations proved baseless.  Of 314,938 licenses issued since the law went into 
effect, only 470 have been revoked for any reason.  
<DD>Contrary to the assertions of anti-gun lobbyists, the evidence indicates that an 
armed citizenry generally has a deterrent effect 
on crime.  According to sociologists James Wright and Peter Rossi, criminals tend to 
be more concerned about encountering an armed victim than about being arrested by the 
police.  Wright and Rossi conducted two studies commissioned by the U.S. Department 
of Justice in the 1980s that examined the attitudes of incarcerated criminals towards 
violent crime.  They interviewed over 1,800 convicted felons who were in prison in ten 
different states.  A majority of these felons 
claimed to worry more about dealing with an armed victim while committing a crime than 
about running into the police.  That's one reason why so many crimes are committed 
outside the home:  criminals fear armed homeowners. 
 And when criminals do target houses, they pick residences where no one is home 
to avoid the possibility of being shot at.  Criminals prefer preying on people on the streets: 
 thanks to concealed weapons restrictions, they will most likely be unarmed.  
<DD>Wright and Rossi's study seems to validate the common assumption that 
civilian gun ownership has a significant deterrent effect on criminal behavior.  Thirty-four 
percent of the felons interviewed indicated that at some point in their criminal careers 
they had been &quot;scared off, shot at, wounded, 
or captured by an armed victim.&quot;  
<DD>How often do private citizens use firearms for self defense?  It is difficult to 
obtain precise figures, since many of these uses 
are never reported to the police, but research by Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck provides some insight.  Dr. Kleck 
undertook a huge study in 1992-93, asking nearly 5,000 people detailed questions about 
whether or not they had used a firearm to protect themselves from crime, and if so under 
what circumstances.  From the results of this 
study, Kleck estimated that close to 2.5 million Americans annually actually use firearms 
for self-defense.  In the vast majority of these cases, no one is killed or wounded, and 
rarely are shots even fired.  
<DD>It is generally recognized that localities with the strictest gun control laws do 
not have lower crime rates than jurisdictions with less restrictive laws.  For example, the 
District of Columbia has probably the strictest 
gun control laws of any municipality, and it has 
an extremely high crime rate.  Neighboring Virginia, with relatively few gun control 
laws (and a shall-issue system for CCW since 1995), has a much lower crime rate. 
<P>
<a name ="nra">
<B>National Rifle Association</B>
<P>
<DD>The participants in the political debate over concealed weapons are familiar 
and their positions are predictable.  What's different is the political strategy that 
opponents of gun control are using.  Increasingly 
frustrated by gridlock in Washington, groups like the National Rifle Association have 
turned their sights on the states, and they have 
had remarkable success in changing laws once considered politically unalterable.  Of 
these laws, CCW reform is the most recent and perhaps the most significant change.  
<DD>The largest, most powerful and probably best-known organization is the National 
Rifle Association (NRA).  Founded in 1871 by a number of ex-Union army officers to 
promote civilian marksmanship, the NRA has grown to over three million members 
nationwide, and it has an annual budget of nearly 
$155 million (1993 figures).  The NRA is a 
501(c)(4) organization, as is its lobbying division, 
the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA).  This means it is tax-exempt but, because it is 
organized to influence legislation, contributions to it are not tax-deductible.  The NRA has 
an affiliated PAC, the NRA Political Victory Fund, and a number of affiliated 501(c)(3) 
organizations, including the NRA Foundation, Firearms Civil Rights Legal Defense Fund, 
International Shooter Development Fund, National Firearms Museum Fund, and the 
NRA Special Contribution Fund.  In the 1993-94 election cycle, the NRA's PAC 
contributed almost $6 million to congressional 
candidates of both parties across the country  The ILA itself spent another $2 million on 
mailings, phone banks, and other benefits to pro-gun 
candidates. 
<DD>For most of its existence, the NRA concerned itself with training people in the 
safe and proper usage of firearms and in sponsoring shooting competitions.  This began 
to change in the late 1960s as increasingly restrictive gun control laws were proposed 
and passed, most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968.  For a time, there was 
considerable debate within the NRA about whether 
increasing the group's focus on political issues was compatible with its traditional 
interest in promoting marksmanship.  This debate continued through the 1970s, and 
culminated in the &quot;Cincinnati Revolt&quot; in which 
the NRA's executive vice-president and a number of board members who favored a 
less active political role were replaced by politically-oriented activists who wanted to 
fight gun-control legislation.  
<DD>The NRA is actively lobbying at the national, state, and local levels.  Working 
in conjunction with state organizations, NRA has successfully pushed for CCW reform 
in 19 states, and it is close to passing 
legislation in several others, including Missouri 
and New Mexico.  In this effort, the NRA works closely with sportsmen's organizations, 
including hunting and target shooting clubs, as well as with crime victims' groups.  In 
the field of CCW reform, NRA has so far worked exclusively at the state level, entirely 
bypassing the U.S. Congress.  NRA is lobbying for the adoption of laws at the state level 
that are patterned on Florida's CCW law, which establishes a shall-issue system placing 
some basic requirements on license holders..
<DD>Following the death of NRA President Tom Washington in 1995, First 
Vice-President Marion Hammer assumed office, 
giving the NRA its first-ever woman president.  
The former president of Unified Sportsmen of Florida, Hammer was instrumental in 
lobbying the Florida legislature for the passage 
of the state's CCW reform in 1987.  Hammer is a life-long Democrat and a grandmother 
who has already purchased firearms for her three grandchildren.  
<DD>It is perhaps not coincidental that the NRA's president and its chief lobbyist, 
Tanya Metaksa, are women at a time when the organization has begun to emphasize the 
importance of training women in the use of firearms. 
 This new emphasis underscores the NRA's traditional interest in firearms training.  But 
it also seeks to enlist women as a new political constituency to the ranks of those who 
believe the possession of firearms is a crime deterrent. 
<P>
<a name="gun">
<B>Gun Owners of America</B>
<P>
<DD>The other major national organization pushing for CCW reform is a more recent arrival 
to the gun control debate.  Founded in 1977 by former California state Senator H. L. 
&quot;Bill&quot; Richardson, Gun Owners of America 
presents itself as &quot;the no-compromise gun lobby,&quot; and its position on CCW reflects that.  
<DD>In contrast to NRA, Gun Owners is pushing for adoption of handgun carry laws 
modeled after those in effect in Vermont.  Alone among the states, Vermont does not 
require a permit of any sort to carry a concealed handgun.  State law makes it a crime to 
&quot;carr[y] a dangerous or deadly weapon, openly 
or concealed, while committing a felony.&quot;  
Gun Owners calls current CCW reform legislation &quot;phony,&quot; and it opposes concealed 
carry laws that require any &quot;government 
approval, permission, license, or tax&quot; to obtain a 
permit to carry a concealed weapon.  Gun Owners argues that the CCW reform legislation 
that has been adopted by most states discriminates against the poor and minorities 
because it requires application fees and the cost of firearms training that states require 
for certification to carry.  More importantly, Gun Owners argues that any government 
regulation of firearms possession will inevitably lead to further restrictions as well as 
violate constitutional rights guaranteed by the 
Second Amendment.
<DD>Politically, Gun Owners is outside of what is usually considered the political 
mainstream; it is not concerned about angering the 
political establishment.  Gun Owners has been willing to endorse and support 
candidates for public office who are considered 
longshots with little chance of winning.  In 1994, 
for instance, Gun Owners, unlike the NRA, enthusiastically backed Republican 
Steve Stockman in his congressional race against longtime House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX).  Brooks had angered Gun Owners by working for passage 
of the 1994 Crime Bill, which contained a ban on the importation and manufacture of 
certain kinds of military-style firearms known as 
&quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Gun Owners had no 
compunction about challenging Brooks, a powerful member of Congress who had 
enormous influence over gun control legislation.  Stockman went on to defeat Jack Brooks and 
became one of the &quot;Giant Slayers&quot; of the 
1994 congressional election.
<DD>Gun Owners has had limited success promoting its preferred version of CCW reform. 
 Despite the many states considering reform legislation, Gun Owners has not 
convinced any to enact its purer version.  Gun 
Owners remains an outsider, occasionally scoring a policy success, but mainly working to 
influence the course and scope of the gun control debate.       
<a name="cit">
<P>
<B>Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms</B>
<P>
<DD>Also involved in the debate is the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and 
Bear Arms, and its affiliated 501(c)(3), the 
Second Amendment Foundation.  Citizens Committee is headquartered in Bellevue, 
Washington, and employs John Snyder, an active political foe of gun control since the 1960s, 
as a congressional lobbyist in Washington, DC.  Citizens Committee was originally 
founded as a committee of the Young Americans for Freedom, but later became independent.
<a name="hand">
<P>
<B>Handgun Control Inc.</B>
<P>
<DD>Anti gun groups have scored notable legislative successes in recent years.  In 
1994, following the election of Bill Clinton, they secured federal legislation placing 
restrictions on handgun purchases and banning so-called assault weapons.  However, 
the gun control groups have had few successes in the latest state legislative battles over 
the right to carry concealed weapons.  Like many other big government advocacy groups, 
their power is concentrated in Washington, DC.  They thrive on coalition-building and 
on public relations imagemaking in the national media.  The real question is whether 
these advantages can survive renewed grassroots challenges by state and local defenders 
of Second Amendment rights.   
<DD>The largest and most powerful opponent of CCW reform is the 501(c)(4) 
Handgun Control, Inc. and its affiliated 501(c)(3), 
the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.  Compared to the NRA, HCI is a new arrival 
in Washington.  It was founded as the National Council to Control Handguns in 1974 
by Mark Borinsky, a community activist who was mugged by an assailant who used 
a handgun.  Borinsky was joined in 1975 by Pete Shields, a former DuPont 
executive, whose son was the last of the victims of 
the infamous &quot;Zebra Killer.&quot;  Shields 
became executive director of NCCH in 1976. 
<DD>In 1985, the Council (renamed Handgun Control in 1978) gained a new board 
member who gave the group a much higher profile.  Sarah Brady's involvement in the gun 
control movement came about in a very public way:  her husband James Brady, 
Ronald Reagan's press secretary, was shot and almost killed in the 1981 attempt on 
the President's life.  Brady's name soon became synonymous with HCI's flagship 
legislative accomplishment, the Brady Bill, a federal 
law which mandates a nationwide waiting period of five business days before the purchaser 
of a handgun can take possession of it.  
<DD>Since its founding, HCI has grown to over 380,000 members, and it has an annual 
budget of over $6 million.  The affiliated Center 
to Prevent Handgun Violence (CPHV) had a budget in 1994 of $2.4 million, which 
mainly funds educational programs ($1.3 million) and a legal action project ($430,000).  
CPHV's educational efforts include its STAR 
(Straight Talk About Risks) program, which is 
intended to convince school-aged children that 
guns are a key  element of criminal violence.  
CPHV also purports to offer safety tips for those who own and keep firearms at home.  
These tips include &quot;EMPTY IT OUT AND LOCK IT UP&quot; and &quot;Explain to children that they 
should NEVER touch guns&quot; (emphasis in the 
original), tips that would preclude the ownership of a firearm for self-protection and the 
imparting of basic gun safety to children.  The advice concludes with the assertion 
that &quot;The safest thing is not to have a gun in 
your home, especially not a handgun.&quot;  
<P>CPHV's Legal Action Project defends gun control legislation in the courts from 
legal challenges by gun rights advocates.  For example, it has filed briefs defending a 
municipal Morton Grove, Illinois law banning handgun ownership and California's 
state ban on assault weapons. 
<DD>The Legal Action Project also has tried to use the courts to secure unlegislated 
gun control.  CPHV has undertaken court cases that would impose a legal doctrine of 
strict liability on manufacturers of so-called 
&quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Under this 
interpretation, manufacturers would be liable for 
damages that result from the misuse of their 
firearms, without regard to the circumstances.  
This back door approach to gun control would effectively end the production of these 
firearms and probably drive the manufacturers out of business.    
<DD>HCI has been very effective at mainstreaming its cause and attracting corporate funding.  In 1993, for example, 
Capital Cities, the owner of the ABC television 
network, and Bell Atlantic, the local telephone monopoly for much of the east coast, 
each gave $5,000 grants to CPHV.  While these are small grants, they give CPHV the 
credibility of an affiliation with major corporations.  
The Capital Cities grant is particularly 
disturbing because gun rights activists have long 
maintained that their point of view is never accurately reported by media outlets such 
as ABC.  When ABC's owner weighs in with what is essentially a political contribution 
to one side of the gun control issue, its capacity for objectivity is seriously in question.            
<DD>In 1986, HCI began what was to become a seven year effort to enact the Brady Bill 
into law.  Shortly after this effort was underway, gun control activists also discovered a 
new target, the so-called assault weapons.  On January 19, 1989, a gunman used a 
semi-automatic version of the Russian AK-47 assault rifle to kill five elementary school 
students and one teacher on a school playground.  Almost overnight, the issue of 
the &quot;widespread availability of 
semi-automatic assault weapons&quot; became a matter of public debate.  Even though the availability and 
use of semi-automatic firearms, almost all of them rifles, with military-style features would 
appear to be a separate issue, &quot;Handgun&quot; 
Control, Inc. quickly took it up with relish. 
<DD>HCI was heartened by the election of Bill Clinton, who was the first president 
since Jimmy Carter to campaign on a platform that included stricter gun control laws.  
Clinton promised to work for passage of both the Brady Bill and an assault weapons ban, 
and in 1994 he fulfilled his promise.  At the 
state level, HCI has been busy opposing CCW reform  but with considerably less 
success. 
<DD>HCI likes to position itself as a 
&quot;moderate&quot; advocacy group pushing for gun control. 
 For the most part it avoids talk of banning guns or adopting other positions that 
might alienate potential supporters.  But after 
the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban were passed, HCI unveiled &quot;Brady II.&quot;  This was 
its blueprint for national gun control, and it is anything but moderate.  
<DD>Going far beyond the most restrictive state laws, Brady II would mandate federal 
licensing of all handgun owners, registration of 
all handgun sales, and a limit on handgun purchases to one per month.  It would make 
it harder and more expensive to obtain a firearm dealer's license, allow only licensed 
gun dealers to sell ammunition, and make it a 
crime to leave a firearm &quot;accessible&quot; to 
anyone under age 16.  In addition, Brady II would require an &quot;arsenal&quot; license for gun 
collectors; it would ban &quot;non-sporting&quot; 
ammunition, mandate that firearms be made 
&quot;child-proof&quot;, and hold parents liable for 
accidents involving their children's misuse of 
firearms that they own.
<a name="coal">
<P><B>Coalition to Stop Gun Violence</B>
<P>
<DD>If HCI is like the NRA in promoting itself as a &quot;moderate&quot; voice in the gun control 
debate, then the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) is the more hard-core alternative 
for gun control supporters.  Originally called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns, its 
name change illustrates how the group has attempted to widen and obscure its goals. 
 However, unlike HCI, CSGV does not deny that it wants to ban handguns 
completely from &quot;importation, manufacture, sale, 
transfer, ownership, possession and use by the general American public.&quot;  The only 
exceptions it would recognize are the &quot;police, 
military, security officers, and gun clubs where the guns are secured on the club's premises.&quot;  
<DD>Arguing that sporting and recreation is the only legitimate purpose of gun 
ownership, CSGV does not call for an outright ban 
on long arms such as rifles and shotguns (as long as they are not classified as 
&quot;assault weapons&quot;).  But while CSGV supports 
many of the proposals endorsed by HCI, it regards them merely as intermediate steps to its 
ultimate goal of banning handguns.  It would license gun owners and limit handgun 
purchases to one per month for gun owners, limit the availability of gun dealers' licenses 
and raise their cost, increase taxes on handguns and ammunition to pay for health costs 
associated with firearms, and impose its version 
of strict legal liability on firearms 
manufacturers and dealers.  
<DD>CSGV operates on an annual budget of roughly $ 1 million.  Beside its 120,000 
individual members, it has enlisted 46 labor, religious, professional, medical, and 
educational associations as members, including:  
Americans for Democratic Action, the American Jewish Committee, the Center for Science 
in the Public Interest, the National Urban League, the United States Conference of Mayors, 
and the United States Student Association (see page 5 for a full list).
<DD>As with other 501(c)4 lobbying organizations, CSGV has an affiliated 501(c)3 
organization.  This one is called the Educational Fund to End Handgun Violence.  
Established in 1978, the Fund has expanded its activities much like CPHV, operating a program, 
&quot;Hands Without Guns,&quot; for school-aged children.  
Its Firearms Litigation Clearinghouse assists plaintiffs attempting to win damages for 
shooting incidents and for injuries from defective firearms.  It also develops legal theories 
to hold firearms manufacturers liable.  The Fund also hosts an annual conference on 
gun violence and maintains a database of community anti-gun organizations.  It has an 
annual budget of slightly less than $200,000, and receives grants from several 
foundations, including $55,000 from the George Gund 
Foundation and $16,000 from the Kanter Family Foundation.   
<a name="viol">
<P>
<P><B>Violence Policy Center</B>
<P>
<DD>The Violence Policy Center, a think tank for the gun control movement, is the 
newest participant in the policy debate.  Despite 
its small size and lack of recognition, VPC has skillfully disseminated its ideas.  Founded 
in 1988 by activist Josh Sugarmann, VPC has steadily churned out reports and 
publications.  Operating on an annual budget of slightly more than $100,000, the Center 
devotes itself to studying the gun control debate and &quot;educational efforts . . . targeted 
at the general public, public policymakers, and the news media.&quot;  
<DD>While it has examined typical gun control issues such as CCW reform and assault 
weapons, VPC has made the American firearms industry a particular focus of its attention. 
 Indeed, VPC identifies the recent successes of CCW reform as representative of 
legislation conceived to provide &quot;financial 
benefits to all members of the gun lobby.&quot;  In 
<I>Concealed Carry: The Criminal's Companion</I>, VPC argues that the firearms industry, 
faced with stagnant sales, has used CCW reform to expand its markets.  It claims firearms 
instructors believe the training component in CCW reform laws will give them increased 
business.  And it imagines that the NRA sees CCW reform as a way to increase its 
recruitment of members.
<DD>VPC has had a definite impact on the policy debate over gun control.  In 1988, VPC 
published one of the first reports warning against manufacturers of &quot;assault weapons.&quot;  
When the issue acquired national significance, VPC benefitted from the publicity, and it has 
attracted major foundation funding.  Contributions by the John D. and Catherine 
T. MacArthur Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, and the Aaron Diamond 
Foundation suggest the regard in which it is held.  
<a name="state">
<P>
<P><B>The States Lead the Way</B>
<P>
<DD>In late 1994, it looked like gun rights supporters were on the ropes.  With an ally in 
the White House and many supporters in Congress, anti-gun groups had secured 
passage of the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban, and they were poised to 
accomplish their final goal.  While the anti-gun 
groups tended to work independently of one another, their efforts were dovetailing.  
HCI strove to appear moderate in its calls for federal legislation, and was aided by 
the strident demands of CSGV.  VPC reports and studies provided arguments and data 
for more and stricter gun control laws.
<DD>The election of 1994 stalled the final assault on guns.  But the assault weapons 
ban remains intact, and President Clinton promises to veto any legislation attempting 
a repeal.  Can the anti-gun groups consolidate their gains?
<DD>This may appear to be the current situation at the national level, but it ignores the 
important changes that are taking place at the 
state level.  Reform legislation permitting the 
carrying of concealed weapons is occurring nationwide, and no help from the 
federal government is needed.  Like so many public policy reforms in recent years, from 
school choice to welfare reform, reform has 
&quot;devolved&quot; to the states.  Congress may 
soon get into the act on CCW reform, possibly by considering legislation to allow CCW 
holders to carry guns across state lines.  But for now, however, the federal government is 
not needed for reform to succeed.

<B>Denigrating America's Armed Forces</B><BR>
By Robert V. Pambianco<BR>
<P>
<DD>Lost in the news coverage over the death of Chief of Naval Operations 
Jeremy Boorda, and the concomitant tales about the problems besetting the 
Navy, is the story of just how Admiral Boorda's medals became a cause of concern for 
the news media.  After all, knowledge of campaign ribbons is not the sort of thing 
one expects of reporters.
<DD>It turns out that the medals story was fed to 
<I>Newsweek</I> and ABC News by a little-known outfit called the National 
Security News Service (NSNS).  A charter member of the blame-America-first 
chorus and an appendage of the anti-defense lobby, the Service delivers 
pre-packaged news stories to the media.  Such was 
the case with the account of Admiral Boorda's Vietnam decorations. 
<DD>Since the leg work is already done, the press naturally gobbles up these 
stories hook, line, and sinker.  The <I>Washington 
Post</I>, ABC's &quot;World News Tonight,&quot; 
and &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; have all used NSNS reports, all of which are hostile to the 
U.S. armed forces and invariably designed to denigrate the defense establishment.
<DD>Veteran activist Wayne T. Jaquith founded NSNS in 1990 as an adjunct 
of the Peoples Education Center.  Earlier, Jaquith had been executive director 
of another far-left group called Physicians for Social Responsibility, the 
American affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War  one 
of a number of groups used by the Soviet Union to undermine support for 
military preparedness in the West.  As the <I>Washington 
Times</I> reported on May 20, these groups were loosely tied to Soviet 
&quot;active measures&quot; and were conceived by then KGB head Yuri Andropov as a 
replacement for the nuclear-freeze movement, which had lost credibility as a 
result of its more direct ties to Soviet espionage.  Yevgeniy Chazov, health 
minister under Leonid Brezhnev, was the head of the international physicians group.
<DD>Apparently unhappy with the outcome of the cold war, NSNS seems 
determined to inflict revenge on the U.S. military that made the West's triumph 
possible.  Indeed, NSNS's bureau chief, Joseph J. Trento, a former CNN 
reporter, told the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> that 
now that Admiral Boorda is dead, &quot;What we're going to do is look to see if 
there was some other reason that Boorda felt exposed.&quot;
<DD>NSNS receives funding from liberal foundations, most prominently the 
W. Alton Jones Foundation, a supporter of sundry left-liberal causes.  Jaquith 
told <I>Organization Trends</I> that his group 
also receives funding from the John D. &amp; Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation, one of America's premier establishment philanthropies.  And he confirmed 
that it had received one grant from the Arca Foundation, which in the past was 
run by liberal gadfly Marge Tabankin, former head of the Hollywood Women's 
Political Caucus and current director of the Streisand Foundation.
<DD>The real story here is not the news service; it is what this tells us about 
the American media.  Groups like NSNS exist on the extreme fringe of the 
political spectrum.  Yet with little effort, they 
are able to sell their wares to unquestioning reporters.  The same reporters who 
would instinctively question the motives of anything prepared by a 
right-of-center think tank, are all too happy to serve 
as a conduit for NSNS's anti-military agenda, while affecting shock and 
disbelief at any suggestion of bias.

  By "lower," we do not mean "bad."  The bliss of marriage 
consists in part in the sexual union of spouses.  That union 
is, in the human species, elevated and inspired by the 
rational and moral union that married people enjoy.  A 
lifetime of commitment, chosen and not dictated by 
instinct, sustained by determination in the face of obstacles, 
is the specifically human satisfaction of human sexual 
relations.  In that context, the human family is a reflection 
of the divine nature of man.

  A national marketing survey indicates that the average 
homosexual enjoys a household income of more than 
$55,400, a figure $23,000 higher than the average American 
household.  Homosexuals are far more likely to hold a 
college degree, and far more likely to work in a professional 
or managerial position than average Americans.  They are 
more than four times as likely to travel overseas, or to earn 
over $100,000 annually.  See "Overcoming a Deep-Rooted

to show that as many members of the "predator classes" 
opposed the Constitution as supported it.
  In his essay "On the Jewish Question," Marx had pointed 
out that progressive taxes can be used by the state as an 
effective means to abolish private property:  "when men 
strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, 
the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy 
religion; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish 
private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, 
or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds 
to abolish life, by the guillotine" (emphasis original).  Robert

  In 1927, the Progressive historian Vernon Parrington 
made this remarkable reinterpretation of the American 
Founding: "The substitution of 'pursuit of happiness' for 
'property' [in the Declaration of Independence] marks a 
complete break with the Whiggish doctrine of property 
rights that Locke had bequeathed to the English middle 
class, and the substitution of a broader sociological 
conception; and it was this substitution that gave to the 
document the note of idealism which was to make its appeal 
so perennially human and vital."  In the view of Parrington, 
the radical welfare state had been present in America's most

(According to the California Department of Personnel 
Administration, the state paid $430 in 1992 to Foundation

was worth $565. (According to HUD, the average one-
bedroom apartment in Los Angeles costs $704 in rent; I 
estimate $60 in utilities for a total of $764; a Section 8 
certificate is worth $764 minus 30% of cash income: $663 X 
30% = $199, and 764 minus 199 is 565.) Thanks to Jennifer

* Editors' Note: The idea for this appendix arose during a 
November 1992 segment of the television interview show, 
"Meet the Press."  Its purpose, like that of Appendix A, is to 
demonstrate that Bible-based religious faith is perfectly 
compatible with the principles and traditions of American 
democracy.  Indeed, it is much more so than the facile 
moral relativism of modern liberals.

Baden</P><P>IN addition to their disappointment with the elections, major environmental groups are learning the pain of limits to growth.</P><P>       From 1990 to 1993, membership fell 33 percent for Greenpeace and 35 percent for the Wilderness Society. The Sierra Club has lost 130,000 members and has accumulated deficits of nearly $3 million. Although groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the folks who brought us the Alar hoax, have held even, overall memberships peaked in 1990 and have been falling ever since. Only the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that values entrepreneurship and stresses incentives, has gained a substantial number of members.</P><P>     What explains these dramatic losses? Why are people electing to invest less time and money in the traditional green groups? As with most interesting economic changes, several forces are at work.</P><P>     First, with Clinton in the White House, Gore at the Naval Observatory, Babbitt in Interior, and ecologist Jack Ward Thomas as titular head of the Forest Service, some environmentalists believe that our environment is in good hands. They think they can relax their vigilance, secure in the belief that the people from the Potomac will manage our natural resources with prudence and sensitivity. With the environment covered by jolly green giants, concerned greens can direct their efforts to other causes.</P><P>     Today's situation is similar to that faced when Jimmy Carter was in office. The &quot;good guys&quot; were in Washington and green groups' memberships and money declined. Some believe God sent Jim Watt, Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Interior, to save the environmental movement. Watt personified evil and exploitation, making it easy to recruit crusaders to battle him.</P><P>     Second, the upper middle class and the wealthy provide most of the financial support for environmental groups. At the same time, Americans in the top 5 percent of the income distribution pay 43 percent of all personal income taxes. This is a terribly big hit. With government taking an ever bigger first bite, charities are bound to suffer. If the top 5 percent were paying 25 percent rather than 43 percent, contributions to all charities, the arts, churches, hospitals and schools, would increase dramatically. When government takes more there is simply less for worthy causes.</P><P>     The third reason is by far the most complex. It involves culture and political evolution as well as economics. However, the short version is easily stated: Professional environmentalists have been found out.</P><P>     For 25 years, the professional environmental groups have postured as selfless defenders of the public interest. The myth is that these underpaid servants of ecological integrity fight the public's battles against big business. Armed mainly with truth, virtue and purity, they fight the good fight though heavily outgunned. Clearly, all well-intentioned people would support such champions. But after a generation of success, the environmental organizations grew fat and rich. Their myth is losing its luster. Increasingly, people believe that under the costume of virtue lies sleaze and flab.</P><P>     Jim Watt actually hurt the environmental groups because he cost them their purity. Before Watt, most of us who joined were active in the outdoors. Although there was overlap, Audubon was for bird watchers, Sierra Club was for climbers, the Wilderness Society was for backpackers, and so forth. We were lifestyle members; our environmentalism was integrated with our living.</P><P>     Watt so offended those sensitive to environmental values that previously uninvolved people stampeded to the environmental movement. The organized groups became trapped by their gains. As David Foreman, a founder of Earth First! told me, Sierra stressed Club more than rocks and Wilderness emphasized Society more than trees. For most of the new members, environmentalism was a cause rather than a lifestyle, and today most causes have short lives. Stable members became ephemeral. Homelessness, world hunger, reproductive rights and other causes offered competing opportunities for well-intentioned people to demonstrate their good intentions by writing letters and sending checks.</P><P>     With every good cause competing, the leaders of green groups emphasized marketing. They became salesmen, their product was their cause. A premium was placed on exaggerating or fabricating environmental crises to galvanize members and attract new recruits. But there's a tension between maintaining integrity and making the sale.</P><P>     Incentives to make environmental problems big, dramatic and scary led to half-truths or outright lies about the actual risks of many alleged environmental crises. Alar, toxic waste, ivory, global warming, and other issues were often distorted by green groups as they tried to maintain their membership and budgets.</P><P>     Time has exposed environmentalists as just another special interest. Every dollar spent on a cause defined in New York and D.C. offices is a dollar less for local problems people can see and feel. The obvious failures of legislation such as Superfund and the problems with the Endangered Species Act caution people to be skeptical of dire warnings from Manhattan and the Beltway.</P><P>     Just as political corruption and deception have fueled a voter backlash, so deception by green groups has real consequences. A new environmentalism that recognizes the importance of property rights, entrepreneurship and incentives must emerge if we are to preserve environmental quality and ethical integrity.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

BADEN</P><P> I'M BACK HOME in Montana for the Christmas break. It's zero degrees at daybreak, no wind, clear day. It's great to be on the ranch, but there is something I miss. This morning brought it back.</P><P>       In this holiday season when we show understanding toward others, it helps to know people who spend their lives living in the rural spaces of the country. Most of us who spend our time in cities cannot know about the rural way of life or understand those who identify with the Wise Use movement. Coming back to Montana always helps me understand why people want to protect the life they have here.</P><P>       This morning was like a morning 23 years ago: Daylight breaking, just below zero, no wind, off to work, a great day in the making. I'd like to share the best part.</P><P>       Up Taylor Fork of the West Gallatin River, about 15 miles from Yellowstone Park, I heard a beautiful and moving sound. This morning it came back in my mind. It's still beautiful, and it still moves me.</P><P>       It's quiet at dawn, at zero degrees, at 7,000 feet - no background noise. Any sound captures attention. And I hear this deep, rhythmic, resonant, powerful call. It told me, &quot;Let's go. It's cold out, but we aren't very cold yet and soon we'll both be warm.&quot; If the sun stays out and the wind stays down I'll shed my jacket by noon and work in long johns and a shirt until lunch. I'll enjoy the food and the rest. I'll need the recharge.</P><P>       I wish I could write sounds, for my story is better if you hear this. This sound is compelling, and its message is passing. This and other sounds of the West remind people of better times.</P><P>       The sound starts deep, regular and rhythmic. It's loud but muffled. We can't see its source, yet we know what it is - but today it's a bit different. What's happened?</P><P>        A faller's saw wouldn't start, and he's standing on the tracks of a D 7 Cat with his chain saw over the exhaust. They're warming up together. His saw will start; the Cat's wake-up purr will shift to a good working growl, changing with load and slope.</P><P>       We were good at doing solid work, making logs from trees and getting them to a mill where they were converted to products people wanted. Although few on the crew thought of it this way, we were part of the international economy. Our work in the woods was economic coordination spontaneously at work. Here are the details we experienced and enjoyed.</P><P>       Cutters put standing trees on the ground without hanging the falling trees on others. They stuck the nail of the tape on the butt of what would become the first log. They walked the tree, limbing it on the way, then bucked it to log length, two or three logs per tree. Skidders jumped off their Cats, set chokers on two to six logs, swung back into the Cat and hit the winch.</P><P>       The mainline of the rigging tightened, and the chokers came taut. Maneuvering the Cat to avoid hang-ups on stumps, the skidder headed for the landing. He'd unhook the chokers and deck the logs, then spin the Cat and go for another turn. Football linebackers and collegiate wrestlers are well-suited to this work.</P><P>       It was great! I miss it still. And I didn't need a workout before going to work.</P><P>       We worked together and with nature. The faller and Cat skinner warming engines together, falling and bucking were with an eye toward choker setting and skidding; otherwise the snow would soon hide the logs. The work, the action, the coordination, the clear and unambiguous value of what we produced, I liked it a lot. Occasionally, when looking for something else in the ranch's shop, I find artifacts of those years.</P><P>       The story of that morning 23 years ago illustrates parts of the Wise Use philosophy so many critics ignore: strength, skill, trust, teamwork producing real products with obvious value. Neglecting these values in the interest of promoting a &quot;new West,&quot; all green and sensitive but absent grease and guts, isn't fully honest.</P><P>       As lattes replace logging boots, arrogance often overrides empathy. There are good people out there who identify with Wise Use. They have different and competing visions for the West's future. I thought of them this holiday season.</P><P>       I respect the best of these people just as I respect the best of my academic colleagues. I can't forget them even though I work more with symbols than with metal and drink wine rather than whiskey. The world they envision is no more. Like the open range, it can't be preserved in its old form. I'd like to help smooth the transition to a sustainable economy that respects liberty and recognizes the culture of our recent past.</P><P>       This is the holiday season that stresses good will to all. I hope we will have enough good will to realize that there are values of the old that would benefit the new Northwest. Perhaps we can build new communities with shared values of liberty and environmental quality. This is my goal for the new year. You are welcome to join me. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

Baden</P><P>THIS is my last column until I return from Montana next autumn.</P><P> While there, I'll continue working on the three E's of environmental policy: ecology, economics and ethics. Only systems that link freedom to act with responsibility for the results of the action work well in dealing with them. Others fail. Linking action with accountability for outcomes is a classic problem of political economy. It plagues efforts to harmonize our environmental and economic interests.</P><P>     All my columns deal with these themes. Next fall, when I return to FREE's Seattle office and the University of Washington, I will again apply economic thinking to pressing environmental and ethical issues. I often think of my columns while bicycling.</P><P>     Seattle and a ranch near Bozeman, Mont., are great places to live. For years, I have wanted to make the spring pilgrimage from Seattle to Bozeman by bicycle. This year my wife Ramona and I joined 110 participants for the first week of Cycle America's annual trip across America.</P><P>     Some bicycle tourists go self-contained. We see these hardy individuals on the road each summer. Their bikes resemble over-loaded pack animals with lumps of clothing, cooking gear, sleeping bags, and tents. Imagine a Porche 911 Carrera towing a U-Haul. These riders proudly identify as self-supported cyclists - others might call them masochists.</P><P>     In contrast, Cycle America provides fully supported tent touring. Trucks transport the extra clothing, sleeping bags and tents, and vans pick up the stragglers. Meals are prepared by people in local communities. The support staff is excellent, cheerful and highly competent. These cycle tourists are neo-Spartan hedonists.</P><P>     In the most luxurious kind of bicycle touring, cyclists carry only sun screen, water and a credit card. They sleep at inns and eat fine food. This Stoic Epicurean cycling is my favorite kind of tour. Each year FREE offers such a &quot;Seminar on Wheels&quot; for special friends. These Bozeman-based tours are &quot;rolling salons&quot; with readings for each day and seminar discussions over dinner. Last year we biked from Yellowstone to Glacier National Park. This year we'll tour the Big Hole Country of Southwest Montana.</P><P>     Linkages between economic and environmental systems are especially clear when cycling. For example, our Cycle America Tour left Bellingham and headed over Rainey and Washington Pass and into Grand Coulee. This area was logged early in the century. We saw large stumps from four to eight feet off the ground. Cyclists asked, &quot;Was logging only in the winter and was stump height determined by snow depth?&quot; No, I explained, the relative value of wood and labor, not snow depth, explains the high stumps of years ago.</P><P>     America had a huge timber inventory. Trees were so plentiful that their value was often negative. Fertile cleared ground was often worth more than land with standing timber.</P><P>     Because trees swell at their base, timber cutters created temporary platforms from which they sawed the trees above the butt swell. This left much high quality wood in the forest, but it saved labor. Our ancestors &quot;wasted&quot; wood to economize on labor.</P><P>     Today the relative values are reversed.</P><P>     We biked past several dozen sawmills filled with second-growth and third-growth logs. Today, some mills utilize tops down to 2 inches in diameter. Twenty-five years ago, some mills would take no top less than 7 inches. But as relative values shift, the market naturally adjusts, responding quickly to changing scarcities.</P><P>     Another adjustment is coming. On the third day of the trip, we arrived at Grand Coulee and Lake Roosevelt. I spoke with Gary Kuiper, recently retired superintendent of Lake Roosevelt National Recreational Area. He had served on parks throughout the United States and loves the Park Service.</P><P>     Throughout his career, he saw politics interfering with sound and sensitive management. He saw no way out of the dilemma between long-term protection and constant short-term political pressures. This political problem is increasingly obvious. It's the natural result of the &quot;scientific management&quot; model of the Progressive Era, a century ago.</P><P>     This approach assumes federal control by experts uncontaminated by self interest or political pressures. However, bureaucratic and political entrepreneurship normally trump scientific understanding, concern for local communities, and property rights. Ecological damage, economic waste, and ethical violations result.</P><P>     As problems grow, concerned citizens seek new answers. People who are intellectually and ethically responsible don't expect different results from the same institutions. They want institutional change. To be successful, new approaches must replace political management. I suggest that we adopt a variety of alternative institutional arrangements. These should be modest and careful experiments that rely on various mixes of nonprofit and for-profit organizations, not federal bureaucracies. The feds will monitor, not manage.</P><P>     We've had a hundred years experience with sylvan socialism and we know a lot about what doesn't work. This summer I'll explore new approaches to these problems with academic and business leaders, federal judges, journalists and environmental writers, and some Montana fun-hog cyclists. I look forward to sharing the results with you during the next academic year.</P><IMG SRC="/free/Images/biker.gif" WIDTH=341 WIDTH=249><IMG SRC="/free/Images/van.gif" WIDTH=212 HEIGHT=176><P>__________</P><P> John A.

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Lecture Four -- PFF</title>

Renewing American Civilization<br>
Class 4<br>
Pillar three, entrepreneurial free enterprise, focuses on entrepreneurial 
free enterprise as the great producer of wealth, solutions to problems, 
and developer of opportunities January 28, 1995. <br>
<P>

>>The following is a special program produced by RCTV, College 
television, in Waleska, Georgia. From college in Waleska, Georgia, this 
is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the fourth of 10 class 
presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at 
college, will continue his course, which presents the foundational 
principles necessary to the renewal of American Civilization. This week's 
lesson, pillar three, entrepreneurial free enterprise, focuses on 
entrepreneurial free enterprise as the great producer of wealth, 
solutions to problems, and developer of opportunities.
<P>
Welcome, and let me begin by welcoming the students of Mind Extension 
university, which is in, I think, some 26 million homes around the 
country. Let me remind everyone who is watching that you can mail your 
comments to: Renewing American Civilization, P.O.. Box 6008, Marietta, 
Georgia 30065. You can also fax your comments to 404-528-9806. Or you can 
e-mail your comments to America Online at renewam@aol.Com. Or you can get 
class transcripts and other class materials available on our Internet web 
page, which is too silly for me to repeat. That's not English, so I now 
refuse to say it. But anybody can write it down. I should say, by the 
way, I think John was telling us last night, John McDowell, that I 
believe there have been, like, 460 transcripts downloaded from Internet 
and, there have been another, I think, 100 from Compuserve and another 
100 from America Online. So people out there are getting it.
<P>
I was at the Library of Congress yesterday looking at the national 
digital library, and it is amazing what we're about to be able to do, and 
we're seeing it in terms of reaction to the course, and people are 
accessing us electronically. Finally, for more traditional folks, you can 
order "American Civilization" newspaper, video and audio tapes and the 
course readings, by calling 1-800-to-renew. And the fact is for about 90% 
of the country, that's still the most practical answer, is pick up the 
phone, call the 800 number, and don't worry about it. But it is 
interesting to see the expansion of what's happening. In this course, our 
suggestion is that there is an American Civilization, and that it has 
five pillars. That the five pillars are: the historic lessons of American 
Civilization, personal strength, entrepreneurial free enterprise, the 
spirit of invention and discovery, and quality as defined by. Now, what 
we're going to do is take two hours on each of these five pillars, and 
then we're going to talk about four areas, and we're going to apply the 
five pillars to four different areas.
<P>
First, to the third wave and American Civilization, what will the 
information age mean for America. Second, to creating American jobs in 
the world market. Third, to replacing the culture of violence and poverty 
with a culture of productivity and safety. And, fourth, citizenship and 
community in 21st century America. Of these, today's topic will be the 
pillar entrepreneurial free enterprise and looking at: why is 
entrepreneurial free enterprise so important? And that's where I want to 
start, because I want to explain just for a minute what we mean by that. 
We have to first examine in America: why is entrepreneurial free 
enterprise important? And I think this is a very key question to what 
we're trying to get at. Let me say, first of all, when I use the word 
"entrepreneur" from the French "to undertake," I don't just mean making 
money. The first time I taught the course, I used a section out of a book 
on dinosaurs called "T-Rex" by one of the leading current dinosaur 
collectors, and in the book, he talked about the fact that they found a 
Tyrannosaurus Rex and didn't have the money to get it out of the ground, 
and he explains all the different things they did to get the corps of 
engineers to lend them a bulldozer, get a company to loan them a big 
truck, get volunteers to go out. He undertook -and the meaning of the 
word "entrepreneur," he undertook to solve his problem. If you look at 
the great teachers in the country, 

<P>
If you look at Jaime Escalante in California who teaches Hispanic kids so 
that they can go to M.I.T.. and Cal tech on a regular basis because he 
makes calculus come alive in the barrio, he's an entrepreneur. He's an 
entrepreneur of learning, and he does what it takes to get it done. So 
entrepreneurship doesn't mean just getting rich. It means a psychological 
attitude that says: I will undertake something, and in that process, I 
will make sure it happens, and I will learn what I have to learn to get 
this done. That is, it is a project-centered learning. If I can for one 
second, this is one of the most important things to learn about the 
difference between the dead end we've gotten to in credentialing and how 
America works when it's healthy. In credentialing, we say to you: learn 
what is in this box. You will get five hours' credit, and then learn what 
is in this box, and you'll get five hours' credit. And when you learn 
enough boxes end to end, you'll have a Ph.D.
<P>
What entrepreneurs do is they say: I'm here now. I want to get here. 
Everything I have to learn in order to get there, I will learn. And it is 
the project which drives the learning. If I have to learn psychology in 
order to convince the banker to give me the loan, I'll learn psychology. 
If I have to learn management skills in order to be able to take care of 
a particular project, I'll learn management. If I have to learn 
accounting to be able to take care of the cash flow, I'll learn 
accounting. You tell me what the project requires, let me break it down 
into a series of learning sequences and I'll learn them, and my payoff is 
in the real world, not am I credentialed, but am I accomplishing 
something? And if I'm not, let me go back and start again and figure out: 
now, what is it I missed? So it's a learning-driven system, but the 
learning is defined by what we're trying to accomplish, and that is a 
very, very different approach. When you liberate human beings to be 
entrepreneurial, that is, you break down the bureaucratic habits and the 
sloth that says, "you sit there until I give you red tape and I tell you 
the regulations and I'll define for you" 
<P>
-- there's a great funny story Sonny bono told the other night. True 
story. Bono had retired from the entertainment business, had gone to Palm 
Springs, had bought a restaurant, he wanted to put up a sign. He goes 
into the city hall, he says, "I want to put a sign in my restaurant." The 
bureaucrat in city hall says, "you're in Palm Springs." He says, "I 
bought a restaurant. "I want people to know it's Bono's restaurant." He 
says, "you don't make the rules. "we make the rules. "fill out all these 
forms." Fills out the forms, he comes back, the bureaucrat says, "It will 
be a while before we decide whether or not you can have a sign." Bono 
comes back again, he said, "I've bought the restaurant, I'm making 
monthly payments. "I can't get people to come to my restaurant because 
they don't know it's Bono's restaurant, and I need a sign." Finally one 
day, he said he walked in and he said, "I've found a solution." And the 
bureaucrat looked at him and said, "It's not your job to find solutions. 
"we find solutions." Bono said, "I'm running for mayor and I'm going to 
fire you." And the other night at the Washington Journalism Foundation 
dinner, Bono looked out and he said, "but I'm a compassionate man. "he's 
my gardener now." 
<P>
Now, the point of the story, which I believe, by the way, up through the 
"I'm running for mayor," is absolutely true. The point of the story is 
that bureaucrats and academic credentialers and people who are locked 
into control, they basically create a sense of passivity on the part of 
the recipient. "you sit there and we'll take care of you." "you sit there 
and we'll get around to you." Entrepreneurs are very different, and 
again, because of the cynicism of the culture which broke down American 
Civilization beginning in 1965, they don't get -- they don't get this 
next paragraph. I'm going to read to you one of the most important 
paragraphs from Adam Smith's "the Wealth of Nations" in which he tries to 
describe why entrepreneurship works in a free
society.
<P>
He said the following, and I quote: "In spite of their natural 
selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, 
though the sole end which they proposed from the laborers of all the 
thousands they employ be the gratification of their own vain and 
insatiable desires, they are led by an invisible hand, and without 
intending it, without knowing it, advance the interests of society." Now, 
this is very much like the Federalists. The Federalists who are writing, 
after all, in the same period as smith, understand that it is human 
nature to be selfish. That all of us are selfish. That when you see the 
noble government officials, it's just disguised selfishness. When you see 
the noble reporter, the noble politician. Now, you can raise people to a 
higher moral standard. You can occasionally get a person to seek fame, to 
seek long-term glory, to believe in virtue over greed, but it's very 
hard, and it's not the natural state of things.
<P>
It is educating people above their normal behavior. That their normal 
behavior is to be self-interested. I mean, you find those exact quotes in 
Madison's -- in "the Federalist." But that if you free up people to 
pursue their self-interest in the marketplace rather than any political 
bureaucracy, that in order to please themselves in the marketplace, they 
have to sell you something that pleases you, or you won't buy it. So if 
you can harness their desires to your desires, so the only way they can 
succeed is to give you a service or a product you want, then they get to 
be happy because they're selling, and you get to be happy because you're 
buying, and if they aren't clever enough to figure out what you want, 
then they're not going to be clever enough to be successful. So they can 
only achieve their success by pleasing you, the customer. Now, that's the 
core of Adam Smith's argument that the more freedom you create, the 
greater the opportunity you will find a chance to buy what you want to 
buy, to live the way you want to live, because you'll now create an 
opportunity for entrepreneurs to invent things you never dreamed of.
<P>
I mean, nobody invented the thought of walkman till it was invented. I 
mean, nobody walked around all day and said, "gee, I sure do wish I could 
listen to a radio or a tape recording while I'm jogging." The second it 
was invented, people said, "I've got to have that. "I can't live without 
it." Nobody invented the microwave. I mean, nobody who sat around as a 
consumer and said, "I need a microwave." The minute it was -- or the fax 
is an even better example. I mean, the fax exploded in use once it was 
invented. But smith's point is that what you want to do is create a very 
free society in which whoever pleases you best, not the best Ph.D.., Not 
the best lawyer, not the best bureaucrat, not the most powerful person, 
not the richest person, the person who pleases you best is the one that 
resources shift to, because you as a consumer say, "I want that one." 
That's why you had the rise of Japanese cars. That's why you've had the 
resurgence of Ford. If you watch what happens, the competition ultimately 
exists to serve the customer, not to serve the producer.
<P>
And in that framework, what you've got to do is encourage maximum 
entrepreneurial behavior, and in a, sense you can see the Father Flanigan 
at "Boys Town" as an entrepreneur if you watch the Spencer Tracy movie. 
That's clearly entrepreneurial behavior. He had his vision of what he 
wanted to accomplish. He went out and put it all together. He overcame 
obstacles. And so entrepreneurial behavior is not just about getting 
rich, but it is about having a dream and figuring out: what does it take 
to put together the resources to achieve my dream? The resources may be 
inside you. I want to be a world figure skater or whatever. And the first 
key to this, I think, is that entrepreneurial free enterprise depends on 
personal strength. If you are not personally strong, you cannot possibly 
engage in entrepreneurial free enterprise. A couple of good reasons. 
First of all, you have to have the courage to take risks. It takes 
tremendous courage to -- again, to go out and try anything. I think I may 
have told you all at one point about I tried to learn how to roller skate 
when I was in my early 30s, and I had never roller skated. Its just 
something I hadn't done. And my two daughters, when I ran the first time 
and lost, they said to me, "okay, it's our turn.  we want you to learn 
how to roller skate." And I found myself in my early 30s, overweight, not 
particularly athletic, out on skates in a skating rink down in Newnan, 
Georgia, and a 4-year-old skated by backwards waving at me. And I'm 
looking down at this little kid and I'm barely able to stay up on my 
skates, and the kid is skating away from me backwards smiling, and I 
realized whatever it is you're learning for the first time is hard. And 
so whatever you've already mastered, when you go to the next one, it's a 
whole new experience. And you have to have courage to keep learning, to 
keep growing, to keep trying. Second, you have to have the discipline to 
persevere and to work harder. 
<P>
My older daughter owns a coffee company in Greensboro, North Carolina, 
and she's learned the hard way setting up her own business. She has two 
coffee stores and an 800-number mail order service, and a coffee cart at 
a hospital. Suddenly she has, I think, 20-something people that work for 
you. It's really hard work, you know, and yet she loves it, she enjoys 
it, she's having a great time, but it also owns her. I mean, first you 
own the store and then the store owns you. Okay? I mean, anybody who's 
ever been in a small business knows that's how it is. Well, you've got to 
decide you want it bad enough. I met recently with the Amway folks. We 
were talking about putting together for Americans who don't have money an 
entire program on cable television designed to say to them: you know, you 
can do beauty control, you can do Mary Kay, you can do Amway. There are 
100 systems you can get into for almost nothing if you want to get out 
there and you want to sell, but then it's hard work, but don't tell us 
you don't have an opportunity.
<P>
What you're telling us is the opportunities are too hard. Very different 
attitude. So you've got to have courage. Now, what I want you to look at 
for just a second is a little film about Alger. Alger is the great figure 
who popularized in the 19th century the concept of rising. I think as you 
watch this, you'll have some sense of what 19th century cultural values 
were about.
<P>
Don Johnson: gifted with a keen sense of observation, Alger began 
interviewing the children of American immigrants. Most were poor, many 
orphaned without family or teachers to inspire them or guide them. But 
these were Horatio's heroes. They earned their keep shining shoes, 
peddling newspapers, delivering messages, lucky to earn a penny or two a 
day. From their courageous stories, Alger produced 134 novels reflecting 
the theme of rags to riches through ambition, honesty, and respect. The 
titles tell it all: "sink or swim," "try and trust," "brave and bold," 
"strive and succeed," stories and bywords that motivated generations of 
American youth to reach for the stars. And just how many books did the 
rejected poet end up selling? Over 400 million copies, making him still 
the most widely read author in America and a name synonymous with 
hard-earned success. Alger's effort was to popularize, and it was modeled 
on Samuel smiles, who was a writer in Britain, and both of them were 
trying in the mid 19th century to say: here are -- in very simple, very 
easy-to-read books, here are the habits that work. Here is the way to 
succeed. Here is how you should live your life if you want to get ahead. 
In a very real sense, the key to this is to understand that Alger is 
about you. That the goal here is to say to every American: you should be 
an entrepreneur. If you aren't an entrepreneur, why not? You have all the 
freedom to be an entrepreneur. You have all the opportunity to be an 
entrepreneur. 
<P>
Remember, that means "to undertake." It doesn't mean you have to go out 
and start a small business. But it means you get up in the morning with 
an attitude that says, "gee, I wonder what I'll undertake today. "I 
wonder what I'll do today." Not how I'll suffer, not how I'll be 
victimized, not how I'll feel sorry for myself. What will I do? And that 
reminds me. You were asked last week to turn in reports of being -- 
people who were your personal hero or heroine, because so much of this is 
an attitudinal thing. Here are just a couple. I'm not going to give you 
the names, but here are various folks. "I've been influenced by a large 
number of very special people: my father, a teacher, my commanding 
officer in the service, people from history, but my greatest hero is my 
wife. "she had polio as a child, was told she would not live past age 14, 
spent a total of three years in a body cast as a result of five back 
operations, lost her first husband in an accident at age 30, and was left 
with three children and a bankrupt business. 
<P>
"Yet through faith and hard work, she has persevered and succeeded and is 
an inspiration to everyone she meets." And in the 19th century, she would 
be the subject of a Alger type book. In the 20th century, of course, 
since she's succeeding, she could not make it on Donahue. Whereas, if she 
would refuse to do anything, stay at home and explain that she'd been 
victimized by bad luck, she could be on at least three talk shows. Second 
example, "my heroine is my paternal grandmother, who mothered me in many 
ways. "she struggled with her husband in a dry-cleaning business, 
struggled with his alcoholism, had one child at age 36. "she probably 
overattended to family business and underattended her child, a child who 
would ignore her for the rest of her life. "her husband died in 1966, and 
she lived completely alone in little love for 20 more years. "she could 
have chosen to be bitter. "she could have chosen to isolate herself from 
her son and grandchildren. "Instead, she was always welcoming, nurturing, 
and loving her grandchildren, and never had a disparaging word for anyone 
in her family. 
<P>
"She is my heroine, and her gifts in the midst of apparent emptiness are 
a shining example." Third example, "my grandmother is my example of a 
heroine. "she survived four husbands, with two dying of heart attacks and 
watching one die of cancer. "through all this, she managed to raise three 
children, all of whom are successful leaders in the community today. "she 
also had a full-time job and worked another job to keep her family above 
poverty. "she has been a leader in her church for the past 30 years. "she 
has survived two heart attacks, and still continues to be a community 
leader, as well as a church leader today. "she inspires me through her 
continued strength and perseverance." Now, again, imagine every one of 
those excuses to say, "well, I've had it. "time to quit." Lastly, "while 
I was in the military, I had an instructor that was a Vietnam Veteran. 
"he'd been an air crewman on medivac helicopters and lost both of his 
legs while saving the lives of two marines.
<P>
"He overcame his disabilities to teach others. "His knowledge of rescue 
obviously saving many more lives." So I just want to give you a flavor 
that when we talk about courage, perseverance, strength, that this 
applies to every person. When we talk about being an entrepreneur, we're 
talking about every person. If you didn't get up this morning thinking, 
"It's great to be an American, I'm a free person, time to go do 
something," then the problem's in you. It's not in the country. Now, in 
that framework, there are three big concepts. First, the entrepreneur as 
a creative inventor. By that, I mean that when you encounter a problem, 
the trick for the entrepreneur is to invent the solution. Now, again, I 
mean -- so over and over, when an entrepreneur runs into a problem, they 
try to think through: what would solve this? Rather than: look at me, I 
can't get it done. And as a general rule, entrepreneurs have a lot of 
common sense and they are very creative at problem solving, and the more 
they practice being an entrepreneur, the more creative they are. 
<P>
Second, it is the customer or the market or the goal which defines 
success. That is, you have to decide: what is it you're trying to please? 
How do you keep score? And I'm not asking you to have a -- I think every 
American should keep score separately. You ought to keep your score. But 
when you do, it is this thing outside you, it's the customer or the 
marketplace or the goal, that's what defines for you what your success 
is, not inside you. So as an entrepreneur, I'm not talking about your 
values. Your values should be internal to you. I'm talking about how you 
focus your energy and your effort. It ought to be outside yourself, which 
you'll see also in "effective executive" is a major point, that leaders 
are focused outside. What are you trying to accomplish? Now, the third is 
to recognize that getting the job done is the focus. And again, the 
credentialing really tears us apart, because credentialing says getting 
the right piece of paper is the focus.
<P>
That's why modern education is collapsing. Because we have too many 
people who know how to get papers and too few who know how to learn, and 
you say -- that's why bureaucracies collapse. Bureaucracies say, "hey, we 
did all the processes. "Why are you mad at us? "The fact that nothing got 
achieved is not our fault. We had every meeting, we've stamped every 
paper, we reviewed every document. You shouldn't be mad at us." But an 
entrepreneur knows that it's getting the job done. See, you define the 
job, you make sure the job fits your goal, your market, or your customer, 
and then you get the job done, and you do what it takes ethically and 
legally to get the job done. Now, this comes into a fascinating thing 
which Jeff Eisenach and others have really opened me up to and the whole 
concept of: how do we define getting to success?
<P>
And I want to share with you what I think is truly, if you'll focus on 
it, a remarkable insight. There are two visions of success that grew up 
in the 20th century: Character building versus popularity seeking. That 
from Benjamin Franklin's "Poor Richard's Almanac" and the autobiography 
of Benjamin Franklin up through Napoleon Hill's "Law of Success," which 
is a great old book that I really recommend to you to just to at least 
check out of the library and take a look at. The "Law of Success" by 
Napoleon Hill, he went around and interviewed Andrew Carnegie and Henry 
Ford and Thomas and a generation of successful people, and he said: what 
works? And he wrote down what works. And if you read this, I mean, it 
says to any American: if you spent some time and read this, for example, 
the "Law of Success," Lesson 8, self-control, and he walks through why 
self-control matters. You find that he focuses consistently on building 
character, on what it is that we need to do. And you can read "the 
Effective Executive," which I'll come back to. You can read "Grinding it 
Out" by Ray Kroc. These are -- when people, "say how can I be 
successful?" "go to a used book store and get a copy of 'grinding it out' 
by Ray Kroc, or go to the library and check it out for free. "don't tell 
me you're too poor to learn." 
<P>
It's a great book. He founded McDonald's. It's a study of perseverance 
and his story of getting permission to build a McDonald's in Chicago, but 
only according to the specifications of the original McDonald's brothers 
building in California, which was in Bakersfield near the desert, getting 
to Chicago and realizing they had no basement for a furnace, and spending 
a year getting them to rewrite the documents so he could build a furnace 
in a basement, is hysterical. Or his discovery that one of the secrets of 
McDonald's is its French Fries. Anyone know why their French Fries are 
different? What do you mean by "blanch"? 
<P>
>>they're slightly cooked and I guess to seal in the moisture. No? Aged. 
no, they're aged. This is very important. He discovered -he couldn't get 
the French fries right in Chicago. He went back out to the desert. He -- 
again, he's following the problem to get the knowledge. He goes back out 
to the desert and he says, "what do you do?" They say, "well, when we buy 
the potatoes, we put them out back in the shed." Turns out they were 
dehydrating 8 to 10% of their body weight. The French fries from 
McDonald's are slightly dehydrated. That's why they're crisper. But he 
had to work his way back historically to figure out what they had done. 
It's a great book. Equally great book, Sam Walton. I mean, if a man makes 
$17 billion net worth, creates the largest retail system in the world, 
does it all after going broke and does it all as a very down-to-earth, 
practical kind of guy, maybe it's worth reading. And so when somebody 
says to you, "oh, gee, I don't know how to do all those things." Or in a 
more complex way, "the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen 
Covey. Very popular best seller, now out in paperback. Very worth 
reading. Available in your library.
<P>
And I say this in part so people who are in public housing and who have 
no money and can't find any opportunity at all say -- but are sitting 
there getting paid full-time to not have to do any work for an entire 
month, "walk to your nearest library. "pick up a book." The book which 
turned me a on to the whole concept of character versus popularity, a 
tremendous human being, John McCormick, "self-made in America." 
First-generation millionaire, went bankrupt at 29, sitting on the beach 
feeling sorry for himself. An older man of European descent came by and 
watched him for three days and finally said, "and why do you feel so 
sorry for yourself?" And he said, "oh, I went broke at 29." He said, 
"you're so lucky. "I was in my 40s before I went broke. "much better to 
get it out of your way now." And get back up on your feet and do it. And 
again, a modern version of napoleon hill, "Think and Grow Rich: a Black 
Choice" by Dennis Kimbrough, who's from here in Atlanta, and Napoleon 
Hill, translating specifically challenging black Americans and "saying, 
here is a way to do things." 
<P>
Now, in this context, what I want to suggest to you: that there is an 
entrepreneurial spirit in American history, and it teaches us at least 
three key lessons, and if you look at the history of entrepreneurship in 
America, you learn a lot, because we're the most entrepreneurial society 
in history. Lesson one: new experiences force us to rethink old rules. 
What used to work in Europe doesn't work in America. Big shock when you 
arrive from England or Germany or France, you're on the edge of the great 
forest, you're in a new society, a new environment, you'd better rethink 
it. Well, guess what? If you're at the edge of the information age, you 
know, our new frontier is this Third Wave Information Age. New rules are 
going to have to grow up, new discoveries, new ways of doing things. 
Lesson two: the market is more productive than the bureaucratic system. 
This is a very important central lesson. Are you going to gamble on being 
productive in a bureaucracy or are you going to gamble on being 
productive in the marketplace?
<P>
Now, if you say, "In the marketplace," I'd say to you, "fine, why do you 
have 18 years or why do you have 12 years of mandatory bureaucracy for 
education?" You've got to take seriously what the words mean. If the 
market's more productive, maybe we should rethink education from the 
ground up. If it's -- and so you've got to start -- not just education, 
the whole bureaucracy, the whole way we do medical care. Which do you 
believe in, bureaucracies or markets? And why? Third, lesson three: 
technological innovation can precede scientific understanding. It's a 
very important Americanism that we came very close to losing in the last 
20 years because of academics and credentialing. In the academic world -- 
and by the way, this is a big problem with the food and drug 
administration. Because if you can't explain -- aspirin could not be 
today brought to the market because we do not know why it works. You 
cannot do a paper explaining for the food and drug administration why 
aspirin's good. You know it's good, but you can't explain it. Since we 
can't explain it, you couldn't do it. It's exactly backwards. But if you 
go to credentialing, credentialing says, "If you can't explain it, it 
doesn't exist." 
<P>
So here you have the entrepreneur -- and again, this is why Americans 
historically were anti-intelligentsia, they were anti-credentialing. If 
you go back and you read the -- go back and look at how Americans dealt 
Europeans who had lots of college degrees, and there was an automatic 
sense of, "I'll bet you can't do anything competent," and the reason is, 
if you are driven to ascertain fact by credential, you do what your 
tenured professor tells you to do, and that's the truth, so that in the 
middle ages, they didn't go out and count the number of teeth in a horse. 
They read Aristotle and how many teeth Aristotle said a horse had, even 
if, in fact, it was no longer accurate. There's a book by white on 
medieval agriculture which he points out that the actual practices of 
agriculture were 1,000 years ahead of the way it was taught. 
<P>
Because the farmers weren't trapped into doing what the Greeks had done, 
so you just went and did better things. And they'd actually had 1,000 
years of invention by the middle of the middle ages in what farmers 
actually did, none of which showed up in the academic world. And so 
you've really got to look at this question of: what if it just works? 
Could we do it? What if we can't explain it? What if it's intuitive, or 
what if we have a discovery or we don't yet have an explanation? Could we 
just use it for a while? Penicillin. I mean, there was not a theoretical 
model to get to penicillin, but it worked. In fact, you may remember the 
reason they discovered penicillin is they were trying out an experiment, 
they couldn't get the bacteria to live long enough because the mold kept 
killing it. And they finally said: if the experiment is to figure out how 
to kill the bacteria but we can't get the experiment to work because the 
bacteria keep getting killed, maybe we ought to look at the mold. Which 
was an accident. Penicillin was an accident. It was a discovery. Now, 
entrepreneurial free enterprise works and bureaucratic credentialism 
fails for a couple of reasons. I think these are very, very profound 
about how far off track we've gotten from American Civilization. First, 
the real world is very complex. So many different things come together to 
make up the real world that it is impossible to capture them in any kind 
of academic environment. Second, much of reality is non-verbal, 
non-rational, and non-linear. You look across the room, you see the right 
person, you fall in love. Now, that's not just a romance novel, that's 
not just a movie. It really does happen. You are suddenly caught up in a 
situation, and everything in your life has gone fine and you get mugged, 
and suddenly whatever your current line is, it changes. Or you find out 
you have liver cancer. I mean, much of life, you know, you're having a 
really great time, you have a great marriage going on, and you have 
triplets. 
<P>
Your whole life changes. And my point's just that a lot of reality can't 
be captured by drawing lanes on a board or having academic studies. Best 
example of this, if I can, David Ogilvy, terrific guy, "Confessions of an 
Advertising Man," founder of Ogilvy-Mather, one of the great advertising 
geniuses of the post World War II era, this is his description, okay? 
He's in high school, and then he gets to college. "I was too preoccupied 
to do any work and was duly expelled. "that was in 1931, the bottom of 
the Depression. "for the next 17 years while my friends were establishing 
themselves as doctors, lawyers, civil servants and politicians, I 
adventured about the world uncertain of purpose. "I was a chef in Paris, 
a door-to-door salesman, a social worker on the Edinburgh slums, an 
associate of Dr. Gallup in research for the motion picture industry, an 
assistant to Sir William Stevenson in British security coordination, and 
a farmer in Pennsylvania. "my boyhood hero had been Lloyd George, and I 
had expected to be prime minister when I grew up. "Instead, I finally 
became an advertising agent on Madison avenue. "the revenues of my 19 
clients are now greater than the revenues of her majesty's government." 
<P>
And he goes on to talk about being all these different things, and he 
describes what it's like to work for a great chef in a great restaurant 
and the lessons he learned there that he takes 20 years later and applies 
to advertising, because he understood that if you learn everything and 
keep saying, "now, how does it apply to this," there's nothing which is 
outside the box for your lifetime, because you don't know what you're 
going to do later on. So when you say, "why am I doing this boring 
thing," the real question is, "what can I learn out of this boring thing 
that will apply later?" Totally different attitude. Nothing is boring if 
you think it applies to you. Is that not true? Just think about it. It's 
the key to why I learn a lot, because I think everything applies, so you 
can walk in and talk to me about anything and I go, "wow, that's 
interesting." Because sooner or later somewhere I'll be able to figure 
out how to apply it, and that's Ogilvy's point. The third big principle, 
I think, is that learning by discovery should inform and guide planning, 
not vice versa. Now, the idea of learning by discovery is very, very 
important. Go out and do it, and as you're doing it, say to yourself, 
"what am I learning?" This is how I'm becoming Speaker, by the way. I 
mean, we're doing it and then we're checking it out every night, we go: 
now, what did we learn today? So the opposite of planning. Because, you 
see, what happens is -- and here's the -I'm going to see if I can put it 
up here in a chart real quick. What we tend to say is: okay, we will now 
have a planning meeting. This is our plan. Unfortunately, it turns out 
reality is outside the plan. 
<P>
What do we normally do? We translate this and lie to ourselves and bring 
it to here. Right? Because we're going to do our plan. Instead, if you 
say, I think I'm going in this general direction, but I think I'll figure 
out if this is what's happening, I think I'll try to learn from what I'm 
experiencing, it's a very different model, and then I'll do my planning, 
getting up every morning, trying to think through: what did I discover 
yesterday based on what I was learning? And now I think I'll apply that 
to rethinking my plan. As opposed to: what did I plan? Which means -- 
which is going to make me deny reality and go ahead and do it even if it 
isn't smart. Now, there's a powerful reason for this, and this may 
surprise you. It's inside us. Self-interest is real and powerful. Self, 
you, yourself. I'm talking about you personally in this class. 
<P>
You have a powerful self-interest. One of the things, if you use it as an 
entrepreneur, is self-interest leads you to learn about your projects so 
you can achieve your goals. This is self-learning. "boy, I really want to 
get this done. "I better really focus on it. "what do I have to learn so 
I'll be happy, because I'll get what I want?" But the very same 
self-interest encourages you to hide from negative information. It is 
self-protection. The technical term in society is cognitive dissonance, 
blocking information, which will cause you to have to rethink what you're 
doing. You buy a dress you really love, except you look horrible in it. 
You don't want to be told you look horrible. Now, you know you should be 
told you look horrible in it because you really don't want to look 
horrible in it, but then again, if they tell you you look horrible in it, 
think how bad you'll feel about all the money you just spent on this 
dress that looks horrible? So which do you want? Do you want your friends 
to say to you, "boy, is that horrible"? Or do you want your friends to 
say to you, "well, it's an interesting dress"?
<P>
Do you see the problem that builds up? I was talking to the guys on that 
one. You know, several of you -- just think about those long weekends. 
Now, the point is when you think about -- or getting your haircut or 
whatever. What I'm trying to say to you is you've got to think about half 
of you wants to be told the truth even if it's painful, because you 
really want to do better, and after all, you won't do better if you don't 
have the truth. The other half of you wants to be protected from the 
truth if it's painful, because you don't like the pain. Bureaucracies and 
credentialing minimize self-learning and they maximize self-protection. 
"I don't have to learn these things. "I'm already a tenured Ph.D.., So I 
don't care what you think of my class." This is not true of me 
personally, but this is a -do you see what I'm saying? "I'm a bureaucrat, 
so even if I'm an arrogant, stupid bureaucrat doesn't matter, because you 
can't fire me. "It's too much trouble." On the other hand, because 
markets won't let you hide from failure, they maximize self-protection 
and they minimize -- I mean, they maximize self-learning and they 
minimize self-protection. In the marketplace, if you lie to yourself, you 
go broke. People refuse to deal with you. You know, if I'm a bureaucrat 
and you have to see me to get your driver's license, I can be as nasty as 
I want to be, because you have to see me.
<P>
But if there are three competitive driver's license offices and they pay 
the government a little fee to be allowed to issue driver's licenses, 
you're going to go to one that is the most efficient, the most courteous, 
the most available. Now, I, the bureaucrat who's now a contracted out 
self-serving person, I now have to be nice to you or you won't come to my 
particular drive -- there's no reason you couldn't issue driver's 
licenses through three or four or five different companies. Each of them 
would pay the state a fee for issuing the driver's licenses. Sure. You're 
seeing lots of different things. But just think about it. You see it in 
hospitals. I mean, look at the ads you now see: "come to our hospital. 
"you have more fun having a baby with us." I mean, I don't know of any 
woman who's had a baby who thought that was a convincing ad, but it's -- 
but the principle's right.
<P>
But notice the difference in the two systems. In a credentialed, 
bureaucratic structure, if you don't like what I'm doing, tough break. I 
don't have to learn it, because I'm still here. In a market environment, 
if I don't pay attention and I don't do what the market wants and what 
the customer wants, I go broke. Now, because of self-learning and 
self-interest, entrepreneurialism ultimately requires a moral basis. This 
is one of the things which I think the modern age has explicitly failed 
to understand. You see the cynicism and the attitude of the elite culture 
and of the press corps about this whole notion of markets and 
entrepreneurs and bureaucracy, what they don't get, and frankly, this is 
partly because of some levels of libertarian thought. What they don't get 
is that Adam Smith wrote two great books. The more famous is "the Wealth 
of Nations." It is actually his later book, and I suspect in his own mind 
his less important one, this is "the Theory of Moral Sentiments." Let me 
say up front, it is a lot harder to read than "Grinding it Out" by Ray 
Kroc. This is very dense, mid 18th century literature. But his argument's 
very simple, and it's well worth your spending a minute on. Smith is a 
moral philosopher. He's not an economist. Economics -- and this goes back 
to credentialing. In the early -- in the original world of learning in 
the 18th and 19th century when Smith came out, you learned what you 
needed to learn to write what you needed to write.
<P>
Only in the modern age under the influence of the German school of 
professionalism we began to break it down so that this is an economist, 
this is a political scientist, this is a historian. And we have all these 
various subdivisions which are our efforts to break life down so we think 
we can master it by knowing a great deal about one subset. So I know a 
lot about your wallet as an economist, and I therefore know you, which is 
silly. Of course it's not true. Smith, however, was of a different world. 
Smith was a moral philosopher. He would have thought of economics as a 
subset of moral philosophy. And in the theory of moral sentiments, he's 
trying to wrestle with: why do people behave the way they do? 
<P>
He comes up with a great concept. It's important, remember, the invisible 
hand is his model in "the Wealth of Nations," that the free market guides 
us to serve the most people in order to make the most money, and if we 
don't make you happy, you won't pay us, so you won't be happy and then 
wewon't be happy, so our own self-interest forces us to learn about your 
self-interest, which is why the marketplace is the most self-disciplining 
mechanism ever built, much more so than a totalitarian police state. 
Because it is the invisible system which forces me to make me happy to 
figure out what will make you happy. And since Spielberg does it with 
"Jurassic Park," he got more money, so he's happy. If he produces a bomb, 
he won't be happy. And even though he might say, "I sure wish we could 
pass a law to make all of you go to my next three movies," as long as 
it's a free market, he will only succeed by pleasing you. So that's the 
invisible hand.
<P>
In Volume 1, the earlier work, "the Theory of Moral Sentiments," what 
Adam Smith says is there is a man or woman in the mirror. Every person, 
except for people who are sociopaths, every person has an invisible 
mirror in their head which they look into and they say, "Is it right?" 
And they can't avoid it. And they do wrong, but they know it's wrong. I 
mean, since we're all weak, we all do wrong, but he says -- he builds a 
theory of moral sentiment. He says the base of society is right and 
wrong. It's not money, it's not economics, it's right and wrong. And that 
a healthy society consciously thinks about: how do we establish a 
framework in which the rules tend to favor those who ask that question 
and listen to it? So it's a framework that favors the honest over the 
crooked. Now, that may sound obvious, but it's not obvious. It's a 
framework for example which would be very tough on passing bad checks, 
because it is a deliberate act to defraud your neighbor.
<P>
And so we would say, "hey, we want to really reward honesty. "we want to 
set a standard of honesty, "we want a standard of not taking from your 
neighbor." Very different kind of society. And Smith saw economics, "the 
Wealth of Nations," as a part of this much larger picture, which begins 
with the notion that if we're going to have a free society, if we're 
really going to -- if you think about it, free societies require enormous 
levels of trust. We'll form a partnership. We'll both work at it. That's 
a very high level of honesty. That's an assumption that you're not going 
to try to rig the game and cheat me. If you live in a society -- there 
are cultures on the planet where people don't trust each other. They wake 
up in the morning with distrust. In that kind of a society, it's very 
hard to work together to be creative, because I assume you're going to 
cheat me, so I've got to figure out all sorts of -- this is why lawyers 
are devastating to American Civilization. Because lawyers create an 
adversarial environment. 
<P>
I mean, if you live in a country where there are TV commercials that 
basically say, "If you haven't sued somebody recently, why don't you 
bring your rolodex down and let us go over it together"? I mean, the 
legal system of adversarial thinking is devastating to an entrepreneurial 
society. Because it begins to break down the barrier of friendship and 
relationship and trust, and begins to say -- we're having -- I mean, I've 
found in my own business now that there are moments when the lawyers who 
now are trying to protect me and make sure I don't do anything are 
saying, "well, if you do 'x,' it will set up 'y,'" so you're being told: 
don't do the common-sense, compassionate, decent thing, because it will 
be a pretext for a lawsuit. You've got to wake up every morning assuming 
every person you deal with could potentially sue you. Now, that is death 
to an entrepreneurial society. The lawyers. In a totally misshaped 
understanding of what the purpose of the legal system is. It is not the 
purpose of a legal system to find ultimate justice at the ultimate end no 
matter how destructive the total cost.
<P>
The purpose of a legal system is to create a framework in which people 
live together with reasonable costs, solving problems in a reasonable 
way. Now, what you have today is a legal structure which is dominated by 
the trial lawyers who make the money by the lawsuits, who rig the game in 
favor of more lawsuits. I mean, it is a very sick system, and it has to 
be thoroughly overhauled.
<P>
Do you think it can be changed?
>>sure. That's what we're all about. You can come to the town hall 
meeting. Are you doing a town hall meeting today? Sure. At noon in 
Woodstock. I do it every Saturday. But my point is, is you think about it 
culturally. This is a cultural point. It's a point makes in his book that 
he says the two greatest challenges to us in the world market as a 
society are the cost of health care and the legal system, which creates 
adversarial psychology. And that comes right back to this notion to have 
an entrepreneurial free society, you have to consciously cultivate 
honesty and a sense of trust, and you have to instill that and you have 
to reward those who follow it, and you have to punish those who break it. 
Otherwise -- and punishment can be things as simple as economic costs. I 
don't mean put them in jail, but finding says -- somebody once said 
reestablishing shame. You know, re-creating a sense of: that's bad 
behavior. That's unacceptable. Now, in that framework, let me just 
suggest to you that markets reinforce success, but bureaucracies 
reinforce the failure to get accurate information.
<P>
That to maximize your own success, you have to emphasize honesty and 
integrity and discourage misleading or dishonest information. This goes 
right back to remember the notion that if you put on a dress or a suit 
that doesn't look good, in a truly healthy society, you would like your 
closest friend to suggest to you taking it back. Wouldn't you? Isn't that 
the real the fact, that you'd like to get honest feedback, but to get 
honest feedback, you have to live in a society which values it? On the 
other hand, if you think you'll be punished for giving honest feedback, 
you know, "complain about us and we'll see that your papers get lost and 
the bureaucracy won't approve it for three months," or, you know, "mess 
with me and you won't get tenure," or "mess with me and you won't get a 
good grade," and so the more you can get down to a marketplace, the 
further you can get away from bureaucracies and credentialing and the 
better off. 
<P>
This fits, by the way, the one uniquely American philosophy, pragmatism 
as developed by William James. "Pragmatism," which actually grew out, and 
James gives credit to an earlier American who'd written an article 
actually in a scientific magazine, is a fascinating concept. It's 
originally based on the work of Charles Pierce, and what Pierce was 
trying to discover is: how do Americans think? And what he concluded was 
that Americans have developed a new philosophy where they looked at 
reality and then came back and created their thoughts. The pragmatic did 
not mean to sell out. In Washington today, "pragmatic" often means 
selling out. That's not what the term meant. The term "pragmatism" meant 
trying to use common sense and your real understanding of real life in 
order to then formulate a philosophical understanding working back from 
it. Being pragmatic meant taking in all the data, thinking it through, 
and then reaching a conclusion that fit the realities you were dealing 
with. And it was seen by 19th century Americans as the absolute logical 
way to deal with things. 
<P>
So you didn't start out and say, "look, here's what I have in my head. 
"let me now re-interpret reality so it fits what's in my head." It said 
the opposite: "let me try to understand reality and then come back and 
think in my head what I should do now that I've been in close touch with 
the real world." Did not mean, you know, to compromise. It did not mean 
to sell out. It did not mean any of those things. It was, in fact, a way 
of trying to come in close touch with practical reality. Which is why 
pierce first writes about it in a popular scientific magazine, not a 
philosophical journal. He's trying to grab: why are we such an inventive 
people? Because we're willing to pragmatically try to solve things, as 
you'll see next week when we talk about the spirit of invention and 
discovery. This is a country which has a huge drive to invent, to 
discover. You know, Benjamin Franklin invents the lightning rod. Why does 
he invent it? Because he wants lightning to quit hitting buildings. How 
does he invent it? He tries to figure out something that will draw the 
lightning -- the electricity away from the building. I mean, why did he 
use the product he used? Because it worked. "It worked" is -- for most of 
American history, "It worked" or "It failed" were definitive statements. 
Only in more recent times do you say, "well, it may be failing, but let 
me give you the really good explanation of it." In most American history, 
it was, "well, that didn't work. "let's go try something else" which is a 
pragmatic kind of approach. 
<P>
There are five enemies of entrepreneurial free enterprise: bureaucracy, 
credentialing, taxation, litigation, and regulation. Let me walk you 
through them. First, bureaucracy. Bureaucracy teaches that process is 
more important than achievement, that rules are more important than 
productivity, and that bureaucrats should dominate productive people. And 
I think those -- and all three of those are absolute -- I could validate 
1,000 times a day that those three things happen every day. Second, 
credentialing. You can apply this to your own experience of college; 
emphasizes attendance over achievement, obedience over creativity, and it 
emphasizes an elite's definition of useful knowledge. And the elite, by 
the way, is largely a credentialed elite. It's not an aristocracy or an 
elite of achievement. Third, taxation shifts resources away from hard 
workers, achievers, and entrepreneurs into the control of bureaucrats. 
Taxation discourages the productive by taking from them the fruits of 
their effort. 
<P>
Taxation transfers wealth from the best market-oriented entrepreneurs 
into the control of government careerists who focus on inputs, not 
outcomes, and who measure processes, not successes. "how committed are 
you to dealing with drug addiction" is a question which means: will you 
spend a lot more money? It does not mean if you find out that the most 
effective drug programs in America are very cheap, do we take all the 
expensive ones and replace them with cheap ones? Which, by the way, turns 
out to be true. Almost all successful transformational programs are very 
inexpensive, because they rely on a missionary spirit and a spirituality, 
which are antithetical to government bureaucracies. And almost every one 
of them are cheaper than the parallel government service which fails. Yet 
if you were to say, "I have a terrific idea. "I'm so committed to helping 
addicts, we should cut the program in half," people would think you were 
crazy, because that is not how the modern welfare state measures. 
<P>
It measures process, not result. Investment, not outcome. Regulations are 
a burden to entrepreneurs, a diversion of their time, often a process 
that requires learning the bureaucrat's meaning and the bureaucrat's 
system even when it objectively has no impact on reality. It is a daily 
reminder that the bureaucrat is more powerful than the entrepreneur in 
modern America. That's a very key statement. At the present time in 
modern America, a totally obscure bureaucrat who has achieved nothing and 
knows nothing has more power than a person who creates a million jobs. 
You decide which of the two can put the other out of business. Litigation 
is a direct threat to the entrepreneur. Operating on scarce resources to 
create a better future, the entrepreneur is constantly threatened by the 
specter of a lawyer whose lawsuit will, at a minimum, divert time and 
money, and may literally bankrupt the endeavor. Just when the 
entrepreneur should be focused on achievement, he or she must focus on 
legal self-protection. Now, those are the five killers of entrepreneurial 
behavior, and so what we're going to think about as we come back in the 
second hour is we're going to lay out looking at: how do we create a more 
entrepreneurial society? 
<P>
Remember, "entrepreneur" means "to undertake." It doesn't mean just to 
make money, but we want an entrepreneurial society so that people create 
local ballets, they create local sports team, they create local 
charities, local hospitals. Entrepreneurship is the idea. I think I want 
to get something done, I will go undertake it. Now, what you want to have 
is a healthy free society where there are 260 million people who get up 
in the morning and go, "wow, this is a great day. "we're free. "we're 
Americans. "I wonder what I'll undertake today?" And then if we do that, 
our gamble is, this has been our gamble for 300 years, that the explosion 
of energy that we arouse by allowing everyone to pursue happiness creates 
such enormous creativity that it drowns the more disciplined, efficient 
systems of centralized dictatorship. So we'll let the other team have the 
bureaucracy, they'll be real smart for three weeks.
<P>
We will then drown them in the sheer energy and creativity of free 
Americans who are liberated and who, therefore, rush around with enormous 
energy trying to pursue happiness. Very core cultural commitment of our 
civilization. So any -- I think John said there was, like, a minute and a 
half. Any questions? Yes, sir.
<P>
'What kind of an advantage or disadvantaged environment would you say 
that having been a historian and not an attorney in your political life, 
which is essentially a world of lawyers, has been? Well, I believe it's 
not being an historian. I believe whatever you want to do, study the 
history of those who did it. That's what napoleon hill did. If you ask me 
to what -- what advantage do I gain by any problem I face, I start by 
saying, "tell me a story." And I listen to the history of the problem. I 
listen to the history of the people around it. Why did they fail to solve 
it? What are their views. So if you say -- if you're asking me how 
valuable do I think it is to start by learning about reality by studying 
history? I think it is irreplaceable. I think it's one of the real keys 
to my success. It's different than being a historian. It's useful to have 
historians who write histories you can then read, but every American, I 
mean, I think every successful entrepreneur who's smart, you learn this 
over time, starts by studying the history of what they're trying to do, 
and I think in that sense it's invaluable. So when we come back, we're 
going to pick up the notion of what would getting back to American 
entrepreneurial behavior, reestablishing the "Laws of Success" of 
Napoleon Hill, and looking at how to be an effective entrepreneur, a 
variation on "Effective Executive," and we'll gather in a couple minutes.
<P>
(break)
<P>
>>let me remind you where we're at at this point. We're talking about to 
undertake, entrepreneurialism. And what I'm going to suggest to you in 
the next few minutes, using the standard model for planning that we've 
talked about for analysis and planning, is we're going to look at 
entrepreneurial vision, entrepreneurial strategies, entrepreneurial 
projects, and entrepreneurial tactics. So we're going to literally come 
right down to a model of vision, strategies, projects, and tactics, and 
we're going to look at in a large sense, if you really wanted every 
American to have in themselves the sense of it, if you grew up in 
America, planning to undertake things, planning to be an entrepreneur, 
what would it be like? Interestingly, it's very different than the 
working model that came out of world war ii. Remember, in World War II, 
we mobilized 15 million people, put them in uniforms. Big systems did big 
things. We had the manhattan project to invent the atomic bomb. We had a 
huge fleet.
<P>
We got in the habit of if you look at the Eisenhower cycle, you have the 
habit, and it's legitimate in total war, a large structure doing large 
things in a very orderly manner, and so the big became the thing. We -- 
you know, we admired IBM, we admired general motors. But now look at an 
entrepreneurial society. What would you favor? You'd favor the small, the 
beginner, the one who undertakes. Now, imagine you rewrote your tax code. 
Right now, if you work for a big corporation, you get a tax break if you 
buy your health insurance. If you're self-employed, you don't. Just start 
with that and work your way through the whole system. So imagine you 
started and you said right now, if you're in the welfare system and you 
go out and start to work for Amway and you report your earnings, you get 
kicked off welfare, so you might earn enough out of Amway to begin to 
learn how to sell and to begin to learn how to work and to begin to learn 
how to have money, but if you got just that first rung of the ladder, 
basically what we've done in the welfare state is two things. We've said, 
in terms of big and small, that government which is very comfortable with 
the big. 
<P>
The president could meet with the head of the three auto companies. You 
can't meet with 20 million small businesses. So in a sense, the 
government tilt between big and small, the bias is towards big. The big 
-- and it's not because of any corruption. It's because they're easier to 
find. They're more organized. So you say, "let's pass a regulation." The 
big already have lawyers on their staff. It's the small who have to go 
out and hire a lawyer. So the big says, "not a big deal. "this is not a 
bad regulation. "just more work for my lawyer." The small goes, "that's 
my margin of profit." Okay? Second, to understand an entrepreneurial free 
society, you have to have a ladder. This is a ladder. I can't draw very 
well and I can't write very well, but just bear with me. What the welfare 
state does is it -- it says: you'd better jump from here -- this is a 
stick person. 
<P>
This is not a giraffe. In a healthy free society, you're down here. 
You're poor. You get to the first rung. What the welfare state does is it 
says: if you can't jump from here to here, we're going to punish you. So 
you can't go out and get a part-time job. It's illegal. You can't go out 
and begin to undertake. It's illegal. You couldn't open up a beauty shop 
in your public housing apartment. It's illegal. Yet how did people 
historically rise? They worked at home, they did odd jobs, they got a 
little bit of money, they learned the habits, and three to five to six 
years later, they're up here. We've killed the first five years of 
rising. Made it illegal. And that's why you've got to revisit this whole 
thing. You know, a smart society favors entrepreneurs, because 
entrepreneurs provide the resources for helping others. I mean, if you're 
going to -you know, if you're going to tax the successful, it's helpful 
to have lots of successful, and if you have enough people -- if you have 
enough people who are successful, they give away enough money.
<P>
Andrew Carnegie endowed 2,563 libraries. He built them personally. The 
deal was the city or town would provide the land. And they would provide 
the books. He'd provide the building. 2,563 personally given libraries 
around the world. Now, in order to do that, he had to be very successful. 
And yet today, we don't -- there are a lot of people who love jobs, but 
they hate job creators. So they punish the job -- sort of like loving 
eggs and hating geese. So you keep shooting geese so that you can't get 
any golden eggs, because you'd be happy to have eggs, but the stupid 
geese keep coming in. Very important to say if you really want energy and 
success and wealth, you'd better encourage lots of people to be 
entrepreneurs. Now, culturally, we're still okay. We haven't totally 
broken down, despite the discontinuity from 1965 to 1995. Americans favor 
achievement over bureaucracy, learning over education, health over health 
care, housing over housing authorities, safety over government 
ineffectiveness, and job create over taxation and regulation.
<P>
And literally, what I'm suggesting is you can take the ones we favor, 
achievement, learning, health, housing, safety, and job creation, and 
start saying: all right, what would be -- the changes be like to get to 
there, the changes culturally, the changes in the society, the changes in 
government? Or to put it differently, look at the difference between 
entrepreneurial business and bureaucratic business, entrepreneurial 
government and bureaucratic government. I mean, government doesn't have 
to be bureaucratic, and business is not automatically entrepreneurial. 
There are big corporations that are so bound up in red tape and so 
bureaucratic that they are basically parallel variations on the 
government. And there are some government systems that are so lean and so 
creative that they arelike the most -- they're like the best of the 
entrepreneurial systems. So the question is not: where is the structure? 
It's not government versus business. The question is: are you 
entrepreneurial, are you problem solving, are you creative, are you 
focused on the market and on the customer and on getting the job done?
<P>
Or whatever you happen to be, private or public, are you slow and 
dominated by procedures and dominated by red tape and dominated by people 
who tell you the rules rather than the achievements? And those are 
psychological. Now, another factor here, and this is going to be a huge 
factor in the next few years, a healthy, productive system is very 
decentralized. I can't say this too strongly. Very decentralized. What 
you want to do, I mean, it's interesting if you watch the way I am 
speaker. People think I'm the strongest speaker in maybe 70 years. The 
fact is, I decentralize all the decisions. Dick Armey runs the house on a 
day-to-day basis. We have very strong committee chairmen. My strength 
comes by delegating back out to lots of good people who are then to get 
the job done so that they are solving the problems. I called Joe Paterno 
a couple months ago and asked him about being a head coach. He said: one 
of the keys is to let your assistant coaches make mistakes.
<P>
Because if they can't make mistakes, they can't grow. So you've got to 
delegate, get it away from you, let them go learn. You want a very 
decentralized society. You want local people making local decisions. It's 
a totally different model from the sort of centralized command 
bureaucracy which grew out of Ludendroff's management of Germany in World 
War I and then was gradually primated throughout the modern world and 
ended up with people thinking you could plan health care and you can plan 
education. You need centralized national plans. Totally wrong. You need a 
centralized national direction. You need leadership that says, "we're 
going that-a-way." But when you say, "go west," you then want 20,000 
individual wagon trains. You don't want to try and have one centralized, 
you know, government wagon center. A very different model. And as a 
result of being decentralized, a healthy, productive system has a lot of 
small units. 
<P>
So that one of the things you want to do is you want to constantly create 
the nurturing of: how do I spin off small things? For example, when Zoo 
Atlanta became privatized instead of the mayor of Atlanta spending five 
minutes every three months thinking about Zoo Atlanta, you had a 
full-time director and a president of the Zoo Atlanta -- of the friends 
of the zoo who worked on it every day all day, because they now had 
control and they were in charge. It went from $850,000 budget to a $9 
million budget. It went from being almost disaccredited because it was so 
bad to being a world class research zoo. It's totally privatized. All the 
funding's now private. There's no tax money left. And by decentralizing 
away from the city of Atlanta to that unit doing its own thing, we have 
dramatically changed how it operates. Now, one of the reasons the post 
office is failing, frankly, is that it's neither fish nor fowl. We've 
neither said to it, "you're now in charge, good luck," nor do we take it 
under the government and say, "we're going to reshape you, because we're 
in charge." 
<P>
So you have a bunch of guys who aren't really in charge because the rules 
are set by the congress, and then the work rules are set by the union 
negotiations, and then it's a mess. And we would be much, much better off 
to decide decisively: how do you want to get it run, and then run it. And 
get it away from the federal government, which can't think about these 
things. I mean, you can't think about Bosnia, Chechnya, Somalia, Haiti, 
Rwanda, trying to think about the entire national economy, and then 
micromanage a system of 800,000 employees. Nobody has that kind of span 
of control. So what you want to do is have lots of smaller units. You 
want to constantly devolve things away, get them back to somebody who can 
actually do something. A healthy, productive system is best educated and 
shaped by markets. I'm lost. What are you doing? Let me go back and try 
again. If you look at the notion of marketplaces, what we're suggesting 
here is that to truly shape things, you want to have the market making 
the decisions. 
<P>
Not the bureaucracy, not the politicians, not the academic elite, not the 
lawyers, but the marketplace. And you want to find out some way so that 
you have choice. In a funny way, it means you're constantly thinking 
about you as a consumer. How do I maximize your right to choose, your 
right to choose in health care, your right to choose in education, your 
right to choose in government services? If there's not some overwhelming 
reason for it to be a government monopoly, why not simply decentralize it 
and dump it into the market? Even if the government wants to do it. Have 
the government do it in a competitive manner. Now, it's also fair to say 
that as a result, if you're going to have a very decentralized system 
with lots of small units running around focused on the markets, that a 
healthy, productive system has a lot of leaders. And that that model, 
having a lot of leaders, means you've got to think about a system where 
it's not who's the president or who's the speaker or who's the 
government, but it's: who's doing something neat today?
<P>
So Bill Gates shows up, he dropped out from college, he never got a 
degree, and he happens to be worth billions of dollars and he runs 
Microsoft, which happens to be the most heavily capitalized company up to 
GM in the world. Or somebody else shows up, you know, Steve Jobs drops 
out of college and invents apple computer. Or Spielberg creates "Jurassic 
Park." I mean, what works is what works. This goes back to remember 
pragmatism? How can you tell what works? Because it's working. And what 
happens is credentialed people and academics and bureaucrats want to have 
something that gives them stability. They want to decide what works. And 
so very often, they will define the most grotesque failure as a good step 
in the right direction. You know, have you ever noticed there are no 
public failures? I mean, you know, if McDonald's did as bad at serving 
the customer as public housing, it would not only bankrupt, it would 
probably put the head of McDonald's in jail. But there are no public 
failures. If you put the word "public" in front of something, it's 
morally good. That's an example of what happened in the mid 20th century.
<P>
I mean, why is it morally good? Why should the word "public" mean 
anything except that it's a great word? I mean, yet you can talk about 
people and you can say, "well, public spokesman" for it as though private 
is bad. But what we're suggesting here is that what you want to test is: 
does it really work? What are the real products? Let me tell you, you 
measure much of modern government by that test, it's gone. You measure 
much of education by that test, it's gone. You measure a lot of health 
care by that test, it's gone. Because if you go to the customers and you 
say, "are you happy? "do you think you're getting the best product? "Is 
something actually working?" You'll suddenly discover that they're being 
coerced by the legal power of the state to engage in behaviors they would 
not voluntarily engage in and which they don't think are very productive, 
and so what you want to do is you want to say, "all right, by definition, 
you show me something real big and I'll show you something we should 
rethink," and that includes the Pentagon.
<P>
I mean, I'm not standing here saying, "let's not look at everything but." 
I'm saying: you look across the board, and then you've got to say if you 
want the society to get something done, try to keep it private, try to 
keep it small, try to keep it decentralized, try to find local leaders 
who grow by doing. Which is totally different than a credentialed simply 
bureaucratically planned system. Then you come back to the notion, which 
is really the scary part of this, that entrepreneurial free enterprise 
includes the right to fail. Very important. I mean, if you're not going 
to let people fail why do you think they're going to learn? If you have a 
school system that says, "as long as you show up, I'll give you a 'C,' 
even if you can't read, I'll at least promote you because we don't want 
to make you feel bad about yourself," nonsense. If you're 9 or 10 years 
old and you can't read, I want you to feel terrible about yourself. 
<P>
I want you to say to yourself, "I have got to buckle down here and learn 
this, because I am never going to get a job in my whole life." I mean, I 
want you to feel miserable if you can't read when you're 15, and I want 
you to say, "I feel so miserable, I'm going to start learning how to" 
read. If we say, "well, it's really socially acceptable because we know 
you mean well and we don't want in any way to impair your self-esteem," 
baloney. If you can't read, I want you to have terrible self-esteem and 
then buckle down and learn how to read. Yes, it's scary. But the truth 
is, you can't read. If you can't read, you can't get a job. If you can't 
get a job, you don't have money. If you don't have money, you don't have 
any power. So now we've said: we want you to be the powerless person with 
a lot of self-esteem. We've lost our minds. There's no harm in failing. I 
keep telling that to my friends. I ran twice and lost. 
<P>
My first try at writing a novel was so bad that Alvin Toffler's agent 
wrote back and said, "I assume you shake hands better than you write 
fiction." That did actually stop me for four or five years. I decided, I 
mean -- but I bounced back after a while, and I'm back again. I've got a 
new novel coming out. I mean, you can't -- but my point is, you know, 
every -almost every -- not every one, but almost every successful writer 
can show you the first five manuscripts. I mean, Hemingway was once asked 
to write 1,000 words on how to become a writer. He said, "the key to 
writing is" -- he then wrote in the word "write" for the next 994 times. 
You know, I talked to Jack Kemp the other day about he was desperate to 
be a pro football player. He worked out four times a day. He would throw 
500 passes a day all summer. He was just -- it was his thing when he was 
a young guy. He had to do it. And it's hard. You know, and I think unless 
we're honest about it, a free society is the right to soar gloriously, 
and it's the right to crash and burn. When you get to a nanny state that 
says, "we're going to protect you from crashing and burning," they're 
also going to stop you from soaring, because you won't learn enough, you 
won't have enough adversity. You won't collide with reality. Years ago, I 
read a little "Reader's Digest" story about a butterfly that was coming 
out of the cocoon, and somebody stopped and helped him get out of the 
cocoon and so disoriented the butterfly because it didn't have to go 
through the difficult, painful struggle of getting out that it couldn't 
figure out what to do next. Sometimes people have to get out of their own 
cocoon, they have to struggle, they have to learn. And if you try to 
block that from them, they don't have the growth experience, they don't 
have the internal knowledge that they need.
<P>
Now, I want to carry you back and remind you just for a second, because 
we're going to leap into this and I want you to apply it, remember the 
four layers of planning: vision, strategies, projects, and tactics, 
because I want you to think about entrepreneurship, undertaking, getting 
things done at all four levels, and remember that you successfully lead 
by a process: listen, learn, help, and lead. So first you listen to 
people, you learn from people, you help people, and then in a rational 
society, people who know that you'll listen to them, learn from them, and 
help them want you to lead. And a good entrepreneur does a lot of 
listening. They have a burning vision of where they want to go, but they 
listened a lot about how to get there. Okay? Now, I want to come back to 
where we started, where we were at the end of last week, and take back up 
Peter "the Effective Executive." Now, remember that I said to you last 
week, that I thought this was maybe the most important single book on 
effective citizenship and effective entrepreneurship in the 21st century 
that has ever been written, and that I really wish every American citizen 
read it, and I wish probably starting at freshman year in high school it 
became sort of a once-a-year required reading. The reason is that there 
is so much in it, and when you first read it, it's going to overwhelm 
you, so you've got to come back again. And I think if people came back at 
it once a year for five or 10 years, it would truly create an 
entrepreneurial society. 
<P>
Now, I decided that my strategy last week failed, because I was trying to 
not put Chyron up, but if I don't put up, I can't make the points clearly 
enough. So then I decided that I would write out some key things for you 
to think about. So I started with something which a lot of people 
normally skip, that's the preface, which are roman numerals vii and viii. 
How many of you skipped past that? Okay. Good. I'm glad you read it. 
Those of you who read it, being as it is -- I'm now going to give you 
something like -- something like nine or 10 Chyrons that come out of that 
page, out of these two pages, because when you see them -- okay, first 
point he said, he argues, is that you have to manage yourself for 
effectiveness. Remember, this is, in a funny way, a book not about 
managing others, and although "the Effective Executive" sounds like, 
"I'll go up there and I'll be important and I'll be the executive," what 
he really is saying to you is: managing starts with yourself. So 
everybody has a target for being an executive. It's you. And everybody, 
therefore, can do it. And that's his second point. One can always manage 
oneself. Now, let me just say to you, this goes to the heart of 
victimology. And let me just stop you for a second.
<P>
I don't think technically John can put that back up again, but I really 
think this is worth really stopping on for a second, because this is a 
radical assertion. Remember, I talked to you about the notion that you 
were really faced with a question here of American Civilization with a 
discontinuity. And this is a good example. One can always manage oneself. 
>From 1607 to 1965, the dominant culture would have absolutely agreed. 
They would have said, "that's obvious." From 1965 through 1994, we had a 
discontinuity. And you had a dominant elite culture that said: how can 
you expect Sam to manage himself? Sam's black, or he's a poor white from 
West Virginia, or he's a refugee from Vietnam. Sam's had a hard life. 
He'd like to manage himself, but, I mean, it's hard, you know, and it 
just isn't fair to expect that of him. Sam's a victim. And for you to set 
some goofy standard that Sam has to actually manage himself is just a 
sign you're either totally uncaring or you're out of touch with reality. 
Now, isn't that close? I mean, how many "Oprah" shows have there been?! 
<P>
I mean, what -- can you imagine if Donahue and Oprah said halfway through 
-- if at the end of the first half when the victims got done explaining 
their pathologies, the second half of the show was: now, tell us again 
why you didn't manage yourself? And the whole second half of the show 
was: tell us why -- do you have a telephone? Do you have yellow pages? 
Can you afford a newspaper? I mean, you have people who can buy beer 
every weekend, but they don't have any money for a newspaper. And then 
we're supposed to say: that poor victim. You have people who are paid to 
do nothing all month, and they sit there a block from the public library. 
<P>
One example I was given the other day, I was on a radio talk show 
somewhere, I think in Boston or somewhere, and they called in and talked 
about a woman who had been now on welfare for 17 years. And my question 
was: that meant that she had 17 years times 365 days, take out Christmas 
and new year's and whatever, to go to the local library. But she'd stayed 
home to raise her children, which is certainly a legitimate argument, 
although working mothers go to work and put their children in nurseries 
to pay the taxes for this person to stay home, but that's not here nor 
there. Okay, fine. As soon as the kids went to school, which was about 12 
years ago, did she go to the library then? Because she had, after all, 
from 9:00 A.M.. To 4:00. And it's not to pick on this individual woman, 
but it's to say look at the mindset we now accept. I mean, when Drucker 
says, "one can always manage oneself," that's a very radical assertion in 
the welfare state.
<P>
And if you take the words seriously, going back to George Orwell's great 
essay "Politics and the English language," words matter. If one can 
always manage oneself, the first question to ask of every able-bodied 
person is: so what are you doing to improve your life? When a homeless 
person shows up for the 12th straight day, a good question: and what are 
you going to do to earn your meals? And the minute you say, "well, 
they're a victim," then either right or not right. Should the real 
sentence be, "one can always manage oneself unless one is a victim"? Or 
is it, "one can always manage oneself"? I mean, it can't be both. Now, 
let me carry you a step further, though. And this is where really was a 
genius in his studying of Sloan and Marshall and Theodore Vail. What came 
to understand was that effectiveness is a small number of practices. And 
that you can practice effectiveness until it becomes a habit.
<P>
And this is part of what truly changed my life. And the reason it changed 
my life is if day to day being effective is literally learning the habits 
that work and then practicing the habits that work, then you can begin to 
say: okay, what is it I can't do very well? I mean, maybe you're not a 
good salesman or maybe you're not a good speechmaker, or maybe you're not 
a good bookkeeper. Then you can begin to break those down into habits. 
Now, what are the habits? What are the practices? And you'll notice it 
uses the analogy of practicing Mozart. He says his music teacher taught 
him as a very young person. This is another example, by the way, like 
Ogilvy, that, who is writing a management book, is using a lesson he 
learned from his music teacher, because knowledge matters where you can 
apply it. It doesn't matter based on credentialing. So he's giving you a 
management lesson about life based on his piano lessons. Which is why 
real liberal arts is non-disciplinary. It is using that which makes sense 
out of the real world and tying it together with the perceived wisdom of 
5,000 years of written history, whether it's a play, whether it's a 
history book, whether it is politics or it is economics, whether it is a 
statue or it's a business course. It's bringing it together into one 
synthesis based on life. And so point is his music teacher says to him: 
you can't compose like, but you can practice like.
<P>
Again, those of you who play golf, you may not be able to putt like a 
great golfer, but you can practice putting like a great golfer does, and 
that means that once you begin to realize that it's a small number of 
practices and that you can practice effectiveness until it becomes the 
way you are, you literally grow and change. You become the habits. 
Somebody just came to me a while ago about taking pictures. I take 
pictures very efficiently, because I have to, because, I mean, I have so 
many pictures made all the time, and so I've learned to totally relax. 
And most people, watch yourself the next time somebody takes your 
picture, you tense up. I do just the opposite. I totally relax. For me, 
taking the picture is a moment of rest. It's a practice I learned in 
order to survive doing what I do. 
<P>
Jack Kemp came up to me one time, and he used to practice falling, 
because when you're a quarterback, you get to fall a lot. And he said 
literally, you can practice falling a way that you minimize damage to 
your ribs. So you literally -- I was very impressed, because it's a 
practice, it's a habit. Once you can identify pieces that work, you're 
going to run a small business? There are hundreds of little habits that 
make the difference. You want to be a public speaker? There are habits 
you can learn. And as you practice them, they become how you function. 
Now, the other thing he said that I think was so important that I 
underlined one word he doesn't underline: "all" effective executives have 
had to learn to be effective. Remember, he says here that after 45 years 
of studying executives, every one of them, Marshall,, Eisenhower,, every 
one of them had to practice. There were no natural-born effective 
executives. Which is also a sign of great
Hopefulness, right?
<P>
And he goes a step further. He says "all" effective executives have had 
to practice effectiveness until it became a habit. So first you have to 
learn how to be effective. Very important distinction here, two-step 
process. First you learn it, then you practice it. They're not the same. 
Learning in an academic setting is enough to pass the test. Practicing is 
enough to live it in your life. Do you do it automatically every day? 
Listening, I am not a natural listener. All of you by now know this. I'm 
a natural talker. I love to battle. My grandmother used to say that I 
clearly had a lot of Irish blood because I would just babble all the 
time. And my grandmother was a doctor, and so she's allowed to say this. 
This is not an ethnic slur. You know, and I like to wander around -but 
I've learned the first discipline when I start a meeting is -- what do 
you think I do? 
<P>
Ask first what everyone else thinks.
>>you ask questions. You listen. You go around the room. You gather the 
information. That's a learned -- and I'll go into meetings when I'm tired 
and I'm in a hurry and I'd like to cut through all that and get right to 
my deciding, and I stop myself and I say, "don't do it!" Because if you 
do it -- it's like trying to rush a cake. We'll bake it for half the 
length. We'll turn the heat up an extra 150 degrees. You know, and 
literally what offering you, is a cookbook on effectiveness. He says a 
third thing, which I think is one of the most encouraging comments I've 
ever read: "all" the ones who worked at making themselves effective 
succeeded. Now, go back and double check here. Every person he knows who 
actually worked at it became an effective executive. Now, if you go back 
in, notice how radical this is in terms of the discontinuity we've been 
living there. The idea of walking into a public housing project and say, 
"hi, all of you can learn to manage yourself. 
<P>
"and by the way, if you'll practice these habits, all of you will learn 
how to be an effective executive." How different is that from the current 
tone? And we'll create a ladder you can climb. But you see how totally 
different that is psychologically in expectations and structure of 
thought? Now, I decided -- I hate to do this, but I looked at it and I 
looked at it, and I decided that just as a way of starting the game, I 
mean, I really last week was trying to figure out how could I not put up 
to tell you about this book, because I don't want anybody who's watching 
to think, "oh, I've now heard about the book, so I don't have to read 
it." This book is -- when you realize that everything I just showed you 
up to that point is out of those first two pages, then there's the rest 
of the book. But I think the core principles are so powerful, I want to 
spend a minute or two with them. The first one is: know and manage your 
time. Bob weed, who was my first administrative assistant, was a great 
fan, and weed and I really were built into this habit.
<P>
I manage my calendar all the time. I manage it annually, I manage it 
quarterly, I manage it monthly, I manage it weekly, I manage it daily, I 
manage it hourly. I'm extremely aware of how I spend my time. So people 
say to me, "how can you be speaker of the house, go back home and have a 
town hall meeting, teach at, write a book?" The answer is because I spend 
more time managing my time than anybody I've ever met, I mean, and it's 
because I'm a disciple of and I know it works. And so you get up and you 
say to yourself -- first -- and he makes a very important point. This 
goes back to pragmatism and to learning about reality. What is the first 
thing says you should do in order to manage your time? Does anyone 
remember? Record it, right. First he says, this is pragmatism, learn how 
you are spending your time, right? Now, an example, I made the ultimate 
sacrifice, at least in terms of normal peacetime behavior, I called my 
wife last night and I said: we've been running so hard the last week and 
we only have such a short time off tomorrow, that I'm prepared to give up 
the Superbowl and just hang out with her and to heck with it all.
<P>
She doesn't totally believe me yet, but we're negotiating. But my point 
was I suddenly stopped and said to myself: yes, in a normal environment, 
I'd really like to sit and watch the Superbowl, but given what the last 
week's going to be like and what the next week's going to be like and 
what the last month was going to be like and what the next month's going 
to be like is not nearly as important to me as just hanging out with 
Marianne. You have to make real decisions, but if you don't stop -- if I 
had not stopped and said: what's this last week been like? What is next 
week going to be like? You say, well, we can watch the Superbowl, but 
we'll find some time later on in the week, nonsense. Not right now, not 
what I'm doing and not what she's doing, either. She just got a 
promotion. 
<P>
So it's really sort of -- you've got to -- but you've got to start by 
saying: how are you spending your time? Then you've got to say: what are 
your goals and values and priorities? So now you've got column a, how you 
are spending your time, and you've got column b, what is it you think 
you'd like to do? Then you've got to create column c, which is to impose 
b on a. One of the points makes, which has been invaluable in my 
training, is the higher up you go, the less time you have. Because 
everybody below you has the right to claim your time. So I know I start 
every week with a whole range of meetings I can't get out of before I get 
to decide anything about my time. It's the opposite of the way people 
think it works. Now, that means I have to reach way out, three, four, or 
five months, and figure out what it is I want my associates doing so that 
they're calling the meetings I want to go to. Because if I don't get them 
doing the right things, they'll be doing the wrong things, and they'll be 
doing the meetings on the wrong topics, so the only way I can control my 
time is to strategically be so far ahead of the system that I'm assigning 
task forces on the topics I want to meet on, because they're going to 
call me to the meetings. 
<P>
I won't have any choice. So I'd better think through three months from 
now what I wish we were meeting on. Otherwise, if I wait and decide 
Monday, what I'll find out is that I've already spent 80% of my time in 
meetings I can't get out of. Does that -- do you all begin to see a 
little bit of -- so you've got to start with: what are you doing? And you 
do that by literally recording every 15 minutes. As you get important, 
you have a staffer who does it with you. Then you look at: what do you 
wish you were doing? And then you stop and you put the two together, 
which means making choices. It means two things, okay? It means choosing, 
and it means sticking to the choice. I mean, I have now been coerced by 
age and embarrassment into exercising regularly, so I get up and I go -- 
I leave at 6:15 in the morning and I go swim at least four days a week. 
Which means about 5:45 every morning, I have this choice. You've just got 
to work through this.
<P>
>>doesn't that kill your flexibility, though? 
<P>
>>no. It means that you're being flexible when you do this. Remember that 
I do it constantly. I do it hourly, do it daily, I do it weekly. I go 
through this sequence four or five times a day. How long does it take to 
do that?
>>to do which part?
>>I mean, how much time is that actually detracting away from your 
schedule? Minutes. You learn -- I mean, when you've done it 25 years, you 
learn how to do it very fast. I tried doing that, and it took me an hour 
and a half. Yeah, but you'll learn. I mean, this goes back to the point 
about climbing the ladder. I mean, right now it takes you an hour and a 
half. Then it will take you an hour. Then it will take you a half hour. I 
mean, you'll gradually get -- you'll get the habit, and then you'll begin 
to know, "oh, yeah." If I say -- and, I mean, right now, I have my 
schedule for all of next week. On the plane back today, I will look 
through all of next week and I'll figure out what I want to kill, how I 
want to use the meetings I have to be in, and if I only have time for 
three meetings I get to call, they'd better be the right three. So it 
requires me to think through what I'm doing. There's got to be some fun 
out there somewhere. There's a lot of fun. I mean, but look, this can be, 
"I want to go to the zoo." This is not just work. You've got to decide 
what's fun. I mean, I have to tell you, I mean, sitting behind the 
president of the state of the union is okay. Yeah, but, I mean, getting 
-- the other part of it is if you decide -- and you put your finger on a 
really good point. If you decide you want to do something, you ought to 
relax and enjoy it. I decided I'd be an important person. When you're an 
important person, people love to get their pictures made with you. You 
know, the other night we passed the constitutional amendment, we got to 
the dinner late, we spoke to 2,000 people. There were 150 people who had 
not gotten their picture made with me because they were supposed to get 
it made before the dinner, but we were passing the constitutional 
amendment, which we thought took precedent, and at 10:15 at night, having 
-- for the third night in a row, because we had the state of the union, 
then we had the Washington Press Club Foundation, and now we're doing this.
<P>
At 10:30 at night, I was standing there getting my picture made 140 
times. And somebody said, "boy, that was really nice of you." No. It's 
the business I'm in. I mean, if you're a dry cleaner and you've got to 
keep the dry cleaner open because it's the prom night and folks are 
coming by to get their suit, you keep it open. If you're not going to 
take care of the customers, why should the customers take care of you? 
Now, if you don't want to be in that business, go get in a business you 
like. You'll see -- you'll see, and I can't remember now when we used it, 
the segment -- I think it's in the third wave, the segment about the guy 
who founded steak and ale, where he talks about the number one advice he 
gives to people: find something you want to do, because if you want to do 
it, you'll do it. People say to me: how do you get kids to read? I say: 
find out what they're interested in and let them read what they want to 
read. 
<P>
My mother-in-law just did that, so she has a nephew who wants to be a 
drummer, so he's now reading biographies of drummers. He's so excited, he 
can't stand it. Now, you'd never get a normal school class to say that's 
an acceptable topic, but he'll read like crazy if he gets to read about 
what he wants to read about. So I come back to you and say: if you find 
out when you go through this and this you're miserable, rethink this. Why 
are you doing it? That's why I didn't become a lawyer. I knew enough 
lawyers. And I don't mean that disparagingly, but when I was younger, I 
assumed because I wanted to go into politics, I'd probably be a lawyer, 
and I watched people who were good lawyers, I didn't want to do what they 
did. I didn't want to think the way they thought, and I liked history, so 
I became a historian. I did history because I liked history. Because I 
think it's useful, because it's fun, it's interesting. It's like reading 
novels. To me, reading a good history book is like reading a good 
mystery. I'm always curious what's going to happen next. And just a 
different way of thinking about things. My point is: if you're not happy 
doing this, erase it and start over. And that's where part of -- and 
there's also a difference between being satisfied and having fun. I'm too 
tired to be having fun. But I'm very satisfied. And again, I think that's 
an adult thing. If you watch somebody -if you watch a grandmother who has 
the whole extended family come home for Christmas, my mother-in-law does 
this, and she cooks and she fixes and she feeds everybody, it isn't fun, 
but it is enormous satisfaction. I think sometimes we're too juvenile. We 
use the word "fun" when we really want -- when we ought to use a more 
adult word, you know: are you satisfied with the way you're spending your 
life? If you're not, then stop and rethink column b, but don't complain 
about it, don't whine. It's your life. Change it. Now, the second big 
thing is: focus on outward contributions. Effective executives do not 
focus inward. Any time I run into somebody and I say, "how are you doing" 
and they start by telling me how they feel, I worry.
<P>
If they tell me, "wow, I've got this great project, I'm doing these neat 
things, we have these good" -- you know, something good is happening, if 
they're focused on contributing, "here's what I'm achieving." "I'm 
writing a script" or "I've got a great movie underway" or, you know -- or 
"I baked a good cake today, and we're having a bunch of folks over," 
anything which is outward. Effective executives focus outward. They don't 
focus inward. This is, by the way, the opposite of the way bureaucracies 
function. Bureaucracies please their own internal hierarchy. 
Market-driven systems please the customer. Totally different models. And 
so an effective executive gets up every morning and says: what am I going 
to do this week that makes a difference? How am I going to be more 
effective outside my activities? How is my company, my bureaucracy, my 
business, my museum, my zoo, you know, my house of representatives, how 
are we going to serve out there better? And then you want to clean up 
inside, you want to be more efficient so you can be more effective.
<P>
There's a big difference. Efficiency is doing things right. Effectiveness 
is doing the right things. It's better to do the right things 
inefficiently than to do the wrong things efficiently. Again, one of the 
places where bureaucracies die. So you focus outward. The third one, and 
this I mentioned the other -- last week, but I want to come back to it 
because it's so important and it is so opposite of the discontinuity's 
culture. You build on strengths. You do not build on weaknesses. Remember 
I showed you last week, these are mountains. If you're going to have 
mountains, you're going to have valleys. You've got a strong personality, 
you're going to have big weaknesses. What you want to do is find a way to 
balance them so that you get this strength, and then you find out what 
this weakness is and you get a strength that fits this weakness. So your 
team is very strong, because somebody in the team has a strength for each 
thing you need. But what you don't try to do is get that well-rounded, 
dull person who's here. 
<P>
And look at modern human resource management and look at schools and look 
at the way we normally think about things in big systems. What do we look 
for? The person who doesn't make waves. The person who's not disruptive. 
The person who goes along to get along, to use Sam Rayburn's phrase. 
That's not leadership. Leadership requires mountains. And so when you 
look around, when you try to recruit, you've got to say: what are you 
good at? What are your strengths? Some people's strength is they're 
brilliant. Other people have the strength that they work very, very hard. 
Other people have the strength that they're able to
Look out and they're able to organize other people, so while they may not 
be very brilliant or work very hard, they get so much out of the 
collective team that it all works. But notice how different this model 
is. This is a model that says -- and by the way, this is particularly 
true of young males. You get an "a" or you get an "f." Very common for 
very, very strong young males to do very well with the things they like, 
and do very badly with the things they don't like. Just very common. I'm 
not going to make any more comments about hunting, but it's very common. 
And yet you have a society which very often will say: well, first of all, 
do you really want to reward strength? I mean, won't that make people 
feel bad who have weaknesses? Is it really appropriate to have people who 
do as well as they can do? Secondly, how comfortable are you with 
somebody who comes in, you say they're a genius, they're also a pain in 
the neck. Are you really prepared to manage that level of diversity? 
<P>
And yet argument is that great, very effective executives are very, very 
good at spotting, recruiting, and nurturing strength and will tolerate a 
lot of weakness in order to get the strength around them. The fourth 
point, which has been an enormous help to me, is the argument that 
effective executives focus or concentrate on the few main areas that are 
decisive. If you think about it in that sense, the contract is a 
management tool. It gave us something to talk about that focused the 
debate. Whether you liked it or you didn't like it, it sounded positive, 
it did exist, you know, it was in print, and so it focused what we're 
doing. It's given us a focus for 100 days. So you say to me: what are we 
doing? Doing the Contract. It makes my job easy. I just delegate the 
Contract to Dick Armey, and he has to now figure out how to get it all 
done, but then -- but it makes his job easy, because he walks into the 
conference and says to all the committee chairmen: guess what we're doing 
the next 100 days, guys? They all have the same document.
<P>
So then they go to their committees and they say: guess what our 
committee's job is for the next 100 days? So in a sense, you've now 
focused everybody on one goal. So you've now brought together 230 members 
and 6,000 staff on one goal. Now, what brave leaders do very -- and 
effective executives do is they figure out of all these possibilities. 
Which ones are central to their game? And they then magically focus in on 
their game, whatever it is. This is their assignment in the near future. 
They don't pay attention up here and they don't pay attention down here. 
So what they do is they work back from the marketplace and they work back 
from their goals. What is it they want to accomplish? They think through 
their vision, they think through their strategies, and then they say: 
what are the two or three decisive points? Never more than five. Never 
more than five. No human being can manage more than five decisive points. 
<P>
You can have three and get two of them done and add two more. And you can 
do that the rest of your life. But you cannot at one time handle more 
than five things. It is impossible psychologically. It's just too 
complicated. And what you found is that effective executives shrink their 
area of focus so that they can truly focus. It's the difference between a 
shotgun and a rifle. And then they put all of their energy, all their 
time, into solving the specific requirements of the things they have 
decided matter. Which gets me to the last big point. We've now focused 
down, we've said: here's what matters to me. You're now rewriting your 
schedule to fit what you've said matters to you. You've brought around 
you strong people with strong personalities, which means they all -or 
with great strengths. Not necessarily strong personality, but great 
strengths. They may not be strong personalities. I mean, you may have a 
computer person with no personality, but boy, are they great at keeping 
your whole information system up. 
<P>
Or an accountant who's not exactly the life of the party, but boy, do 
they keep you out of trouble with the IRS. Then you've got one more 
thing. Now that you've focused, now that you're thinking about it, 
effective executives makes effective decisions that establish systemic 
change. Now, let me tell you what that means. Every time you run into a 
problem, the first thing you do is you say -- first you stop, right? 
There's a problem. And what do you do when there's a problem? Look at it 
and you listen and you learn. Then before you start to solve it, you say 
to yourself, "aha, is this a symptom of a deeper problem?" Automatically. 
Never ever, ever, I mean, unless it's something goofy like "we need to 
put a postage stamp on it" or something, but if it's anything which 
requires -- if it's anything which requires you to stop for a meeting, 
that's complicated enough that it's worth listening to for a meeting, 
then don't solve it until you've asked the g, that's complicated enough 
that it's worth listening to for a meeting, then don't solve it until 
you've asked the question: is there a deeper problem? The reason's 
simple: if there's a deeper problem, when you solve this one, guess 
what's going to happen?
<P>
It's going to resurface. And then when you solve this one, it's going to 
resurface. But the effective executive, and this is the essence of and 
Marshall, and it took me five years to figure this out in the mid '70s, 
the essence of it is you sutomatically stop and you say -remember, this 
is the reverse of vision, dtrategies, projects, and tactics. This problem 
is a tactic. So, now, let me see, am I going back up to a project level, 
or am I going back up to a strategies level, or am I going back up to the 
vision level? What's wrong?  Why did this happen? What's going wrong in 
our system? Did we have the
Wrong strategy? Do we need to rethink it? Did we design the project 
wrong?  Or is there a flaw in our vision of what we're doing? Because 
then it's worth your taking the time. You see, it's going to take you one 
hour to solve this, one hour to solve this, one hour to solve this, and 
you still aren't there. But if you will stop, figure out what this is, 
and get rid of it, none of these will come back. And you'll be a stronger 
institution or a stronger person or a stronger organization. 
<P>
Sort of like I learned when I woke up after having -- after having been 
out drinking all night that I had a hangover. That may mean take lots of 
aspirin or it may mean think about something deeper here. Or I'd really 
like to exercise a lot, except I never go out and get sweaty. I'm using 
silly examples, but I'm trying to drive home a deep point here: if you 
get in the habit when you run into a problem of asking if there's an 
underlying class of problems that this is a symptom of, and then thinking 
through the systemic changes you need to solve this problem, what you'll 
find happening pretty rapidly is you're really moving.
<P>
Now, notice what you've done now. You've created a system where you focus 
outside to decide what you're going to do, you then focus, narrow down to 
the things that really matter, so you're really focusing your energy 
intelligently, you then control your time so you're able to be focused on 
the things that really matter. You then recruit strength so you have 
strong people helping you solve your problems, and you then always make 
systemic corrections rather than just solve the tactical problem. When 
you find yourself doing those five things as an automatic rhythm of your 
life, then you'll find, a, that you are amazingly effective. 
<P>
I mean, Drucker was right. I mean, he got this. He absolutely understood 
how to do this and put it together -- I mean, he's still in his, I think, 
late 80s writing, but this book is a work of genius. And my point is: you 
take those five ideas, you don't have to have a penny. You don't have to 
have a master's in business, you don't have to be -- you know, you don't 
have to own a business. You know, you can get up in the morning as a poor 
person, take those five key habits, and by the end of the day, you're 
better than you were when you started, and if you did that every day for 
a month, you'd be a lot better than you were at the beginning of the 
month. So every american can learn these five principles. They can learn 
the five habits. And if every -- I mean, if we say to them: that's our 
expectations, you're an American. Why aren't you being effective? 
<P>
Notice how different that is from the psychology of victimization. And by 
the way, notice I'm not controlling anybody. We're saying: why don't you 
be effective at the game you want to play, pursuing the life you want to 
do, so you can have happiness on your terms? Because you're an American. 
You're free. But to be free, you have to have personal strength, and if 
you're going to have personal strength in the information age, you ought 
to learn to be an effective executive, because that gives you the tools 
to be personally effective. And just take that model and compare it with 
what we're used to seeing. Next week's topic is pillar four, the spirit 
of invention and discovery and the development of pragmatism and 
practical common sense, and next week's reading is "Democracy in 
America," volume II, the first book, chapters 9 and 10.

Baden</P><P>HOW HAS Forbes magazine, the self-described capitalist tool, become a green advocate? The influential people at Forbes see markets as the most ethical and efficient means to coordinate much of society.</P><P>       In contrast, political management implies economic inefficiencies and ecological destruction. These are logical consequences of political incentives.</P><P>     A recent Forbes feature by Ellie Winninghoff explains how government subsidies promote environmental harm. Here is a sordid story of socialism for the wealthy and duplicity by politicians whose opportunism trumps their environmentalism.</P><P>     Three-fourths of the Pacific Northwest's electricity comes from hydroelectric dams. Many of these, including Bonneville and Grand Coulee, were financed by the taxpayers through the Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers.</P><P>     Once built, the feds subsidized electricity, making power here far cheaper than in other regions of the country. Nearly $1 billion in annual subsidies keep Washington's power prices at about 3 cents per kilowatt hour. Industrial consumers such as Alcoa, Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical, and Reynolds Metals pay even less.</P><P>     But insulating households and businesses from the real costs of power production has negative consequences. In addition to lost revenue, these costs include diminished salmon runs, lost wild rivers, wasteful irrigation and  additional coal-fired power elsewhere. These dams, along the Columbia and Snake, strangle formerly rich salmon runs. Salmon populations are only 15-25 percent of their 19th century levels. Some runs are gone.</P><P>     Here's how dams effect salmon. When hatchlings move from the upriver spawning beds to the Pacific, the slack, warm waters of reservoirs and the blades of hydroelectric turbines take a high toll. Mortality runs about 15 percent per dam. When mature salmon swim from the Pacific to the inland Northwest, the big dams again pose a formidable obstacle. Even with fish ladders, upstream travel has a mortality of 5-13 percent per dam.</P><P>     With 14 major dams on the main stem of the Columbia, and 10 on the Snake River, mortality quickly mounts. The Grand Coulee and Hells Canyon dams completely block salmon from the upper stretches of these rivers. Transporting hatchlings around dams and using hatchery fish has sorry results; hatchery fish are weaker and more disease prone than wild salmon. Thus, in spite of expensive efforts, the runs are dying. Ecological health declines, outdoor recreation suffers, and a perpetually renewable resource is lost.</P><P>     In the Northwest the price of electricity is less than its cost. With rates kept at 3 cents per kilowatt, Northwest consumers use 60 percent more electricity than average Americans. This compares to New York's 10.2 cents, Califomia's 9.7 cents, and Florida's 7 cents. In an age when power can be wheeled around the country, this implies huge unnecessary economic and environmental waste.</P><P>     Insulated from the information and incentives communicated by prices, people don't respond to changing values and ecological conditions. Continued high consumption, not conservation, of electricity is encouraged by subsidized power. And greater use of electricity favors running turbines to maximize production with continuing damage to remaining salmon runs.</P><P>     This story of dams and salmon illustrates a principle of political economy. Once subsidies are created, they persist. People view them as entitlements. Major electricity users, especially aluminum companies, invest in politics to keep power subsidies. Our representatives and senators seldom act in a principled way if that raises voters' electric bills to fair market rates.</P><P>     Dams generate not only power but also opportunistic politicians. For example, in 1982, then-representative Al Gore of Tennessee invited William Niskanen, an economist nationally respected for both his intelligence and integrity, to his office. Gore asked for a casual, informal meeting to discuss Niskanen's planned research into the pricing policy of federal power agencies. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was important to Gore, and so he organized a manipulative ploy to protect his constituents' pork - cheap TVA power.  Niskanen arrived to find not the promised casual conversation, but rather TV cameras and other congressmen. Gore staged the meeting as a Star Chamber interrogation for the consumption of home districts.</P><P>     Gore's showmanship paid off. Oregon's Mike Hatfield, a Republican, passed the &quot;Niskanen Amendment.&quot; This act prohibited government officials from studying how market pricing could improve federal power pricing. The subsidies remained unexamined and unchallenged by those best positioned to do so.</P><P>     This tale of political privileges and opportunism does not imply that markets are perfect. Market prices will poorly reflect the value of salmon or of free flowing rivers. But market-driven power production and allocation won't subsidize environmental harm as federal hydropower has done for five decades.  With vested interests behind each dam, the feds radically increased stakes in subsidies. Adjustments are difficult, salmon suffer, and ethics erode.</P><P>     The problems which flow from federal power subsidies exemplify the complementary interests of groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and National Taxpayers Union. Greens, fiscal conservatives, and supporters of reduced government all favor the elimination of power subsidies.</P><P>     The question is, will the new political leaders realize the potential to harmonize economics, ecology, ethics, and growing demands for limited government?</P><P>       While we hope they will act in a principled manner, we should not confuse our hopes with our expectations. Yet, as Al Gore said on page 236 of his book, Earth in the Balance, &quot;a pattern of dysfunctionality need not persist indefinitely, and the key to change is the harsh light of truth.&quot; And when dams break, the truth may flood out.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

True social security
</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%></center>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<br><dd>
Want to save the Social Security system? Start privatizing it. If that sounds like the advice of some crazed conservative with a political death wish, then think again. In February, the New York Times reported that a Clinton administration advisory panel is on the verge of recommending that a portion of workers' payroll taxes be invested in the stock market. Some members of the panel would even allow workers to make their own investment decisions.
<br><dd>
"Our proposal," said Sylvester Schieber, an employee benefits specialist and member of the Advisory Council on Social Security, "would give people the widest choice of investment options. People could invest their Social Security money as they invest the money in their individual retirement accounts. Beyond the floor of protection provided by Social Security, we should let people participate fully in this economic miracle that we call America. It's paternalistic to assume that people cannot take action in their own self-interest."

<br><dd>
Washington, of course, is filled with well-intentioned paternalistic types who presume to know more about what's good for people than the people themselves. That includes saving for retirement. In all likelihood, someone with a similar mindset on the council leaked the news of its draft findings in order to rally opposition to it. That's just the way Washington works. The 13-member panel, which was appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in June 1994, is scheduled to issue its findings in the spring.

<br><dd>
According to the Times, there are at least two key recommendations in the current draft. First, eight of the 13 members favor shifting some portion of Social Security investments from long-term, interest-bearing government securities into common stocks. Edward Gramlich, professor of economics and dean of the University of Michigan's School of Public Policy, rightly notes that stocks have significantly outperformed bonds over the long term. Panel member Robert Ball, a Democrat and former Social Security commissioner, would invest up to 40 percent of program revenues in the market based on recommendations by a board of government money managers.

<br><dd>
Second, some panel members actually favor creating an individual account for each person covered by Social Security. Although Social Security would still hold the accounts, beneficiaries would choose from, say, 10 options on how the account would be invested.

<br><dd>
These aren't the only issues at stake here. The level of Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes, the eligibility age of Social Security recipients, changes in benefits and the timing of any reforms in the program would all have to be taken into account should the federal government decide to implement them. In that regard, reformers should keep a couple of things in mind. First, the sooner the reforms, the easier it would be to accommodate them. Waiting until Social Security is on the verge of going broke, as it will if the program continues at present, would require drastic changes in eligibility, taxation and benefit requirements.

<br><dd>
Second, the Social Security program today is nothing more than a transfer of tax funds from one generation to the next. Unlike other investment instruments such as stocks, therefore, investing in Social Security is nothing more than a bet on the willingness of future workers to pay payroll taxes. Given its choice, the Clinton administration's advisory council would rather bet on the stock market.

<DD>This election year there has been much loose talk about the 
so-called religious right.  Mainstream media stories on the rise of the Christian 
Coalition speculate on its likely impact on 
national politics and generously quote those who warn that its activities will produce dire 
repercussions for the country in general and the Republican party in particular.  In all 
the clatter there is rarely any mention of the religious left.
But left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American 
politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. 
 For years the Rev. Jesse Jackson has asserted that political engagement from the pulpit is 
an essential part of the church's moral responsibility.  In 1988 Jackson's presidential 
campaign was financed in part with cash donations openly collected in black churches.  
In 1994 a group of black ministers led by Bishop L.E. Willis, Sr. endorsed Virginia 
Democratic Senator Charles Robb in his reelection 
contest against Oliver North.  Willis's group, the Third Jurisdiction of the Church of God 
in Christ, represented about 60 churches in Virginia.  Yet liberals routinely cite the 
North-Robb race as evidence of a one-sided Christian partisanship.
<P>No one seems to mind when liberal religious groups engage in political activities. 
 Left-wing church activists lobby in support of socialized medicine and racial 
preference programs, and against welfare reform.  
They organize boycotts against business and agitate for mandates and regulations in the 
name of &quot;corporate responsibility.&quot;  Liberation 
theologians make foreign policy pronouncements and lead crusades for nuclear disarmament. 
 Liberal church leaders denounce Republican policies as cruel and un-Christian.
<P>This kind of religious protest is not isolated and sporadic; it is organized.  
Religious groups on the left engage in the same 
activism  albeit on a smaller scale  as the Christian Coalition.  The Interfaith 
Alliance (TIA) is one such group that has lately 
been in the news.  Its organizers say it was 
created as an alternative to the &quot;divisiveness 
and intolerance of the extreme religious right.&quot;   
<P>The agenda of the Interfaith Alliance is far removed from that of conservative 
Christian groups  you won't hear much from them about the right to life   yet its methods 
are quite similar.  In July, it announced a 
&quot;Road to Renewal&quot; that will bring &quot;TIA's 
national religion leaders to local TIA chapters and 
the national party conventions to help empower mainstream people of faith.  TIA's 109 
chapters will distribute millions of voter guides. 
. . .&quot;  Distributing voter guides is exactly 
what the Christian Coalition does.  And it is 
exactly what has the Coalition's liberal critics 
so excited.  
<P>
Earlier this year, the Oregon Interfaith Alliance distributed its &quot;mainstream&quot; 
voter guides to Oregonians prior to that state's special U.S. Senate election.  Like the 
Christian Coalition's guides, they were supposed to provide Oregon voters with the 
candidates' &quot;positions on important issues.&quot;  
Distributed by the Alliance's network of grassroots activists, the guides covered 
such issues as the minimum wage, Medicare and Medicaid, the environment and housing 
discrimination.  What party's candidate do you suspect ranked better on the Interfaith 
Alliance scale?   
<P>Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden narrowly edged out his GOP opponent to win the 
U.S. Senate seat.  Did the Interfaith Alliance's guides play a role in Wyden's victory?  
Probably.  But does that make them illegal?   
Where is the outcry from those who groan about religious influence?  
<P>
<a name="#2"></a>
<B>Just What is the Interfaith Alliance?</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance, a Washington-based 501(c)(4) organization, bills itself 
as mainstream and moderate.  Yet careful scrutiny reveals that it is anything but moderate. 
 Indeed, the Alliance clearly has a partisan purpose: to elect liberal Democrats.  
<P>It is not surprising to discover that this supposedly nonpartisan group was 
started with Democratic party money.  In 1994, the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee (DCCC) provided $25,000 in seed money to the Alliance.  The DCCC is 
the sister organization of the Democratic National Committee.  It recruits, and 
raises money for, Democratic congressional candidates.  Its current chairman is Rep. 
Martin Frost (D-TX).
<P>The DCCC's support for the Interfaith Alliance may reflect the growing 
awareness on the part of many Democrats that 
modern liberalism's hostility toward religion and 
traditional morality has alienated many voters and driven them into the hands of the 
Republican party.  Fearing a religion gap, they 
fund a group, nominally oriented toward religion, that promotes a secular agenda of big 
government while attacking religious conservatives who have decided to get involved 
in public policy.  
<P>The Alliance has found a friend in organized labor, which has committed 
itself--to the tune of $35 million--to defeating Republican congressional incumbents.  
Toward that end, the AFL-CIO has sought to take advantage of the Alliance's voter guides. 
 On August 29, the <I>Washington Post</I> reported that AFL-CIO field organizers  deployed 
to &quot;targeted Republican districts&quot;  have 
a &quot;special mission&quot;:  to &quot;persuade preachers 
in North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Washington, Oregon and Colorado to dump the 
voter guides issued by the Christian Coalition and instead give parishioners literature 
prepared by the Interfaith Alliance.&quot;
<P>Such activities are part of a resurgent alliance between labor and left-leaning 
church groups that has emerged in the wake of leadership changes at the AFL-CIO.  In 
the past, relations between big labor and liberal religious activists were strained.  Former 
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, a staunch anti-communist, had little patience for the 
religious left because of its uncritical sympathy for Third World revolutionary movements. 
 The deposed Kirkland's successor, John Sweeney, has much closer ties to 
radical elements in the liberal coalition, and he 
has worked to rebuild ties between labor union leaders and religious &quot;progressives.&quot;
<P>The Alliance claims that its voter guides are &quot;fair and honest&quot; and not slanted 
toward one particular party.  But the Alliance 
frames issues so as to make the final positions 
taken by the Democratic party leadership appear more favorable.  For instance, who 
could oppose &quot;Supporting families by 
advocating for a fair living wage,&quot; or &quot;child care 
that protects and nurtures every boy and girl,&quot; 
or "child care that protects and nurtures every boy and girl," or skill
training needed for good paying jobs." As Alan Wisdom, vice president of the Institute on Religion &amp; Democracy, noted 
recently, the Alliance is obviously trying to create the impression that the 
Democratic party &quot;is the party of righteousness 
and reason.&quot;

<B>Jill Hanauer: Abortion Activist and Party Regular</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance's partisan pedigree runs deep and it is most apparent in 
the group's leadership.  
<P>Alliance organizers have assembled a collection of clerics to serve as a board of 
directors.  Mostly representatives of mainline denominations, the list includes 
several prominent religious church figures such as Bishop Edmond L. Browning, primate of 
the Episcopal Church in the United States; Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of 
the National Council of Churches; Denise Davidoff, moderator of the Unitarian 
Universalist Association; and J. Philip Wogaman, senior minister of Foundry United 
Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., the church 
regularly attended by President and Mrs. Clinton.  (See box for complete list).
<P>Their names appear prominently in press releases and statements.  However, this 
seems more style than substance--window dressing to lend the group an air of reverence 
that it would not otherwise receive.  Boards of directors are rarely involved in the day to 
day operations of nonprofit lobby groups.  They may appear at conferences or serve as 
occasional spokesman, but generally they exist to authorize the activities of the full-time staff.
<P>In this case, the staff member who calls the shots is the Alliance's executive director, 
Jill Hanauer.  Her past disproves the Alliance's claims to moderation and calls into 
question its affirmations of faith.
<P>Hanauer's background is politics, not religion.  A long-time Democratic party 
operative, she was a staffer for former Senator 
Gary Hart and later worked on Rep. Patricia Schroeder's 1988 presidential campaign. 
 According to <I>National Journal</I>, she raised more than $3 million for the Democratic 
National Committee before joining the National Abortion Rights Action League 
(NARAL) as its political action director in 1990.  In 
1992, she joined Iowa Senator Tom Harkin's presidential campaign.  All in all, these are 
hardly the sort of activities of someone in the 
mainstream.
<P>
<a name="#3"></a>
<B>Hostility Toward Religion</B>
<P>
<DD>The Interfaith Alliance presents itself as a faith-based organization, but Hanauer's 
past contains incidents of antagonism toward religion.
<P>
As a college student at the University of Colorado, she organized efforts to 
prevent the school's football coach from leading 
his team in a moment of silence before games  and she eventually got the American 
Civil Liberties Union to file suit against the school. 
<P>
The football coach, Bill McCartney, who describes himself as a &quot;born-again 
Catholic,&quot; was proscribed from asking his 
players to bow their heads in silent prayer before taking the field.  He was prevented 
from asking them to say grace before team meals.  He could not share his faith while 
speaking in his capacity as football coach to 
local community groups.  All this was the result 
of an agreement negotiated between the University and the ACLU. 
<P>
McCartney's more egregious offenses included Biblical references during practice 
 recounting the story of David and Goliath, for instance.  The 
<I>Los Angeles Times</I> reported that on one occasion when a player was seriously injured and lying in a 
coma, &quot;the team assembled after practice, 
dropped to one knee and joined hands for a moment of silence.&quot;  
<P>
Hanauer's efforts to keep prayer out of football were but one aspect of her 
campus activism.  During her time at the University 
of Colorado, she also garnered publicity for organizing anti-CIA protests. (This 
resulted in the arrest of 477 people.)  And she 
worked to make sure that abortion coverage 
remained a part of the student health insurance plan.
<P>
Hanauer's apparent antipathy toward religion  and for coach McCartney  did 
not fade after she graduated.  She has criticized Promise Keepers, the national Christian 
men's group that challenges men to be more involved with their wives, children, 
and churches.  Founded in 1990 by McCartney, the group extols personal responsibility 
and family commitment at gatherings across the country which regularly attract tens of 
thousands of participants.  But this is too much 
for Hanauer.  Quoted in the <I>Minneapolis Star 
Tribune</I> in July 1995, she accused McCartney of having &quot;a very extreme political agenda.&quot; 
<P>One telling characteristic about the Alliance is its conspicuous use of the 
word &quot;extreme.&quot;  For example:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> &quot;these extremists organizations preach . . . a destructive message of division, 
discord, and even outright hatred.&quot; 
<LI> &quot;Pat Robertson has long advocated many extremist . . . ideas.&quot;  
<LI> &quot;Help us prevent Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, as well as other extremists 
with religious claims for an exclusive political agenda, from writing their extremist 
views into the law of the land.&quot;
</UL>
<P>The Interfaith Alliance is ever-ready to cast stones and demonize its political 
oppo--odd behavior for a group that claims to &quot;promote the positive role of religion 
in public life.&quot; and asks candidates to take a &quot;Pledge of Civility.&quot;  It defines 
as  &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; those who 
would normally be associated with the cutting edge of liberalism, and everyone 
to the right of that (most people) must be an extremist.
<P>
<a name="#5"></a>
<B>Who are the Real Extremists?</B>
<P>
<DD>In trying to tar conservative Christians as religous extremists, the Alliance makes 
common cause with groups like Americans United for Separation of Church and State. 
<P>Americans United and the Interfaith Alliance Foundation jointly prepared a 
report that &quot;highlights the Christian Coalition's extreme agenda and its efforts to gain control of the Republican Party.&quot;
<P>The report maintains that the Christian Coalition has forced Republican politicians to embrace various &quot;extreme&quot; positions 
such as calling for the repeal of quotas, the adoption of English as the official language, 
and the elimination of the Department of Education and the National Endowment for 
the Arts. 
<P>The head of Americans United is Barry Lynn, a Protestant minister and former 
legislative counsel for the ACLU.  Lynn is arguably the leading proponent in the country 
of the idea that the sale of pornography should be a protected First Amendment right.  
William A. Donohue documents this in his book <I>Twilight of Liberty: The Legacy of the 
ACLU</I>.  When President Reagan announced in 1984 that a commission would be formed to 
study pornography, Lynn &quot;took issue with the President's characterization of 
pornography as a `problem.'&quot;  According to Lynn, 
&quot;Although we are far from a sexually 
enlightened society today, our greater openness 
about sex should be viewed as a reasonable explanation for much of the growth in 
sexually-explicit materials.&quot; 
<P>Americans United is not an organization known for moderation.  Originally called 
Protestants United for the Separation of Church and State, it is committed to driving 
religion from public life.
<P>For instance, Americans United, together with the ACLU and the Milwaukee 
Teachers' Association, the local NEA affiliate, 
brought suit challenging Wisconsin's school choice plan, which would enable poor families 
to send their kids to private schools.  Americans United argues that the plan and other 
voucher plans violate the establishment clause of 
the first amendment.  The group also opposes a school-prayer amendment to the 
Constitution, opposes legislation to allow 
religious institutions to administer social service 
programs, and opposes parental rights legislation.
<P>Lynn has labelled as &quot;a religious tyranny amendment&quot; a proposed Religious 
Equality Amendment to the Constitution.  The amendment, which was submitted by Rep. 
Henry Hyde, states that neither the federal government nor any state government shall 
deny benefits to or discriminate against any per<BR>
son on account of religious expression.
<P>In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to dissuade 
churches from distributing Christian Coalition 
voter guides.  It warned churches that by doing so they, in Lynn's words, &quot;run the risk of 
having their tax-exempt status challenged and possibly revoked.&quot;  Lynn argues that 
Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition seek to &quot;create what amounts to a theocracy 
in America.&quot;  Americans United also has a project to encourage people to report to 
the I.R.S. churches that they believe are improperly engaging in politics.
<P>Lynn was quick to criticize Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia for an 
address he made at a Mississippi prayer breakfast this spring.  Scalia descried the 
scorn suffered by people of faith and criticized elites who denigrate religious belief.  As if 
to prove the point, Scalia was immediately pilloried by those who are uncomfortable at 
the mention of morality.  Lynn was quoted in <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> as commenting 
that Scalia's speech &quot;undermines public confidence in his objectivity&quot; on 
church-state issues.
<P>Lynn is also troubled by congressional chaplains who since the first Congress 
in 1789 have opened each day with prayer.  He believes the salaries Congress pays 
chaplains are a &quot;direct subsidy of religion which has no place in a Congress which ought 
to care about . . . the Constitution.&quot;
<P>It's ironic that the Interfaith Alliance, a self-proclaimed mainsteam faith-based 
group, is allied with an advocacy group dedicated 
to eradicating the public expression of religion.
<P>
<a name="#6"></a>
<B>Don't Tell Us What Your Against; Tell Us What You're For</B>
<P>
<DD>The irony disappears when you realize that the Interfaith Alliance has little to do 
with religion.  Rarely is there any mention of God in its literature.  It espouses no tenets 
of theology.  Even its professed values are generic and watery platitudes  &quot;The 
Interfaith Alliance believes in the dignity of the individual and the importance of 
community.&quot;
<P>Moreover, the Interfaith Alliance has no agenda of its own.  Although it clearly 
supports a raft of Democratic policy positions on health care, the environment, the 
minimum wage and so on, its raison d' etre is 
bashing the Christian Coalition.  Perusing press 
clippings one finds that the Alliance is rarely quoted in support of a policy or proposal. 
 Instead, it is almost always mentioned in context: denouncing the Christian Coalition.
<P>The Interfaith Alliance is a parasitical organization.  Without the activism of 
religious conservatives, the liberal left would have 
no use for it.

Baden</P><P>GOLD mining on federal lands, raising sugar cane near the Everglades, and irrigating Western deserts all illustrate the critical differences between being pro-free market and pro-business.</P><P>       It is easy to see why many people confuse the two. Wise Use groups and others, out of duplicity or ignorance, posture as defenders of the free market. But in fact, they often argue for special privileges and protections that cost the environment, consumers and taxpayers dearly. It is important to understand the difference between advocating the free market as a process and advocating special treatment for businesses.</P><P>     The market is a system of information and incentives. It coordinates human action and allocates resources to their highest valued uses with greater efficiency than other systems. It works extremely well, though never perfectly, with commodities such as minerals, agricultural goods and manufactures.</P><P>     However, some valuable things, such as clean air, species diversity, migratory waterfowl, and scenic landscapes are difficult to protect and allocate through the market. Economists call these public goods and common-pool resources. It is difficult or impossible to price or to establish clear property rights over them - and without clear and transferable property rights, the market cannot function well. If markets are to minimize waste and efficiently protect the environment, people must bear the costs of their actions.</P><P>     Businesses are players within the market framework. Each shares the framework with other groups as well as unorganized individuals. Businesses in the market are like organisms in an ecological system.</P><P>     Businesses have incentives to avoid the full costs of their actions. They often favor policies that advantage themselves and impose costs on others. If responsible for their full costs, the things they produce may be more expensive. For example, gold mining, which can involve dynamiting entire mountains and bathing the rubble in poisonous cyanide solutions to leach out the gold, may not be profitable if ecological, aesthetic and health costs are counted. Companies may even have to give up their mines. Society (i.e. all of us) would reap a net gain, but stockholders and employees would suffer losses.</P><P>     A pro-market position puts the public's well-being ahead of special privileges for any business. In contrast, the phrase &quot;pro business&quot; means allowing certain people to evade responsibility for the costs of their actions and to insulate themselves from competition. Many businesses try to avoid or ignore environmental costs because by doing so, they gain in the short run. To avoid costs, businesses lobby legislatures to limit competition, obtain subsidies, or ignore certain costs.</P><P>     Consider Florida sugar growers. U.S. sugar quotas protect them from less-expensive imports. Moreover, sugar growers can ignore the enormous ecological damage they inflict on the Everglades. Their political power (even then-Sen. Al Gore voted to protect them) allows them to retain these subsidies at the financial and environmental expense of the country.</P><P>     But such pro-business strategies always advantage one industry by disadvantaging others. For instance, candy manufacturers who use sugar have higher costs than Canadian competitors because U.S. sugar prices are kept artificially high by quotas. They have been forced to use corn syrup as a higher cost and imperfect substitute for sugar. And now the corn syrup producers lobby to keep the quotas on foreign sugar. In economies as in ecology, everything is tied to everything else.</P><P>     Or consider the Mining Act of 1872. It grants companies the right to mine federal lands virtually for free. It probably made sense 100 years ago, but today it is an indirect subsidy to environmentally destructive mining. Mining companies favor the law because they don't want to pay market prices for the lands they mine and be responsible for the environmental damage they cause. Again, being pro-market by requiring mining companies to bear these environmental costs would hurt the companies while benefiting the public.</P><P>     Federal subsidies for irrigation are a notorious pro-business strategy. With water delivered at 10 percent of its cost, it is profitable to grow water-intensive crops such as rice in semi-deserts like the Central Valley of California. But the &quot;cheap&quot; water does not reflect the opportunity costs of taxpayers' money, the wildlife habitat and fish runs damaged by dams and water diversions, and the pollution created by chemical runoff from irrigated fields. Subsidized water costs society a great deal. Here again, being pro-market puts us at odds with the private interests of agribusiness.</P><P>     People who take pro-market stands take equally strong stands against special privileges for businesses. Both justice and efficiency demand that businesses bear full responsibility for the costs their actions impose on society, including the environmental costs. Market principles favor the environment because many environmental problems arise when people are isolated from the costs of their actions. This insulation comes from favors for the politically powerful. This is why being pro-market supports the public's interests first and foremost. As environmentalists learn this distinction, I hope to see a union of pro-market and environmental forces.</P><P> __________ </P><P> John A.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>How many Madison millions?</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%> 
</CENTER>

<P>Just how much money has the failure of the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association cost taxpayers? Depending on the source, the timing of the estimate, and the method of calculation, the taxpayer-absorbed losses have been variously estimated at $47 million, $50 million, $60 million, $65 million and $68 million. At one time or another, each of these figures was accurate, but currently even the $68 million estimate substantially understates the cost to taxpayers.

<P>According to a spokesman at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), which is the government agency now responsible for keeping score, Madison's bankruptcy has so far cost $73 million. And that is only through 1994. The burden literally grows daily, and no estimate of its ultimate cost can be made at this time.

<P>Why these losses continue to escalate and how Hillary Clinton and the president contributed to them are worth reviewing. After all, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton relentlessly campaigned in 1991 and 1992 by denouncing the 1980s as &quot;a gilded age of greed and selfishness, of irresponsibility and excess.&quot;

<P>For all practical purposes, and contrary to the assertions of Richard Ben-Veniste, the minority counsel for the Senate Whitewater committee, all of the bad loans contributing to Madison's financial debacle had been granted before July 1986. At that time, the federal government removed Madison's owner, James McDougal, and placed Madison under direct federal supervision, ending the hemorrhaging. When Madison was formally closed down in 1989, the feds estimated its losses at that time to be $47 million, which essentially represented the difference between the cost of paying off depositors and the then-estimated value of Madison's assets.

<P>Over time, however, the ultimate value of Madison's assets continued to decline, according to the FDIC. As in the case of most failed S&amp;Ls, some loans that were believed to be partially recoverable when the thrift was closed eventually proved to be worthless, adding to the initial loss estimate of $47 million. And taxpayers, of course, had to continue to pay property taxes for Madison's failed real-estate ventures until they were sold for losses. While in receivership, interest payments applicable to Madison's borrowings from the federal financing bank continue to accrue, marginally adding to the taxpayers' burden. And litigation expenses are a factor as well. So as not to divulge to potential targets the scope of the government's legal efforts, the FDIC won't provide a breakdown of the sources of increases in the taxpayers' liability until litigation is concluded.

<P>In an absolute sense, compared to some failed S&amp;Ls whose costs exceeded $1 billion, Madison's $73 million taxpayer hit is small. According to FDIC records, however, the percentage of Madison's losses relative to its deposit base is very high even by S&amp;L bankruptcy standards, exceeding 60 percent. That means for every $100,000 of taxpayer-insured brokered deposits - so-called &quot;hot money&quot; - that Madison was able to attract by offering significantly higher interest rates than its competitors, more than $60,000 went down a rathole. This is a truly astonishing accomplishment - Madison's loan losses proved to be more than 20 times the federally required capital base of 3 percent of deposits.

<P>Of even greater interest is the fact that Madison's loan activity increased dramatically after Mrs. Clinton was hired in April 1985 to represent the thrift before the state regulatory body responsible for approving Madison's plan to meet federally mandated recapitalization requirements. Approval was given in May 1985 after Mrs. Clinton telephoned the chief state regulator, who, as a former law student and campaign volunteer of Gov. Clinton, had been appointed by him four months earlier. In 1985's third and fourth quarters, Madison's mortgage loans increased by $32 million. This six-month, $32 million mortgage-portfolio increase was nearly four times the size of Madison's entire mortgage portfolio as of Dec. 31, 1983, when the feds issued numerous cease-and-desist orders.

<P>As sordid as all of this is, just be thankful that 1996's campaign will not be a replay of 1992's, when the thoroughly corrupt, congenitally hypocritical Arkansas crew lectured Americans about the moral hazards of &quot;the corrupt, do-nothing values of the 1980s.&quot;

Renewing American Civilization<br>
Class Six<BR>
Pillar Five: Quality As Defined By Deming<BR>
<PRE>
>> The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
>>Television, in Waleska, Georgia.  From Reinhardt college in Waleska,
>>Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the sixth of
>>10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor
>>at Reinhardt college, will continue his course, which presents the
>>foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American
>>Civilization.  This week's lesson, Pillar Five, Quality, focuses on
>>quality, customer orientation, teamwork, continuous improvement, systems
>>analysis, and the spirit of Edwards Deming.

>> Let me say good morning.  I want to welcome the students of Mind
>>Extension University who are taking the course by television around the
>>country.  And remind you that you can mail your comments to:  Renewing
>>American Civilization, post office box 6008, Marietta, Georgia  30065.
>>Or you can fax your comments to: 404-528-9806.  You could e-mail your
>>comments to America online at renewam@aol.com.  Class transcripts and
>>other class materials are available on our Internet web page, which is
>>http://www.pff.org.  And if you got that, you probably didn't need it,
>>because you probably already knew it.  And if you didn't get it, you
>>probably don't need it, because you probably can't do it.  For those who
>>are not quite into the third wave, you can call 1-800-to-renew to learn
>>more about "American Civilization" newspaper or how to get the video and
>>audio tapes of the course and how to get the course readings.
</PRE>
I want to remind everyone that this is premised on the idea that there is
an American Civilization, and that the five pillars of American
Civilization are, first, the historic lessons of American Civilization.
Second, personal strength.  Third, entrepreneurial free enterprise.
Fourth, the spirit of invention and discovery.  And, fifth, today's topic,
quality as defined by Edwards Deming, and that as we go through each of
these pillars with two hours with a class devoted to them, we will then
pick up starting next week with the four areas to which we will apply these
pillars.  First, the third wave and American Civilization.  Second,
creating American jobs in the world market.  Third, replacing the culture
of violence and poverty with a culture of productivity and safety.  And,
fourth, citizenship and community in 21st century America.
<P>
Now, today's topic is quality as defined by Dr. Edwards Deming.  But before
we get into talking about quality, I just want to take 30 seconds and ask
you, based on having read Drucker's "the Effective Executive," which, as
you remember, is one of the books I most emphasized buying and I'm frankly
encouraging every American citizen to buy, because I think it's the key to
being effective in the 21st century.  How many of you have found yourself,
from Drucker's work, keeping better track of your time?  Okay.  Those of
you who are doing that, how many of you found that it's actually helped
you?  Okay, almost all of you.  I raise this because everybody who's
watching, as well as the students in this class, ought to consider if you
haven't already read Drucker and you're not applying these ideas, you ought
to.  And if you have read Drucker and you've now been told by about 90% of
the people who are actually using it that keeping track of your time and
then thinking through how you use your time is actually effective may be
the key then for a lot of people who say they're too busy to keep track of
their time, is to keep track of their time so they can learn what they're
too busy doing.  And I think that's a very important part of this.
<P>
The -- let me say that today also, we are going to look at applying Quality
and Profound Knowledge to education.  This is something I want you all
during the class today to make notes to yourself.  I mean, the one thing
about virtually every American is they spend a lot of time asa student.
You've been in education.  And Dr. Minnix was reminding me last night that
we want you to literally, for the next two hours, just take notes. And then
we're going to spend a little bit of time at the very end of the class
saying, okay, based on what you've learned from Deming and based on the
concepts of Quality and Profound Knowledge, how would you change the
process of learning?  But in addition, we're going to ask you by next week
to tell us what three -- what are the three biggest changes you would make
in the way people learn based on what you're learning today about
knowledge?  And all of you are experts, and all of you have been in school,
all of you have spent the hours.  You certainly have plenty of expertise at
having studented and hopefully having learned, and so you ought to be in a
position to say, based on my years of experience, here's what I think we
ought to change based on what I've now heard about how Dr. Deming thought.
Okay?  So we're going to come back to that at the very end of the course.
<P>
For me, my introduction to Edwards Deming started with two people.  One was
Owen Roberts, who's a management consultant who actually -- a long-range
planner who actually was the person who helped invent this course.  And
many years ago, Owen Roberts told me that I had to study Dr. Deming, that
he was right.  And he gave me Dr. Deming's book, which is very hard to
read, and the truth is, I didn't pay as much attention.  I tried two or
three times, didn't get it, and I sort of backed off.  Then Roger Milliken
invited me to come to the Milliken company's annual leadership retreat.
They take their top 270 people and they go off for three days and they hide
and they talk about, where are we at today?  Where are we going?  There's
no hierarchy.
<P>
Now, Roger Milliken owns the Milliken company.  It's a family owned
company.  He's been president of it since 1948.  He's physically a big man,
taller than I am.  And he dominates the company.  And he has taken the
company through a revolution beginning in 1979, 1980, and literally changed
the entire structure of the company. And I found myself in meetings where
37-year-old sales managers would get up and say, "Mr.. Milliken, with all
due respect, you're just plain wrong.  "you do not understand what's
happening in marketplace, and we're in the marketplace, and we're telling
you that isn't right."  And I watched Milliken get up at one point and he
said, "I know I'm supposed to just be part of a team here, but can I say
something, too?"  And it was astonishing, because it was a sincere
partnering between the guy who literally owned the company and people who
were working.  Now, this is the most successful textile company in the
world.
<P>
And so I stopped and I said, what is it you guys are doing?  And they did
the red bead experiment, which we'll do, and every year as part of their
retreat they stop and they talk about Deming and they do the red bead
experiment to remind themselves to ground their behavior in Profound
Knowledge, which is Deming's term.  But what I found at the Milliken
company was that they had shared vision, they all had the same vision.
They had shared strategies.  They had open discussion.  Facts, not
opinions, dominated.  Everyone studied the basics.  Everyone counted.  And
they had an explosion of productivity.  When I say everyone counted and
everybody understood the basics, I meant Mr.. Milliken had to be studying
the same material he asked everybody else to study, and when I tell you
everybody counted, he wore a name tag and everybody else wore a name tag,
and he said, "you can't know 13,000 people. "but the newest janitor can
wear a name tag and the head of the company can wear a name tag, and there
is an immediate ability to read each other's name.  "and you can create a
dialogue that is more personal instantly."
<P>
And so they had a system where they had thought through how everybody could
play a major role.  Now, from that, I decided, look, this is such an
amazing change, and I listened to his key people tell us how they had change
d the company.  And after I left there, I had dinner with several of his
top people, and I talked to them about, what did you do?  How did you do
it?  And it literally was a revolution.  They took a system which had been
top-down and they redesigned the entire system, and it was very, very nerve
wracking, and the guy who was in charge of doing it went off and ran this
experiment, decided it worked, came into see Mr.. Milliken, outlined for
Mr.. Milliken and the top three deputies: this is the scale of the change
we've got to go through, and the senior guy said, "that's not the Milliken
way.  "we don't do things like that."  And he said Roger Milliken sat at
the end of the couch for about five minutes, and there was nothing said.
And he's thinking, okay, I can get a new job.  It's not a bad deal.  This
has been a great experience. And at the end of it, Milliken said, "you
know, he's right. "that's not the Milliken way, but it's going to be," and
they just changed the whole system.  Took them three years.
<P>
Now, in that framework, what I want to suggest to you is that part of what
happens and part of what Milliken does a lot of is let people do things for
which they are recognized.  They liberate people to achieve excellence.
They allow people to work beyond their job definition.  They give them a
level of responsibility and creativity which allows them then to be
participants in the continuous improvement of the company and to make
hundreds of little suggestions.  Because one of the things you're going to
discover out of this is that most of the time it's not the giant leap
forward that matters.  It's having specific little breakthroughs every day,
but having so many of them that the cumulative effect is a giant leap.  And
this leads to recognition.
<P>
In Japan, the leading award for being a company of quality is called the
Deming award after Edwards Deming.  In the U.S. It's called the Baldrige
award after the former secretary of commerce.  Now I want you to
understand, the reason -- one of the reasons we're focusing on Dr. Edwards
Deming today is this is a man whose impact on Japan was so profound, that
their top award for the highest quality Japanese company is the Deming
award.  In 1950 or '51, he was invited -- he'd been in Japan earlier as a
statistician.  He was invited back to talk to what he described as 80% of
the capital investment in Japanese manufacturing.  They had about 400
people in a room, and for three days he taught them.  Now, he later
developed that into a four-day, 10-hour-a-day course, and he taught it
until he died at 93 years of age.  We're going to give -- we're giving you
a very brief two-hour overview of what is truly an extraordinary system.
And he's left behind people who studied Dr. Deming and his work all over
the world.  But the reason for prizes, this is a very important first
point.  The prizes and awards and honors are signals to people of good
behavior.
<P>
And this is very important, because it's very different from normal
American behavior.  The trick is not to say, I think I will now do
something so I can win the prize.  The trick is to behave in such a way
that the prize is a signal to others to study how you behave.  Let me draw
a distinction.  One of the great dangers with the Baldrige award is that
people will try to get the Baldrige award so they can then run an ad
saying, this is how good we are.  That's a very misleading way, because
it's an external motivation.  It's a manipulative motivation.  The trick is
to say, I want to be the highest quality company in the United States
because that's the best way to serve my customers.  That's the way to stay
in business.  That's the way to create jobs.  And, oh, by the way, they
honored me by giving me the Baldrige award for being the best at what I do.
As distinct from, now, what gimmicks do I -and all of you think about
courses you've taken -- what gimmicks do I have to do so the Baldrige award
committee will give me the award so I can then run the ad?
<P>
Do all of you see the difference?  Huge difference in why you're doing these
things. Recognition for internally driven achievement is good.  Seeking
recognition for external motivation is bad.  Very big difference in what
you're doing.  Getting an "A" because you actually mastered physics is
good.  Getting an "A" because you conned the teacher into thinking you'd
met the requirements is bad.  And if you have an "A" driven system rather
than a physics driven system, you have truly broken the back of learning.
So just take that and think about what's gotten -- why we're having such
huge problems with education in America today.  Because people are
extrinsically motivated.
<P>
What do I need to do to get enough credits to get out?  I mean, how many of
you have friends who take college courses in order to get the credits so
they can get out?  Seriously, raise your hand.  How many of you know
somebody who takes courses in order to get the credits to get out, as
opposed to taking the course in order to learn the material?  So you've got
to rethink, why do you do things?  Let me also suggest the reason that I
focus on Deming and use up 10% of the course on this topic is that with a
-- I believe with a culture of quality, Americans can out-compete anyone in
the world.  And I believe that for three reasons, so you understand.  This
is not just Pollyanna, oh, gee, we're wonderful.  We can win.  One, we're a
continentwide nation.  We're huge physically.  I mean, only china and
Russia are comparable to us, and Australia are comparable to us, and I
guess brazil.  Everyone else is just smaller.  I mean, people talk about
competing with Japan.  Japan is the size of California, and about 80% of it
is mountains.  In the long run, Japan's not competitive in terms of just
sheer resources. Second, we are the most ethnically diverse society on the
planet.  I mean, if we ever get our act together and are truly organized,
you want to send a salesman to Nigeria who fits in?  Fine.  You want to
send a salesman to china who fits in?  Fine.  I mean, we are an
extraordinarily diverse society, so we bring more potential creativity from
more backgrounds than any other civilization in the world.  Third, because
we are an individual society where you are endowed by your creator with
individual liberty, we have a greater capacity to liberate energy, to
liberate creativity.  I mean, if you talk about the Deming model of
everybody playing a role, everybody helping, continuous improvement, there
is no other society on the planet that is as consistent about saying
everybody can play.
<P>
So we should in the information age easily be the dominant competitor on
the planet if we decide we have to have a civilization committed to Quality
and to Profound Knowledge.  I believe that quality can transform
government, and that we need to really think through, how do we apply this
-- these ideas across the system?  This is much deeper than simply
reinventing government, to use a current phrase. This is literally
rethinking from the ground up.  How would a customer-oriented system
behave?  How would you design it?  And you'll see by the end of these two
hours how different that is. I think quality can transform services.  It's
not just about manufacturing.  It's about any systemic -- systematic human
behavior, and so it's just as applicable to the newsroom or to an insurance
company as it is to making cars.  It's important to understand -- and this
is one of the great problems in dealing with a lot of consultants on this
topic -- that Quality and Profound Knowledge are not gimmicks or management
techniques.
<P>
You know, quality is not, you know, putting up a sign on the wall or hiring
somebody for a two-day course to teach you the five -the five habits of
quality.  Quality is very different.  Quality and Profound Knowledge are
essentially cultural, intellectual, personal.  It is a way of seeing
things, a way of doing things. It's a way of life.
<P>
Now, I spent about 60 hours with Dr. Deming over a three-year period.  And
it was like peeling -- unpeeling -- or peeling an onion.  I mean, I started
with his ideas as he would explain them, andthen I'd ask him a set of
questions. Then I'd go off and think about it.  Then I'd come back and ask
him more questions.  What I discovered was that Deming had a cultural world
view that represented America between 1910 and 1930, and it started with
levels of integrity and hard work and sincerity and decency that were
integral to American Civilization.  And that those were his assumptions.
They were working assumptions on which he then built his philosophy.  And
so you had to really listen carefully, because he's talking -when he talked
about quality, he was talking about a way of life.  He was not talking
about a gimmick.  A way literally of getting up each morning and how you
felt all day, how you thought about things all day.  Think of it this way,
we codify our beliefs and ways of doing things into processes, systems, and
structures, whether it's business, education, or society.  In other words,
how do you answer the telephone?  You know, are you friendly, are you
orderly, are you organized?  How do you deal with customers when they walk
in?  What are your habits?  How do you take phone messages?  Is it a habit,
or is it random pieces over paper scattered all over the house?
<P>
I mean, it's a very simple example, but think about it.  How do you decide
to learn how to cook something new?  Do you randomly experiment, or do you
have a cookbook?  And what you find is that the people who are really
effective consistently codify things.  They think through, what are my
habits?  What are my structures?  And all a large system is is a series of
structures and habits.  So we have a habit of building a car at the ford
motor plant.  We have a habit of how we do an appendectomy operation.  It
is this set of processes. So it's very important.  Do you all understand
what I'm trying to say here in terms of the notion it's not magic?  Every
time you encounter a set of behaviors, you can say, what are the habits and
systems and structures that that behavior is an example of?
<P>
How do TV people operate as compared to print people, for example?  Print
reporters type.  TV people talk into a camera. Very different ways of
presenting.  They need different quantities of information.  Print people,
the entire evening news is less than a full page of a newspaper.  So if I'm
a TV reporter, I need to know the right 40 seconds.  I mean, watch how
short the time is for a TV reporter to speak, and then say to yourself, I'm
going to spend all day, I'm going to be on the air one time, and I need 40
seconds.  How much do you have to know to do 40 seconds?  And then think
about the reporter who writes a very long article.  Look at the difference
in density and the habits that implies.  And so you go through and you ask
yourself, what are the -- what are the beliefs and ways of doing things
that we're codifying?
<P>
A good place to go look at a waffle house, which is a great little system.
I mean, they hire people, they train people, you suddenly have a short --
have you ever tried to imagine doing what that short order cook does?  Have
you ever just sat there at the counter and listened for a while as the
various waiters and waitresses yell the orders and it somehow all works?
Can you imagine yourself being, you know -- what is waffle house?  It is a
very highly organized set of habits and behaviors and systems.  And they
train people very quickly into learning how to do that.  And they do a very
good job.
<P>
Now, in that framework, three men have created the modern awareness of
quality, Dr. Deming, of course, and then Dr. Juran and Dr. Crosby.  Very
different people.  Very different people.  Deming and Juran -- Juran's
still alive, but he's also now in his late 80s.  Deming died a year ago,
and Crosby is much younger.  He's a generation younger.  Crosby was the
quality -- was the real popularizer.  He wrote a book called "Quality is
Free," which was a best seller and which basically argues that quality
actually lowers your costs and improves -- and it was Crosby's book which
led Milliken to Deming, because Deming -- Milliken said he read Crosby'sboo
k and Crosby says something like 20 to 30% of what you're doing is waste,
and if you can simply cut out the waste, you increase your profit by 20 to
30%, and since he owned the company, he stopped and said, wait a second.
This is an enormous amount of money.  Well, think about your own life.  If
you could literally combine Drucker and Deming and improve your daily
effectiveness 20 to 30%, how much would that over a year impact?
<PRE>
>> don't the market forces naturally force quality issue?

>> no.  Not if everybody's equally mediocre.  It's true.  I mean, we're
>>going to get to this in a minute, but it's true.  You can have an entire
>>-- I mean, look at a third world country.  They have a market.  But the
>>market force is a bowl of rice, not McDonald's.  Because quality is not
>>forced.  Quality's created. Now, the market then can discern quality.
>>The market can invent quality.  We're going to get to that in just a
>>minute, but it's a very big difference.  What the market will do is at a
>>given level of quality, I will choose the better over the worse, but it
>>will not raise the level of quality.  It takes leadership to raise
>>quality.

>> doesn't that encourage quality in itself?

>> yes, it does encourage it over time if you know how to think systemic,
>>if you grow up in a civilization which teaches you to think
>>systematically, but it doesn't encourage it over time if you don't.  And
>>you'll see this in just a minute.  I mean, again, imagine there were no
>>cookbooks and you said you went to the place that most -- that most
>>frequently actually cooked the egg, but since there were no cookbooks, it
>>was random.  You hire a cook and you say, cook the egg.  They haven't got
>>a clue what you're talking about.  Okay?  The first step is, this is the
>>recipe.  This is the stove.  This is how we wash the dishes.  And then
>>you begin to improve, and then ultimately you get to ray Kroc's invention
>>of McDonald's, which is one of the great breakthroughs of consumer
>>culture.  Or coca-cola, the invention of coca-cola in the late 1880s,
>>early 1890s.  But it took somebody to invent it.  Once it's invented,
>>quality drives out non-quality, but until it's invented and begins to be
>>the new accepted standard for the market, you stay at whatever level you
>>were at before.
</PRE>
Now, the thing that's fascinating to me about Profound Knowledge in
Deming's model is that it has deep American roots.  It has the work ethic,
basic honesty, basic decency, self-respect, and respect for others.  It has
teamwork.  Think of a wagon train, pragmatism, trying to achieve the aim,
and personal responsibility.  The only way you'd get all these if you --
and this was very striking to me and when we first designed the course.  I
see the entire personal responsibility two hours as coming, in a sense, out
of Deming's work, because Deming's assumption was you had to have personal
responsibility.  If you couldn't have personal responsibility, you couldn't
even begin. So that's one of the reasons we emphasize it so much in the
course.  That in his vision of America, the first thing you'd say to every
person on welfare is, what are you going to do about it?  The first thing
you'd say to every addict and alcoholic is, what are you going to do about
it?  Now, we'll help, but you tell us what you're going to do first.  And
so you start with this very deeply ingrained sense of personal
responsibility.
<P>
And again, I mention the wagon train because in a lot of critiques of
American Civilization, there's a tendency to overstate the lone cowboy,
which, by the way, is nonsense.  I mean, you almost never had lone cowboys.
You had herds which were herded by cowboys who operated as a team.  But if
you think about this whole notion of the lone gunfighter in the middle of
the street, that is an almost pathological vision of the 19th century.
There were very few loners.  There was tremendous individualism, but it was
individualism within groups, it was individualism within the wagon train,
individualism within the community, individualism within the group of
people herding the cows.  And you had very individualistic personalities,
but you had people who were very used to working as a team.
<P>
And it's very important to understand that.  It's individualism with a
capacity to then deliberately surrender your individuality to be part of a
team, knowing you can then leave the team and go back to being an
individual and that you'll form a new team.  But it's America as a sequence
of teams not America as this hegemonic individual who is totally isolated.
I mean, Jeremiah Johnson was a very rare person.  And he's the mountain
man.  There's a movie by -- with Robert Redford.  He's a real figure, but
he's very rare in the 19th century.  There are very few people who were
that alone, and the real model was the cavalry patrol, the wagon train, the
community, the small town.
<P>
Now, in this context, Deming, who was born in Indiana but raised in Cody,
Wyoming, born in 1900, is, I think, in many ways in his own life the
personification of those kind of core American values and core American
behaviors.  So what I'd like you to do for a minute is take a look at Dr.
W. Edwards Deming and his life.
<P><PRE>
>> it's been said that James Watt, with his development of the steam
>>engine, set the industrial revolution in motion.  Henry Ford advanced the
>>revolution to its second phase with his assembly line method of
>>production.  And some say that W. Edwards Deming created the third phase
>>of the industrial revolution, with a simple philosophy based on customer
>>satisfaction, continuous quality improvement, and a focus on the people
>>who make it work.

>> Donald Petersen: the one stipulation that Dr. Deming had was that, in
>>fact, I would be the one that would meet him, not someone down in the
>>organization.  And he explained that when we did get together, he
>>explained that to me by explaining how disappointed he was in his
>>inability to get the leaders in America back in the '40s and early '50s
>>to understand the importance of putting quality as the number one
>>priority in your business.

>> W. Edwards Deming: a manager is a leader.  Should be.  He understands
>>how he, his work, and the work of his people fit into the system for
>>optimization of the system.  That's the first job of a leader, to try to

>>into what he can do best.  That he takes joy in doing, and help him to
>>improve.  He's coach and counsel, not judge.  Judge people, you shut

>> anyone that has started to spend time with Dr. Deming and the basic
>>ideas, the importance of people and treating of people, it's almost like
>>the golden rule and some of the other things cast in a business context.
>>Why, it just came through to me that the principles were something I
>>strongly believed in and could easily make as my main statement as far as
>>what I wanted to stand for at the Ford motor company.

>> Now, let me summarize all that into three pieces for a second. Petersen,
>>whose book, by the way, "a better idea," is a tremendous introduction and
>>very helpful.  He is now retired. But Petersen describes in "a better
>>idea" what he did at Ford and how he did it.  And I found it very helpful
>>in understanding the development of quality across the board.  So that's
>>one.  Two, but notice, Deming starts at the top.  The President of the
>>United States, the CEO of a corporation, the president of a university.
>>If you don't have leadership -- this is not about all of us being equal.
>>It's about an orderly process in which everybody's equal before the law,
>>but in your organization, you get somebody -- there is a wagonmaster in
>>the wagon train.  The wagonmaster makes decisions.  There's a captain of
>>the ship.  So Deming would go to the wagonmaster or to captain of the
>>ship and say, would you like a quality wagon train?  Would you like a
>>quality ship?  And then they've got to be involved.
</PRE>
Second, notice the role of invention.  This is back to answering your
question.  In that sense, who did we see last week who was decisive in
creating consumer awareness?
<P><PRE>
>> Edison.

>> Edison.  I mean, take the list of what Edison invented, most of which
>>was not requested until it arrived.  Think of the rise of the fax or the
>>microwave oven or the cellular telephone. Third, notice Petersen's
>>reference to the golden rule.  In many ways, what Deming tries to do is
>>codify healthy behavior and simply say to people, treat everybody else
>>the way you wish you were treated.  Get everybody involved in the system.
>>Okay?  Now, I was -- one of the reasons I got very excited about this
>>and I was very interested in doing this is for many years, I represented
>>Hapeville, which has a Ford plant which is widely considered one of the
>>best plants in the world, in many ways considered equal to any plant.  I
>>think it ties one Toyota plants as one of the two best plants in world.
>>I watched it go through the transformation from the system it had been,
>>which was the classic industrial system, to a participative system in
>>which if people on the assembly line had a new idea, they would be flown
>>to Detroit to meet directly with the engineers.  And they would help
>>redesign how the company built cars.  And it was just -- you could see
>>the explosion of energy and the level of investment people were making in
>>their own jobs as they got excited.  Let's take just a minute to look at
>>the Ford plant at Hapeville.

>> the need for a change became evident when, in 1979, Japanese car makers
>>claimed a fifth of the American auto market.  Ford was losing $96 every
>>time it sold a car or truck in north America. Chrysler, near bankruptcy,
>>was losing more than $600 a vehicle. Only General Motors was making
>>money, more than $300 a sale.  By 1988, Ford was earning $591 a vehicle.
>>Chrysler was recovering, earning $288 a sale, but General Motors'
>>earnings had dropped to just $47 per car and truck sold in North America.
>>A harbor & associates report ranked the Ford plant in Atlanta as the
>>most efficient in the country, beating even the Japanese.  It
>>manufactures the sable, named one of "car and driver" magazine's 10 best,
>>as well as the Taurus, which is the number one selling American car,
>>second only to the Honda accord.  The harbor report credits Ford with
>>cutting labor costs, retooling plants, and encouraging cooperation
>>between labor and management.

>> the Taurus-sable was designed for ease of assembly, and it became that
>>way because we were involved.  I'm talking about the hourly work force in
>>this assembly plant was involved upstream of the design of that product,
>>and we designed it so it would be easy to assemble.

>> The key here, in part, is that people get integrated into the totality
>>of what they're doing and are then liberated to improve their own
>>contribution to getting it done.  So there's this constant process of
>>improvement in which everybody's a participant.  Now, by definition, if I
>>said to you, who's going to be smarter, a system in which 85,000 people
>>all get up every morning saying, "how do I improve my job?" Or a system
>>in which 84,500 people get up and say, "I'll go do my job,"and 500 will go
>>around trying to invent something?  Which was the old system. The old
>>system was, you do your job, we'll hire a consultant. The consultant will
>>come in and listen to you.  Then the consultant will tell me what they
>>think they heard you say.  Then I'll decide, although I don't do your
>>job, how to improve your job.  I'll tell the consultant, who will then
>>teach you.  I mean, isn't that exactly how it used to work?  Okay.
</PRE>
What Deming is doing is liberating everybody to improve their own
performance in a context of understanding the larger system that they're
part of.  Now, it's very important to understand, Deming is not teaching a
technique.  I cannot drive this home too hard.  Deming is teaching a way of
being.  You have to discipline yourself. Again, it's like learning how to
cook.  Let's say you get up in the morning, you said, I want to boil eggs
today, but I'm so sick and tired of putting water in the pot.  Today I'm
just going to put the egg in the pot.  To heck with the water.  I mean,
that's literally what -- that's how people manage.  I really ought to do
what Drucker says about keeping my schedule, but it's so hard, I don't have
time today to figure out how I'm spending my time, which when you think
about it is about as dumb as not putting water in the pot.  So learning new
habits, learning new approaches, is a way of redisciplining yourself.  But
it's redisciplining yourself not into what I do on the job, but into a way
of being.
<P>
I think there are six core principles.  This is my abstraction of 40 hours
of Deming.  So the first is that -- and we're going to go back over these a
couple times -- the consumer, not the bureaucracy, defines value.  The
producer invents value. To improve future results, you must improve the
process.  People have intrinsic motivation.  They want to do a good job.
Every person, process, and system is part of an interdependent larger
system.  And continual learning is the basis for continual improvement.
<P>
Now, we're going to come back to all six of these, but I want you to first
of all understand the key part of this, which is thinking about the concept
of what it is you're doing. And where we went wrong, I think, was in the
early '20s with a guy who was the leading inventor of management techniques
in the industrial era, Taylor.  Taylorism was a term.  Taylor studied what
Ford did at General Motors -- I mean, at Ford motor company. And Ford
suboptimized things.  He broke it down so you put on the wheel, he put on
the bolt, you put on the tire.  And so Taylorism was, how do we break
things down into very tiny bites?  And the ultimate model was the pyramid.
<P>

Okay?  Now, there's a problem with this.  This is the person at the top.
This person has power.  This is the person on the assembly line.  This
person has no power.  Who does this person report to?  They report upward
to a person who's their supervisor, who reports to the line manager, who
reports to the plant manager, who reports to the regional vice-president,
who reports to the vice-president of production, and so forth, right?  This
is the customer.  Look how hard it is for the customer to say, "what they
did yesterday to my car doesn't work very well," and notice this person
doesn't care.  If the customer's here saying to them, "boy, was that a dumb
way to put the car on," they go, "yes, but that's what the person above me
told me to do."
<P>
Now, who am I going to obey, the customer or -- the Deming model's much
simpler.  The customer is, in a sense, able to communicate with all these
for the following reason.  And I'll give you a couple of quick examples.
And this is one Dr. Deming used directly.  He said, you're going to wash
off a table. This is your job, is to wash off a table.  So I'd say to you,
wash off the table.  Okay?  What do you do to wash off a table? Anyone?
<P><PRE>
>> you take the rag.

>> take a rag.

>> put it under the sink and get it wet

>> put it under the sink.

>> put soap on it.


>> put soap on it.

>> go over to the table and wipe several times, knocking the dirt off on the floor or into the hand, and then you go and rinse the rag out and wipe the table off.

>> okay.  Is the table now wiped off?

>> should be.

>> does everybody agree the table's now wiped off?

>> I'll bet it's not, though.

>> no, no, no, it is wiped off.  That's not -- don't be overly suspicious
>>here.  Table's wiped off.  How many of you agree the table's wiped off?
>>Okay.  First question, you're part of a larger system.  What's the first
>>question?  I say to you, wipe off the table.  What's the first question?
>>

>> how do I do it?

>> no.

>> which table?

>> no, which table.  Why is that important?

>> got to know what you're doing.

>> so I'll tell you, it's a white table made of metal sitting in the middle
>>of a room.  It's the only table in the room.

>> which room?

>> operating table.

>> why should it be wiped off?

>> okay.

>> operating table.

>> Why should it be wiped off?  Now, if it's a -- if it's a process, see,
>>what I'm trying to draw for you here is the difference between a flow
>>chart and a pyramid.  In a pyramid, the person above you said, wipe off
>>the table.  You said, fine, I wiped off the table.  They forgot to tell
>>you it's an operating table, so the patient got sepsis and died.  It's
>>not your fault. It's not your fault.  You did exactly what the person
>>above you told you.  In a flow chart, no matter where you are in the
>>chart, what you need to know is: what is the end product?  Why are we
>>doing it?  Who is relying on me?  And who am I serving?  Because if you
>>don't have an integrated -- if you don't understand the system you're
>>part of, how can you know what your doing?  Which means, guess what?  You
>>have to hire people who are told, ask questions.
</PRE>
Notice how different this is.  Here the answer is, take orders.  Now, you
come in and you say, well, we could wipe the table off with that stuff
you're using, but, you know, I noticed recently that there's a brand new
antiseptic that's dramatically more powerful.  Whose job is it to know
that? Anybody in the organization.  Anybody in the organization is allowed
to say, I read this article yesterday.  I think we can improve this.
Because they're all equal in the flow chart. They're all necessary.  Give
you a good example.  If you fly on airplanes, you may think the pilot
matters.  And they do.  It's good to have pilots.  It's good to have pilots
who take off and land safely.  It's good to have pilots who know what
airport they're going to.  It's also good to have mechanics so that the
engine doesn't fall off.  Because even with a good pilot, if the engine
falls off, it is bad, okay?  But in a sense, it's funny. The first hearing
I attended as a freshman in congress was on a DC-10 which crashed because
the bolt broke and the engine fell off on takeoff, and it crashed and
killed 400 -- 300 people. Chicago.  Okay?  And it turned out the way they
were putting the bolt on was wrong and was causing stress and metal
fatigue.  They had to change the way they put on every engine in every
DC-10 in the world.
<P>
Okay?  So it's only when you start realizing that in a modern system, every
person matters.  If they don't matter, why are they there?  It's a key test
of how you downsize government.  if your job isn't so important you have to
do it brilliantly, why are we keeping you?  And if it's so important that
you have to do it brilliantly, how do we train you and empower you and
strengthen you so that you can be brilliant?  Every person has the
potential to be brilliant if they're put in an environment of adequate
support.  But notice how different that is from this system.  I am the
important person.  You are the unimportant person.  So I am the chief pilot
flying to London.  I get paid lots of money.  You are a lowly mechanic.
Who failed to put enough gasoline in, or jet fuel.  I am now near Iceland.
We are running out of fuel.  I am a less important pilot than I thought I
was.
<P>
Okay?  Now, the trick here is to understand that key words explain Deming,
but that you have to then say to yourself, why is each word key and how --
because it has to permeate your life.  So that you -- each of these habits,
each of these patterns, becomes part of you.  For example, a process is a
repetitive series of actions or causes that create some output. I dial the
telephone or I type on my computer.  Or I write out checks once a month.  A
repetitive series of actions or causes that create some output.  A system
is a network of processes.  I do habit "a," then I do habit "b," then I do
habit "c," and they all connect with each other.  Your car, in a sense, is
a system. Its wheels, its hydraulics, its steering mechanisms, its engine,
its gas tank, and all these various things fit together into a system.
Common causes of variation are present all the time and affect every time
you -- "trial" may confuse you.  But if you're trying things out, every
time you do something, it is affected by a common cause.
<P>
If you try to drive into Atlanta between 8:00 and 9:00 every morning during
the week, you will have a similar experience.  It's called a traffic jam.
Okay?  Very important just as an example of common cause, okay?  If you
arrive at the 24-hour grocery store early enough each morning, you will get
there before the newspapers are delivered and be frustrated. There's a
common cause here.  The correct answer is not to arrive at 5:00 and wait
patiently till the papers get there at 6:00. The answer is to figure out,
what time does the paper get there? You see -- it's very important.  The
reason it's important is special causes are not present all the time and
will only affect some subset of trials.  For example, when we have an ice
storm, the papers arrive later.  Now, when you have a flat tire, even
though you're driving into Atlanta on a Sunday and there is no traffic jam,
you will be stopped on the way in.  That's a special cause.  The reason
this is important, and this to me was the moment -- this was for me what
Roger Milliken's 25% savings was to him.  Because I saw this at the
Milliken presentation, and they made the following point, which is
devastating.
<P>
And I want you to think through carefully.  94% of all improvement is from
focus on common causes.  6% of all improvement is from focus on special
causes.  Guess which one managers focus on?  Because they take for granted
common causes.  Common causes are so common, how could you think about
changing them?  Yet it is the change in the common cause which is the
explosive improvement.  It's a very important, key part of this whole
thing, is to understand you have to say to yourself, you know -- I'll give
you an example.  I work at losing weight.  Except when I eat ice cream.  So
I can tell you by measuring calories that I do a terrific job of losing
weight most days.  Now, I have an occasional day when there's a little
blip.  That day occurs as often as once or twice a week.  Can you identify
with these kind of examples?
<P>
Now, I have discovered -- my older daughter found a fabulous diet which
absolutely works.  And I'm now on it, and I've lost one notch in my belt,
and it's a great diet.  And you eat fruit up until lunch, you eat
vegetables for lunch, and you can eat vegetables and one other thing in the
evening.  Like, you can have vegetables and meat, or vegetables and bread,
or vegetables and potatoes, but -- so I got on this thing because it
absolutely worked for her amazingly, and she eats all she wants.  It turns
out, you can eat an amazing quantity of fruit before lunch and it doesn't
matter, because all the fruit you could eat all day is less than one good
bowl of ice cream.  Now, eventually I figured out -- it took me about a
week to figure out, well, I'm happy doing this.  And we all think it's
funny in my family.  What I'm doing is just applied common sense, and I've
eliminated the common cause problem of ice cream and beer.
<P>
Okay?  Now, I'm trying to bring you back to notice, what people tend to do
is they take for granted all of the normal things they do, and then they
look for the one special gimmick.  Okay?  Common cause improvements come
from changing the system or process.  So you have to think through, what is
our system?  What are we trying to get done?  What do we do routinely which
if I could get a 10% improvement, because it would be 10% improvement
routinely, it would be big?  When you focus too much on special causes, you
actually disrupt the system and make things worse.  Now, because people
will say, oh, let's really focus on that flat tire.  Boy, we'll really make
sure we don't ever have a flat tire again.
<P>
That's not what's causing you a problem.  What's causing you a problem is
you insist on trying to get into Atlanta at 8:00 o'clock in the morning.
If you went into Atlanta at 7:00 o'clock in the morning or 9:00 o'clock in
the morning, you could get in very quickly.  You can't get in at 8:00
o'clock in the morning even if your tires don't go flat.  Now, to identify
a common cause, however, you must have a theory, a prediction, a standard,
and a goal.  This is absolutely critical.
<P>
Deming is actually, in a weird kind of way, very intellectual and then very
psychological and personal simultaneously.  First of all, you have to have
a theory.  A theory is our understanding or hypothesis of how things work.
Remember the egg?  If you have a theory that says water, pot, heat, egg,
that's a hypothesis.  "I believe I can cook an egg if I put it in water and
put the water on heat."  Now you can test the theory out.  Don't put the
heat on.  Put the egg on and put the heat on without the water.  It's very
important.  If you take every job in the world, it gets to be as simple as
that if you think it through.  What's your theory of the job?  Second,
theories let us predict what will happen. Why do you think that's going to
turn into a boiled egg?  Because you have a theory.  "it's my theory that
this is how we boil eggs."  Well, tell me about the job you're now doing.
What's your theory of how you'll do this job?  A standard conveys the level
of acceptable behavior.  I want all of my eggs to be soft-boiled.
Therefore, I should not cook them 12 minutes.  That sounds obvious.  It is
not obvious.  You'd be astonished how many people have no theory of the job
they're doing and no standard for the job they're doing.  They do what's
acceptable.  Yet every job being done in America today is susceptible to a
theory and a standard.  The goal is the desired outcome.
<P>
Why are you doing this?  Remember I asked you about wiping the table.
First question should have been, why am I wiping it?  What is the desired
outcome?  And if I said, it is so we can eat off of it, that's one level.
What if I'd said it was, frankly, to be able to make clay pots?  Think of
the difference between cleaning a table off to make a clay pot from
cleaning a table off to eat on it to cleaning a table off to do surgery.
The term "wipe off the table," unless you know why you're doing it, doesn't
make sense. And by the way, look at the theoretical model behind killing
germs, which lays at the base of why you use antiseptic to clean off the
surgery table.
<P>
There's a whole set of theories in your head that you don't make clear to
yourself that you just accept as common knowledge.  Now, if you have the
desired outcome, you know the standard you want to work at, you have a
theory of how it's going to work, we just described management.  Management
is prediction, and prediction is based on theory, an understanding of how
things work.  I believe we will make 85,000 cars at Hapeville this year.
We will do it in the following manner using the following processes.
That's a projection.  That's a theory. And great managers spend every day
immersed in the theory of how things will work and then studying why the
theory and reality didn't match.  To summarize for a second.  Now, this is
very -it's surprised, both very common sense and very intellectual. There
is no learning without prediction.  You must compare results to prediction
to then revise and extend the theory to have a reason to change the process
and behavior.
<P>
So every time you start to do something, what is your goal?  What is the
standard forthat goal?  What is the system you're involved in to achieve
that goal?  What's your theory of how you will achieve that goal?  What
common processes will you use and what common things will be involved?  And
then you begin to put it together so that it becomes a habit, a routine way
of doing things.  And then you internalize that into yourself much like
Drucker.  Just as Drucker says, you know, to keep track of your time, ask
of every problem, what is it a symptom of, so you're solving the deeper
problem.  Learn how to manage strengths, focus on the customer.  Always
focus outside your organization.  Be driven by the need to have results
outside your organization.
<P>
Similarly, Deming is saying, when you get up in the morning, what's your
goal?  What is your theory of that goal?  What standard is necessary to
meet that goal?  What are the common causes that affect that -- getting to
that goal?  And if you get every person in your organization doing that
simultaneously, the level of human talent you bring to bear -- I mean,
people -- you know, why did we run the House of Representatives amazingly
well the opening month?  Because we had 230 members and about 500 staff,
and we gave all of them responsibility.  So everybody could play. Again,
think about it this way.
<P>
And this is the essence of the American model, by the way.  It's the reason
Sloan ultimately beat Ford.  Henry Ford was a genius.  Sloan was not a
genius. Sloan was a very smart organizer of people.  But Sloan figured out,
if I get enough smart people, we will collectively outthink one person,
even if that person's a genius.  This is also the American way of war.  No
one of us can necessarily beat the best professional military in the world.
On the other hand, we can bring so many people to bear with so much common
sense that the collective team is so amazing, so that we delegate down to
lieutenants decisions some countries would keep at generals.  We tell our
sergeants to make inventions some countries would allow colonels to make.
So the total intelligence we bring to bear, the total number of people able
to think about a problem, is enormous.
<P>
And every time we do this as a country, every time we find a way to engage
everybody, we drown problems and talent. And every time we go back to this
model, which is the bureaucratic welfare state, it's the old manufacturing
model, it's the old military model, you look at "Desert Storm."  "Desert
Storm" is this.  Very enormous delegation.  Look at the old model.  Not
very much delegation.  This was -- this was what we tried to do in Vietnam.
We did not do this in world war ii. World war ii was like this.  Very
decentralized.  Okay?  Any quick questions?  We have time probably for one
question, two questions.
<PRE>
>> is that the same as Hill's mastermind theory?

>> I don't know.  In the sense -- no.  I think hill's closer to this.  Now,
>>in terms of breakthroughs for inventors, you want this.  I mean, the
>>geniuses do this, but in a smart system, you start with the genius and
>>you immediately give the information to everybody.  In a bad system, you
>>have no geniuses, or you have a genius, but they get to keep the magic.
>>It's not how it works in a good -- in -- so Edison invents the
>>phonograph, everybody gets it.  Okay?  We will take a brief break and
>>then we'll pick up with the red bead experiment.

(break)

>> Now, what we're going to do now is, in some ways, the most famous thing
>>that Dr. Deming did, and that is the red bead experiment.  In order to do
>>it correctly, we're going to need several willing workers.  We've already
>>got Justin, who's agreed to be our computer person.  He is going to run
>>averages.  The way this experiment works is this is a factory.  This
>>factory produces materials for people for our customers.  Our customers
>>want only white beads.  This is our machine, this plus a person. This
>>machine goes in, you bring it out at a 45-degree angle, and your job is
>>to produce only white beads.  Every red bead is a defect, okay?  Now,
>>we're going to run this factory on a traditional Taylor-oriented, top-down,
>>"boss tells employee what to do" model, but with all the modern gimmicks.
>>So we're going to have motivational process inside the pyramid, okay?
>>What we need now is we need five volunteers.  We need one volunteer who
>>will be our recorder.  Their job is to track whether or not the workers
>>are doing their job or whether they should be fired and replaced with
>>other workers.  Then we need four workers who are willing to come up and
>>perform to the top standards necessary to stay in business in a
>>competitive world market.
</pre>
Okay?  So who would like to be the willing workers?  One, two, three, four.
You four come up.  Now, who would like to be the recorder? You're now the
recorder.  You can come over here.  Okay, the recorder's job is to use this
-- can you write clearly?<p>
<pre>
>> sure.

>> Now, your job is to be over there and to mark that.  You four come over
>>and stand right behind me here.  For television purposes, we want to keep
>>that clear.  And Dr. Barbara Lawton, who, as I said, is my coach, is
>>going to pretend she's a student, because she's going to do a part we
>>couldn't figure out how to teach anybody in a short time.  Come on over.
>>She's going to record and tell us what our predictions should be, okay?
>>And if I get it too far wrong, she will promptly break in and tell me.
>>Now, your job -- because you're all willing workers, right?  You applied
>>for the job.  You want the job.  And you understand that your career and
>>your future is a function of doing this.


>> what's it pay?

>> pays a lot.  Pays more than you were earning sitting in this class a
>>minute ago.

>> okay.

>> okay.  And it's the only job in town, so it's a big deal. Okay, now,
>>your job is to reach in here and to pull out the scoop, filling up every
>>one of the things, and having only white beads.  What we're going to do
>>is allow each of you to do it once, and she will record, okay, so you're
>>one, two, three, and four.  Okay, what's your first name?

>> Winston.

>> Winston is going to be number -- no, no, put it over there on the line --

>> right here.

>> that's right, yes.

>> Winston.

>> good, Winston.  And your name is?

>> Bob.

>> okay, now --

>> Bob?

>> Stephanie.

>> Stephanie.  So we've now identified them, so this will be a test of
>>their competence.  And on national television, they will now --

>> Mai.

>> Mai?

>> We will now learn whether or not they are not just willing workers, but
>>they're our model of good quality-oriented workers, right?

>> absolutely.

>> okay, Winston, go for it.  This is your job.  Okay, all right, whoa.
>>Now, first of all --

>> got an empty slot.

>> First of all, Winston has an empty slot, so we know that he's not very
>>competent.  Second, he has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
>>eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 -- 15 red beads.  This is not good, okay?

>> what can I say?  I'm in food service.  What can I say?

>> Bob will now hopefully do a decent job.  Oh, Bob just cheated. Bob just
>>cheated.  Bob has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
>>red beads, but we also have to mark -- mark after it, just put a little
>>"c" after the "9" so we can remember that he cheated.  Okay.  Stephanie
>>will now hopefully -- this is a chance now for Stephanie to prove --
>>okay.

>> all right.

>> three, six, she got nine, too.  Now, she and bob are clearly superior to
>>Winston.

>> thanks.

>> go, Mai.

>> all right, now, Mai  has -- she has the largest number of vacancies, two
>>vacant.  Then she has two, four, six, eight, 10, 12 -- do we count the
>>vacancies as red beads?

>> why not.

>> okay, so they count to 14.  She has 14.  If you don't get one, that
>>counts the same as getting a red bead, which actually means Winston's at
>>16.

>> yeah.

>> and plus he should be penalized for cheating.

>> I didn't cheat.

>> no, he didn't cheat.  Bob cheated.  He was sincere, but incompetent.

>> my heritage, that's what counts.

>> all right, now, this means -- by the way, what's the total? Where's the
>>computer?  Justin, what's the total of those five -four?

>> 48.

>> 48.  You've got to do the computer faster.  What's the average, then,
>>since there are four of them?  Anybody want to do that without a
>>computer?  12, right.  So total 48, 12 average. Okay, now --

>> if I get fired from my job, I'm going to really leave.

>> okay, Dr. Lawton, do you want to tell us anything about where we're at
>>now for predictive purposes?

>> let's keep on going.

>> okay.  All right, now we're going to go to day two, but let's recognize
>>here, first of all, that we had nobody who was actually very good.

>> wait a minute.

>> I feel real bad.

>> we had two people who at least seemed to be trying, bob who cheated and
>>Stephanie, so I would say Stephanie's clearly the best worker, because
>>she tied bob but she didn't cheat.  Okay. Winston is close to pathetic,
>>but we don't want to make him feel too bad.

>> but there's no --

>> but -- what?

>> there's no way for them to do it right --

>> You're not allowed to talk.  You're supposed to -- see, each person --
>>in a pyramid, each person has their job.  Your job is not to be part of
>>this except to write.  Now, the problem we've got, in a good modern
>>management hierarchy with a pyramid, having brought in our consultant, we
>>would say,  let's put Winston on probation.  Recognize that Stephanie
>>seems to be doing pretty good.  But we also have to recognize that we're
>>in the world market, competition is tough.  We need to do better.  Now,
>>we're going to start by creating zero defect day.  We're going to say, we
>>should do better.  We want everybody to do better.  We want to raise
>>morale.  Do I put these up now?  You can help do this.

>> okay.

>> put one of these up.  "quality is our name."

>> where do you want it?

>> on the wall.  And, Mai, you can help.  "zero defects now." And in
>>addition, in order to build morale and let people understand that we are
>>committed to quality, right, we're going to give each of them -- here you
>>are.

>> thank you.

>> they're very -- and I put yours on you because I wasn't sure you could
>>find it, okay?  You are, after all, on probation at this stage.  And
>>here, you may have one too for helping.  Okay, now we have -- this is the
>>big motivational moment.  We've had quality rally, we've had quality day.
>>We have our quality signs. And everyone is committed.  "I'm a quality
>>worker," right?

>> yes.

>> all right.


>> absolutely.

>> Winston, since you're a quality worker and on probation, go for it.

>> Winston said he wanted a break.


>> can I put the beads on there?

>> no, no.  Scoop.

>> you're not allowed to do that.

>> okay.  Two, four, six, eight, 10, 12, 14, 16.

>> Ooh!!

>> Winston has tied his all-time record for incompetence.  You have to at
>>this point wonder if this guy's just not going to get it, right?  All
>>right, bob.  Bob.  Well, bob, now that we're monitoring so he doesn't
>>cheat, two, four, six, eight.

>> one just fell out.

>> nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 -- 22, setting a -- making
>>Winston look good.  Now, Stephanie's at 10. Continuing, although she's
>>decaying, she's nonetheless not doing as badly as bob.  Okay.

>> she's learning from my mistakes.

>> all right, Mai, go for it.  This is your moment.

>> I don't really feel so bad anymore.

>> 19.  Now, this is bad.  What's the total?  Huh?

>> 67.

>> and what's the average?  16.75.

>> now, we have to really look at this for a second.

>> we're getting tired.

>> we're motivating the workers, we've talked about quality, we've brought
>>in a quality consultant, we've had a quality rally. It's worse, right?
>>Okay.  This is -- let me be straight about this, now.  This is the last
>>day for two of you.

>> all right!

>> and you have to say right now, theory and prediction, that bob and
>>Winston, although actually Mai's now worse than Winston by one.

>> that's right.

>> only Stephanie seems to have learned how to do the job.  And if we were
>>a normal company, wewould now be honoring Stephanie, because she seems to
>>have done the best job so far.  Okay, now, go for it.  This is your
>>moment.

>> all right, Winston.

>> all right, all right, all right.

>> no, no.

>> I'm just mixing them up.

>> Ahhh, look at that!

>>	11.  Which for bob is a miracle.

>> mix them, mix them.  The key is to mix.

>> for Winston.  Bob.  Dramatic improvement over his two previous days of
>>failure.  He's almost up to being average.

>> Ooh!

>>	11.  Tied.

>> no, wait a minute.  Gosh, okay.

>> counting is good.  Okay.  But Stephanie's up to now always been better.
>>So let's see if Stephanie's now going to have the big improvement.

>> Ooh!

>> six?

>> no, seven because she missed one, seven.  Notice Stephanie continues to
>>improve.  This is Mai's moment, and Mai has lots of pressure now.

>> two, four, six -- 17.  Now, if you add across, okay -- so the team has
>>done better, but remember, the two weakest people now have to go and be
>>fired.  So if you add across --

>> this day or overall?

>> of the three days, total.

>> no, no, no, don't write that in there.  That's the fourth day. Just
>>write it up here.

>> 43, 22, 32, 41 --

>> no, 33.  It's 42.


>> well, you just asked me to write.  You didn't ask me to --

>>	46.

>> check her.


>> stop it.

>> 50, 50.  Well, so Mai is gone.  Does everybody agree?  Mai failed.  Okay.

>> she was admirable.

>> and bob is gone.  Right?

>> and bob's gone.

>> bob's gone.  The big 22 killed you.  It's gone.

>> I want a hearing.

>> no, you're gone.  You can try to file an EEOC complaint later, but not
>>during the class.  Okay?  Now, okay.  Now, each of you -they go twice?
>>Okay.  So, Winston, you get to go and we'll add you up under Winston and
>>bob.  You get to go twice.  You're very destructive.  Okay.

>> Ooh!

>> Uh-oh, two blanks.

>>	12.  Do it again.  Go again.

>> Uh-oh.  Shut up.

>>	21.

>> notice, by the way, how the scorekeeper, who's not performing -- not
>>participating, gets a certain thrill out of his failure? Just think about
>>this again in terms of hierarchies.

>> is this sick or what?

>> nine.

>> nine.  Now, clearly, clearly Stephanie is the person who has best
>>understood this.

>> watch them be all empty.

>>	10.

>>	10.  Okay.  So he did 33, she did 19.  But look how bad the day was.
>>Okay.  So as our consultant, what do you want to teach us now?  Do you
>>want them to stay up here so they can learn  that --

>> if you look at this, this would be essentially a stable process, and
>>here is where Newt laid off the two worst people.

>> all right, you need to.

>> come over and stand -- does she need the hand mic or what?

>> this is innovation.  I think you guys didn't think through this part of
>>the process.  Go for it.

>> this is called --

>> is that picking it up?

>> There's only common cause variation inside the system.  So the system is
>>stable, and therefore predictable.  And so what we have is that with all
>>of these people, you can say if this process doesn't change, then you
>>would expect the same thing to happen in the future as has happened in
>>the past.  Because this is a stable system, there's only common causes
>>present, you have predictable performance, and the only way to change the
>>performance is to change the underlying process.  When we got rid of the
>>two worst workers, nothing really changed.  The system continued to work
>>exactly the way it was before.  It's a process problem.  It requires
>>process improvement, and it had nothing to do with the motivational
>>techniques or actually laying off the two worst workers.

>> get rid of all those reds.

>> eliminate the red beads coming in.

>> Ah, yes, okay.  Why don't y'all go ahead and sit down.  You may keep
>>those as a memento of this moment of excitement.  Notice here a couple
>>things.  First of all, how did -- how did you all feel as you went
>>through this?

>> we had no control over it, really, I mean, so --

>> all right.  In fact, what is -- what is really to be attributed to your performance?

>> I filled up the holes.

>> and what else?

>> sheer luck.

>> luck, right, pure luck.  Very important.  Because how much of what we
>>think we are managing in a normal system is, in fact, not theoretical,
>>not systematic, it's just pure luck?  Okay. Secondly, how did the rest of
>>you feel?  I mean, those of you who were working, what was your reaction?
>>Bob what was your reaction?

>> I thought I had a career, and, I mean, it really wasn't that easy to do,
>>but she had good leadership.

>> bob, what was -- Winston, what was your reaction to not making it?

>> well, it was sheer luck, absolute sheer luck.

>> it's frustrating when you know what the problem is, but you don't know
>>how to change it.

>> now, why did you get -- why did you think it was funny that they were --

>> well, because you made me shut up, but right from the get-go, I knew
>>that as long as you've got red beads in there, they're going to be
>>pulling out red beads and somebody's going to lose.

>> right, so guess what?  On a traditional assembly line, what does the
>>traditional average worker know?

>> that there's going to be defects and there's nothing they can do about it.

>> right.  That they are, in fact, going to be part of a system over which
>>they have no control, and, in fact, if the vice-president for purchasing
>>takes the cheapest contract from the worst supplier, their performance is
>>going to go down. Right?

>> right.

>> Which leads them then to react exactly as you were reacting, which was
>>to be cynical, and instead of building a team, to say, well, that
>>person's gone.  Which both leads you to be frightened and therefore more
>>withdrawn and therefore more cynical, which is, guess what?  The typical
>>reaction of the classic 1930 blue collar industry.  Which defines a lot
>>of modern labor relations. Because the boss who didn't have to do this,
>>the guy who made his bonus this year by buying the cheap parts because he
>>lowered the cost of parts so he looks great, but he's ruined our career
>>because he wasn't measured as part of a system.  He was suboptimized, so
>>he measured purchasing, but if purchasing got you lousy parts, you know
>>-- if he had bought only white beads, he would have paid 8% more, and
>>this would have been a piece of cake.  So he's saved 8% and made our job
>>impossible.
</pre>
Secondly, the guy who's in charge of production was -- went to work 40
years ago when this was the only device available, so he loves this device.
It makes him feel secure.  There's a new device which will only select out
white beads, but it's different.  And so he he's no longer on the line, so
he doesn't feel the pain of your failure, so he doesn't buy the new device
because he doesn't get it.  Do you begin to see how this fits together into
a pattern?  You're part of a system.  This, this, the quality of the beads,
the instructions.  I mean, we could have said,  reach in here, use your
hand, get up only white beads, and fill this. Which would be a process
change.  But do you see the pattern?  So there's lots of way to solve it,
but to solve it, you have to recognize you're part of a process, and you
have to understand how you fit together so that in the original Deming
model, this being -- remember, this is the organizational structure.
You're down here under manufacturing right here.  Over here is purchasing.
Here's advertising, and here's direct sales.
<P>
So advertising is saying,  we're going to offer only white beads. You keep
telling them, no, no, offer 90% white beads.  They're saying, we can't
offer 90% white beads, because you can't compete in the world market with
only 90%.  Purchasing's going, we've got to keep our costs low.  Let's buy
the cheapest possible supplier. You're then forced to manufacture with an
obsolete process you are not allowed to improve.  Then the sales force goes
out and offers 90% white beads, which is what you told them is the most you
could do in the current system.  But the customer sees the ad for 100%,
looks at the lot they just got, which is 90%, and goes to the head of the
corporation and wants to know of these four guys, why are you failing?
Now, the Deming model is radically different.
<P><pre>
>> on that model, on the previous model on the classic hierarchy, shouldn't
>>the guy at the top be responsible for looking at all this?

>> The guy at the top should be responsible for setting the vision and
>>general strategies and defining a culture of the system which allows
>>every person to participate in going in the direction of the common
>>vision.  But can't possibly, in fact, know these things.  It's too big a
>>system.  Okay?  No surgeon can clean an operating room as well as the
>>best person they hire who's done it for 20 years and really cares about
>>their job.  And if the surgeon starts trying to micromanage the janitor
>>who's cleaning the room, you're going to kill people.  Okay?  So you want
>>every person to do brilliantly their job and to redesign and own their
>>job within the general vision set by the person in charge.  This person's
>>job is to, first of all, focus on the customer, focus on the inventions
>>of the future.
</pre>
They just invented the phonograph or the movie or whatever it was Edison
was doing.  How does this change our world?  How does it change our
product?  Our customers are changing.  Alfred Sloan went out once a quarter
and spent one week as a salesman on a lot.  Head of the largest industrial
corporation in the world sold cars one week every quarter.  Why?  Because
he wanted to know what questions the customers were asking because he
wanted to have a real finger -- "spitzen  gefuhl" is the German  phrase
-fingertips,  he wanted to know what  was happening in the marketplace at a
better level than his pollsters could tell him. Okay?  Remember Drucker's
point.  You're always looking for the change in the pattern.  You want to
know, what are they doing that's different?  What's happening out there
that's unusual?
<P>
Now, Deming's point is that you first have to have an aim, and you've got
to develop really thinking through that aim, you do consumer research, you
design and redesign, you receive and test materials coming in.  How many
red beads are there in our raw material?  You then talk to the suppliers,
because you ideally want to get a supplier who's going through the same
process you are, and you say to the supplier, we want you to be our
supplier. How can we work together so you won't produce any red beads?
Which means you suddenly, instead of just looking for the cheapest
supplier, you begin to build a relationship where they've got to know what
you're doing.  So you call the office -you call the supply company and say,
no, no, we're not doing restaurants.  We're doing operating rooms.  We need
to buy from you appropriate things for an operating room, not appropriate
things for a table in a restaurant.  Then you produce, assemble, and
inspect, and you test all these things constantly, and then it gets to the
consumer and it comes back around, but it's a constant process, and you
need to be thinking all the time about the totality of the process.
<p>
Okay?  Now -- and this is something you can do anywhere -- I mean, you all
can do this.  This is not a hard experiment to set up, and it's very
useful, because it's only when you get people into doing it for a while.
And again, Deming took 40 hours, 10 hours a day for four days, to immerse
people in what I'm giving you a hint of.  You're only getting a hint today.
Because you really have to be able to feel this and get the rhythm of
this.  And think about how isolated you feel. And then ask yourself about a
typical government worker or a typical schoolteacher or a typical anybody
in a classic system where you're told, do your job and keep your mouth
shut.  And what they want to do is say, wait a second, what is our aim?
What are we trying to accomplish?  I mean, apply this thinking to learning.
Yes, sir?
<p><pre>
>> I think you could envision the union's response to the scenario we just
>>experienced, but what about this Deming model? What's the union response
>>to it?

>> Well, the unions are confused by it and increasingly willing to work
>>with it because they see the pressure of the world market.  But remember,
>>the union response was a response to Taylorism.  It was a response to the
>>idea that, we're going to suboptimize your job and we're going to
>>brutalize you into a dehumanizing job with no power, no control.  You
>>know, do the white beads or else.  That's why you got all the union work
>>rules, was a response to Taylorism.  And now you're saying to people, we
>>want you to be a complete person.  We want you to completely understand
>>where we're going, and we want you to have complete authority for you to
>>help be creative and in redesigning your part of the process.  Very
>>different model, and places like Ford are unionized.  I mean, they go
>>through lots of dialogue trying to find a way to break through, trying to
>>talk with each other, trying to figure -- it's very -- the cultural
>>change is enormous.  It's not just a management change.  It's a cultural
>>change.
</pre>
Now, what you've got here is -- let's go back and start at the beginning.
Principle number one, the consumer, not the bureaucracy, defines value.
This is very important for this reason.  You've got to define the consumer.
Okay?  If I can go back to the notion of flow charts -- where did the
eraser go? Oh, there it is.  Okay.  What I want to show you is normally, in
most large systems, who's defining value?  At the welfare office, who
defines value?
<p><pre> 
>> the bureaucracy.

>> right, the head of the welfare office, right?  So it's downward.  Okay.
>>In a normal hierarchy -- I'll just do a simple one -- you're down here
>>working, right?  Here is your customer. In a normal hierarchy, this
>>person's defining value for you, right?  I don't care what you, the
>>customer, want.  I care what my boss wants.  But in a flow chart, here's
>>the customer.  You should be feeding back into the system, this is what
>>I'm hearing, this is what we need to change, this is how we can improve
>>it.

>> this Deming model, if we make this -- if our civilization makes this
>>move towards this Deming model and we pass out responsibility to the
>>workers, will it render the unions as we know them today obsolete or
>>impotent?

>> no, the unions as they are today are obsolete.  Unions today have to
>>reinvent themselves.

>> well, is there any place for the union in this model?

>> Sure.  Sure, in a very big system where it is more efficient for you to
>>organize yourselves if you have one person who studies the whole system
>>than it is for you to try to do it yourself.  I mean, if you're all the
>>baseball players, you probably want to have a spokesman who somehow is
>>working.  But the aim of the spokesman would be different than the aim in
>>a traditional union.

>> Well, wasn't the whole need for the unions with the Taylor model because
>>the people at the lowest level --

>> No, it actually goes back to the middle of the 19th century. I mean,
>>it's an effort for people to aggregate themselves into groups that can
>>talk about their life.  If you have lots and lots of people doing this,
>>they may well want some kind of association to discuss doing it.  But the
>>goal of discussing in a Deming world is totally different from the goal
>>of discussing in the Taylor pyramidal world.  Here it's a fight.  I mean,
>>this person is above me.  They don't understand my life.  They're going
>>to try to force me to do things I can't do.  They'll fire me if I can't
>>do this, even though it's not my fault I can't do it.  In this world,
>>you're all on the same team.

>> so would it be safe to say that the Taylor organizational structure is
>>more adversarial and it's much more therapeutic --

>> Much more.  This is an inherently adversarial power structure. This
>>should be an inherently team collegial power structure. Okay?  Very big
>>difference.  I can only remain speaker of the house as long as I convince
>>a majority of 230 of the republicans that I am listening to them well
>>enough that they should re-hire me.  They are my consumers.  And the
>>minute I forget that -- I have two sets of consumers.  600,000 Georgians
>>and 230 house republicans, and the minute I forget that, either set of
>>consumers can fire me.  It's a wonderfully market-oriented system in that
>>sense.  Very -- it's a hard system, but it's market-oriented.  But the
>>first goal here -- and it's something to think about education.  Who is
>>the consumer?

>> students.

>> If the students -- actually, there are three consumers, the society, the
>>parent, and the student.  Because, remember, the student's not paying
>>directly.  The student is being paid for by the parent and society to
>>achieve three sets of goals.  But now go back and ask yourself about the
>>typical learning situation we currently create.  If those three are
>>defining it, who defines it today?  The politicians, the bureaucrats, and
>>the professionals. Second principle, the producer invents value.  Nobody
>>knew they wanted to go to McDonald's till ray Kroc copied the McDonald
>>brothers plan.  Ray Kroc, remember -- this is one of the great stories of
>>how history unfolds, because it's not linear.  It's not from here to here
>>to here.  Ray Kroc was what?  Anyone remember?

>> milkshake --

>> milkshake machine salesman.  He wanted to sell milkshake machines.  He
>>was the best milkshake machine salesman in the country, and the McDonald
>>brothers had a great product based largely on their French fries, and
>>lots of people came to McDonald's, and he went to them and said, you guys
>>ought to franchise.  If you would franchise.  Now, why does he want them
>>to franchise?

>> sell more milkshakes.

>> Sell more milkshake machines, and they said to him, we won't do it.  He
>>said, if you'll just expand, I could do it.  They said, we don't want to
>>expand.  We're happy being the McDonald brothers.  So he finally, after
>>two years, talked them into letting him expand, at which point he gave up
>>being a milkshake machine salesman, but it was all a historic accident.
>>The minute he opened McDonald's in Chicago, people flocked to it, and he
>>suddenly said, this is really a winner.  By the way, do you know why they
>>use Coca-Cola?  The regional Coke salesman loaned him the equipment.  He
>>was an -- he was a small businessman he was getting off the ground, and
>>they said, we'll help you.  We like your idea.  We want you to succeed.
>>Someday you'll be a good customer.
</pre>
Notice how Deming-like this is.  Okay?  Let us help you be successful?
Well, guess what the largest single customer in the world is for Coca-Cola?
McDonald's.  Out of one local guy being positive.  Now, in this model, of
course, or in this model back here, finance would have said, you did what?
Okay? Principle number three, to improve future results, you must improve
the process, which means if you're serious -- this is why Deming and
Drucker blend together so brilliantly -- if you're serious, you have to map
the process you're engaged in.  You have to always be thinking process.
What am I learning about the process?  So you can't focus on the event.
The event is, oh, I did this number.  It's part of a process.  Show me the
map of the process.  What does the chart look like?  Okay, so you're
constantly improving the process, because it is the process improvements.
Silly example.  You have a phone which is too far from your desk and the
cord is too short, so 12 times a day you have to stand up and walk over to
the phone.  What is the obvious answer?
<P><PRE>
>> get a longer cord.

>> get a longer cord or --

>> move the desk.

>> move the desk.  It may seem obvious.  Great managers do it
>>instinctively.  Bad managers get up 12 times a day for their whole life.
>>Okay?  Fourth, people have intrinsic motivation. They want to do a good
>>job.  Very important part of this.  The average human being wants to do a
>>good job.

>> what do you think's behind it?

>> it's an assumption about human nature.  Doesn't mean that they're good
>>-- they're necessarily good people.  Every one of us has some potential
>>for evil.  Every one of us has to go through a process all of our lives
>>of sorting out how we live out our potential, but most of the time most
>>people inherently would prefer to achieve rather than to not achieve.  And
>>you can acculturate to increase that tendency.  It's the basic tenet of
>>America.  I mean, if we're endowed by our creator with certain
>>unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
>>happiness, you're assuming people will pursue.

>> I would argue that if people wanted to do a good job, we wouldn't see
>>the social problems that we see today.

>> Unless you have a system which is telling them not to do a good job.
>>Remember, the person down here who's not doing a good job may be -- is
>>being sent signals all day to keep their mouth shut.  A person on welfare
>>is being sent signals all day,  don't try.  Why would you want to get off
>>Medicaid?  Why would you want to leave public housing?  You don't have
>>any personal friends who work.  Why would you want to work?  Why would
>>you get good grades?  Talk to black kids who get good grades in an inner
>>city school and the peer pressure they're under to not succeed.  I mean,
>>humans will -- humans, I think, have a desire to be good, they have a
>>desire to be liked, they have a desire to achieve. But they can be broken
>>of those desires by a system which repetitively pounds in them to teach
>>them bad behaviors.  Why wouldn't you get pregnant?  All your friends
>>are.  I mean, just think about it as -- if you apply Deming, if you read
>>Leon dash's book "When Children Want Children" and think of it in a
>>Deming model of a system and a culture and a process, you have a totally
>>different view of what happens.  And we'll get into this when we get to
>>the section on the culture.
</pre>
But our presumption here, it's at a core part of Deming, it's why Deming is
so American, is that people basically want to pursue happiness.  Now, if
you don't believe that, you need a dictatorship, you need a police state.
But if you believe that, then you ought to design a system that starts with
the idea probably you want to do well. Now, if you're one of the tiny, tiny
percentage that don't want to do well, we can deal with that, but for most
people most of the time, it is safer to assume they want to learn, they
want to grow, they want to do well, and we are the facilitators of their
behaving in a positive way.  Principle number four
<P><PRE>
>> excuse me, does that mean that baseball players can roll into some kind
>>of a --

>> well, jack Kemp has a very simple -- we'll keep this Chyron up.  Jack
>>Kemp has a very simple theory on the baseball strike. His theory is that
>>when the marginal tax rate finally broke 50%, by the time you count in
>>state taxes, that if you're a normal player who knows you've only got a
>>six- to 10-year playing career, that the marginal tax rate makes you much
>>more desperate than you were when it was 28.  And that the tax increases
>>have a direct impact on why the players are so concerned.  Because
>>they're actually making much -- by the time you take out the agents' fees
>>and you take out the tax rate at the state and federal level, they're
>>actually taking home much less than people think they are.  And these
>>guys know that they're probably not going to play more than 10 or 12
>>years, so they've got to build up in that length of time the entire nest
>>egg to sustain the rest of their life.
</pre><P>
I mean, they're huge salaries, and I don't feel any sympathy for a guy who
makes $7 million a year in field sport, but that if you really evaluate as
a system in a Deming model and said, now, what happens to your salary?
Tell me how much your agent gets.  Tell me how much the union gets.  Tell
me how much the tax collector gets.  How much is left?  And you're 26 years
old and you're a pitcher and you may not have 10 more years, how worried
are you?  And they're in an adversarial environment.  I mean, they and the
managers have -- they and the owners have had a lousy relationship
culturally.
<P><PRE>
>> arrogant, bad decision-making by people like Steinbrenner.

>> On both sides, on both sides.  You've got owners who have made bad
>>decisions.  You've got a player's union that's made bad decisions, and
>>instead of in a Deming-like model stopping and -I mean, what they -- I
>>think what they ought to do, frankly, is go off on a retreat and not come
>>out until -- you know, if you took every owner and every player and you
>>said, we're now all going to go to Yellowstone and we can't leave until
>>we have a solution, they'd get one.  They'd talk to each other.  But
>>until you can unlock that, as long as you keep it adversarial, back to
>>this.  Well, these are just the players.  I am the owner.  Who do you
>>think you are?  Okay?

>> that's like saying that the worker at Ford is laid off.  And they've
>>worked for Ford for 20 years.  Three weeks before Christmas, they get
>>laid off.  They can't make their boat payment, their house payment, that
>>and that and that.  Well, you know, what a rotten president, what a
>>rotten congress, you know, we can't make our house payment.

>> I didn't say the Congress should do anything.

>> well, I'm just saying --

>> I said -- but a healthy leader would tell everybody eight months
>>earlier, we have a big problem in the world market.  We're not competing
>>very well.  We may end up having to close the factory if we're not
>>careful.  We'd better think about this together.

>> that's what I'm saying, is that they've got to take responsibility.  If
>>they know their career is only 10 years --

>> then they've got to slow down.


>> -- they've got to save it up.

>> and what they're saying to you is as long as we raise the marginal tax
>>rate, the amount they have to play with is going down, so the pressure on
>>them to get higher salaries is greater than people think it is, because
>>the net they're making has gone down, not gone up.


>> but it's free.

>> I'm just saying if you're the owner and you treat that with arrogance
>>and you're an owner who has a private corporate jet and you own a big
>>corporation and you have a stadium given to you by the city on a really
>>nice deal and they now get into a fight, if you decide just to fight each
>>other, which is Taylorism, why would you think the strike would end?
>>Whereas, if you'd come over here and say wait a second.  We're part of a
>>lot bigger system that has customers out here.  We are actually the
>>fiduciaries of a great national pastime called baseball.  We have a moral
>>responsibility to find a solution, this tone, this conversation is
>>totally different from Taylorism.  It's a different model.  But notice,
>>this is also broken up, because when you go to Taylorism and they hire a
>>union agent, now these guys have an agent who's paid to fight, and these
>>guys have an agent who's paid to fight, and they go off into a room and
>>they couldn't care less about the customers.

>> absolutely.  But what they're doing is the same thing we do with the
>>beads.  They're pulling them out and they don't have any control over the
>>red beads coming in.

>> right.

>> which is this guy  over --

>> right, which is why what they really ought to do is every single one of
>>the players and every single one of the owners ought to go off as a
>>group, kick out their agents on both sides, and sit down without the
>>lawyers and talk as human beings about the national pastime.

>> without the president and congress, also.

>> they ought to do it because as people who want to serve their fans and
>>the sport that they are the fiduciary responsible of, it's the right
>>thing to do.  And just say, we don't want -- now, when you get done with
>>all the talk and you have reached an agreement, you bring in the lawyers
>>to legally codify the agreement.  But the minute you get the two sides
>>lawyers, you leave this and you go back over here.  And what you've done
>>is you've now blocked right here.  And these guys don't talk to these
>>guys because they each have a hired hatchet, a hired gun. And the hired
>>gun's just sitting there shooting at each other.

>> and they can't make any decisions anyway --

>> right.

>> -- to solve the baseball strike.

>> But they can blur the communications.  So this team only hears from
>>their hired gun and this team only hears from their hired gun, so the
>>owners get one-sided views and the players get one-sided views, and over
>>here is the customer and the national pastime, both of which are being
>>served badly by both the owners and the players.  And that's why the
>>Deming model is so much more powerful at providing service and providing
>>goods than is the Taylor model.  Now, we've got to get through some more
>>stuff. But notice what the next Chyron is.  Principle five, every person,
>>process, and job is part of an interdependent larger system.  So if you
>>start with, gee, here is the pastime of baseball, here are the 130
>>million fans, here are the people who earn a living selling, you know,
>>cokes and beer and popcorn and tickets, here is the players and the
>>owners, now you see yourself in a much bigger system, and your ego gets
>>much smaller.  You're a tiny part of that system, okay?
</pre>
And unless you see yourself as your -- you and your process and your job
are part of a larger system, how can you figure out what your contribution
is?  That's why I said earlier when I said wipe off the table, the first
question is, why?  Because you've got to figure out what system you're part
of.  Principle number six, and this is very hard to get across to people,
continual learning is the basis for continual improvement.  I can't
overstate this.  You have to learn every day of your life.  We have got to
rethink education from the ground up, so from prior to birth, from
conception to death, there are things we can do to maximize your chance of
learning.  If we are the best learning society on the planet, we will
dominate the planet in terms of our productivity, and that means rethinking
everything from the ground up.  And if you're not continually learning
every day, you don't get it.
<P>
Okay? Principle -- now, so take those six principles and let me go back and
show them to you in this way,  value is defined by the customer, value is
invented by the producer, production is a system of processes, everyone
contributes, and continuous improvement by everyone is the most powerful
model.  Now, let's look at a non-manufacturing example of this, one of the
great systems of this country, the Ritz-Carlton.
<p> <PRE>
>> thank you for calling the Ritz-Carlton --

>> for Ritz-Carlton hotels, it's a matter of constantly improving services
>>to its guests, for in a real sense, its product is service.  And they
>>also understand that with total quality management, the old way ways no
>>longer work.

>> Horst H. Schutze:  if it was true that quality, that it could reach the
>>peak of quality, if it was not a moving target, if it wasn't a continuous
>>voyage, then we would still be driving model-t Fords.  You see, there is
>>always a new dimension and new frontier to be captured.  It's very
>>interesting that most people think that statistical process control does
>>not exist in the service industry.  And it certainly does.  We have key
>>demands by customers, key expectations identified, of course, through
>>careful service, and for all those key expectations, we have processes,
>>and those processes are measured.

>> in fact, they measure 720 work areas throughout the company, and on a
>>daily basis.  Then those measurements are combined with comments from
>>guest surveys to form a data base which is used for continuous
>>improvement.

>> okay?  Is that helpful?  Now, seen from that context, I mean, you can
>>apply it to, how does the reservation clerk answer the phone?  How does
>>the bellman greet you at the door?  How do they take care of your towels?
>>How do they take care of room service? How do they take care of the
>>restaurant?  I mean, every aspect. It's not just manufacturing.  Every
>>aspect of life.  What if we had a quality-driven legal system?  What if
>>we had a quality-driven bureaucracy?  And you can be.  I mean, you know,
>>"bureaucrat" doesn't have to be a negative word.  Because originally, it
>>simply meant somebody who was systematic in doing things.
</pre>
Now, remember the three big concepts of entrepreneurial free enterprise.
First, the entrepreneur as a creative -- is a creative inventor.  Second,
the customer or the market or the goal defines success.  And, third,
getting the job done is the focus.  So you invent, the market judges
whether or not your invention is useful, and getting the job done as you've
defined it is how you define whether or not you're succeeding.  If you
apply quality to education in that context, you have a totally different
rhythm and pattern of how we try to learn.  It be much more dynamic, much
more open.  And the focus would be on,  how much do you learn, not how long
do you sit?
<P>
And this is why we really do want you by next week, every one of you to
have written down what three major changes would you make in the process of
learning in America based on Deming and Drucker and, in particular, on
today's session.  The vision here that we're trying to communicate with
this particular two hours is an America committed to Quality and Profound
Knowledge so that every American, the poorest American, the richest
American, the least powerful, the most powerful, somebody with a sixth
grade education, somebody with a Ph.D.., every American starts out each day
and says, what process am I involved?  What system am I part of?  What is
my goal?  What customers am I trying to satisfy? How am I doing this?
Okay?  In that framework, it seems to me that our strategies,  learning,
speaking, teaching, recognizing, living, okay, how you have to learn, then
you have to speak.  You have to explain what you're doing.  You have to
teach it.  When somebody does do it right, you want to recognize them.  And
all this gets summarized into literally,  how do you live every day?
<P>
And it may sound at first kind of hokey, but just think about it. What
we're trying to do here is suggest to you that Deming took the best of the
American Civilization, he codified it into a way of empowering every person
to have control over their contribution, so that every person can literally
live this out. You ought to be living it out in your marriage or your
relationship to other people.  You ought to be living it out in your
community.  You ought to be living it out in your own life. Think of your
own life as a system, as a process.  All that should fit together in a way
that makes sense.
<P>
Now, if that's true, one of the questions I'd ask you to think about, which
I don't have an answer to, is, what are the projects and what are the
tactics that ought to grow out of this?  What would make your community
more quality-oriented, more like a Deming Profound Knowledge system?  Or
your family, or your job, or your volunteer activity?  If you would,
imagine applying Quality and Profound Knowledge to health, safety,
government, the welfare system, and learning.  Notice, by the way, health,
safety, and learning do not imply health care.  They don't imply police.
They don't imply education in the traditional sense.
<P>
They simply say, okay, how do you maximize learning?  How do you maximize
health in America?  What if we didn't need any open-heart surgery because
everybody had habits of diet and habits of exercise so that they didn't
need it?  How much would that save?  Very different way of thinking than if
you  start -- you know, what if every neighborhood had its own patrol and
every neighborhood did -- had its own people who systematically became
deputized and you didn't have any crime?  Which is different than,  can we
hire enough police and enough prosecutors and build enough prisons so that
after the crime is committed, we can lock up the bad people. Very different
models.  And I'm trying to get you to break down the internal barriers to
creativity where you start with blinders on, and instead, get you to think
about all of it, the totality of opportunity that's available.
<P>
Remember that we talk in terms of vision, strategies, projects, and
tactics.  And what I want you to think about is applying it to quality in
education.  And, frankly, if I were redoing this particular Chyron, I'd
probably say quality in "learning."  I wouldn't say "education."  I have
almost no interest in education.  I have every interest in learning.  Now,
you may learn in a setting which is an educational setting or you may learn
some other way.  But what I want to know is,  how much are you learning?
What is your process of acquiring knowledge?  What's your process of
changing your life?  And you find more and more learning goes on outside of
structured, bureaucratic environments.
<P>
More and more people who buy tapes or they go to a particular three-day
seminar or they do something on their own or they pick up books or they use
expert systems in computer.  Or they find a consultant who comes in for a
day.  You know, I mean, think about it as an adult, if you had to go learn
skiing, would you take a five-hour credit course on skiing, or would you go
and spend three intense days at a resort with a ski instructor?  Which
technique -- they're both kinds of learning.  Or would you read a book on
how to ski, practice it a little bit, and go down the slope and see what
happens?  Different people do different things.
<P>
My point's just that's a -- if you focus on learning, it's a dramatically
more open-ended question than if you focus on education, which is a
predefined professional status in a bureaucratic setting occupied with
credentialing.  Very different systems.  Remember, also, that after you
think you know what you're doing, we've got to go back to applying listen,
learn, help, and lead.  That is, you think you have your vision, you think
you have your strategies, you think you have your projects, you're ready
with your tactics, fine.  Now go listen to the person next to you.  What do
they think?  What are their concerns?  Why do they do it?  Because if all
you do is focus on your version of visions, strategies, projects, and
tactics, you still have not listened to everybody else who's part of your
game.  So there's an enormous amount of listening involved in this kind of
leading.
<P>
Okay?  So how does -- how would this lead you to change learning in America
based on what you've learned today?  What might you do?  Just brainstorm.
No rights and wrongs.  Just be creative.
<PRE>
>> let the students choose who they want their teachers to be for which
>>subjects they want to take.

>> put the students in a teaching capacity.  The best way to learn
>>something is to teach it.

>> teach it, sure.

>> get the parents more involved in volunteering in the schools.

>> what else?

>> like, learn through experience.

>> okay.  Should that count?

>> sure.

>> I mean, if we say to you, we want you to become something, what if you
>>just go and do it as an apprentice and actually learn it, but you didn't
>>sit through the five-hour course?  Does that count?  Does that count?

>> bureaucracy has to be defined.

>> yes, ma'am?

>> I think you ought to make computers check-outable at libraries just like
>>you do books, because they can learn things faster on a computer.

>> that's interesting.  What if you could check out a PC and the software
>>package literally and maybe put -- give a credit card or something as a
>>device, but what if public libraries became centers where people could
>>literally go in and check out computers?  Yes, sir.  Go ahead.

>> I think field trips should be part of, like, for history and stuff.  I
>>know when we were, like, in fourth grade, we toured the cyclorama and
>>berry college, and in high school it was so much more paperwork, we
>>couldn't go anywhere.

>> I was going to say, did you learn on field trips?

>> yeah.

>> what are the new rules in Georgia on field trips?

>> there's so much paperwork, you can't --

>> anybody know?  You do fewer field trips today.

>> too much litigation.

>> too much litigation.  Too much time out of the classroom.  The rules in
>>Georgia today are actually worse for field trips than they were 30 years
>>ago.

>> even the bureaucracy of the tests.  They have a test now that says you
>>can't graduate from high school in Georgia, and teachers are going to
>>have to teach, this is what's going to be on the test.  That ends -- you
>>know, my English teacher couldn't teach Maya Angelou's poetry because she
>>knew that this wasgoing to be on the test, because you have to pass the
>>test to get out of high school.

>> See, they teach to the test.  Remember the Deming point?  The purpose of
>>recognition is for what you've already internalized, and if we set up a
>>standard for recognition that you  then -- you then gain the system,
>>right?  And say, I've got it.  What I've got to learn to do is to stand
>>on one leg.  Okay, I can now stand on one leg, so I'll get an "a."  Who
>>cares?  Now, if the other answer is, the reason you're standing on one
>>leg -- and I'm not going to do this -- the reason you're standing on one
>>leg is you're a ballerina and you're doing a pirouette, see the
>>difference?
</pre>
Okay, and we're now going to honor the best ballerina.  That's a very
different reason for learning to stand on one leg.  And what we do in a
bureaucratic credentialed environment, you systematically reduce the
creativity of people, and you systematically reduce the holistic manner in
which they learn, and you reduce them so that they become passive, narrow,
and shallow, and then we say,  gee, why do our schools not work? Because
the entire core structure is wrong.
<P>
Now, next week we're going to pick up the Third Wave in American
Civilization.  Next week's readings are Alvin and Heidi Toffler's "Creating
a New Civilization, the Politics of the Third Wave."  Alexis de
Tocqueville's "Democracy in America," volume II, books 2, chapter 18, and
volume II, book 4, chapter 1.  And Don Eberly's "Building a Community of
Citizens," chapter 5.  And we'll take up, what does the third wave mean and
how will it change our lives?  Okay?

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Lecture Two -- PFF</title>
Note: this transcript is unedited and can not be used for any other 
purpose except those specifically authorized by the Progress and Freedom 
Foundation
<P>
Renewing American Civilization<br>
Class 2<br>
The historic lessons of American History January 14, 1995
<P>
The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College 
television in Waleska, Georgia. From Reinhardt College in Waleska, 
Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the second of 
10 class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor 
at Reinhardt College, will continue his course which presents the 
foundational principles necessary to the Renewal of American 
Civilization. This week's lesson, pillar one: the historic lessons of 
American Civilization, focuses on the lessons of American history and the 
use of history for analysis and problem solving.
<p>
Good morning. Let me say that it's a little bit rainy here in Waleska 
this morning, but I want to welcome what I hope are the dry students of 
Mind Extension University all over the country and report to all of you 
that my sister-in-law found me by channel surfing last Saturday, ended up 
taking at least the television part of the course. And I want to remind 
everyone that they can mail their comments to "Renewing American 
Civilization," post office box 6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065. They can 
fax their comments to 404-528-9806. They can e-mail their comments to: 
America Online. It's renewam@aol.com. And by the way, 42 people responded 
on America Online this week, and they also had 57 other people who 
downloaded transcripts from Compuserve and America Online, and they are 
available on our Internet web page, which is on the screen. 
http.//www.pff.org. And everybody who's watching who doesn't have a clue 
what that means, that's fine, don't worry about it. Sometime in the next 
decade, it will get to you. Also, there's an "American Civilization" 
newspaper. There are also video and audio tapes of the course and the 
course readings. Anybody who's watching who's interested in that can just 
call 1-800-to-renew.
<P>
Now, just as a very brief overview, remember, the assertion of the course 
is that there are five pillars of American Civilization. That they are 
the historic lessons of American Civilization, is the first pillar. 
Personal strength is the second pillar. Entrepreneurial free enterprise 
is the third pillar. The spirit of invention and discovery is the fourth 
pillar. And quality as defined by Deming is the fifth pillar. And we're 
going to take one class for each of these five, and then there are four 
areas to which we will apply these pillars. They are, first of all, 
looking at the third wave in American Civilization, so we'll spend two 
hours looking at the concept of the information revolution in American 
Civilization. Then creating American jobs in the world market. And then 
we will spend two hours looking at replacing the culture of violence and 
poverty with a culture of productivity and safety. And finally, we will 
close the course with two hours on citizenship and community in 21st 
century America, which in a sense ought to be the final culmination of 
what we're trying to teach. 
<P>
Now, today's topic is the historic lessons of American Civilization. And 
I want to use this to accomplish three different things, if I can, just 
for a second, so you'll understand where I'm going and what my biases are 
and what I'm trying to accomplish. First of all, I want to get you to 
think about history. I am a historian as a vocational degree. Because I 
think if you want to understand human beings, you ought to study history, 
because history helps you. In other words, I didn't study history to 
become a historian. I studied history in order to understand how people 
function, how people do things. Because the most powerful predictor of 
possible future behaviors is history. So one thing I want you to do is 
learn a fair amount about how to use history, how to make it work for 
you. So you actually look at it and people say, "oh, that's history." And 
it's common in our current culture that that means it's irrelevant, it's 
past, it's gone. I would argue just the opposite. Every major figure, 
when you go back through the last 300 years, when you read Napoleon's 
quotes or you look at Washington, look at FDR, look at Harry Truman, 
again and again you find people who read history for a practical reason. 
<P>
So I want to -- part of the purpose of today's two hours is to try to 
begin to convince you that history can be the most practical of 
disciplines, because it is teaching you about what you want to do. So I 
don't really care what history you read. If you want to get rich, then 
read the history, the biographies of people who got rich. You want to be 
a famous entertainer, then read the biographies of people who became 
famous entertainers. You want to be a successful political leader, then 
read the biographies of successful political leaders. But studying how 
others have done things not only enriches you in the sense of, oh, you 
know a lot more and you sound a lot better at cocktail parties, it also 
gives you a wider menu of solutions than people have who don't read 
history. So I regard immersing yourself in history as the most practical 
of applications. 
<P>
The second point we want to make is that history is a great place to 
begin to really reemphasize American exceptionalism. And I want to talk a 
lot about that today, and it reinforces our argument that America is a 
civilization. That it's multi-ethnic, but one civilization. And you'll 
see that as we start talking about American history. 
<P>
The third thing I want to do with today's looking at history is to get 
you to realize how aberrational the current moment is.  And in a sense, 
the core argument of this course is that from the arrival of the 
English-speaking peoples, which is a period of around 1607 to 1620 in 
Virginia and in Massachusetts, that you had a culture which began to wash 
up on the North American continent. That culture, going all the way back 
to the Magna Carta, had a deep passion for liberty. That it had learned 
lessons in the English Civil War, and that it had, with John Locke and 
others, created an argument about how humans are free. And that that 
culture actually gradually emerges, becomes modern America, and that you 
can see from 1760 to 1789 a big argument about whether or not, in fact, 
being American is different than being British. 
<P>
There's a famous story of Franklin going to Britain sent by the colony of 
Pennsylvania as their representative, arriving in Britain as a loyal 
English subject and leaving Britain as an American, because in his 
exposure to the British political system, he had come to realize how far 
apart we were and that they were not us. And there are a number of 
quotes, and I remember the one who said -- somebody who said during this 
period, I think it was John Adams, who says that we entered this argument 
with Britain thinking we were British, and in our minds learned that we 
were American, and then decided we had to have a revolution. And then 
after the revolution, they have to invent a system.
<P>
And one of the things which liberated me and got me going was Gordon 
Wood's two great works on "the Origins of the American Revolution," which 
covers this period, and "the Radicalism of the American Revolution" in 
which Wood argues that a second great breakthrough occurs. This is our 
political breakthrough. We become America politically, we become a free 
country, we adopt the constitution. And that's why we have, as some of 
your assignments, "the Federalist Papers," the Declaration of 
Independence, the Constitution. They're out of this period. Then there's 
a second break point which is: now that we're no longer bound by a king 
and we're no longer bound by aristocracy, we become a remarkably 
democratic, capitalist, entrepreneurial society of enormous freedom. And 
that is codified in 1830, '30, and '31 by de Tocqueville. And by this 
point, we have become America.
<P>
Now, the central argument of this course intellectually is that this 
system, to a remarkable degree, survived to about 1965. And that you 
could have had a dialogue between American leaders, the American elite, 
normal, everyday Americans, you know, people have all kinds of 
backgrounds could have gotten together up to this point and there would 
have been a continuity from here to here, and you'll see it today. In 
fact, I was shocked last night preparing today's class. We're going to 
share with you something I have never -- did not hear till last night, 
which is Franklin Delano Roosevelt's radio address to the country. It's a 
real experiment -- I'll say to the people watching us on mind extension 
university, this is a real experiment, because we're going to ask you to 
listen to a radio speech for eight and a half minutes, which in the age 
of television is unthinkable. 
<P>
But when you listen to it and you think about it, this is -- and Drucker 
wrote a book on this called a discontinuity. It's called "the age of 
discontinuities," and his point is that every once in a while things 
break, and you know what is on this side of the discontinuity. You don't 
really know what's on the other side, by definition. That's why it's a 
discontinuity. It's discontinuous. When you listen to the Roosevelt radio 
speech, anyone from here back to here would have understood the speech. 
And I want to ask you when we get to it to take notes, because it is 
inconceivable that the elite would have accepted from here to the present.
<P>
I think this discontinuity ended in 1994. But it's inconceivable to 
anybody in the discontinuity that you could have had that speech. It 
would have been ridiculed and it would have been unthinkable, and you'll 
see what I'm talking about when you hear the speech. And yet my assertion 
is that because of -- see, America is a collection of solutions. American 
civilization is the conscious effort of human beings to collect solutions 
to the question: how do human beings live together and function? And 
because I believe it is the highest value collection of solutions in 
human history, I believe that having now gone through the discontinuity, 
what we're about to do is come out as America again. But that there was a 
very serious argument for a 30-year period over America was essentially a 
racist, sexist, repressive society of greedy people who rip off the rest 
of the nation and exploit the poor, and that if you engage in an act of 
violence, it was probably because you were psychologically dispossessed 
and a victim, and therefore you had an obligation to shoot up people 
because after all, this racist, sexist, exploitive capitalist culture had 
forced you to do that. 
<P>
Now, in a sense -- but I can find you the articles, the speeches, the 
analysis, the courses that make this argument. And that therefore -- and 
it's basically two simple arguments. The theory here is very simple. All 
of these people believed that America is a great country filled with good 
people. Now, they were not simplistic. Everybody in this period believed 
in the original sin. That is, all of them believed: of course you have 
evil occasionally. Smush it. And evil can be: you have to train your 
child. You have to have discipline. You have to learn all sorts of -- you 
have to learn habits that are good. You have to say, "don't do that." But 
everybody in this period believed it. Over here, you suddenly end up in a 
-- you end up in an argument: is, in fact, America a country where the 
people are so incorrect that you need to use the coercive power of 
government to reshape the people? And that the duty of government -- the 
argument here that was offered was that the government must intervene on 
behalf of the ideal and reorganize the average American because they are 
not thinking and doing the right things. Okay?  And that's part of what 
we're going to discuss as we go through this. 
<P>
Now, the first place I'm going to start is the use of history for 
analysis and problem solving. Remember back to my point that I believe 
history is the most practical of disciplines and the most -- and worth 
looking at, because it strengthens your ability to analyze and to solve 
problems. And I believe that there are five reasons for studying the 
lessons of American history. First of all, history is a collective 
memory. That is, history is how you think about and learn about yourself 
as a people. Second, American history is the history of our civilization, 
and I'm going to go back to each of these in a minute. Third, there is an 
American exceptionalism that can be best understood through history. 
Fourth, history is a resource to be learned from and used. And, fifth, 
there are techniques that can help you learn problem solving from 
historic experience. So we're going to walk through all five. 
<P>
Let me start off with this notion: history is a collective memory. I 
mean, how do you learn how to be an American? Part of it is you develop 
common language. I mean, why does the statue of the marines on MT. 
Suribachi raising the flag really matter? Because it is a collective 
reminder of the heroic cost of freedom. And it's useful to remember. I 
mean, if you don't know where Iwo Jima was, who fought in world war ii, 
who the marines are, or why it mattered, then having a picture of that is 
irrelevant. And one of the frightening things about the elimination of 
historic memory, the creation of cultural amnesia in the last 30 years, 
is that it's harder to know what it means to be an American if you don't 
know the history of the American people. And so it's very important in 
part to immerse people. 
<P>
Remember, my Ph.D.'s in European history. I'm not arguing against 
learning about the rest of the world. I'm arguing that first you immerse 
yourself in America. First you thoroughly understand how you came to be 
American. Then you learn about the rest of the world. And I think you 
should do both. I think you should learn about the rest of the world. But 
I think unless you ground yourself in an understanding -- and this is, by 
the way, a very multi-cultural history in the sense of who came here, but 
it's a history of one civilization. So you can't understand America 
without understanding the contribution of Chinese laborers in building 
the railroad. And, for that matter, Irish laborers. You can't understand 
the U.S. cavalry in the 1870s and '80s without understanding the influx 
of immigrants and the degree to which it was largely an immigrant service 
at the enlisted ranks. You can't understand the nature of our 
relationship with the north American Indian who was here first who were 
actually Asians. 
<P>
I mean, they're not native Americans. They're Asians. They came across 
the Bering strait. In that sense, everybody born here is a native 
American, but you can't understand their relationship unless you go back 
and look at them just before the arrival of the Europeans and you look at 
it in contextual terms. You know, why did the Apaches end up being driven 
out? They get driven out because the Comanches get guns first. There's a 
huge war fought in the 1750s over who's going to trade with the French 
traders. Who's going to have weapons?
<P>
And you have to look at this -- see, you need to understand all of this. 
What's the role of the Aztecs? What's the role of the Spanish, who are, 
after all, in the southern part of north America much, much earlier. It 
gives you a real sense of perspective, by the way, to look sometime at 
how long the Spanish were in and how brief a time we've been in as a 
United States, as an American Civilization. And then what does that say? 
And you go to a place like Santa Fe. What's the richness of Santa Fe and 
how early was Santa Fe a major city with major intellectual sources, 
compared, say, to Boston? And you begin to see a whole -- a much more 
complex history, but the totality of it is American Civilization. 
<P>
Second, it's the history of our civilization. And this is one of the 
assertions that I think is maybe most controversial in the course. We 
need to learn about us so we can renew our sense of us-ness. That is, 
American history is useful for everybody. It's particularly useful for 
us. And you need to learn how to be an American, because as George 
Santayana said, quote, to be an American is of itself almost a moral 
condition, an education, and a career. Notice how he's describing it. 
It's an education, it's a career.
<P>
What does he mean by "career"? He means that to live out being American 
is a full-time job. That it's a way of being. It's not an inheritance. 
It's not, "oh, I'm an American" -- you know, "I'm German." "why are you 
German?" "because my parents are German. We lived in Germany." Or, "I'm 
Japanese." "why are you Japanese?" "well, because I'm genetically 
Japanese." You're not genetically American. To be an American is 
literally an act of the mind. 
<P>
Third, there is an American exceptionalism that can best be understood 
through history. And this -- I'm going to come back later to Everett Carl 
Ladd's concept of American exceptionalism, but I want to make a 
particular point here that is again going to be very controversial with 
people who are overly rational. Much of life is lived and experienced. 
It's not neat lines on a chalkboard. It's not a monograph. It's not 
intellectual. All of you, I think, now know that. There are things you 
can experience that you can read about forever, but until you have 
experienced them, they don't exist. You sort of think you know. I mean, 
I'm living this now in terms of becoming speaker. I mean, whatever I 
thought it would be like, this is different. Well, being an American is 
best experienced by reading about people who have been American. Because 
American Civilization is too complex to reduce to a series of seven 
principles, three rules. It's a way of being. It's like Zen. 
<P>
Now, there's a great book for those of you who want to pursue it called 
"Zen and the art of archery" by Hergrove, who's a German, which gives you 
a sense of what I'm trying to talk about.  It's a way of -- you have to 
be an American. And one of the best ways to study being an American is to 
read the history of people who have been American. Because it's too 
dynamic and too complex to reduce to just a set of cookbook terms. 
<P>
Fourth, as I said earlier, we're going to look at history as a resource 
to be learned from and used. When -- and this is my challenge. When you 
run into a problem, the first thing you should ask is: who else has had 
this problem and how did they solve it? And then go study people who 
solved it, because it's cheaper to imitate than to invent. A basic rule, 
and it's one of the reasons I ended up as speaker of the house, is that 
every time I bounce into a problem, I try to stop and say: okay, now who 
already has solved this somewhere in history? I then go read their 
solution. I then ask: will that one work here? Does it have a good idea? 
Is it worth doing? 
<P>
Fifth, there are techniques that can help you learn problem solving from 
historic experience. There's a way of practicing immersing yourself in 
this. Now, one of them I just gave you. Every time you run into a new -- 
I mean, you don't do this for everything. But every time you run into a 
significant problem, stop and say: who solved this somewhere else? Go to 
the library and ask them: what books do you have on this topic? Who has 
already done it? And start from there. But you also realize history is 
not just written. Go find somebody you know personally who's already 
solved it, and ask them to teach you. I mean, a large part of my life 
beginning when I was very young, maybe 4 or 5 years old, is an 
instinctive, automatic search for people I can apprentice myself to. What 
are you doing when you apprentice yourself to somebody? You're getting 
them to give you the oral tradition of their history. You're successful. 
Why are you successful? 
<P>
And I'm trying to remember the great leader of coca-cola for many, many 
years, Woodruff. I saw Herman Cain, who's the head of godfather pizza, 
who lives in Omaha, Nebraska. He's an African-American, born in Atlanta. 
His father was Woodruff's chauffeur. So he has great lineage 
intellectually, because Woodruff talked around his father, and then 
Woodruff and his father talked around him. And so while his dad was -- we 
could say, "well, your dad's only a chauffeur." Yeah, he's a chauffeur in 
one of the most successful business leaders in American history. So guess 
what the quality of Herman Cain's education was before he was 18? Okay. 
And that's what I mean, is -- but you're learning the history of what 
Woodruff did. Why did Woodruff know it was right? Because he spent 50 
years of his life practicing. 
<P>
Now you get to learn either this is how he did it and you copy it down 
and you skip the 50 years, so history's not just written, it's also oral. 
Now, we want to focus on actively listening and reading. And you want to 
ask yourself -- by that, I mean, don't be passive. Ask yourself first: 
what are the hidden lessons in what I'm experiencing? Second, how does it 
apply to me? And, third, what additional questions does it lead to? Now, 
by hidden lessons -- and you'll see this. We're going to do an experiment 
in a minute. By hidden lessons, I mean the fact is that everybody has a 
tendency to be passive. You receive it, but you need to actively be in 
the TV when you watch it. You need to actively be in the book. You need 
to actively be in the conversation, probing, asking questions. Think 
about it. What does this mean? What can I learn here? But second, and 
this is the key to all real learning: how does it apply to me? 
<P>
Now, I'll just guarantee you, if you're learning for you, you will learn 
30 or 40 times more intensely than if you're learning for the teacher. 
And if you get in the habit of learning for you, you'll learn all your 
life. If you get in the habit of learning for teacher, you'll learn till 
the test. It's a totally different model of what learning's about. And 
then lastly, as soon as you learn this batch, you ought to say to 
yourself: now, what does that lead me to ask? What additional questions 
does it lead me to? 
<P>
Now, here's what I want you to do: I want you to actively watch, ask 
questions of yourself, make notes, as we watch two minutes on Gettysburg. 
Then we're going to stop and I'm going to ask you: what did you learn and 
what questions might this lead you to out of Gettysburg? Okay, so let's 
take a look, if we could, at Will Wright on Gettysburg, and I think you 
can watch it on the monitors.
<P>
On November 19th, Lincoln traveled to Gettysburg to dedicate the new 
union cemetery. The featured speaker was Edward Everett of Massachusetts, 
a diplomat, clergyman and celebrated orator. The president had been 
invited almost as an afterthought to offer a few appropriate remarks. 
Everett spoke for not quite two hours, then Lincoln rose. The local 
photographer took his time focusing. Presumably the president could be 
counted on to go on for a while. But he spoke just 269 words. He started 
off by reminding his audience that just 87 years had passed since the 
founding of the nation, and then he went on to embolden the union cause 
with some of the most stirring words ever spoken. Lincoln was heading 
back to his seat before the photographer could open the shutter. 
<P>
>> he felt that he had failed, that it was a poor speech, that the people 
didn't like it, it was so brief, less than two minutes. He felt that he 
had failed. Lehman, his friend Ward Lehman, was sitting next to him on 
the stand, and when he sat down, there was just a sprinkling of applause, 
and he said, "Lehman, that speech won't scour." That's what you say about 
a plow in the prairies when the mud doesn't come off it. 
<P>
>> the cheek of every American was tingled with shame as he reads the 
silly, flat, dish-watery utterances of the man who has to be pointed out 
to intelligent foreigners as the president of the united states. Chicago 
times. 
<P>
>> dear Mr.. President: I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I 
came as near to the central idea of the occasion in two hours as you did 
in two minutes. Edward everett. >>
<P>
Okay. So what do you think? What do you get out of that? What lessons, if 
any, can you pull out of that, or what questions? 
<P>
>> doesn't take a long time to say a lot. 
<P>
>> okay. I'm going to shorten it. Say a lot briefly. What else? 
<P>
>> sometimes initial response by witnesses or media witnesses is not 
really relevant. 
<P>
>> initial response can be misleading. I'm going to take the teacher's 
prerogative a second and pull a second thing out of what you said. The 
media can be wrong. 
<P>
>> this, by the way -- you want to understand how important history is, 
at least to me? Nothing which has ever been said about me is comparable 
to what was said about Lincoln or what Jefferson and Hamilton said about 
each other through papers that they subsidized. This is a tough business. 
And it has always in America -- that's why American history is useful. 
This isn't Russia, this isn't china, this isn't a controlled press. This 
country is the most rough and tumble, brutal political system in the 
world. Except we don't kill each other. So we don't have secret police. 
You don't get assassinated. You don't have the knight of the long knives 
in which Hitler wiped out hundreds of people. But verbally we sublimate 
our violence by just being unbelievable to each other. 
<P>
And there's a long tradition -- I mean, you can actually do a paper on 
what Lincoln -- what was said about Lincoln after the speech, and it's 
just -- about half the newspapers were just devastated. What else? What 
else did you pick up? 
<P>
>> even if you think that you've failed, you might have been succeeding 
the whole time. 
<P>
>> that's right. This is very important, by the way. Because a lot of 
time people get very insecure. What does it tell you, by the way, that he 
commented on his speech to his friend as soon as he made it? But what 
does it tell you about Lincoln? 
<P>
>> that he's humble. 
<P>
>> genuine. 
<P>
>> insecure. 
<P>
Not genuine, he's insecure. All politicians are insecure. At least all 
the ones I've ever known except people who are just out of touch with 
reality, I mean, because you're in a very public environment and you're 
trying do something very public, and you want to do it well. There's a 
wonderful scene in "the Wind and the Llion," which I really recommend to 
all of you. It's a magnificent movie about Theodore Roosevelt and a great 
way to learn about that era. And there's a wonderful scene. He's 
campaigning for re-election in 1904. He's on the back of a train and he 
has a huge crowd, and the band is playing and people are screaming and a 
cowboy on a horse for the rough riders is firing a pistol in the air, and 
there's just a -- it's a mob scene. And as it's pulling out of the 
station with these people running after the train, he turns to the 
secretary of state, who's next to him, and he says, "they do like it, 
John, don't you think? They do like it?" 
<P>
And I thought it was such a wonderful capturing of the core insecurity 
that, I mean, he's surrounded by a mob which has gone crazy, and he's 
still not quite believing it, because at this level -- I mean, Lincoln, 
after all, other than Washington, Lincoln has the hardest problem: how do 
you hold together the union? And if you want to, by the way -- and it's 
interesting, if you want to read a really interesting novel about 
Lincoln, it's gore Vidal's "Lincoln." I was astonished he could write it, 
I mean, because I'm not a great fan of Vidal's, although I like some of 
his stuff. But it is tremendous and well worth looking at. 
<P>
Okay, one or two last comments. What questions might -- now that you've 
seen two minutes, what questions might it lead you to? 
<P>
>>well, the timing, or how it was brought across at the time, how the two 
minutes was brought across, for me it's so effective, I think. I mean, if 
he may have said it a month from then, it probably would have been 
totally devastating because of the deaths at the time. 
<P>
>> that's right, but the context changes things. I mean, I think -- and 
again, this goes back to why history matters. If you don't know what 
Gettysburg was, if you don't realize how many people died, if you don't 
understand it's the middle of a Civil War, the Gettysburg Address loses 
its meaning. This is a speech given by the President over the graves 
dedicating the cemetery, and heard in that context, it is a very 
different thing than heard in the abstract. Now, let's go back now, and I 
want you to watch this again, having raised some questions and having 
thought about it, watch the same two minutes and see if you can put into 
it as you begin to think about what you're seeing. Again, this is 
something people need to do. If you're not really good at this yet, do it 
three or four times. Take the same thing and practice on it until you see 
that there are many things occurring, many things being said in a short 
two minutes. Let's roll that, if we could.

>> let's test it for a second, okay? Let me just ask: how many of you 
found new things the second time around, just out of curiosity? About 
half of you, all right. Let's now look at the 269 words. See if we can 
actually play the Gettysburg address for you.
<P>
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this 
continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the 
proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great 
civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived, and 
so dedicated, can long endure. We are met here on a great battlefield of 
that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it as a final resting 
place for those who here gave their lives that their nation might live. 
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a 
larger sense we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecrate -- we cannot 
hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, 
have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world 
will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but can never 
forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be 
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they have, thus far, so nobly 
carried on. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task 
remaining before us --that from these honored dead we take increased 
devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of 
devotion --that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have 
died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the 
people, shall not perish from the earth.
<P>
Did you notice what the pictures were of? Who were they? 
<P>
>> civil war veterans. 
<P>
>> civil war veterans gathered at Gettysburg after 40 years after, I 
think, which should remind you of what recent event you've seen?
<P>
>> d-day. 
<P>
>> it's almost exactly the same time frame. Actually, it's 10 years 
longer now. Let's also remind you that countries are saved by the young 
and reminded by the old. And that that's just the nature of the way life 
occurs. Now, he talks about a new nation conceived in liberty and 
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. And in his 
-- and clearly in a time when there were still kings and czars and 
emperors, in Lincoln's mind, the core value of the civil war is the test 
for the human race of whether or not this kind of government of the 
people, by the people, and for the people, can survive. This is literally 
a test of whether or not it's possible. This was still a radical 
experiment in the 1860s. Probably the person who has best captured all of 
this is everett Carl Ladd. He has a new little book out called "The 
American Ideology: An Exploration Of The Origins, Meaning And Roles Of 
American Political Ideas." It's from the Roper Center in Connecticut, and 
it only runs to about 80 pages, but the essence of what he says is that 
the underlying core values for most Americans are still remarkably what 
they have been for 300 years. That despite the best efforts of the elite, 
it is astonishing -- and we'll come back to this -- it is astonishing how 
much classic America has survived. 
<P>
Now, Ladd argues that there is an American Exceptionalism. That it is a 
uniquely insistent and far-reaching individualism. That it's a view of 
the individual person which gives unprecedented weight to his or her 
choices, interests, and claims. That in America, more than any other 
society in history, you matter. Who you are, what you want to do, what 
your rights are, what your claims are on each other and on the society at 
large. And Ladd breaks it down into a series of key values. He talks 
about private property in the economic sphere. Democracy and freedom from 
government control in the political sphere. Advancement on one's merits, 
the absence of rank, and moral equality in the larger society. Let me 
just very briefly walk you through each of these. 
<P>
First of all, private property in the economic sphere. They originally 
wrote, "we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, 
among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of property." The reason 
was if you don't have the sanctity of property, the state can expropriate 
you. If the state can expropriate you, your only means of survival is the 
state. If you have to depend on the state for your survival, you have no 
freedom. So in their minds, the old term "your home is your castle" was 
very deeply felt, and it went back to the English civil war and to 
experiences they'd had with monarchical government. These were not idle 
consents. That's why, for example, the right to bear arms is a much more 
complex issue than people think it is in 9-second sound bites. These guys 
wrote the stuff in for very deliberate historic reasons, and they valued 
property rights as a core of freedom. 
<P>
Second, they wanted democracy and freedom from government control in the 
political sphere. That didn't mean that they didn't think government 
should be able to do things. I mean, they're very tough about government. 
They want a constitution that is a strong but limited government. They 
didn't want a weak government. They wanted a strong but limited 
government. But in the political sphere, they wanted you to be free to do 
virtually anything, and they thought it was essential. That's why the 
freedom of speech is so important. That's why secret elections are so 
important. That's why it's so important to have the rule of law, where 
the laws matter, not the personalities. A very deliberate pattern. They 
wanted advancement on merit. 
<P>
This is going to be, I think, an enormous issue in the next decade. Do 
you do better because you were born and therefore deserve it? You were 
entitled to it? Or do you do better because you earn it? And the founding 
fathers had zero doubts about this. Zero. You had every right to advance. 
But to advance is an active status. You had very few rights to demand 
that others made you entitled. This is going to be an enormous debate and 
is at the core of American society. There was a total absence of rank. 
<P>
I said in my speech accepting the Speakership, I quoted de Tocqueville 
about the house being made up of vulgar people. Remember, the word 
"vulgar" in that period meant "not of aristocratic class." It didn't mean 
you could wear four-letter words on your t-shirt. I mean, we have, in a 
sense, vulgarized the word "vulgar." And think about this in terms of the 
breaking down of American culture. In the 19th century, being vulgar as 
opposed to being an aristocrat made Americans proud. Americans were proud 
to be commoners. They were proud to have a house of representatives that 
was the people's house. Their great joy was that they're not aristocrats. 
But that didn't mean that they wallowed in the mud and tolerated 
alcoholism and thought that it was all right to be a low life. It meant 
that being a middle-class, working person, being a person who did the 
best you could, being without money but not being poor, very important 
psychological concept. 
<P>
Because Americans historically always figured they'd have money soon. A 
country of tremendous striving in the sense of: of course I have every 
right to be here. I'm an American. I don't have to be a king or a duchess 
or a duke. I am an American. To be an American is all the rank I need. 
They also sought moral equality in the larger society. Every American was 
the moral equal of every other American. Every American had the same 
standing to go to court. Every American had the same standing to be 
treated fairly. So a great -- there's a John Wayne quote about -- from 
one of his movies where he says, "I give every person respect, and I 
expect them to do the same for me." The second part of that was he then 
shot them if they didn't. But it's really a remarkably American concept, 
that we are all equals. That the only person, for example, that you need 
to call by title is the President. That's why I'm "Newt." I'm not "Mr.. 
Speaker." Because we're all equals. And it's core to being American. 
<P>
Ladd's argument -- and everett Carl Ladd really has educated me a great 
deal on this, and I just think he's done remarkable work. I think he 
understands the core of America. Ladd's argument is that  the -- that 
you've got to look at these values, and that the essential distinguishing 
American values all reflect a pervasive underlying individualism. That 
this is just a remarkably free society. But part of this comes down, and 
this is a -- this, for me, has been a work in progress. A society of 
individuals, if it's going to have a limited government, has to have a 
strong culture. If there's enormous freedom and no police state, then one 
of the ways we make sure we don't attack each other is we imprint in the 
culture tremendous respect for each other. If there's enormous freedom 
and we're not going to have a huge government circuses and bread process 
of taking care of the poor, then you have to imprint a work ethic of 
tremendous proportions, where people say: well, of course I work. I'm an 
American. And it becomes an identity. So that in a very real sense, if 
you want a society which is very free from government and bureaucracy, 
you have to have a society which has -- which is very strong in what it 
teaches itself and it teaches its children and it teaches immigrants who 
become American. And so we have to rethink: what is this -- what's the 
context of those individuals? And I think it's ironic, in a sense, if you 
think about it, that the very -- here we are on the one hand saying: boy, 
are we really a free society. I can do my thing. And yet I would argue -- 
and this is a lot of evolution of my own thinking over the last 10 or 15 
years. 
<P>
One of my favorite movies is "the Last of the Mohicans," which I commend 
to all of you. It's a great film about the French and Indian war. 
Wonderful scene where the American who was the deerslayer is standing 
there and the British officer says, "aren't you going to Fort William 
Henry?" And he says, "no, I'm going to Kentucky." And he says, "how can 
you go to Kentucky in the middle of a war?" And he says, "you face north, 
turn left, and walk. It's west of here." It's a very American response. 
And the officer says, "but you're a British subject and you have to come 
and fight." And he says, "no, I am an American." 
<P>
Now, he ends up going to fight. Why? Because of the girl, which is also 
classically American. It's a very romantic country. It really, 
historically, is a very romantic country. You can't be American without 
having romance in your heart. I mean, if you grow up as a cynic, it's 
very hard to sustain the magic that's American. But part of the 
conclusion I reached, oh, maybe 22 years ago, reading Daniel Boorstin's 
work on the Americans, is that as important as the mountain man is -- and 
you remember "Jeremiah Johnson," which is a great film, and again, a very 
useful introduction to a real authentic American -- there were very few 
mountain men. There were very few people who went out on their own in the 
woods. The most common American pattern was the wagon train. Wagon trains 
are collective enterprises. They are us getting together. A wonderful 
scene in "Witness" where they have the barn-raising. The community comes 
together. America is about individualism, but it's about an individualism 
which then voluntarily creates communities, which is the thing de 
Tocqueville is stunned by, that here you have this enormous freedom. D
<P>
oes the freedom lead to anarchy? No. The freedom leads everybody to get 
together. But they get together voluntarily and they create the community 
they want, and now in the electronic age, you can live geographically 
next to 60 different people, not know many of them, and then you can 
reach out to the people you want to create an electronic community with 
by telephone, by fax, by computer, and you suddenly have an extended 
family of lots of people, some of whom you've never even met, but you 
were really excited knowing each other. So it's the individual then 
merging into community. And one of the characteristics of it is that 
idealism in the community draws the individuals together. It's not 
rampant individualism. It is individualism lived out idealistically 
within a community. 
<P>
And I'm now going to show you what I think is one of the most powerful 
things in the whole course where we have to thank, frankly, Ted turner 
for giving us the right to use this. We actually had this before it even 
-- it was available commercially. It is a speech, it's a true speech, 
given by a college professor who volunteers in the Civil War. And he is 
talking to a brigade which has rebelled. It has mutinied, and he is 
explaining to them why he needs their help. And I want you to watch this. 
You can take notes if you want to, but I don't think you're going to want 
to make notes. I think you're just going to want to absorb this and then 
I'm going to talk briefly. Think about the idealism, think about what you 
heard earlier about Gettysburg, and then watch this.
<P>
I've been talking with private Bucklin. He's told me about your problem. 
There's nothing I can do today. We're moving out in a few minutes. We'll 
be moving all day. I've been ordered to take you men with me. I'm told 
that -- that if you don't come, I can shoot you. Well, you know I won't 
do that. Maybe somebody else will, but I won't, so that here's the 
situation. The whole Reb army is up that road a ways waiting for us, so 
this is no time for an argument like this, I tell you. We could surely 
use you fellows. We're now well below half strength. Whether you fight or 
not, that's -- that's up to you. Whether you come along is -- is, well, 
you're coming. You know who we are, that we're dying here, but if you're 
going to fight along side us, there's a few things I want you to know. 
This regiment was formed last summer, in May. There were 1,000 of us 
then. There are less than 300 of us now. All of us volunteered to fight 
for the Union, just as you did. Some came mainly because we were bored at 
home, thought this looked like it might be fun. Some came because we were 
ashamed not to. Many of us came because it was the right thing to do. All 
of us have seen men die. This is a different kind of army. If you look 
back through history, you will see men fighting for pay, for women, for 
some other kind of loot. They fight for land, power, because a king leads 
them, or just because they like killing. But we are here for something 
new. This has not happened much in the history of the world. We are an 
army out to set other men free. America should be free ground, all of it. 
Not divided by a line between slave states and free. All the way from 
here to the pacific ocean. No man has to bow, no man born to royalty. 
Here we judge you by what you do, not by who your father was. Here you 
can be something. Here is the place to build a home. But it's not the 
land. There's always more land. It's the idea that we all have value, you 
and me. What we're fighting for in the end, we're fighting for each 
other. Sorry. I didn't mean to preach. You go ahead, you talk for a 
while. If you -- if you choose to join us, you want your muskets back, 
you can have them. Nothing more will be said by anybody anywhere. If you 
choose not to join us, well, you can come along under guard, and when 
this is all over, I will do what I can to see you get a fair treatment, 
but for now, we're moving out. Gentlemen, I think if we lose this fight, 
we lose the war. So if you choose to join us, I'll be personally very 
grateful.
<P>
Now, a couple quick things, because we only have two minutes till we 
break. One, if you want to read the background of this, it's a book 
called "Killer Angels," which was a brilliant novel which was used by the 
Army War College and which I recommend to you as maybe the finest novel 
about the Civil War, not counting "Gone With the Wind," which was a 
totally different -- in terms of military novels. Second, Chamberlain 
himself is a real person, college professor, volunteers, the most 
decorated officer in the Union army, accepts Kee's sword at Antietam, is 
picked by Grant to accept Lee's sword, goes back to Maine, president of 
Bowden college, Governor of Maine, writes his memoirs very late in life, 
but is a classic American, as you can see. I mean, this is not a guy -- 
he's not a Prussian military expert. He's just a wonderful human being. 
<P>
Three last points: this is a romantic war. There's another scene in the 
movie which I commend to you to go rent in which a Confederate general 
just before Pickett's charge makes a very similar speech, and it's, I 
think, one of the reasons that the Civil War grabs us, is that both sides 
felt passionately that they were idealistically right in their 
interpretation. Also notice he's asking people to risk everything.  And I 
want you in that context, with what we're going to see later on and 
everything you've seen here, thinking about the veterans you saw back at 
Gettysburg -- when I gave my speech as Speaker, I quoted from "the Battle 
Hymn of the Republic" which, of course, was the song of the Union Army, 
of the Grant Army of the Potomac. "as he died to make men holy, let us 
live to make men free." And my point to all of you is: we're not asking 
you to go to Gettysburg. We're not going to ask you to invade Normandy. 
We're just asking you to live your life in a way that Chamberlain would 
have understood so that Lincoln's efforts to make sure that this 
government and this model and this system survives, in fact, work out. 
<P>
And that that's the whole point of this, is that if we would simply live 
in peace at 20% of what we risk in war, this would be an amazingly better 
country. So we have a quick break, and then we'll come back, all right?
<P>
Let me make two corrections. I got so involved between my emotional 
reaction to that particular passage by Chamberlain and the fact that we 
were running out of time. Somebody pointed out to me, of course he 
accepted Lee's sword at the courthouse at Appomattox. I said Antietam, 
which was obviously wrong. And second, the Union Army at large was called 
the Grand Army of the Republic. It was not the Army of the Potomac. The 
third, somebody mentioned to me who'd seen last year, and I'll take just 
a minute to tell you this -- Chamberlain leads his unit to Gettysburg. He 
is put at the far left the Union line and is, in fact, holding the 
position that the confederate army decides they will turn, their theory 
being that if they can come up around here they can outflank and force 
the entire Union army to roll back. He's at the top of little round top. 
And he's there with Confederate forces attacking up the hill. They fight 
for hours. Unit after unit attacks his unit. And this is all in the 
movie, it's a remarkably done in the movie. Finally his officers come to 
him and say: we're down to one or two cartridges per man. We are 
literally about to run out of ammunition and we have to pull back, and he 
says but if we pull back, we're going to unhinge the entire Union army. 
We can't pull back. And they say we don't have any choice. We're 
literally about to run out of ammunition. And he stops and he says, we're 
really tired. We've been up here. They've been attacking uphill all day. 
So I want you to think about this in terms of people who think they have 
problems. He says, therefore if we're about to run out of ammunition, fix 
bayonets. We will charge downhill. And they do. And they break the morale 
of the units that have been fighting uphill all day who're suddenly 
coming uphill one more time, you know, we're totally exhausted but maybe 
this time they'll break. They're suddenly faced with a very loud, a very 
noisy Union regiment charging downhill. You can go out and practice this. 
It's hard to go uphill. Go to Kennesaw mountain and try it for a little 
while. And it breaks their morale. They run, the battle at this point in 
time is ended and saved. The amazing irony is this unit is transferred in 
order to rest -- because it's been in terrible shape, lots of casualties 
-- they are transferred to here, which is where Pickett's charge occurs. 
They're not, by the way, the most badly damaged. The first Minnesota 
volunteers is the most badly shot up unit in the battle other than 
Pickett's Virginians. 
<P>
But I tell you that so you understand: he was asking these men to 
voluntarily go and then, as history would have it, they end up at the 
critical point, all but three of the men volunteered. They -- the reason 
they mutinied, by the way, is they thought they had signed two year 
papers and they thought they were legally being Americans -- you can all 
remember the fights you've had with your professors or fights you've had 
with somebody -- they were legally entitled to go home. It was legally 
time for them to leave and the army had said no, you can't leave. So they 
thought they were legally entitled to not be there and they volunteered, 
all but three of them, and made a huge difference in the survival. 
<P>
Now, we're going to go back and pick up a part of American exceptionalism 
which is among the most controversial, the pervasive sense of religion 
and God. And what we're going to suggest to you is, first of all, again 
this goes back to why to understand American Civilization, you have to 
start by understanding American history, that the religious and social 
tenets of Puritanism are diffused throughout American values today. And 
again I'm drawing largely on Ladd's work, but it's important to 
understand this: the Puritans had a very highly developed sophisticated 
understanding of their relationship to God. They attempted to live that 
out in this life. Many of their strongest beliefs, the work ethic, for 
example, are driven into us. We're the most moralistic society on the 
planet. Doesn't mean that we don't break down in our morality, but that 
we have a sense of morality and think of it as breaking down. And it's a 
very intense reform idealism that is at the core of American Civilization 
and in part goes back to the puritans, then was revived by the great 
revival of the 1730's, then was revived again by the Wesleyan movement, 
then was revived in the 19th century by the revivalist movement, and I 
would argue that in a sense what you are seeing happen now is a 
reemergence. 
<P>
I think it's no accident that the Pope's book has been a best seller. I 
think that there is a tremendous resurgence of interest among all kinds 
of religious groups, whether Jewish or Islamic or Christian, whether 
among Christians, whether it's Protestants or Catholic or Orthodox, you 
see a very deep reassertion which is not uncommon in American history. 
That what you get in American history is these sort of wave effects, 
where you'll have a tremendous upsurge of reform religious conviction and 
that will lead to a lot of changes that will gradually taper off, and 
then two generations later it will come back again and it almost always 
leads to a follow on wave of political and social reform. 
<P>
Now in that context, the fascinating thing about America is that the 
United States is both highly developed and religious. As a general rule 
in the modern world, the more industrialized you are, the fewer people go 
to church, the fewer people who say they believe in god, the fewer people 
who pray, that it's a great anomaly that in fact we are, by a huge 
margin, the most explicitly religious society of any industrial nation. 
We are the aberration, we're not the norm. 
<P>
Now Steven Carter wrote a book called "the Culture Of Disbelief" which 
shook up some people the other year because their presumption was that 
Carter, who is a black professor at an Ivy League school, clearly should 
not believe what I'm about to read to you. The subtitle of the book, "The 
Culture Of Disbelief - How American Law And Politics Trivialize Religious 
Devotion." Very important concept: "How American Law And Politics 
Trivialize Religious Devotion." And this is what he wrote in the 
introduction, page 4 of his book: "better than nine out of ten Americans 
believe in God. "and some four out of five pray regularly. "politically 
and culturally, however, for those who do pray regularly, indeed those 
who believe in God are encouraged to keep it a secret and often a 
shameful one at that. "aside from the ritual appeals to God that are 
expected of our politicians, for Americans to take their religion 
seriously, to treat them as ordained rather than chosen, is to risk 
assignment to the lunatic fringe. "yet religion matters to people. "it 
matters a lot. 'Surveys' indicate that Americans are far more likely to 
believe in God and to attend worship services regularly than any other 
people in the western world. "true, nobody prays in prime time television 
unless religion is a part of the plot, but strong majorities of citizens 
tell pollsters that their religious beliefs are of great importance to 
them in their daily lives. "even though popular history -- some popular 
history wrongly assert to the contrary. "the best evidence is that this 
deep religiosity has always been a facet of the American character and 
that it has grown consistently through the nation's history and today, to 
the frustration of many opinion leaders in both the legal and political 
cultures, religion as a moral force and perhaps a political one too was 
surging. "unfortunately, in our public life, we prefer to pretend that it 
is not." 
<P>
Now take that as background from Steven Carter who is a widely respected 
professor, and it led to a lot of argument when his book came out. What 
you're now going to hear is Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his radio 
address to the nation on the day we invaded Europe. Let me set the stage 
for a minute: we're engaged in the third of our great conflicts for 
survival. The first was the American Revolution, the second was the Civil 
War. We believed that evil was on the march, and we believed that we had 
to defeat Nazi Germany. To do that, we had to launch an invasion of 
Europe which was the most complicated, single activity ever undertaken by 
human beings. Landing at Normandy successfully is more complex than 
anything else we've ever done. It was an enormous risk. The American 
people were worried. After all, their children were at stake. There were 
hundreds of thousands of lives involved. It was the great gamble, and we 
knew it was the great gamble. It is in this context that they turned on 
the radio to listen to the president of the United States. Now, given 
modern elite cultures, given the modern cynicism, given the modern 
anti-religious biases, just listen to this speech and ask yourself, would 
it be conceivable that a president of the United States could do what 
Roosevelt does in this speech?
<P>
Announcer: ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.  
>>President Roosevelt: my fellow Americans, last night when I spoke with 
you about the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that troops of the 
United States and our allies were crossing the channel in another and 
greater operation. It has come to pass with success thus far. And so in 
this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in prayer: almighty God, 
our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, 
a struggle to preserve our public, our religion, and our civilization and 
to set free a suffering humanity. Lead them straight and true, give 
strength to their arms, starkness to their hearts, steadfastness in their 
faith. They will need thy blessings. Their road will be long and hard. 
For the enemy is strong, he may hurl back our forces. Success may not 
come with rushing speed, but we shall return again and again, and we know 
that by thy grace, and by the righteousness of our cause, our sons will 
triumph. They will be so tried by night and by day without rest until the 
victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise and flame. Men's souls 
will be shaken with the violences of war. For these men are lately drawn 
from the ways of peace. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They 
fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice 
arise, and tolerance, and good will among all thy people. They yearn but 
for the end of battle, for their return to the haven of home. Some will 
never return. Embrace these, father, and receive them thy heroic servants 
into thy kingdom. And for us at home, fathers, mothers, children, wives, 
sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts and prayers 
are ever with them, help us, almighty God, to rededicate ourselves in 
renewed faith in thee, in this hour of great sacrifice. Many people have 
urged that I call the nation into a single day of special prayer, but 
because the road is long and the desire is great, I ask that our people 
devote themselves in a continuance of prayer as we rise to each new day 
and again when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips 
invoking thy help to our efforts. Give us strength to strengthen our 
daily tasks, to redouble the contributions we make in the physical and 
the material support of our armed forces, and let our hearts be stout, to 
wait out the long travail, to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our 
courage unto our sons wheresoever they may be. And, oh, lord, give us 
faith, faith in thee, faith in our sons, faith in each other, faith in 
our united crusade. Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dull. Let 
not the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters are but fleeting 
moments, let not these deter us in our uncomparable purpose. With thy 
blessing we shall prevail over the unholy forces of our enemy. Help us to 
conquer the apostles of greed and racial arrogances. Lead us to the 
saving of our country and with our sister nations into a world unity that 
will spell a sure peace, a peace invulnerable to the schemings of 
unworthy men, and a peace that will let all men live in freedom, reaping 
the just rewards of their honest toil. Thy will be done, almighty God. Amen.
<P>
Can you imagine yourself sitting at home listening to a radio? You can. 
How about the rest of you, what's your reaction to that? 
<P>
>> you don't hear Presidents pray anymore, not openly. We used the 
footage for two reasons. One is, we originally thought about just using a 
radio. You literally are so trained to see things, if we had just shown 
you 8 and a half minutes of a radio sitting there, we would have lost 
most of the audience, because people can't -- don't focus that way. 
That's not how they think. We also want to remind you, this is what was 
going on while he was speaking and everybody knew it. I mean, everybody 
understood that literally as he spoke, their brother or their father or 
their son was in risk of being killed. You can't imagine the intensity of 
the emotion of it all. And I talked with Sam Gibbens and Bob Dole and Bob 
Michael and other people who have fought in the European theater, you 
know there is a sense about -- you know, talking about George Bush being 
shot down in the Pacific and picked up, he crashed two airplanes, one was 
shot down, the other had mechanical -- and both times he just went back 
and flew the next airplane. And it's hard to imagine for us, because in 
one way it is vivid on our TV screens, it also deadens us. It 
desensitizes us. And, as you said, can you quite imagine what the 
reaction would be? Go ahead. 
<P>
>> the country with only one medium like that, and you are sitting in 
front of the radio and you know that almost everybody else in the entire 
country with electricity is doing the same thing. 
<P>
>> although probably if you had an event this size and it was on TV 
everybody would be tuned to TV. 
<P>
>> was anybody questioning his motivation? I mean, was this just a 
President who, he had been put through the ravages of war and he's 
turning to God, and if that was the case, then I ask where was he when 
the percentages agreement was being signed? He was back here campaigning. 
<P>
>> now you are acting like a modern American. There's nobody in that 
period who would have said -- if FDR. was somewhere in this box, we are 
at war, our children are being risked, our young men may die, this is the 
big crisis, the President comes on and prays, nobody in that period, that 
day, would have gotten down here or up here and said, oh, gee -- example, 
Tom Dewey is running against him for the Presidency. I mean, how do you 
run against a guy who goes on national radio and gives you an 8 and a 
half minute prayer uniting us as a country? But Tom Dewey would not have 
said, "this is a political gimmick." It would have been inconceivable. 
This was the great crisis of the Western World. Nobody would have said, 
"how dare the President pray in public like that." Because he was within 
the framework of the culture and the culture would have said, "what else 
should you do?" I mean, how could you not have a national prayer at a 
moment like this? 
<P>
>> what about George bush, because he asked for a day of prayer when we 
invaded Kuwait. 
<P>
>> let's think about it. He didn't ask for a day of prayer. He, first of 
all, led the entire nation for 8 and a half minutes. Then he said, I want 
you to pray when you get up and I want you to pray when you go to bed 
every day for the rest of the war. I'm just saying, look at the 
difference between that and where this would be -- if this is the 
cultural bounds of his era, then in terms of the discontinuity we're just 
coming out of, he would have been up here. It would have been weird, 
abnormal behavior. Yeah, that's right. I mean, he would have been closer 
to Buchanan than he would have been to the elite vision of reasonable 
behavior. Or for that matter closer to Farrakhan. Maybe closer to Jesse 
Jackson. But he would have been behaving in a way that was outside the 
current elite norms. And I wanted you to see, I wanted you to see that 
contextual framework to understand that for most of American history what 
he did was normal. That it's only starting around 1965 that this all 
begins to really breakdown in a serious kind of way and begins to change 
what are the elite norms. 
<P>
But it's much more -- let me also say, because I just can't -- notice the 
parallel between his explanation of why we fight and Chamberlain's? 
Notice the idealism in his prayer, we don't come to conquer, this is a 
crusade. Eisenhower's book is entitled "crusade in Europe." We saw 
ourselves as liberators, not conquerors. 
<P>
But in addition, I just want to take one second and thank Kathleen Minnix 
and bob head here at Reinhardt and John McDowell who's here from 
"Renewing American Civilization" and Jeff Eisenach from the progress and 
freedom foundation. We decided about ten o'clock last night that we were 
going to use this 8 and a half minutes, and they found the video, matched 
it all up, and got it to work between ten o'clock last night -- again 
it's an example of modern technology, and also the fact we have a great, 
great team that are making this all work. I just have to thank them 
because that was an extraordinary request to suddenly show up at ten 
o'clock at night and say, hey, tomorrow morning we'd like this to work. 
<P>
Let's talk about some other characteristics of American exceptionalism. 
Americans believe that opportunity is generally available to all citizens 
and as a result support of a private- property-based economy remains 
strong. I mean, most Americans believe that most Americans have access to 
opportunity and that, in fact, private property is the best way to have 
opportunity and that free enterprise works. That's a very deep cultural 
belief. Americans declare themselves prepared to countenance very 
substantial economic inequalities, while insisting on the importance of 
the ideal of equal opportunity. That is Ladd's language. But what he is 
saying here is very straightforward: Americans are prepared to accept 
winners and losers economically. Americans are prepared to accept the 
idea you can be a millionaire or you can go bankrupt. Americans are 
prepared to accept the idea that nobody's guaranteed being massively 
successful, but Americans are determined to find a way for everybody to 
get to the starting line. There's a huge difference between equality of 
opportunity, which virtually all Americans passionately believe in, and a 
quality of results which remarkably few Americans believe in. 
<P>
And it's interesting -- here's one of the places where I think elite is 
way out of touch with most Americans, because I think the vast majority 
of Americans think the idea that we should somehow "norm" things so that 
either for racial or other characteristics, you should somehow have 
advantages you don't have. It goes against the core of the grain. You'll 
see us talk about this more of this next week when we get to personal 
responsibility. Overwhelming numbers of Americans believe we should find 
ways to help people get to the starting line, but once the starting line 
starts, everyone should have to actually run the race. Nobody gets to 
start 15 yards ahead. Now that means you got to find ways to help 
everybody get to the starting line and that's hard. American policy of 
social welfare reflects national insistence on a large measure of 
individual rather than governmental responsibility. Getting very 
specific: in other words, you are responsible for your fate, the 
government is not responsible for your fate. It is a direct repudiation 
of the concept of entitlements. 
<P>
Southern blacks, when asked two years ago, "do you believe work should be 
required of welfare recipients including mothers with small children"? 
Answered -- this is in 11 states -- answered 82% yes, 11% no. It's a deep 
underlying cultural emphasis on work and on your responsibility to 
improve yourself. Much deeper than the elite structure and the government 
structure. In a sense America is about freedom and I think it's best 
captured by the Declaration of Independence: we are endowed by our 
creator with certain unalienable rights: among those are life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness. Notice that the creator comes back in. It's 
at the core, the sense that your powers come from god, they don't come 
from the government. God gives you rights which are unalienable. The 
government can usurp those rights. It can violate those rights. It can 
strip them from you by force, but it has no moral standings for your 
rights. Rights go from you to the government. They do not go from the 
government to you. 
<P>
And then notice the words: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
It's an active open sense of who we are. There's no sense of happiness 
stamps, happiness entitlements, the federal department of happiness. 
Sounds good. Think about it for a while. It is a very profound point of 
how the Founding Fathers saw life. Let me go back, because I want to set 
the stage again. We are using two events as the core examples of American 
Exceptionalism: the civil war in the first hour and D-Day in the second 
hour. You've heard the President's prayer. I want you to see the 
preparations leading up to the day he was praying.
<P>
Announcer: the fateful hours that lie beyond the darkness ahead belong to 
them to do with as they can while the world waits in wonder and hope. 
They may not see themselves as the sword bearers of a crusade, but they 
know well enough what depends on their effort and the ultimate 
preparation is for each man to make himself. One man must make the 
decision, general Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander. He makes it. 
The invasion will go as scheduled on the 6th. The men who will actually 
be the first into France are still back on English soil. Paratroopers of 
the U. S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th Airborne 
Division are to jump behind enemy lines to secure the flanks of the 
invasion area. On the eve of the invasion the Supreme Commander visits 
some of them. "I found them in fine fettle," general Eisenhower is to 
write later, admonishing me that I had nothing to worry about.
<P>
I am going to read you Eisenhower's message. Let me say I regard 
Eisenhower along with George Marshall and Franklin Roosevelt as one of 
the three greatest Americans of the 20th century. In some ways Ike is 
most unique. I keep a picture of him standing in front of a -- it's -- 
we're borrowing the painting, but it's a picture of a painting of him 
standing in front of a picture of Omaha beach, and I keep it for a lot of 
reasons. Here's a Kansas farm boy who gets to go to West Point almost by 
accident, graduates, does all right, rises in the system, and suddenly 
finds himself faced with the decision: do I launch all of the allied 
forces at Normandy or not? Sits on the end of a couch at five o'clock in 
the morning, they've already canceled it once, all the ships are out 
there, everybody is out there, they've got to go or no-go. They've 
canceled it for one day. The weatherman comes in, they practiced it for 
months, the weatherman comes in and says you have a three-day window. If 
you land in these three days, you have three days of good weather before 
another storm hits. He sits on the end of the couch, looks up and says 
"go." 
<P>
Two things: one, a month later when they would have tried to land, the 
worst storm -- the worst summer storm in 40 years hits the beaches, 
actually destroys one of the beaches. Two, he carries in his pocket, and 
you've seen pictures of him talking to the paratroopers, he carries in 
his pocket for two days a message saying that the landing has failed, and 
that despite the best efforts, we've been thrown off with tremendous 
casualties and that the responsibility is his. Now the idea you can take 
a Kansas farm boy, train him well enough that he can launch the largest 
most complex operation in history, and that he has the moral 
responsibility to bear that weight, and then later in life of course 
becomes the President of Columbia university and President of the united 
states, I think it's a remarkable story and well worth studying. 
<P>
Here is what was read to every unit, because back then because they 
didn't have -- this was all secret -- they literally would gather 
everybody on the ship together and they would read them this just before 
landing. This was Eisenhower's message: "you are about to embark upon the 
great crusade toward which we have striven these many months. "the eyes 
of the world are upon you. "the hopes and the prayers of liberty-loving 
people everywhere march with you. "in company with our brave allies and 
brothers in arms in other fronts will bring about the destruction of the 
German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed people 
of Europe, and security for ourselves in the free world. "I have full 
confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. "we 
will accept nothing less than full victory. "good luck and let all of us 
beseech the blessing of almighty God upon this great and noble 
undertaking. "before embarking on this operation, I have a personal 
message for you as to your own individual responsibility in relation to 
the inhabitants of our allied countries. "as a representative of this 
country, you'll be welcomed with deep gratitude by the liberated people, 
who for years have longed for this deliverance. "it is of the utmost 
importance that this feeling of friendliness and good will be in no way 
impaired by careless or indifferent behavior on your own part. "by a 
courteous and considerate demeanor, you can, on the other hand, do much 
to strengthen that feeling. "the rights of individuals as to their 
persons and property must be scrupulously respected as though in your own 
country. "you must remember always that these people are our friends and 
allies. "I urge each of you to bear constantly in mind, that by your 
actions, not only you as an individual, but your country as well will be 
judged. "by establishing a relationship with the liberated people based 
on mutual understanding and respect, we shall enlist their whole-hearted 
assistance in the defeat of our common enemy. "thus shall we lay the 
foundations for an everlasting peace without which our great effort will 
have been in vain." 
<P>
Now imagine you are soldier, you have been trained, you are about to risk 
getting killed, you are going into France. Your last instruction from 
your commander is to treat the as you would treat your own relatives, and 
this is the part of the basis of NATO and the whole modern world. Now in 
that context, again in the language of the time and the way they saw it, 
let's look for a minute at what actually happened.
<P>
Announcer: but for every man there the new world of Normandy is a world 
of private agony and chaos and no man can see the broad design beyond it. 
On a scale so epic that words written long ago by William Shakespeare 
could have been composed for the 6th of June 1944: "he that outlives this 
day and comes safe home will stand to tiptoe when this day is named." 
Three hours after the invasion begins, it is clear that the allies have 
their foothold however precarious. The news comes to America on this June 
day of 1944, bringing a swell of hope and pride and anxiety, too. For 
great victories in war must always be fought dearly. And the price paid 
this day for the allied hold on the beaches of Normandy is not cheap. But 
although the cost is steep, the results are incalculable to the plan of 
battle. The beachhead soon expands from foothold to lodgement. Men and 
weapons and equipment pour ashore. Within 12 days, almost 600,000 men and 
90,000 vehicles are on the beaches, masked for the drive inland. Many men 
yet will fall. Many reverses will be suffered. Many triumphs recorded. 
(artillery gunfire) but in the main, the progress of battle will follow 
the bold plan conceived in allied councils and brought to flaming life by 
the men who stormed the Normandy beaches on the day which will forever be 
known as D-Day, who unlocked the gates of fortress Europe so that a 
monstrous evil could be pursued and destroyed.
<P>
Again, just as with the Civil War, I think you have to see these things 
in context. Now that's part of why I advocate history, because when you 
see what was at risk, how hard it was, how many people were killed or 
hurt, then you see, and I think you hear in the Roosevelt speech, you 
begin to sense the fullness of what was going on and that's part of why I 
recommend that you look at it. Now, I also want to emphasize, while we 
used two wars to communicate part of this, that's because they are the 
most intense point of decision. Had we lost those two wars, we'd live in 
a different world.
<P>
And people need to understand this. It's not like you want to be 
war-like, although Washington said if you want peace, prepare for war. 
You want to be so strong, you don't need to do this, you want to be so 
capable that nobody challenges your capacity, but if you're challenged, 
you literally do at times face situations where you win or die. The New 
Hampshire state slogan is "live free or die." It's not "live free or 
complain," or "live free or whine." And I don't say that so people run 
around saying can I enlist tomorrow morning. I say that to say to you 
when you then measure what you are asked to do in peace time, and when 
you measure what we're requesting of Americans in peace time, it is 
trivial compared to what we've asked in order to be who we are and that 
our generation has to be prepared in peace to give at least some small 
measure of what they gave in war. Or it doesn't work. You can't have 
freedom on the cheap. You can't have freedom without courage, and as 
we'll discuss next week you can't have freedom without personal 
responsibility. Now in that context, the spirit is still potentially 
there. 
<P>
Let me -- one of the speeches which overwhelmed me was sitting -- I was 
just in my sophomore year in congress, rather my -- excuse me, my 
sophomore term, and I was sitting for my first inaugural as a member of 
congress, and this is from Reagan's first inaugural. In terms of American 
Exceptionalism, Everett Carl Ladd's comment, listen to this part of the 
inaugural in the context of American Exceptionalists. This is 1981, 
January. "we have every right to dream heroic dreams. "those who say 
we're in a time when they're no heroes, just don't know where to look. 
"you can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates. "others, 
a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the 
world beyond. "you meet heroes across a counter and they're on both sides 
of the counter. "there are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and 
faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth, and opportunity. "there 
are individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose 
voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art and education. 
"their patriotism is quiet but deep. "their values sustain our national 
life. "I have used the words 'they' and 'their' when speaking of these 
heroes, I could say 'you' and 'yours' because I'm addressing those heroes 
of whom I speak, you the citizens of this blessed land. "your dreams, 
your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes and the 
goals of this administration, so help me god. "we shall reflect the 
compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. "how can we love our 
country and not love our countrymen and loving them reach out a hand when 
they fall, heal them when they are sick, and provide opportunities to 
make them self-sufficient so they'll be equal in fact and not just in 
theory. "beyond these monuments to heroism is the Potomac river and on 
the far shore of the sloping hills of Arlington national cemetery with 
its row and row of simple white markers bearing crosses or stars of 
David. "they add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been 
paid for our freedom. "each one of these markers is a monument to the 
kinds of hero that I spoke of earlier. "their lives ended in places 
called Belleau wood, the argon, Omaha beach, Solerno and half way around 
the world in Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop hill, the chosen reservoir, 
and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles in a place called Vietnam. 
"under one such marker lies a young man, Martin Treptow who left his job 
in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with the famed 
rainbow division. "there, on the western front, he was killed trying to 
carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire. "we are 
told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf, under the 
heading 'my pledge,' he had written these words: quote, America must win 
this war. Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will 
endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost as if the issue of the 
whole struggle depended on me alone, close quote. "this crisis that we're 
facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that martin 
Treptow and so many thousands of others are called upon to make. "it does 
require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in 
ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds. "to 
believe that together with god's help we can and will resolve the 
problems which now confront us. "and after all, why shouldn't we believe 
that? "we are Americans. "God bless you and thank you." 

Now, a couple quick things, very same sense of exceptionalism. Very same 
sense of god's intervention, very same sense of freedom, very same sense 
of sacrifice and a commentary on the modern world. Some in the press 
found one fact about this more important than the idealism, the 
patriotism, the courage or the sacrifice. Reagan said, quote, under one 
such marker, close quote. Martin Treptow was buried in Wisconsin. He was 
not buried at Arlington cemetery. Which became proof that Reagan didn't 
have his facts right. It's worth your reading in Mike Deaver's memoirs. 
It's just a very interesting minor point and, in fact, Reagan knew that. 
But he consciously wanted to build the emotional bond, and while he 
technically covered himself, you can go back and pull it out, that became 
a story. Just an interesting aside on the current culture. 
<P>
Now, this -- and this is part of what makes this course I think different 
than it might have been 30 years ago, this course is not about a 
celebration of the fact that we're neat, that this is the best 
civilization in history, and that everything's fine. This course is an 
argument that we have to reassert and renew American Exceptionalism, that 
it is a struggle for our generation, that our Gettysburg and our Normandy 
may be inside us as a people and may be inside our own country and does 
not require warfare, but requires as much discipline, as much focus, as 
much courage as warfare, and that in order for us to reassert and renew 
American Civilization, that we have a big job to do. Nobody has said that 
better, nobody has explained that the challenge of American 
exceptionalism is not yet completed better than something you are going 
to see in just a minute and it's particularly appropriate on this weekend 
to see this. But the fact is, what I'm trying to wrestle with 
intellectually is that every American has a right to be American, that to 
be American is to have access to opportunity, to safety, to the chance to 
start at the starting line, to pursue happiness at levels that all of us 
know in our heart are not currently available to every American. And so 
there's an enormous job to do. And on the weekend when we celebrate his 
birthday nothing could be more appropriate as a way of refocusing of that 
job than to listen to what may be the single greatest passage of martin 
Luther king, jr.'s career in which he talks about the America that we 
could be.
<P>
Dr. King: we must conduct our struggle on the high plain of dignity and 
discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into 
physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights 
of meeting physical force with soul force, the marvelous new militancy 
which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of 
all white people, for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their 
presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is our 
destiny. (cheering and applause) so even though we face the difficulties 
of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted 
in the American dream. I have a dream that one day, this nation will rise 
up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "we hold these truths to 
be self-evident, that all men are created equal." I have a dream that one 
day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and sons of former 
slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of 
brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a 
state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of 
oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I 
have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation 
where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the 
content of their character. I have a dream today.
<P>
Notice the moral force, notice the use of the Declaration of 
Independence. Remember, I talked about that you have to be immersed in 
your own history. If you don't know that that is a shot of Lincoln, and 
you don't know who Lincoln is, where Lincoln relates back to the rest of 
this, it makes no sense. If you don't understand -- if I said to you some 
day remember Freedom Summer, which is actually a summer of civil rights 
activism in Mississippi, if you don't know anything about the context of 
what he just said, you can't quite understand where the Freedom Summer 
ride -- where it came from or how it started. You've got to put in -- and 
remember also the moral force of what he says, one of the points we're 
going to come to next week is using Shelby Steele's book, "the Content of 
Our Character" which comes directly out of this speech: "the world in 
which my children will be judged not by the color of their skin but by 
the content of their character," what does that mean? And how do we live 
it out? And how do we recognize that for everything, everyone, and this 
is particularly poignant for the baby Boomers -- for every idealistic 
hope we had in 1963, that the end of segregation would be the end of 
misery. What do we now have to do to reinvest ourselves, to reassert 
ourselves, to regain idealism, to come back and say, all right, Dr. King 
was right, we got a part of the way there, we ended segregation but we 
haven't solved it. Now what do we have to do in our generation? And 
that's part of what we'll be picking up with next week.
<P>
But let me carry you back again, at the vision level, America is 
exceptional in and its history teaches us how exceptional. That's the 
core message of this course in terms of this particular two hours. There 
are strategies for understanding it. Teaching American history is one. 
Every child should know it. Learning to find solutions in American 
history is another. Refocusing on the symbols and the reminders, and then 
studying successes. One of the great differences between the modern era 
and classic America is for that the last 30 years we've been fascinated 
by pathologists, and the last place left in American news media where we 
focus on success is the sports page. And sometime, as an experiment, read 
the sports page for three days and then read the rest of the paper. I 
mean, if the sports page resembled the rest of the paper, the worst coach 
in America would be the lead story. Victimization among football coaches, 
you know. The guy who recruited worst would be there talking about the 
psychological trauma of failing. Instead, the sports page is the last 
stand of classic American news. What's working, who's exciting, who's 
successful, what's worth learning? Totally different way of thinking 
about it. Among the projects I think the people that are worth looking 
at, how did people learn American Civilization in the past? Look at the 
McGuffey reader sometime and then look at the path that is used in 
schools today. How were the poor helped in the past? And there Marvin 
Olasky's book is fabulous. What American policies created rapid economic 
growth? And there were periods when we grew very fast. What incentives 
and controls have worked and what has failed in the past? 
<P>
We've been a very successful culture at shaping behavior. We've almost 
never done it successfully through bureaucracy. We've done it by shaping 
the incentives and the symbols, the way we reward people psychologically 
and financially, and we've had enormous impact doing that. Then on a 
tactical level when faced with a problem or opportunity or when beginning 
to plan, ask: how have others done the same thing? And as soon as you 
know what you want to do, if you ask yourself that question and you go 
study it, you will literally save years of time. Now, when you think you 
know what you're doing, remember to go back and practice: listen, learn, 
help and lead. And when you think you know what you're doing, go listen 
to everybody else for a while and see if it makes as much sense to them 
as it did to you. Okay. Now, remember I talked to you last week about 
your rules for immigrants? Somebody arrives in America, they walk up to 
you and say, so what should I do? 
<P>
We did have somebody who in fact -- this is interesting -- we had a 
letter or fax, I guess, from Scott angel over in Tallapoosa who's married 
to an immigrant. They each sent their set of rules over to us. He said -- 
this is his five rules: one, learn to speak English. Two, learn to drive 
and get a car. Three, learn the civil and criminal law that may apply to 
you and your family and abide by them. Four, societal standing in local 
communities still depend on your adherence to the work ethic, learn it 
and live it. Five, there is actually no free lunch. Every benefit offered 
by every program by any organization, be it government or private, 
requires that you relinquish part of the freedom and privacy which is the 
only true benefit of American civilization. Then this is what his wife 
said: the five rules I would like to tell an immigrant would be thus: if 
I am a self-sufficient, hard-working, honorable citizen I would advise, 
one, learn the language of the land. This will encompass reading, writing 
and speaking. Two, reading for the importance of being able to read an ad 
in the newspaper to find jobs. Being able to read and interpret symbols 
and signs in streets to navigate around a big or small city. Writing for 
the importance of being able to fill out job applications. Speaking for 
the importance of being able to communicate what skills you have to offer 
to a prospective employer. Two -- again this is his wife, the immigrant, 
who's writing this. Two, depending on the area and the availability of 
mass transportation, learn to drive a car. This is important because we 
are a car-driven society whether we need it or not. This is one of many 
expressions of privacy that we as Americans treasure, that is, to enjoy 
going places without the hassle of being stuck with strangers in a moving 
vehicle. This also gives us the feeling of self-security and control and 
that our fate is in our hands. Three, learn the economic system of the 
country. For example, learn how banks and lending institutions operate 
and how you can use them to your advantage without appearing naive and 
felt you were taken advantage of when payments for principal and interest 
are due. Learn not to be taken in with advertisements that seem all are 
free. Simple rule to remember is nothing is absolutely free. Four, learn 
what limitations and freedoms you can do with your native culture you are 
bringing in with you. Respect the prevailing customs here as you expect 
them to respect yours. Five, last, if desperate, know where you can get 
emergency help. She then wrote five nasty rules which is what she says 
the professionals teach that I'm not going to spend time on that are all 
destructive. 
<P>
Okay. Now, what were yours? We have a couple minutes real quickly. Who 
has some rules - what would you teach 
<P>
>>student: I had read the Constitution and the Declaration of 
Independence. >> student: I said ask questions of elected officials and 
hold them accountable.  >> okay.  >> student: learn the history of the 
United States. >> learn the history. What else? At a practical level what 
would you do?  >>don't watch the evening news.  >> don't watch the news.  
>> student: but these are the first five things.  >> what are the first 
five things? I walk up. I can barely speak English. I just arrived in 
America, what are the first five the things I should do?  >> student: you 
know I changed mine, too. I threw religion in. I went back and changed 
mine and I threw religion in and I did because so much of what we have 
done and where we have come from is based on the belief that there is a 
god. A copy of the Ten Commandments hangs in the Supreme Ccourt.  >> so 
do they learn your religion or what?  >> I'm not talking about religious 
doctrine, I'm talking the stories.  >> faith, the belief.  >> the 
history.  >> you said you did too.  >>find out their affiliation.  >> so 
one of the things they should do as an immigrant is go to a place they -- 
that believes in what they believe in. Yes, sir.  >> be outgoing and 
don't isolate yourself.  >> okay. The Americans are to an amazing degree, 
sociable. Yes.  >> student: I said build up a network, in that I included 
religion; find out what other people from their country are doing, 
whether or not there is a civic group that they're involved with, where 
they might be worshipping and that sort of thing. I think to connect 
themselves with a network of like people -- and then learn from them 
would be an ideal first thing to do. >> okay. One last one. Yes, ma'am.  
>> student: learn about the money and monetary units here because 
everything is almost always driven by money. Quite a few things are, so 
-- >> student: one modification of speaking English. Learn to speak 
English on the telephone.
<P>
I am told we're about to run out of time, so let me just say next week's 
topic will be pillar two: personal strength. It's going to come right 
back to these ideas, the key pillar of American Civilization and we're 
going to use Drucker's "Effective Executive." I think this is the key as 
to how America operates is the concept of personal strength. And we're 
going to look at the next week, the reading assignment is to read "the 
effective executive" which is available on paperback -- I will say it to 
anybody who's watching us on TV -- and to look at chapter 8, read chapter 
8 of "building a community of citizens."

Renewing American Civilization<br>
Reinhardt college<br>
Class three<br>
"pillar two: personal strength, the key pillar of American Civilization 
and Drucker's Effective Executive" January 21, 1995 <br>
<P>
The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt college 
television, in Waleska, Georgia. From Reinhardt college in Waleska, 
Georgia, this is Renewing American Civilization. In this, the third of 10 
class presentations, congressman newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at 
Reinhardt college, will continue his course, which presents the 
foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American 
Civilization. This week's lesson, pillar two, personal strength, focuses 
on personal strength as the key pillar of American Civilization and peter 
Drucker's "the Effective Executive" as a guide to empowering citizens in 
the third wave information age.
<P>
Let me first of all welcome everybody who's here this morning, and also I 
want to welcome the students of Mind Extension University available all 
over the country, and I understand that there are a growing number of 
cable systems who are just picking us up randomly. In fact, I think we 
start in Washington, DC., On cable on Saturday. And I want to remind you 
you can mail your comments to: Renewing American Civilization, PO. Box 
6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065. Or if you're more excited, you can fax 
your comments to 404-528-9806. And if you are on the cutting edge, you 
can either e-mail your comments to America Online at renewam@aol.com, or 
you can get involved with the class transcripts and other class materials 
which are available on our Internet web page http.//www.pff.org. And any 
of you who got all that, good luck. But it gives you a framework. You can 
also order "American Civilization" newspaper, video, and audio tapes and 
course readings by calling 1-800-to-renew, which is the easiest of all 
the instructions. So anybody who gets confused with all that other stuff, 
you can call 1-800-to-renew. Now, the course here at Reinhardt focuses on 
the five pillars of American Civilization, which are the historic lessons 
of American Civilization: personal strength, entrepreneurial free 
enterprise, the spirit of invention and discovery, and quality as defined 
by Deming. Each of those will take two hours, and we're dealing with 
building sort of a framework in which to think about American 
Civilization. Then we're going to apply the four -these five pillars to 
four areas towards the end of the quarter. First, to the concept of the 
third wave and American Civilization. Second, to creating American jobs 
in the world economy. Third, to replacing the culture of violence and 
poverty with a culture of productivity and safety. And, fourth, how will 
citizenship and community in the 21st century America, how will it 
operate? And our goal in these last four sessions will be to take the 
five ideas inherent in the five pillars, and then to apply them in a 
problem-solving mode so that people can actually deal with and begin to 
see how you take the five pillars and apply them to a specific topic or a 
specific idea that is central to American Civilization. 
<P>
Now, today's topic is personal strength, which I believe is the keystone 
of everything else. That is, as we'll go through it in a little bit, if 
you can't come to grips with the requirement for personal strength, I 
think you really can't deal with the requirements of a free society. In 
order to talk about personal strength, though, remember we talked about a 
analytical planning model of vision, strategies, projects, and tactics. 
So we're going to lay out: what is our vision of personal strength, what 
are strategies to get personal strength, what are some projects that 
would implement those strategies, and then tactically, every day, what do 
you do? 
<P>
Now, I'm also going to draw a contrast between the vision of personal 
strength that grows out of American Civilization and what has happened in 
the last 35 years. Remember I made the point last week that you have from 
1607 at Jamestown and 16 -- 1920 in New England, you have, up until about 
1965, a continuum. We played Franklin Delano Roosevelt's radio address to 
the nation on D-Day where he prayed for eight and a half minutes with the 
American people in a way that you couldn't imagine in the modern age, 
because my argument, essentially, intellectually is that between 1965 and 
1994, there is a discontinuity, to use Alvin Toffler's -- I mean, to use 
peter Drucker's phrase, and that this discontinuity was an effort by a 
series of elite groups for a variety of reasons to replace American 
Civilization with an alternative model, which today is the multicultural 
political correctness left-wing sort of vision of reality.  And that this 
was a very serious -- it was not a conspiracy. It is a general attitude 
by a wide range of people that this civilization was bad and that it had 
to be replaced.
<P>
Now, what we're going to lay out here in part is that the model that grew 
up out of that, which is the model that you are surrounded by, has 
certain inherent values. I'm going to lay out what American 
Civilization's definition of personal strength is and contrast it with 
this discontinuity's alternative model, and then what we are doing here, 
in a sense, is we're talking about reasserting and renewing. And frankly, 
it's been in the course of teaching this three times that I began to 
realize that we are reasserting American Civilization as well as moving 
to renew it. 
<P>
Let me give you an example. At the vision level, we would argue, I think, 
in American Civilization that personal strength is vital. Whereas, the 
elite alternative would argue that most people are victims needing help. 
Now, if you were trying to teach this and we had an entire course just on 
this topic, you could take a week's newspapers, you could probably take 
this morning's newspaper, and you could go through and say: now, what 
happens?
<P>
When we run into a problem, do we say, "boy, you'd really better draw on 
your personal strength"? Or do we say that sadly -- remember the twinkies 
defense? The guy who killed the, I think it was -wasn't he -- didn't he 
kill the city council member in San Francisco? And his defense was he'd 
eaten too many twinkies, and therefore he was biologically unbalanced. 
This is not a joke. Or the Menendez brothers. They were so afraid of 
their parents that their only legitimate response was to kill their 
parents. I mean, don't ground your kids, they may kill you, because after 
all, look how you've scared them. I mean, think about the defenses that 
will be concocted on a regular basis in America today.  And then think 
about this text: is the key to your future personal strength, or is the 
key to your future recognizing your victimization, banding together with 
other victims and forcing somebody else, who must have personal strength, 
since you're now going to force them to take care of you? 
<P>
And William Raspberry wrote a column this week where he said he saw a 
documentary which said -- in which somebody said in the late 1960s, "I do 
not need to work. You need to give me money. And unless you give me 
enough money, you will not have -you will not have, you know, fairly 
compensated me for my victimization. Now, let me give you a second 
example. If personal strength is vital, American Civilization would argue 
that there are internal habits of strength to focus on. Whereas, the 
victimization theory would argue you need external compensation for 
weakness. Now, this may look like this is simple. This is at the core of 
what we're going to talk about. It's also at the core of a book you're 
going to hear me talk more and more about, which is Marvin Olasky's "the 
Tragedy of American Compassion," which I believe is one of the most 
important books written in the last 30 years.  Olasky's argument is that 
to help the poor, you have to have a transformational experience which 
strengthens their internal habits of strength. 
<P>
Whereas, the modern welfare state basically says to you: tell us what 
kind of a victim you are, and we'll tell you how big a check you get. 
Another example: in the American Civilization model, we study winners. In 
the elite culture model, we focus on losers. I'll give you -- again, if 
you wanted to have -- like, for a school room, if you were teaching the 
course and had the time to do it, go look at the sports page for any four 
days and then go look at the front page. Look at the extraordinary 
culture difference. Sports pages are about winning. Interview with the 
best coach, interview with the most successful player, interview with the 
Heisman trophy winner. What does it take to be a winner? You know, if the 
sports page was like the front page, interview with the worst coach in 
America. The trauma of never winning. The psychological sense of 
loneliness of the long-time -- of the long-time loser. The victimization 
of the weakest team in the league. I mean, literally take the two sets of 
articles, put them up side by side, and look at the code words and the 
analytical framework. The front page is about losing, and the focus is on 
victims. The sports page is about winning, and the focus is on success. 
And it's a radical difference. Now, the only difference -- the other 
difference, of course, is that the sports page is also about hometown 
teams, so you're loyal to them no matter what you're doing, but then it's 
the loyalty that's the reward. 
<P>
These are our guys or these are our girls, these are -these folks are out 
there, you know. Who cares, as long as it's our hometown high school 
team? We're rooting for them no matter. But that's good, too, because it 
teaches a different set of strengths, which is bonding and loyalty and a 
sense of togetherness. And then apply that to the way we treat city 
government. I talked this week with a guy in a major city who's a major 
manufacturer who'd been working to help his city and finally got so mad, 
he went to the local newspaper, saw the publisher, and said, "why are you 
doing more each morning to destroy the city than I'm able to do to 
rebuild it?" And he's now been asked to join the board of the newspaper, 
because they were so shaken as he took them through story after story 
which focused on the negative. Let me give you another example. The 
American Civilization strategy would review and encourage success, 
whereas the elite culture strategy restricts, undermines, and takes from 
success to give to losers. So when you hear me talk about class warfare, 
taxing the rich, just think about the psychological implications behind 
that kind of rhetoric. 
<P>
Now, to get one that's really controversial: the American Civilization 
model would award for merit. The elite culture will reward based on 
quotas. We want to know: what have you achieved? They want to know: who 
is your grandmother? That, by the way, is one of the most powerful 
cultural problems in American Civilization. Which matters? Do you matter, 
or does your group matter? Does your future matter and your effort 
matter, or does your past matter? Because, remember, if you reward 
somebody, you punish somebody else, so you're now using the state to pick 
winners and losers based on a particular formula, which has nothing to do 
with you as an individual. It's a very profound question about the nature 
of America, and very antithetical to American Civilization's core values. 
Another example. At the projects level. I want to talk briefly about 
earning by learning versus applying for a set-aside. We designed earning 
by learning about seven years ago at West Georgia college with Dr. Mel 
Steely. 
<P>
We go into public housing projects for second and third graders. We pay 
them $2.00 a book for every book they read in summertime, and we lay out 
a framework. We use adult volunteers and public libraries. Now, if I can 
here for a second, notice the model. We're talking here about a system 
which is remarkably thin and non-bureaucratic and is truly voluntary. 
That is, it's voluntary at two levels. It's voluntary, first of all, 
because the money is not coerced from you by the government. I used the 
term this week "Coercive Volunteerism," and my reference was to the fact 
that if you don't like a particular government program, you decide you 
won't volunteer, that is, the IRS calls and said, "hi, we'd like you to 
volunteer to pay for this program." You say, "well, I think I just won't 
volunteer this year." What happens to you? They take it anyway, right? I 
mean, first the IRS visits, then the US. Marshal visits, then we visit 
you. Is that not right? Part of what I'm trying to do -- I know it gets 
me in trouble sometimes with the elite media -- but part of what I'm 
trying to do here is cut down through all the baloney to get to the core 
underlying realities. Because we have so many layers of garbage words 
that have no meaning. You remember last year one of the phrases for tax 
increase was "contribution." 
<P>
Now, that can only make sense in a culture in which words -- and I'm a 
very big fan, if you've never read it, of George Orwell's work on 
"Politics and the English Language." It's a short essay, the essence of 
which: words have meaning. Now, when I read it, I was just -- I read it 
15 years ago -- I was just blown apart by it, because I suddenly realized 
if you're going to talk about volunteers, they should actually volunteer. 
If they're being paid, they're not volunteers, not in the classic sense. 
<P>
They're government employees. If you're being paid with a charitable 
contribution, it's a voluntary donation. If you're being paid with 
government money, it was coerced from someone. It's the nature of 
government. Government -- in fact, there's a quote from Washington that 
government is about power. And so you'd better think through the power 
you're giving somebody else to say to you, "you will give me this money." 
Now, what we do with earning by learning is very simple. And very 
different from the welfare state model. First of all, we use volunteer 
adults, no money. Second, we use public libraries. That's why they're 
there. No money. Third, we use free space in the public housing common 
room. So the overhead is totally volunteer, the entire structure is 
totally volunteer. The only money goes to the kids. So if you have 
$1,000, you can pay -- at $2.00 a book, you can pay for 500 books. 
Whereas, in the welfare state model, if you have $1,000, you pay $850 of 
it for the bureaucracy. 
<P>
Totally different model. There's a second part: it is incentive-driven. 
That is, if you read 20 books, you get $40. Why are you reading the 
books? Because you'll get a reward. And I have people that say to me, 
"oh, that's terrible you have to pay them." These are little kids who 
watch baseball players on strike, they watch rock stars make millions. 
They read about congressmen getting four and a half million dollar book 
advances. You can't take all this stuff too seriously. And then we turn 
to them and say, "oh, but you shouldn't really think about this." What 
nonsense. I mean, we live in a society where the only way they can make 
money right now is to be a pimp, prostitute, or a drug dealer. It's 
illegal to go to work. They want some cash, they live, by definition, in 
a public housing project. Nobody around them reads, they have a broken 
home, nobody's there nurturing them, and we walk in and we say, "hi, 
we'll actually give you the money if you'll earn it. Because now it's 
your money." Then they get to spend it. 
<P>
Most of them -- we've done it for seven years in 17 Different states by 
now -- most of them spend it on clothing. But the important thing is it's 
theirs by right, because they've earned it. So we're teaching them to 
earn. And we're teaching them that honest work leads to honest pay. And 
we're connecting them with an adult who cares, which may be the first 
adult they've ever seen who cares. We had one young child in Jonesboro, 
Georgia, who had very, very bad teeth deformation who was our best reader 
that year. He was in the fifth grade. We let him in because he was so 
lonely and so isolated that they made the local voluntary decision to let 
him in and break the rules. At the end of the summer, two orthodontists 
took him under their care and gave him two years of free care and changed 
his entire life. All of it done for free. Finally, the reason it got 
started, we teach literacy by doing. How do you teach reading? You read. 
If you'll read long enough, you can read. It's not about, you know, all 
of this fancy stuff, what do you do in class. It's simple. 
<P>
Get them to look at the book. Get them to look at the book. They hold 
enough books, they read enough books, they'll read. Now, compare that 
novel -- I mean, compare that model with the welfare state model, which 
is applying for a set-aside. "you owe me. I deserve." No, no. You earn 
it. It's a totally different system. Let's go a stage further, a project. 
Imagine a TV show on how to rise versus a TV show on pathological 
behavior. One of the real points of the Eberly book, which we're using in 
this course on community and citizenship -- and it's a really important 
point, the theme -- one of the underlying themes of the book is when you 
look at your common culture, what does it teach? If you were a martian 
anthropologist and you arrived on earth and you just turned on American 
evening television, what would the signals be sent? This would be a great 
paper by somebody someday. Again, I'm trying to give you an example of 
how you could take this very compacted course and suddenly explode into a 
range of interesting studies. 
<P>
Look at the five most popular sitcoms, and just watch them for two weeks 
and ask yourself: what were the values I would have learned in those 
sitcoms? They're mostly destructive, they're mostly trivial. They're just 
silly. So where would you turn in your common culture to say: I am a very 
poor 7-year-old, I really -- and I'm Black or Hispanic, and I'd really 
like to know how did 7-year-olds who were very poor and Black and 
Hispanic rise? Tell me a show that shows you. I'd like to know what the 
habits are of being successful. I'm sitting here in public housing, I've 
got a television set, I'd like to be able to tune on and see a show that 
is entertaining and shows me somebody being successful. Businessmen are 
mostly people who are conspiring to dump toxic waste in your back yard. 
Creatures are probably chasing the leader of the choir. Politicians are 
probably all accepting graft. Policemen are probably corrupt. I mean, 
have you looked at the common value systems of the culture on television? 
<P>
And have you looked at what Hollywood does to America by the -- and it's 
not that there's some evil set. It's just that if you're a normal -- if 
you're a normal child and you're trying to get signals, what are the 
signals being sent to you and the thing you're most likely to watch, and 
what is it you're not going to see? And it would be fascinating to see a 
show which actually had a healthy church or a healthy synagogue that 
truly cares about spirituality and actually was helping people.
<P>
It would be wonderful to see a show about a family working in a mission 
setting who were actually transforming a -- what if you saw a show that 
was positive? I mean, in a sense, "little house on the prairie" was in 
this tradition, and the show that he started when he died, what was the 
one about the angel of -- highway to heaven. There are occasional brief 
moments of hope in what is otherwise a wasteland of cynicism. But let me 
get to the area of tactics. One would be: read rather than getting -- 
going for a handout. Now, if we simply said to everybody who wanted a 
handout: the public library is seven blocks away -- and I'm not talking 
to people who are without food, but if you talk to people who have lived 
in the streets, they'll tell you food isn't the problem. There are lots 
of places in America that now serve as mission centers. The problem is: 
what do you do in between meals? I'd say read. If you're not willing to 
learn, you're not going to get there.
<P>
And we need to say that over and over. Another example: working harder 
versus feeling sorry for yourself. I lost two campaigns. If I'd spent 
much time moping about it, I would not be in congress today. Now, you 
open up a small business, it's really hard. The answer is: work harder. 
Learn more, think it through. You go bankrupt. The answer is: get back up 
and go do it again. It's amazing how many first-generation millionaires 
went bankrupt at least once. But their reaction was, "wow, what did I 
learn out of that one?" The reaction wasn't, "gee, I think I'll go quit 
now." Another example, learning from others versus complaining to others. 
You can't -- and this has been one of the keys to my life. 
<P>
I go around looking for teachers. I know I don't know something. Who 
knows it? "would you please teach me?" As opposed to complaining that I'm 
ignorant. If you'll try to learn, you'll be less ignorant tomorrow. It's 
a day-by-day experience. Another tactic, asking the question: what should 
I do? I mean, imagine that every poor person in America today had these 
two choices. We would say to them, ask yourself this morning, "what 
should I do?" What the welfare state says is, "go ahead and say you're 
helpless. We'll send a bureaucrat with a check." In fact, the welfare 
state's structured to punish you if you answer the question, "what should 
I do," "I think I'll go get a job." That's illegal. "I think I'll save 
for my daughter to go to school." That's illegal.
<P>
Let's go back to the vision level. I want to argue that personal strength 
is necessary both for freedom and for a free market. That, in fact, 
you're in a situation where you have to have a sense of being personally 
strong both to be politically free and to be effective in a free society. 
Now, let's look at this in a bigger context. A healthy, successful 
civilization provides at least six qualities of life. These are minimums: 
safety, family, work, health, learning, and spiritual meaning. That a 
civilization -- this is not a government, this is a civilization, the 
value structured, intellectual framework of your life, and that in 
America, the argument would be that the key to providing these qualities 
is all of us working together, with each of us doing our share. Now I'm 
going to walk you just for a second through these, but the argument I'm 
going to make to you is that personal strength is vital to each quality. 
<P>
That any answer which says, "how can I not bear my share of the 
responsibility and you take care of me" is an answer which probably won't 
work. Let's start with safety. A neighborhood that watches out for its 
neighbors is almost certainly a safe neighborhood. And there are studies 
of this. You can build a hallway entrance, and if you have I think it's 
up to four doors, it's a safe hallway. But if you build a common area 
that has too many doors, it becomes impersonal space, and the amount of 
predatory behavior goes up dramatically. But if you create bonding, if 
you create a neighborhood where people know each other, pay attention to 
each other, that's why cul de sacs are safer than thoroughfares. Because 
people tend to know each other and tend to watch out for each other. If 
you create habits of safety, again, those of you who -- I have two 
daughters. They're now grown. But something as simple as: always go out 
in a group. You know, that may strike you as, "gee, you shouldn't have to 
live like that." In virtually every urban society in history, women are 
safer in groups. Now, you can say, "well, you shouldn't have to do that." 
No, you shouldn't have to do that.
<P>
The question is: statistically, are you safer? Don't be in downtown 
Washington or downtown Atlanta at 3:00 o'clock in the morning by 
yourself, whether you're male or female. That's not because -- that's not 
because you have to live a frightened life. It's just because you ought 
to be rational about what the risks are. You know, there's an old rule: 
don't go in -- don't go into a sailor's bar in new Orleans at 3:00 
o'clock in the morning if you're not a sailor and think you can 
automatically handle yourself. You're out of your league. So you have to 
have some discipline to be safe. Now, I'm not saying that's good or bad. 
I'm not saying that's desirable or undesirable. I'm saying that it's 
real, that American Civilization's great hallmark is that it's real. 
Family. Any of you who have had a strong family know if you're going to 
keep a strong family, you have a lot of work you have to do. That you 
just -- you don't keep a family together unless you work at it. That 
takes personal strength. Work is another one. It's Monday morning, you 
don't feel like it. You go anyway. You're a salesman, you've been turned 
down four times, you make the next call. Takes personal strength. Health. 
One of our great problems in America is we're not straight about this. 
You drink a quart of liquor a day, you don't do any exercise, you're 65 
pounds overweight, don't complain to the doctor because he failed or she 
failed. There has to be some level of personal responsibility. People who 
get a disease who recover versus people who don't. Personal strength's a 
big factor in who bounces back. People who live to be 90 and they're 
healthy, like Edwards Deming or like peter Drucker, who's in his mid 
80's, you'll find a lot of discipline, a lot of constant thought. They 
don't -- it just doesn't happen genetically. They're not just lucky, 
although that's a factor, obviously. 
<P>
But it's amazing people -- Chamberlain, remember when you saw Chamberlain 
last week? I was told this story later by Bill fortune. Chamberlain, the 
year after Gettysburg, was shot leading a charge. Died at 84 with the 
wound never having fully healed, having spent every day of his life after 
the war in pain, having served twice as governor, President of Bowden 
college, professor and writer with 50 years of pain, or 40 years of pain. 
Now, somebody else could have easily said, "boy, that debilitates me so 
bad I can't do anything." Chamberlain lived a full life because he 
doesn't know when -- he said, "okay, I'm in pain. Now what am I going to 
do?" Learning. Learning is not easy, and it's not always fun. And when 
it's not easy, you've got to work harder at it, and when it's not fun, 
you've got to buckle down and do it, because otherwise you won't learn. 
<P>
A lot of our failure with modern schools is we don't tell kids the truth, 
which is if -- you know, you've got to work. You've got to do homework. 
You've got to study. And the person being cheated by the teacher who's 
nice is the student who won't get a job because they don't know anything. 
Being nice is not as important as being effective. And so you've got to 
say to people, "it takes personal strength to learn, because learning 
sometimes is really hard." Finally, spiritual meaning. It's not about 
brainwashing. It's about the quiet moment where you decide for you what 
you believe. And a healthy, safe society, it seems to me, has to have 
some concern that if we're endowed by our creator, that is, by 
definition, a spiritual phrase. So that Americans have -- and there's -- 
it's not an accident that this is the most religious of all the western 
industrial nations, because it is a nation that has a spiritual meaning 
at its core. Now, when I talk about personal strength, let me suggest to 
you seven key aspects. You might come up with others, but I think these 
are a pretty powerful base. The first is integrity, then courage, hard 
work, perseverance, discipline, responsibility, and respect for others. 
Let me -- we started with integrity. We argued about this a long time. 
<P>
We were looking for different words. Integrity is very important. It 
doesn't mean not lying. It means behaving with some exemplary honesty 
that it is the way you wished others would behave, and I believe it's at 
the core of a free society. A society without integrity is a society 
which has cancer at its heart. And it's one of the reasons that 
reestablishing a sense of trust is so powerful -- so important and so 
simple. This is not a peripheral issue. Integrity is at the heart of a 
free society. If we have a transaction, I have to believe that the check 
that you gave me is good, that credit card you gave me is honest, that 
the dollar you gave me is real. That your promise that a year from now 
you'll do "x" means our partnership can work. Integrity is at the core of 
freedom and at the core of a free society. I think that to be free, you 
have to have courage. 
<P>
I mentioned the other day that the New Hampshire state slogan is "Live 
Free or Die." I think that's a very powerful concept. It takes courage to 
be free. It takes courage to have integrity. Integrity means saying "no" 
when everybody in the group wants you to say "yes." It means disagreeing 
when everybody wants you to be agreeable. Not because you're obnoxious, 
but because you have to do what you believe in, and to do what you 
believe in takes great courage. To listen to yourself sometimes and do 
what you -- and do what your inner self tells you sometimes takes great 
courage. Third, I think there has to be hard work. I do not think it is 
possible to have a free society without hard work. I don't think it's 
possible to have personal strength without hard work. And I would suggest 
that because the first two are, in a sense, internal to you, I mean, you 
have to know whether or not you have integrity. You have to live out 
whether or not you have courage.
<P>
Hard work is easy to identify, and I would suggest that it is a building 
block we ought to reinsert into the entire culture. And if you're not 
working hard, you're somehow not getting it about American Civilization, 
and that doesn't necessarily mean working long. Doesn't necessarily have 
-- doesn't mean you've got to put in 90 hours a week to prove you're an 
American. But it does mean you've got to be prepared to be energetic and 
committed and enthusiastic. It's why if you look at the great work 
tradition in the midwest, that on the weekend when you had time off, 
people also -- they painted their house, they sewed, they cooked dinner. 
<P>
There's an energetic kind of constant activity that is at the core of 
American life. It also means perseverance. Things don't work. Things 
break down. You make mistakes. You just aren't that smart, and then you 
have to get up and do it again. I've always believed that for leadership, 
perseverance is the most important quality. Much more important than IQ. 
It's why I think this whole bell curve argument is sort of nonsense. I 
don't care -- I don't care what the IQ. Results are by racial stock. It's 
irrelevant, first of all, because you're an individual. I want to know 
how you're doing. And, second, because IQ. Is dramatically less important 
than character. If you have courage, integrity, you have hard work and 
you have perseverance, you'll beat a smart person every time. A lazy, 
indolent, dishonest, smart person will be wiped out in a free society by 
just a -- by just a competent, average, hard-working person with 
integrity and perseverance. And we don't teach the right values.
<P>
We focus on the wrong things. Perseverance, by the way, grows out of 
discipline. If you don't have discipline, you aren't going to get it. 
Now, discipline doesn't mean you have to wear a military uniform and 
stand ramrod straight. But it does mean when the time has come to get up 
-- I'm going to do this right now. I swim at 6:15 or 6:30 each morning 
for a half mile. I hate swimming -- I love to swim. I hate doing it at 
6:15 in the morning, and I hate having it built into my schedule, because 
I don't like being controlled. I also know that I'm 51 and I have an 
obligation to keep my health up and I drink too much beer and eat too 
much ice cream, and if I don't swim, I will look like a little round 
bowling ball and it will be disgusting. So the combination -- and we now 
know what sound bite they'll distort this week, don't we? But the truth 
is, for all of us, there are things, there are times, there are places 
where you've got to do it, and the only way you can do it is to 
discipline yourself. 
<P>
Except no comment later on about the degree to which I may already look 
like a bowling ball. There are limits to academic freedom. All of that, I 
think, grows out of a sense of responsibility. That you -- remember, you 
are endowed with the right to pursue happiness. But that means you have 
the responsibility to exercise that right. So responsibility, a word 
which has almost disappeared in the elite culture. And then out of all of 
this, I just want to suggest to you you still can't have a healthy 
society unless you have respect for others. Now, respect for others 
really does mean putting together and working together in a way that 
given all the characteristics I just outlined, you've got to give others 
those same characteristics. Now, if you take all that -- I think I have a 
summary question that will last for a long time, and it's this, that the 
key question for all public policy should be: will this proposal help 
people become more responsible, more productive, and more safe so they 
can be prosperous and free, so they can pursue happiness? Notice that 
set: more responsible, more productive, more safe. If I give you money, 
does that make you more responsible or less? If I give you money, does 
that make you more productive, or does it actually encourage you to be -- 
to not worry about your productivity? What are you doing? And notice what 
the goals are Here: so you can become prosperous and free, so you can 
pursue happiness. 
<P>
We don't -- we never guaranteed happiness. We guaranteed pursuit. Now, in 
that framework, I want to suggest to you that the greatest failure of the 
welfare state was its direct and indirect undermining of personal 
strength. That the actual effect of the welfare state is to weaken and 
cripple the poor, to encourage more people to slide into poverty and to 
set up a structure in which personal strength decayed because of the very 
actions of government behavior. So it's not: should we have a cheap 
welfare state or an expensive welfare state? It is the structure and 
culture and psychology of the welfare state which is devastating, because 
it destroys personal strength.
<P>
And we're going to spend two hours on this later on talking about how we 
replace it towards the end of the quarter, but for the moment, I want to 
go back and just say to you: the best single work I mentioned earlier is 
Olasky, "the tragedy of American compassion." Because it really, really 
outlines what the welfare state has done and what used to work. And, in 
fact, there's a column in "Newsweek" this week which points out that this 
book and another book which I haven't read yet by Bea Himmelfarb on 
Victorian morality says flatly, in the 19th century, there was a steady 
drop in poverty, alcoholism, and addiction, and, in fact, we were winning 
the struggle, and the model was radically different than the elite model 
we've tried for the last 30 years. What I'm suggesting to you is the 
welfare state attitudes, taxes, and regulations discourage work, which 
undermines perseverance, discipline, and responsibility. That the whole 
structure of the welfare state actually cripples us. I'm also suggesting 
that the welfare state undermines the family. And, in fact, as I may have 
mentioned the other day, the earned income tax credit, if you earn 
$11,000 a year and you marry somebody who earns $11,000 a year, you lose 
$4600 in earned income tax credit by the act of marriage, and then we 
wonder why people don't get married. Now, a state which punishes marriage 
by taking over 20% of your income by getting married is crazy. It is 
literally, certifiably nuts. And it has destructive behavior. The welfare 
state, the sheer volume of rules and regulations undermines integrity. 
Fact is, when you have enough red tape, you cheat on it. That is a fact. 
May not be desirable, but it's a fact. How many of you have found 
yourself at some point in the last year fudging on something, where you 
know you broke some rule? Just raise your hand. Virtually all of you. 
Okay. So why should it shock you that a person on food stamps does the 
same thing? Why should it shock you that a person on AFDC does the same 
thing? 
<P>
Why should it shock you that a person in public housing does the same 
thing? We have built a law dominated, bureaucratically dominated, red 
tape dominated system in which everybody believes they should cheat at 
something. Not that they mean to be bad, but after all, we all know we do 
it. I mean, how often do people say, "yeah, well, you can do it. Go 
ahead. It doesn't really -- it's not a real rule." All right? Sort of a 
rule. It's a rule that matters if they catch you. That is --that is a 
cancer at the heart of a free society. You're going to have few rules 
ruthlessly enforced rather than many, many rules mostly neglected. 
Furthermore, the welfare state's litigation system attacks virtually 
every aspect of personal strength. Somebody's in a car wreck, you stop to 
help them. You get sued for malpractice. Have you ever thought about how 
many different ways you're now legally vulnerable so that trial lawyers 
can get richer, and how much that biases against the system? In addition, 
what happens is people come to rely on government instead of their own 
strength. That instead of focusing on "how can I be personally strong," 
people focus on how to get the government to send them money. "you owe 
me." 
<P>
Now, this core assertion of this, which I think all of the Founding 
Fathers would have agreed with, is that governments can't give you what 
you don't earn. Now, when governments try to give you what you haven't 
earned, the result is loss of self-respect, loss of humanness, and the 
rise of pathologies. And I think that's where we are today. Now, our 
vision is, first of all, everyone can have personal strength. And I would 
debate this anywhere in the country. And you're going to see in a little 
while Max Cleland and hear his story. You've seen Charles Krautheimer on 
television. When you see the examples of people of courage who overcome 
tremendous odds, senator Bob Dole, then they -- then you see an 
able-bodied person tell you that they're a victim and it's just too hard, 
what you've got to say to them is, "get a grip on yourself." Everybody 
can have personal strength. Our vision is that with effort, help, and 
faith, extraordinary things can happen.
<P>
And now, before anybody says, "oh, yeah, Gingrich is just talking about, 
once again, all those rich people who are able- bodied who get to do good 
things. He doesn't care about those who have real problems," I want you 
to listen to a leading Democrat, Secretary of the State of Georgia Max 
Cleland, and really, I think you're going to be very impressed by this 
interview.
<P>
Max Cleland: I was about 15 miles east, setting up a radio relay site on 
a mountain, and had gotten off a helicopter with my radio team, and 
looked down and there was a grenade. I didn't think it was live, and I 
really thought it was mine. I thought it had fell off my web gear and 
stuff, so I was carrying an m-16 in this hand and reached down to get it, 
and just before I reached it, it went off. So I was absolutely stunned 
and terrified, obviously, and looked down and my right hand wasn't there, 
and looked down and my right leg wasn't there, and my left leg was so 
badly mangled, it was amputated within the hour. So within the space of 
one hour, I was, one, lucky to survive, but, number two, lost three limbs 
right there. Bad things happen to good people, and difficulties happen to 
people in life, but that doesn't mean it has to stop you. And my heroes 
now are the people who went on to succeed regardless. 
<P>
People like Abraham Lincoln, who ran for public office many, many times 
and lost and ultimately ended up president of the United States in 1860. 
Or Thomas Edison, who was told by his teachers he was too stupid to learn 
and went on to become the most prolific inventor of modern times. Or 
Helen Keller, who worked through three devastating disabilities, 
blindness, deafness, and the inability to talk, worked through that and 
became a great humanitarian. So my heroes now are people who are able to 
work through the valley of the shadow and come out, as Hemingway said, 
"strong at the broken places." So in many ways, I think I'm probably 
stronger because of that experience, but it hasn't been easy. It's 
possible to be strong after injury or adversity or tragedy. It is 
possible, but it's not easy. So in terms of personal strength, I think 
what happens is you find along the way people say to me, "oh, I couldn't 
do that," or, "if that happened to me, I'd never have the energy or 
strength to get out of -- get out of the bed or get out of the corner or 
go do things." You really don't know what you can do. I think that's one 
of the things I've learned. You never -- that there's great power and 
potential in the human body, mind, and spirit when it goes all out either 
to fight for survival or to fight for some goal or for some idea, or just 
to fight for one's own dignity. Victor Frankel, the great psychiatrist 
out of world war ii, said that "to live is to suffer; to survive is to 
find meaning in suffering." I think when something dramatic happens to 
you, something traumatic happens to you, loss of limbs, loss of friends 
or family, a divorce, some catastrophe in your life, you spend a long 
time thereafter trying to sort out what it all means. You have a search 
for meaning. And the ability to survive after that depends on your 
ability to find some kind of meaning out of it all. 
<P>
As I was going through my valleys and struggling so much with the Vietnam 
experience and a sense of loss and hurt and trying to make sense of it, 
trying to find a sense of meaning and purpose out of it, these words 
meant a lot to me, and as I've continued my struggle and my search for my 
own destiny and how things are going to work out for me and what I should 
be doing and so forth, a lot of the answers of life, so to speak, this 
prayer has meant more and more to me, not less and less. "I asked god for 
strength that I might achieve. "I was made weak that I might learn humbly 
to obey. "I asked for health that I might do greater things. "I was given 
infirmity that I might do better things. "I asked for riches that I might 
be happy. "I was given poverty that I might be wise. "I asked for power 
that I might have the praise of men. "I was given weakness that I might 
feel the need of god. "I asked for all things that I might enjoy life. "I 
was given life that I might enjoy all things. "I got nothing that I asked 
for, but everything I had hoped for. "almost despite myself, my unspoken 
prayers were answered. "I am, among all men, most richly blessed." 
<P>
>>what's your reaction?<br>
>>his prayer is very similar to the prayer of St.. Francis of 
Assisi.>>Now, if you took that -- and you can take that five minutes and 
we could get>>volunteers to go out and visit every home of every 
so-called -- every person who lacked money who was not necessarily poor. 
A huge difference here. In the 19th century, we didn't -- we talked about 
paupers, who were people who lacked the core structure, and then people 
who were poor, which meant you had no money. Today, poor has come to mean 
"pauper." Many people in history have had no money, and yet they've not 
been poor. They've been rising. They would have money soon. Their 
children would have money. In fact, if you look at "little women," it is, 
in fact, a movie about a family which has lost money, but is working very 
hard not to lose status. And it's really very interesting. 
<P>
There's a recent "New York Times" essay on the three versions that have 
been made that we still have available and what they each meant in their 
own generation, how they reflected the values and structures of their own 
generation, and it's worth seeing "little women" and thinking about that 
in that context, and then you think about: all right, what if every 
person in America told you today they couldn't make it saw that five 
minutes? And you said, "now, tell me again what your problem is." This is 
at the core of what we're trying to say, yet part of it which is totally 
outlawed in the modern system, is if you were to say, first of all, who 
is so challenged they can't find personal strength? There are some people 
who have genetic disabilities, they have birth problems, they have -- you 
know, they're a very tiny group, and for those people, I believe we 
should all of us through the government generously find ways to maximize 
the third wave information revolution opportunities to improve their 
lives. 
<P>
I mean, there are lots of things you can do with computers and with 
technology and with rehabilitation. Those folks we ought to invest in to 
get them up to a point where they have a chance to lead a decent life. 
But they're a very tiny number of people out of 260 million. For 
everybody else, it seems to me you have to start by saying: you're going 
to have to find personal strength. Now, the problem with that and the 
thing which has been so driven out by the elite culture in this 
discontinuity is that in American Civilization, we know that faith is 
central to personal strength.  Let me give you some examples. 
<P>
These are among the great success stories of 20th century America, which 
very seldom make page one. Alcoholics Anonymous. This is the big book, 
the basic text for Alcoholics Anonymous. This is what they say on 
foreword to the first edition as it appeared in the first printing, 1939, 
second paragraph: "it is important that we remain anonymous, because we 
are too few at present to handle the overwhelming number of personal 
appeals which may result from this publication. "being mostly business or 
professional folk, we could not well carry on our occupations in such an 
event. "we would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an 
avocation. "when writing or speaking publicly about alcoholism, we urge 
each of our fellowship to omit his personal name, designating himself 
instead as a member of alcoholics anonymous. "very earnestly we ask the 
press also to observe this request, because otherwise, we shall be 
greatly handicapped. "we are not an organization in the conventional 
sense of the word. "there are no fees or dues whatever. "the only 
requirement for membership is an honest desire to stop drinking. "we are 
not allied with any particular faith, sect, or denomination, nor do we 
oppose anyone. "we simply wish to be helpful to those who are afflicted." 
Totally different model. Costs no money, has no structure, and is, I 
think, arguably the most successful single anti-alcoholism operation in 
the world. 

<P>
Second example, if you take a look at "one day at a time" in al-anon, 
which is their book, al-anon is the drug addiction parallel to the 
system. They emphasize a lot about the degree to which you have to 
confront yourself. You have to worry about yourself. This is for January 
15th. They have one day at a time. Literally, every day they have a 
little message. They say, quote, we pray for sobriety for the alcoholic 
because -- I'm sorry, "we pray for sobriety for the alcoholic because we 
believe this will solve all our problems. "this is an illusion. "sobriety 
is only the first step in building a good life. "unless we both work to 
overcome the emotional conflicts within ourselves, we remain at a 
standstill. "our troubles only take new forms because they did not stem 
from alcoholism, but from the personality flaws that caused the 
alcoholism and from our irrational reactions to them. "even when the 
alcoholic has conquered the compulsion to drink, I must remember that I 
have much to learn about adjusting to the sober alcoholic. "today's 
reminder: I will not delude myself into thinking that sobriety is the 
sole goal. "I will deal with each problem that comes to me with the help 
of the 12 steps and the loving interchange with my friends in al-anon." 
Quote, I pray for the wisdom to take a rational and tolerant attitude 
toward whatever troubles I must face each day. In terms of personal 
strength, notice how it is being driven in again and again. "24 hours a 
day," which is meditations which relates again back to alcoholics 
anonymous as a program, this is for day one -- this is for January the 
1st. Prayer for the day, "I pray that god will guide me one day at a time 
in the new year. "I pray that for each day, god will supply the wisdom 
and the strength that I need." This is central over and over. You are 
smaller than your problems. Only god can help you. You can get through 
today. We can't save the rest of your life we can help you save today. 
<P>
And then tomorrow, you can get through tomorrow. So it's a very 
consistent, one day at a time. Finally, one of the books that made me a 
revolutionary. This is "how girls can help their country." I bought it at 
the girl scout house down in Savannah, Georgia, where the girl scouts 
were founded, of course, Juliette Lowe, and it is a wonderful book on 
"how girls can help their country." And my point to you would be that 
when you look through this, the common sense, the basic commitment again 
and again, this book was written in -- published in 1913 before there was 
an ERA. It's emphasis on helping others. It's emphasis on strengthening 
yourself. It's emphasis -- for example, every girl should get two jobs -- 
should have two trades so that if one dies, she can earn a living at the 
other. When you read that passage, then you think about modern 
unemployment compensation and the attitude of waiting. There's a -- this 
book is a profound statement for women of a set of values in a time when 
most of you probably assumed they were unliberated.
<P>
But, in fact, it talks about professions, it talks about patriotism, it 
talks about serving your country, and, of course, imagine how 
old-fashioned the concept, "how girls can help their country." Not how 
their country can help the girls. Now, in that framework, I just want to 
suggest to you that voluntary school prayer matters, because we are 
endowed by our creator, and authority comes from a supreme being. And I 
want to wrap this up, because it comes right back, in a sense, to 
personal strength. The thing that Marvin Olasky says he found fascinating 
is that when you talk to the successful philanthropy groups who really 
help people cease to be a drug addict, cease to be an alcoholic, learn to 
rise from poverty, they emphasize over and over again they start with 
faith. When you read the big book of alcoholics anonymous, it starts with 
faith. And I'm going to come back to this later, but when you read the 12 
steps, it starts with faith. 
<P>
When you go through item by item, it is a continuing again and again 
process of saying: if you don't dig into yourself, where d O you think 
personal strength's going to come from? And Olasky tells a story of a 
very powerful mission system, I think it's in California, that was doing 
really well, but they -- and they would help the local poor, they'd help 
the homeless, they had a tremendous 75% getting off of drug addiction. 
The local government loved them so much, it came to them and said, "we'll 
give you the money to triple your mission, but you have to quit this 
prayer stuff." And they said, "we'd love the money, but it's the prayer 
stuff that is the reason we're successful." The average rate for secular 
government programs, according to Olasky, is, like, eight or 10% success. 
They were having 75%. They said, "what you're telling us is to get the 
money from you, we have to quit doing everything that works, which is the 
reason you want to give us the money." And so my argument's very simple, 
and I am totally against state prayer, I'm totally against the teacher 
praying, but I think we've got to have a debate and a dialogue about 
reestablishing the right to have some level of concern for faith and 
spiritual being everywhere in America.
<P>
And it has to be diverse and it has to represent everybody, and it can't 
be in any way an establishment system. But if you start by saying: in 
order to solve our problems, we will not discuss faith, spirituality, or 
inner strength, you are saying, in fact: we're not going to solve our 
problems. And no matter how much money you pour into an empty vessel, if 
the bottom of the vessel is open, it's going to go straight through. And 
the whole point of this opening hour is to suggest to you that if you 
want a healthy, free society, it starts with personal strength. Personal 
strength starts with some inner strength and inner sense of courage, 
inner sense of integrity, inner sense of spiritual faith, and that unless 
you address that, you're not going to have a healthy, free society. 
<P>
And every government solution that precludes those, that undermines 
strength by giving you an excuse not to get up, that Undermines family by 
punishing you if you get married, that sends signals that tell you, 
"these things don't matter, but why don't you come down to the 
bureaucracy and apply for a check," are, in fact, undermining the very 
goals that they're designed to achieve. So what we'll do in the second 
hour is we're going to take this back up again and work our way through 
some examples and then discuss the works of peter Drucker at the very 
end. We have five minutes. Okay, thank you.
<P>
Let me start with a couple of things just -- first of all, somebody 
reminded me, and I appreciate you all sort of keeping me up to speed on 
all this, that Marvin Olasky, the author of "the tragedy of American 
compassion," which I showed you a while ago, will be interviewed on 
C-Span's "book notes" program on Sunday night at 8:00 p.m.., I guess it 
is. So you get a chance to see Olasky personally. He's a very, very 
interesting guy, and I think you'll find it very interesting to have a 
chance to see him. Let me also suggest to you, somebody brought me -- one 
of the students brought in -- this is the "how to read a book" by 
Mortimer Adler. Adler wrote this. It was originally published in 1940 and 
then rewritten on several occasions and republished. And it starts with 
how to read, you know, your first book, although you obviously have to be 
able to read a fair amount to be able to read it. But for parents -- you 
know, for parents, it's a pretty good introduction to helping your kids 
read, but also, how to read history, how to read plays, how to read 
practical books. 
<P>
I mean, Mortimer Adler was, in some ways, the greatest popularizing 
philosopher of his generation. And this was his effort to really explain 
how to approach books and how to get things out of them. So when we 
talked about active learning last time, this would be -- this would have 
been very useful. And I appreciate very much your bringing it in, and you 
gave it to me, but I'm now going to loan it to Kathleen Minnix, so if you 
could pass it back up to dr. Minnix. She gets to read it while I go back 
to Washington this week. Let me also say that I want to get into a very 
controversial section for a few minutes. We're not going to talk about 
giraffes, so don't get panicked, but I want to get into talking about 
personal strength in some of the most difficult areas, and I want to 
start by arguing that personal strength applies to every American. And 
that literally -- remember I said earlier, people who are born with 
genetic challenges, mental or physical, people who are born -- people who 
get into an accident that severely -- leaves them with a severe handicap 
or disability, that's -- that's a separate challenge.
<P>
I think we have to think there how we help those people, and, in effect, 
give them compensatory investment and education and rehabilitation and 
technology in order to give them a chance to lead a full life. But if you 
except that very small number, I want to suggest that if you are 
relatively able-bodied and relatively intelligent -- and that's a very, 
very broad range. Now, we're talking about probably 256 or 257 million 
out of the 260 million Americans, and I'm sure there will presently be an 
article that analyzes exactly how many it is. But if you take that 
concept, for the vast overwhelming majority, that you're sort of born as 
a person. I used to use the word "normal," but I'm told that's not 
correct anymore. So but you're born as -you're a human being without a 
significant disability or a significant mental or physical challenge, 
that personal strength applies to you, and applies to you wherever you 
are today, whether you are a street person or a homeless person or you 
are living in poverty or you're the richest person in America. Personal 
strength applies to you. 
<P>
Now, what I want you to do is we're going to start this by looking at a 
fabulous introduction, and I should -- to Marva Collins, who is a great 
teacher in Chicago who teaches at a private school which is 
extraordinarily successful in exactly the same neighborhoods that the 
public schools are destroying the kids because they have structures that 
are so undisciplined, lacking in challenge, and they have the wrong 
attitude about the kids. Marva Collins is a very tough disciplinarian. 
And I want you to watch this story of her school, and particularly look 
for a little girl who you'll never forget for the rest of your life when 
you see her. 
<P>
You won't hear students reading about dick and Jane at Marva Collins' 
west side preparatory school in Chicago. Even for the little ones, it's 
back to the basics and the classics.  Cleopatra and Mary queen of Scots 
are all stories of very strong women. The classics to me is a real world, 
it's life. It's about struggle, it's about hard times, it's about 
overcoming the hard times of life. It's about not quitting. While the 
crumbling buildings in the inner city neighborhood near the school may 
say "quit," Mrs.. Collins teaches her students that "can't" is just "can" 
without the "t." Every child in here will tell you we do not take average 
papers. We tell them average people are never in short supply.  If we 
strive for excellence, we can become all that we want to become.
<P>
Great expectations prompted Collins to begin West Side Prep 15 years ago 
with her own money. The teacher believes that there are no poor students, 
there are only poor parents and poor teachers. There are more and more 
people who cannot raise their families in dignity and self-esteem, and I 
never intended for that to happen to any child that ever passes my way. 
They really do not have a choice to fail if they stay here. Since failure 
is not a choice here, Collins reminds students they're bright, and 
discipline and correction are made with positive affirmations. When she 
says that, "I love you, you're too bright to do that," they just know 
that they are too bright and they just stop it. Like a magic that she has 
over the children. At other schools, teachers, they didn't care. I've had 
teachers tell me, you know, "I'm here to get my paycheck. I don't care if 
you get this or not." While some educators have been critical of her 
teaching methods, students do not share their skepticism. She's a fun 
teacher.
<P>
>>it's a small school, but yet it has such big hearts and such expanding 
minds. And students of all ages have great expectations for themselves. 
People without vision perish. People without education don't make it very 
far. I've learned that I can do it if I try and that god made me so I can 
-- so that I can achieve, and I will achieve. Socrates taught Plato, and 
Plato taught Alexander the great, who said, "my parents gave me life, but 
you taught me how to live it," and I think it just goes on and on and on 
and it lives infinitely.
<P>
Don't you think that little girl's probably going to have a fair chance 
of succeeding? But notice how it's all, in a sense internalized, and 
notice how Marva Collins makes the history of the human race relevant to 
those kids. So you study the classics, because they have been powerful 
ways of expressing your life. That the dilemmas of Ulysses and Hercules 
in a sense are your dilemmas, or the dilemmas of Diana, the huntress, are 
your dilemmas. I mean, if you think about the Greek mythologies, the 
roman mythologies, the effort to bring to bear Shakespeare, that it's an 
effort to say: every person should somehow come in touch with the rich 
historical tradition. 
<P>
And yet we have a crisis in our culture which I think we have to talk 
about openly and honestly, and that is, in a sense, the dilemma of 
African-Americans. That the choice is the following two principles: by 
personal strength, I can learn the rules of success and become a 
successful American versus no matter what I do, racism will trap me in my 
Blackness. And it's a very key debate which I think we're going to have 
to engage in the next five or six years, because the question is, in 
America: is my success or my race the key factor? Am I more like an 
unemployed, uneducated "brother" or "sister," or more like other 
successful Americans, even if they are of Asian, Hispanic, or native 
American background? Now, this is not my view. I agree with it, but in a 
sense, I was profoundly moved by Shelby Steele. You remember we showed 
last week dr. Martin Luther king's great speech in Washington at the 
Lincoln memorial where he said, "I have a dream of an America where my 
children will be judged by the content of their character, not the color 
of their skin." Well, dr. Steele took the content of our character, a new 
vision of race in America. 
<P>
I would encourage every American who's really interested in the challenge 
of race in America to read this, because it's a very personal book. And 
he walks through from his own personal experience being in rooms, role 
playing, playing games and how he feels about it, and also the challenge. 
He says the following. This is on page 164 of the paperback edition. He 
says, "I recently spoke with a Black woman who described herself as a 
cultural nationalist. "in her view, there were virtually no opportunities 
for Blacks to enter the mainstream of American life, which she saw as 
fundamentally racist. "she was, as we say, the Blackest of the Black. 
"yet this purified identity was achieved by an absolute denial of 
mainstream Black opportunity. "in her scheme, the more opportunity one 
admitted to, let alone took advantage of, the less Black one was. "the 
power of memory and inversion had virtually called this woman back to 
slavery and left her no option but collective action, since individual 
possibility was all but invisible to her.
<P>
"she was an extreme case, but also an extreme version of the paradigm 
that touches many Blacks. "even among middle-class Blacks who function 
well in the mainstream, when the time comes to declare one's identity, to 
announce one's Blackness, there is invariably a denial of Black 
opportunity. "this is the denial that brings one securely back inside the 
circle of Blackness that quite literally lets one feel Black. "to point 
to opportunity is to stand outside this circle, to be less Black." This 
is a real crisis of our civilization, because it goes to the heart of 
quotas, it goes to the heart of set-asides, but it also goes to the heart 
of the cultural debate about who we are. Are we 260 million people? And 
think about it this way. In American Civilization, we would argue there 
are 260 million of us and that we're each individuals. But in the current 
elite alternative view, there's this sort of thing called America.
<P>
But then there are a series of blocks, and the real test for you is: 
Which block are you in? If you think I exaggerate, look at government 
forms. Do they say you're an American? They say: who are you? And what if 
you are Anglo-American whose mother was Dutch and Protestant, whose 
father was Greek orthodox? And I would argue in the 19th century, they 
would not have thought of that as Anglo-American, but they would now, 
because Mediterranean people weren't considered the same as Northern 
Europeans. And you marry somebody whose mother was Black and father was 
Chinese. But who -- but the father was Chinese-Hispanic, because his 
mother was Hispanic, while his father was Chinese. Which box are you in? 
And the correct answer is what? See, you don't think.

<P>
>>American.<br>
>>no, no. Think for a second. In the real world, in all honesty, if you 
were filling out a job or scholarship application, which of the boxes 
would you check? Black.>>Probably Black, probably. It would depend. The 
correct question -- now, listen, listen, listen. You're not thinking. 
>>>>all right, take us through it. Right. But the correct question is: at 
this school at this time, which group has the best shot of getting the 
scholarship? I mean, let's be honest. I want you to think about it. 
That's why there was a scandal in San Francisco in the fire department, 
because everybody was inventing an American Indian great grandmother. 
Isn't that exactly what the system does? And furthermore, notice how it 
drives you apart. And yet look at the threat. If you're in one of these 
-- if you're in a favored group, favored because of some victimization, 
you know, if we suddenly say, "you're just an American," you lose all of 
your group rights and your group identity, and you get into a big 
cultural conflict, which, by the way, is not new. This has been going on 
since the 18th century, when the Germans arrived and lived in German 
communities. Go look at the Amish today. The history of America is the 
history of a tension between who you were and who you're becoming, and 
it's a very powerful question. And yet the crisis of the inner city is 
really a clash between American Civilization and a culture of poverty and 
violence.
<P>
This is one of the things -- and this -- I really believe the inner city 
is not about racism. It's not a Black problem or a Hispanic problem. And 
you're seeing it gradually spread. If you look at white births outside of 
marriage, they're now about where Black births were in 1960. Black births 
in 1960 are actually closer to white births in 1960 than they are to 
Black births now, because what's happened is the first group to get hit 
were Blacks, because they were the most pushed into the welfare system, 
the Blacks and American Indians. Nobody has honestly looked at American 
Indian reservations as centers of pathology brought on them by the 
government and the way the government Indian bureau works and the 
standards and system. That, by the way, is breaking down for a most 
ironic reason. They're opening up casinos because they have a legal 
loophole, so they're becoming centers of wealth. So they're rapidly 
become Americanized. 
<P>
It will become a great crisis among native Americans in the next 
generation, because they'll come to be rich enough to say, "fine, I'm 
glad I'm a native American. Send me the check. I've got to go to brazil 
for a vacation." It will change their whole world, because they'll 
suddenly start being capitalists. But what happened gradually is as the 
welfare state values have been spreading, it is spreading a culture of 
poverty and a culture of violence. I want to read to you -- Leon Dash 
wrote a tremendous book called "when children want children: the urban 
crisis of teenage childbearing." And I want to read two quick passages, 
but it is absolutely an astonishing work. He says, "I began my research 
into adolescent childbearing" -- let me back up. Leon dash is a Black 
reporter, African-American reporter, at the "Washington Post," who was 
required to do this book to live in a public housing area for 18 months 
in an apartment, going out, listening to and probing people. Trained by 
the greatest investigative reporter of our time, bob Woodward, who 
insisted he go back again and again and again.
<P>
Listen to what he says. "I began my research into adolescent childbearing 
burdened with adult presumptions. "I assumed that the high incidence of 
teenage pregnancy among poor Black urban youths nationwide grew out of 
youthful ignorance both about birth control methods and adolescent 
reproductive capabilities. "I also thought that girls were falling victim 
to cynical manipulation by the boys, although the number of babies born 
to adolescent girls appeared to be awfully high for this to be the 
dominant pattern." Remember, this is a Black reporter who lived in the 
system. "I was wrong on all counts." I want to repeat this, because since 
all modern welfare state policy is based on the preceding paragraph and 
all of the recent surgeon general's arguments are based on the preceding 
paragraph, listen to his conclusion. "I was wrong on all counts. "among 
the adolescents in Washington, DC. Whom I interviewed, I found that 
teenage boys and girls as young as 11 knew more about sex, birth control, 
and their reproductive abilities than I had known at the same age. 
"others had had extensive school courses in sex education in the 6th or 
7th grade. "I found that the girls, far from being passive victims, were 
often equal or greater actors than their boyfriends in exploring 
sexuality and becoming pregnant. "girls were as often the leaders in 
their desire to have a child as the boys were. "I did not find one 
adolescent couple where both partners were ignorant about the results of 
sexual activity without the use of contraception. "in time, it became 
clear that for many girls in the poverty stricken community of Washington 
highlands, a baby is a tangible achievement in an otherwise dreary and 
empty future." 
<P>
I want to repeat this sentence because it's so powerful. "a baby is a 
tangible achievement in an otherwise dreary and empty future. "it is one 
way of announcing: I am a woman. "for many boys in Washington highlands, 
the birth of a baby represents an identical right of passage. "the boy is 
saying: I am a man. The desire for a child is especially acute among 
adolescents who were doing poorly in school. "they knew implicitly and 
had been told explicitly that they were not likely to graduate from high 
school. "these were the youths age 15 to 17 and still in the 7th grade 
who were at highest risk to get pregnant or father a child. "while the 
better students strove for a diploma, the poorer students achieved their 
form of recognition with a baby. "if the crisis of Black teenage parents 
was simply a matter of ignorance, then it might be relatively easy to 
solve, but poor academic preparation that begins in elementary school, 
the poverty that surrounds them, and social isolation from mainstream 
American life motivate many of these boys and girls to have children." 
<P>
The only other point I would say to you is that he estimated that on 
average, it took him -this is Leon dash, African-American, reporter at 
the "Washington post" -- on average, it took four months for him to get a 
girl to tell him the truth. That he listened and asked, listened and 
asked, came back a week later, listened and asked, four months. Which 
says what about most of your academic studies, most of your newspaper 
reporting, and most of your government servants? They're useless. They're 
totally misleading. Leon dash, until I'd read Olasky, I thought this was 
one of the most powerful books. It's a great book, and Leon dash did 
great work and deserves -- he has a new book -- a new report coming out, 
because he's gone back into the period before urban poverty to look at 
it, but it's a great work. The argument I'm trying to suggest here to you 
is that given what he's saying, this is not about birth control 
education. That, in fact, personal strength is the key to replacing the 
culture of poverty. 
<P>
If you really want to replace the culture of poverty, you've got to focus 
on personal strength, and you've got to redesign the entire system to 
focus on personal strength. Now, we're going to spend two hours on this 
later on, but let me, for today's purpose, outline for you nine vision 
level principles for personal strength. First, will this proposal help 
people become more responsible? You'll notice, we did this earlier, more 
productive and more safe so they can be prosperous and free so they can 
pursue happiness. Every time a proposal is clearly going to undermine 
responsibility and productivity, you ought to say to yourself: why are we 
doing this? If you went through the current welfare state and every 
single item which undermined personal strength was eliminated, you'd 
replace about 80% of the welfare state overnight, because it is actively 
destructive. It's not that it's failing to help. It is actually 
undermining, because it is sending the wrong signals. 
<P>
Second, everyone must have full citizenship, and that includes both the 
rights and responsibilities. That means when you see a homeless person, 
you say: fine, I'll go halfway. But you've got to go halfway. If you see 
somebody who is poor sitting there 17 years of age doing nothing: we will 
help you, but then you have to help yourself today. By the way, every 
successful program says it starts today. Not two years, not six months, 
today. Work begins day one. I just met with a sister who's in charge of 
covenant house, which is a catholic charity that has 41,000 girls a year 
who come through it. She said: our principle is simple. You have to work 
the first day. No other system works. So when you hear somebody say: 
we'll get around to it. You have two years to sit around and wait and 
then we'll start, well, if you're going to start, why wait two years? Why 
ruin two years of their life? Why entrench deeper the habits of not doing 
things? Three, everything costs something. 
<P>
There is no free lunch. And as a citizen, you have some obligation to 
help out a little at all times. The 19th century traditionalists have a 
wood pile next to the mission house, and when the homeless showed up, 
they cut wood before they ate. Because if you wouldn't cut wood, you 
weren't prepared to do your share. And they cut wood both for themselves 
and for one widow, because you have an obligation to have dignity by 
contributing. Think about that model compared to the current model. Again 
that's Olasky. Four, reward what you want to encourage, punish or make 
more expensive what you want to discourage. How's that for turning the 
welfare and tax codes on their head? You want to reward savings? Make it 
tax-free. What do we do? We punish savings and we reward credit. Go 
through the whole list. You want to reward entrepreneurship? Make it 
advantageous. You want to reward going to work? Have a very low marginal 
tax rate when you go to work. We do just the opposite. The FICA tax gives 
you a very high marginal tax rate as soon as you get a job.
<P>
Ask any young person the first -- how many of you had that shock the 
first time of getting a paycheck? Raise your hand if you got a paycheck 
and you were stunned how much smaller it was than you thought it would 
be. Okay. Five, these rules apply from childhood throughout your active 
life. In a few weeks, we're going to see a great entrepreneur on 
videotape who talks about he went to work when he was 9 or 10 years old 
because he wanted to buy a pony. Okay. It turns out in a recent "Wall 
Street Journal" study or a "Wall Street Journal" report of a study, over 
half of all the first-generation millionaires they interviewed had their 
first job by the time they were 10. It may be a lemonade stand, it may be 
cleaning up around the yard, it may be carrying newspapers, but notice 
how different that is from the welfare state mentality. Can you imagine 
what trouble I'd be in if I said every poor child should actually be 
earning money? Gingrich wants to exploit child labor. Return to -- you 
know, return to 19th century coal mines.
<P>
I just threw that in so the reporter who's distorting the class can go 
ahead and do it, will have some help. You know, and yet as a matter of 
pragmatic reality, when you see a study that says over half the 
first-generation millionaires rose because very early in life they 
acquired the habits, and then you start talking to middle-class parents: 
do your kids earn their allowance? Just think about it. The families that 
are healthiest, I'll bet you they earn them and they don't give them. I 
even know millionaires whose parents made them work for their allowance 
to instill the habit. You aren't given this money, you earn it. Then it's 
yours. If it's given to you, then it's really not yours. It's your mom or 
dad, and they have the strength. But if you earn it, it's your money. 
Now, if you're physically or mentally challenged, you should receive the 
best possible rehabilitation and assistance to lead the fullest possible 
life, and as I said earlier, I really feel very, very strongly about 
that. 
<P>
Seventh, the key is not a big leap. It is one day at a time with 
continuous improvement. That's the key to success. You've got to do a 
little bit every day. You've got to try to improve every day. You don't 
get this done in a big jump forward. You get it done one step at a time. 
And again, every time you run into people, they say, "well, that doesn't 
get you very far." No, but it's the right direction. It's the right 
movement. There's no hamburger flipping job. Any job beats welfare. 
Because it's the step, it's the beginning. It's where you get started. 
Now, in that framework, you want to build on opportunity and success, not 
focus on problems and failure. This is going to be one of my greatest 
challenges this year in the congress, is convincing our committees to 
have hearings on success. What are the 10 best addiction reform programs 
in America? What are the 10 best alcoholic programs in America? What are 
the 10 best small inner city schools in America? What works? So people 
can copy what works, not just study the pathologies.
<P>
And, ninth, and this one will obviously be -- fit my personality, or at 
least my experience: do not shy away from controversy. This is a choice 
between two value systems, two power structures, and two visions of 
America. Conflict is inevitable and direct. Blunt debate is desirable. 
That until you're prepared to engage the issue of personal strength and 
talk honestly about what it implies, you're not going to get anywhere, 
and that, by definition, is going to be controversial. Now, let me give 
you some examples. I would suggest that in American Civilization, that 
Americans favor work over idleness, saving over debt, family over 
individual chaos, helping your children over abandonment, responsibility 
over irresponsibility, learning over ignorance, and responsible 
citizenship over indifference. Now, and in every case, my point -- this 
is not just nice words. My point is in each case, the law and the 
government should favor the former over the latter.
<P>
That is, you ought to literally go through the tax code, the welfare 
code, the bureaucratic rules and regulations. You should go through the 
entire structure of government and say: are we sending signals that favor 
work over idleness? That favor saving over debt? That strengthen family 
over individual chaos? That give you an incentive and a legal structure 
to help children rather than abandon them? How are we doing this? Or, in 
fact, do we, without even realizing it, send the opposite signal? Go to 
work and we'll tax you and we'll kick you off Medicaid. Save and we'll 
raise your social security taxes. Try to get married and the earned 
income tax credit will take $4,600 away from you. Try to adopt a child 
and it can cost up to $50,000 to adopt a child, so they're trapped in 
foster care and they're trapped -- and, you know, people attacked me over 
the orphanage argument. This is a society which has artificially made it 
expensive to adopt children. Just the opposite of a good, strong 
pro-family environment. 
<P>
Now, the reason I said that we should look at the law and The government 
is because the law is a great teacher. And I really don't think you can 
fully appreciate the power of this. You know when a teacher is saying, 
"you ought to work hard," out in the yard there's an illiterate drug 
dealer driving a Cadillac, then the law is tolerating a lesson to be 
taught, and no matter how often you say it in the classroom, it's not 
going to work. So you've got to structure the law so that you are 
learning from your government and society what you wish to teach in the 
classroom. And if the classroom is teaching one thing and government and 
society is teaching another, you should assume that at best, you're going 
to have conflict, and at worst, that the ultimate reality of the society 
will drown in the classroom. Doesn't do any good to say, "lets teach it 
to them," if the law doesn't teach it, too. And so you've got to think 
about the law as a teacher. In addition, frankly, leaders can be 
teachers. 
<P>
It's very, very important to recognize that leaders play a very, very 
important role, and the way they model, what they say, where they go is a 
very important part of this process of teaching. Do you go to the boy 
scout jamboree or not? Do you go to the girl scout national meeting or 
not? Do you think the salvation army is important enough to visit or not? 
How does a leader spend their time and where do they go and who do they 
see and then what do they talk about? These are important factors. I wear 
a habitat for humanity pin. I understand the other night that on 
"Saturday night live" that the person that caricatures me also had a 
habitat for humanities pin on, but I'm sending a signal. I'm saying 
habitat for humanity is a good program and that others ought to have a 
pin, too. You pick the program you like, but tell me what you're doing 
that's important, because these are signals. They matter. They 
communicate. Public symbols and awards can teach. It's why the thousand 
points of light wasn't a bad idea. That's why when you find ways -- you 
know, as you'll see later on when we talk about Deming and quality, 
creating a Baldrige award at least created a sense of looking at things.
<P>
You know, people would say, "well, they must think quality's really 
important." Getting a scholarship, having a star student. These are good 
things to do, because they help the society talk to itself about what it 
values. And again, we come back to the core point about why civilization 
matters. Civilization must be learned, so values must be taught. And for 
Americans, personal strength must be at the center of those values and of 
our civilization. So if you go out and you start with head start and you 
look at the curriculum, how much are we emphasizing personal strength? 
How much are we communicating it? If you look at the way government 
bureaucracies work, how much do they talk about personal strength? Olasky 
makes the point that when you have 200 cases and you're a welfare worker, 
you have no personal contact. That in the 19th century, because it was 
all volunteer, the average was one to one or one to two. You actually 
knew person you were trying to help.
<P>
At 200 cases, you're filling out the paperwork and sending the check. So 
how can you teach personal strength? And so you've got to really think it 
through in terms of how we teach these things. Now, I want to take for 
the next few minutes one of the two people who I think is at the center 
of the revolution in American productivity and success in the 20th 
century. He's actually, interestingly enough, an Austrian by birth, came 
to the US. In the early 19 -- late 1920s, still alive, still writing in 
his mid 80s. Has an article out this month in the "Atlantic Monthly" in 
the February edition called "really reinventing government" by Peter 
Drucker. And it's just fascinating to me, here's a guy who in his -- I 
think he's now, like, 85 or 86, still teaches at Claremont college, still 
writes, clearly the greatest management writer of the 20th century. He 
and Edwards Deming, who I'll talk about in a little bit, who died at 93 
while still teaching, they're exemplary models of the idea that in the 
information age, our whole Sense of aging is going to change, which as I 
get older I think is cool. 
<P>
But what I want to talk to you about is the book that we have as a 
required reading today, which is Drucker's "the Effective Executive." 
Now, I hope all of you began the process of reading it. This is the 
paperback edition. I hope all of you have bought it, and I want you to 
keep it forever and I want you to mark, like, January of each year, and I 
want you to take it back up for at least four or five years and reread 
it. Now, you may say: why is Gingrich being nutty about this? I read this 
book for the first time in -- and you're going to have to really cue me 
on this, because I'm just going to go rolling for a while because this is 
so important. I read this book for the first time, I believe, in 1969 
when I was in Brussels working on my dissertation, and it shaped my 
entire life. In the first place, really good books lead you to people. In 
my case, Drucker led me to Alfred Sloan and he led me to who was the 
creator of general motors in its modern form, and he led me to George 
Marshall, who was the creator of the American army in its modern form.
<P>
And he said: these are two of the three greatest management leaders of 
the 20th century. Theodore Vail was the other one, and I have not read 
much on Vail. But I found Drucker himself came to the US., Was actually a 
philosophy professor, came to the US. He'd also done merchant banking in 
Vienna, and he began writing on management, and then in one of those 
great moments -- and you'll hear me talk a lot about the idea that life 
is lived organically by bonds of people. That is, if you look at great 
NFL coaches, you'll find out they often studied under great NFL coaches 
and actually find sort of schools of coaching. Well, the same thing's 
true of learning. Drucker was asked by Alfred Sloan, the man who created 
general motors, to come and spend a year in the modern -- he took over a 
company that was bankrupt and rebuilt it. It was on the verge of 
bankruptcy and rebuilt it. 
<P>
Sloan said to him, "I want you to come and spend a year inside general 
motors and explain to us how we operate." It was the greatest industrial 
corporation in the world. He wrote a book, I think it came out the year I 
was born in 1943, called "the concept of the corporation," which in terms 
of just reading a great work on management and history is extraordinary. 
He begins the book by saying, "I'm a little bit like the scholar of china 
who found he was almost ready to write and then there was another century 
he hadn't studied." And one day decided that he'd better start writing, 
because there were always going to be more things about china than he 
could ever learn, and if he didn't stop in ignorance and start writing, 
he'd never get anything written. So he said, "I confess up front general 
motors is so complex and so extraordinary, I don't really understand all 
of it, and this book is simply my effort to explain what I learned in one 
year." Which to me was a very helpful way of reminding us: we're never 
really experts. We never really know. There's always something more to 
learn. 
<P>
And then he outlined how general motors worked in the early 1940s. From 
that, he began developing his approach to management. And Drucker's 
central argument is that the key to -- remember that in his lifetime, the 
central challenge to the democracy is totalitarianism, whereas in 
Washington and Lincoln's lifetimes it was aristocratic kingship. Well, 
kingships were gone, basically. But the new threat of the 20th century 
was that the way you organize humans is you have a secret police state 
with a totalitarian leader. Mao Tse-Tung- in china, Joseph Stalin in 
Russia, Adolf Hitler in Germany, Benito Mussolini, and to some extent 
imperial japan, which was a mixed system with an emperor but with a 
police state, a military dictatorship. In that framework, Drucker's 
trying to explain: how can humans organize themselves to be productive? 
And how can they do so in a way that they share power, with no one 
becoming a dictator? And he creates the concepts of management, the 
principles of management, has written over 20 books and is, I think, 
without any question, the most widely read management consultant in the 
world today. 
<P>
More people -- more managers have read Drucker than anybody else. Now, 
he's older now, and there's a tendency to now skip his books and say, 
well, let's read the latest fad, which I would say is an enormous -- it's 
like skipping Shakespeare. You know, let's read the latest playwright. 
And I would say that at least two or three of Drucker's books should be 
permanent in every management school in the country, and at least one of 
them ought to be in every high school, and that's this one, because "the 
Effective Executive" makes this point. And this is a man, by the way, who 
wrote about the information age in the 1960s and was more accurate then 
than anybody who's writing about it now, because he understood core 
principles about human beings and how systems work. His point is: every 
one of you's an executive. The number of decisions -- I mean, just think 
about today. The class is over. How many of you came here by car? 
Two-thirds of you. How far could you go in a day by car? 600 miles? A few 
of you could go a lot further, but let's not admit that on public 
television. Draw a 600-mile radius. Look at that first choice. Second 
choice, you don't want to go very far today. Well, would you like to go 
to the movies? Would you like to go shopping? If you want to go shopping, 
there are within 30 miles of here 15 malls. Which mall would you like to 
go to? In a typical mall, there are four anchor stores and 280 shops. 
Which shop would you like to go to? Or would you rather go home and stop 
by blockbuster's and pick up a movie? There will be about 6,000 titles. 
Well, you don't want to do that, you're going to go by the county 
library. Or you'd rather go out and play softball, or you'd rather go 
hike in the mountains. My point is: you have at your fingertips such an 
enormous range of resources that you are the first generation in the 
history of the world in which every person is an executive.
<P>
Every person is controlling resources on such a scale that you have to 
think it through and you have to plan it and you have to make it work. 
And so Drucker's argument is if you're going to be an executive, because 
you can't -- you have to to do it. When you go to a grocery store, I 
think it's an average Wal-mart-mart has 100,000 items in it. I think 
there are some superstores, Publix and Kroger, that now are in about the 
same range. So you go to a grocery store, if you don't have a list either 
in your head or in writing, and you say, "I think I'll shop randomly," 
which some of you do -- I was going to say: don't feel guilt ridden. 
<P>
You looked right at me when you said that. I looked at three different 
groups of people. You're the only one who reacted badly. We know a lot 
more about you. My point's just what Drucker's trying to do in this 
little book, and as you know, it's only 178 pages. And what he's trying 
to say to you is: effectiveness is a set of learned habits. It goes back 
to why the bell curve is sort of a goofy book. Effectiveness can be 
learned. It's not a function of being charismatic -- and he's very clear 
in here. It's not a function of being charismatic, it's not a function of 
being good looking, it's not a function of even being smart. It's not 
even a function of working long hours. It's a function of knowing what 
you're doing, thinking it through, doing it systematically, which means 
you have to learn the habits.
<P>
And so what I'm going to do, we -- at one point I started to put up a 
series of Chyrons so you could actually read key things, and then I 
realized as I went back and reviewed the book, I had literally -- and 
this is an important thing about certain books in life. The bible is 
another one that fits this. A lot of books you just read. You go, "well, 
that was interesting. What were the three big points?" Then occasionally 
you run into a book you shouldn't do that. Cookbooks are that way. I 
mean, imagine you tried to read a cookbook the way you read a novel, and 
then you tried to remember a recipe. Okay? This is a cookbook for 
effective life. And so part of my suggestion -- I stopped because I 
decided what you really need to do is go through here, mark it down, and 
then go back, and at each point you need to say to yourself: what does 
this mean to me? Now, I'll give you a couple of examples. Notice that he 
starts by arguing that this is not about managing other people. This is 
about managing yourself. Now, I cannot tell you in terms of how I became 
speaker of the house and done all the different -- and people say to me: 
how can you teach a course here, teach part-time at the industrial 
college of the armed forces, serve as speaker of the house, represent the 
6th district, and have a TV show on Tuesday nights?
<P>
And the answer is this book. This book taught me a quarter century ago 
how to systematically discipline, plan, think through, delegate, trust 
others to build a system. Now, the day we were sworn in, when I got down 
as speaker after my speech and I spent about -- I spent I think about 40 
-- an hour, I think, on the house floor, I left. I had other things to 
do. I did not go back to the house floor until 2:15 in the morning, and 
for 14 hours I just worked. Why did I work? Because of this book. That's 
how powerful I think this book is. This is a book I refer to again and 
again and again. It's the first book I ask all of my members and all the 
senior staff to read. Not all of them have done it yet, and I'll start 
reminding them in the near future, because I can tell when they haven't 
done it. And you may say to yourself: how can you tell when they haven't 
done it? There's a section in here which talks about effective decisions. 
It's chapter 7. 
<P>
And I'm deliberately just going to jump around, because I just want to 
take illustrations, because this -- I would have to teach for three 
two-hour sessions to carry you through this book in detail, and I don't 
want the people to get the Cliff Notes version: newt thought these were 
the six big points. Every page of this book is incredible. If you will 
read it and then stop and say: okay, what did that mean in my life? How 
do I change my behavior? He says in here, on effective decisions, that 
you have to look for disagreement. I'm trying to find the exact reference 
here. Somebody may want to help me for a second. But he talks about the 
notion that you're always looking for an argument or a disagreement, and 
he cites the fact that Alfred Sloan would often say, "if everybody agreed 
instantly," he'd say, "let's postpone this decision for a week so we have 
the time to find something to disagree about." Because he wanted people 
to slow down and talk through the decision. He wanted to make sure that 
everybody in the room understand the decision, because if you just say, 
"yes," 
<P>
And then later you realize, "oh, that means you're cutting my department 
30%?" He doesn't want you to make the decision until you understand the 
decision. So when I watch my chairmen, if they rush something through, 
they haven't gotten Drucker yet. Because they're missing -- you want to 
cultivate all the disagreements before you decide. He has a section in 
here on -I think that particular reference is in "the elements of 
decision-making." He has a section in here in which he talks about 
building on strength. I've always vividly thought about this, because 
it's one of the great weaknesses of modern management, and it drives some 
of my associates crazy because they don't understand a particular style 
that Drucker emphasizes, and that, he says, flatly came out of both 
George Marshall and Alfred Sloan.
<P>
Now, what does building on strengths mean? Drucker's argument's real 
simple. He says: if you want a mountain, guess what you've got on both 
sides of it? Huh? You have valleys. If you want a plateau, you don't have 
a mountain. What does modern management -- what do modern human resource 
vice-presidents look for? We're not going to hire you because of -- we 
found valley "a" or we found valley "b." So you don't fit. You get 
enormous achievement in life if you focus on managing this, if you 
recruit strength. Why can I delegate and walk off? Because all around me 
there are people as powerful as Dick Armey and Tom Delay and John Casey 
and Nancy Johnson and Susan Molinari, and they're all -- they all have -- 
now, does every one of them have a down side? Of course. As some of you 
probably have noticed, so do i. And you'll notice, I never worry about 
the valleys. I knew when I said I'd teach a 20-hour course after becoming 
speaker that some idiot would deliberately distort what I said, so when 
we had the giraffe comment totally taken out of context, that's just one 
of the valleys. You can't go mountain climbing unless you're willing to 
have valleys. But if you assemble a team -- and this is one of the -- if 
you look at George Marshall and you look at Alfred Sloan, remember what 
Drucker says: Sloan would spend weeks thinking about personnel. He'd 
really try to be concerned. 
<P>
Now, this book is so important, we're going to come back to it two more 
times. And I beg all of you, read it, mark it up, think it through, come 
in with questions next week. We may even get to it a third -- another 
time. We're certainly going to get to it next week on entrepreneurial 
free enterprise, and we're going to get to it the last week when we're 
talking about citizenship. So mark it up, look for questions, look for 
things you don't understand, things you don't agree with, but we're not 
going to try to build any Chyron out of this. We're not going to say, 
"here are the three big ones." Every page of this, if you read it and 
think about it and study it, this was a work of genius. This is -- 
Drucker is, I believe, one of the great men of the 20th century, and this 
was an extraordinary effort on his part to lay out the lessons he'd 
learned. When he wrote this, he was already in late middle age. And so 
this is a book I wish every American citizen would someday read and 
understand its implication, which is: you are powerful. You're a free 
person in a free society at the beginning of the information age, and you 
have resources and capacities un -- that no king in the ancient world had.
<P>
Every citizen has opportunity, if we can figure out how to make that true 
and how to get them to learn. Now, having said that, let me also suggest 
to you that you've got to reestablish, as part of that, heroes. Notice 
that heroism teaches the values to be lived for. If you'll notice, 
Drucker, in a sense, talks about heroes. Alfred Sloan's extraordinary 
achievement in building the greatest industrial corporation in history. 
Truly one of the great, great studies. In Sloan's two works, "my 
adventures as a white collar man," which is his earlier memoir written 
just before world war ii, and "my years with general motors," are 
extraordinary books, well worth your reading, but Sloan is a great man. 
George Marshall may well be the most -- certainly the most disciplined 
and maybe in some ways the greatest American of the 20th century. He 
built the modern army from 200 -- or 170,000 men to 15 million in three 
years. 
<P>
One of the greatest leadership achievements in the history of the human 
race. And he was a man of such nobility that he rivals Washington in our 
lexicon of people who are truly noble. Theodore Vail created the modern 
telephone company, avoided nationalization, which was the current thing. 
But the whole concept in your book of readings today, "building a 
community of citizens," Don Eberly was the editor, the section by Dennis 
Denenberg on the role of heroes and heroines in the American story makes 
a very important point. And that is that when you are surrounded by 
heroes and heroines, when the pictures on the wall of your school are the 
pictures of real achievement, when you grow up thinking, you know, that 
you could be like Helen Keller, you could be like Clara Barton, you could 
be like Eleanor Roosevelt, you could lead a life that is dynamic and 
exciting, you could do things that are real, it's different than when you 
grow up without the -- because they, in a sense -- what heroes and 
heroines do is they remind us there are mountaintops and that humans get 
there, and that you, too -- not that you'll necessarily get there. 
<P>
Drucker says at one point: you're not necessarily ever going to be able 
to write like Mozart, but you can play like Mozart. So maybe you only get 
halfway up the mountain, but it beats being stuck in the swamp. And the 
purpose of heroes and heroines is to both give us a goal to strive for 
and to pull us above where we would normally be. In a free society, every 
person has a chance to be a little bit of a hero or a heroine every day. 
There's a Reagan line to that effect in his first inaugural. Now, I want 
you to watch a section which I always watch with great emotion because my 
best friend, who's now dead, and I went to see this many times when we 
were in high school. This is an excerpt from an older movie, and I want 
you to listen carefully to Charles Bronson as a gunfighter that just had 
a fight, all of the local -- these are American gunfighters who have gone 
to a Mexican village to save the peasants from a group of bandits. And 
it's " The magnificent seven."
<P>
It's a derivative actually of Curacao, who was a great classic, and the 
seven samurai. And the parents hid because they're not gunfighters. Later 
in the movie, they become very heroic and they help wipe out the bandits, 
but at the moment, the kids are ashamed of their parents. And watch this 
scene, because I think it tells you a lot about heroes and heroines. 
<P>
>>can we go with you, Renardo?<br>
>>no.<br>
>>you like us, don't you?<br>
>>I guess so.<br>
>>you're one of us, aren't you?<br>

<P>
>>yeah, I'm one of us, all right.<br>
>>take us with you, please?<br>
>>no.<br>
>>we're ashamed to live here. Our fathers are cowards. Don't you ever say 
that again about your fathers, because they are not cowards. You think I 
am brave because I carry a gun? Well, your fathers are much braver 
because they carry responsibility for you, your brothers, your sisters, 
and your mothers, and this responsibility is like a big rock that weighs 
a ton. It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the 
ground, and there's nobody says they have to do this. They do it because 
they love you and because they want to. I have never had this kind of 
courage. Running a farm, working like a mule every day with no guarantee 
will ever come of it. This is bravery.
<P>
Point being that if every person counts, then there may be no more heroic 
act than raising a child. There may be no more heroic act than earning a 
living or doing the right thing by your community. That heroism isn't 
just Horatio at the bridge. But in a free society, heroism is every man 
and every woman every day doing the best they can. Now, I want to remind 
you as you start thinking about these things and as we start applying 
them, we want to apply them in a framework of vision, strategies, 
projects, and tactics, so that we think them through at these four 
levels. But then you also want to discipline yourself into the habit that 
when you think you know what you're doing, that you go out and you listen 
to other people, you learn from other people, you help other people, and 
you lead other people, in that order. So when you think you've got it, 
you've got to go now and listen to see: well, does it make sense to them 
in their world and what are they thinking?
<P>
And I also want to remind you that the whole concept of this course is 
that these ideas are the beginning of a dialogue. This course is not 
about, you know, wisdom that we're guaranteed will work. This course is 
about starting a dialogue about: what is an American Civilization like? 
Now, dr. Minnix suggested for next week we got some great stuff, which 
we're going to codify and reproduce and get back to you on everybody who 
last week gave us their list of what they would teach immigrants, which 
is very helpful. Then we had the test, or the question was: if somebody 
who just arrived walked up to you and said, "what are the first five 
things I should do to learn to be an American," what would you list? 
Interestingly, I would say 70% listed "learn English" as the first thing. 
It was very interesting in terms of some national debates about 
bilingualism, but dr. Minnix suggested for next week that you just write 
us a couple paragraphs of one of two things: what is the best example in 
your own life of personal strength? Or, alternatively: what would be an 
example, again, in your own life, of a hero or a heroine?
<P>
And I think if you'd do that, what we're going to do is we're going to 
keep pulling together everybody's ideas, and I think you're going to find 
by the end of the quarter, we have some very interesting things to share 
with you, and that gives you a way of making it real. Let me stop now, 
because we have a couple minutes left. Questions? Reactions? 
<P>
The point you were saying about having people disagree with you and stuff 
like that, I was wondering on the first day of congress, when you made 
all the rules about the three-fifths majority for a tax increase and the 
open laws on the floor, I thought -- I thought those rules were effective 
from here on out for every congress, and then I learned that it was just 
for this congress, and I was -- and I thought, you know, well, gee, that 
gives democrats more power, you know. Assure.
<P>
>>that they're in the minority now, and that gives them so much more 
power. Is that why you did that? You mean it gives them more power 
because they could vote "no"? Because next time -- the reason you did 
that is because -that's a good question. In the constitution, the house 
and senate are very different. The senate is a continuing body, because 
only a third of the senators get elected every time. The house, however 
-- so the senate rules carry over. The house, though, is entirely a 
single body. And the house is in a situation where we all get elected 
every time, so every time we create a brand new house, so the rules are 
brand new every time. And the house -- under the constitution, the house 
controls its own rules, so the constitution limits us to do that, which 
is, I think, fine. But that's a good question. I think we have time for 
maybe one other question before John yells at me. Yes, ma'am. With the 
advent of the third wave, the political categories we place people, 
conservatives, liberals, populists, is that going to change, or is that 
-- yeah, my personal guess is that all of the political language of the 
last 30 years is gone. We just don't know it yet, and we don't know what 
the new language is, but that an information age, world market society on 
the scale we're describing is going to be dramatically, dramatically 
different, and we'll talk about that. We're going to spend two hours on 
Alvin and Heidi Toffler's third wave and American Civilization, and we 
may well get into that, and then we'll talk about it again at the last 
session of the course, which will be two hours on citizenship and 
community. Now, let me remind you that next week's topic is pillar three: 
entrepreneurial free enterprise as the great producer of wealth, 
solution, and opportunities. I'm going to talk about that. And next 
week's reading is to finish up "the Effective Executive" and to read 
chapters 7 and 11 of "building" -- of "Building A Community Of Citizens."

<h3>Renewing American Civilization: Class Five</h3>
Pillar Four: The Spirit Of Invention And Discovery,
	And The Development Of Pragmatism And Practical
	Common Sense<P>
February 4, 1995<P>
Reinhardt College<P>

The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt college
television, in Waleska, Georgia.  From Reinhardt college in Waleska,
Georgia, this is "Renewing American Civilization." In this, the fifth of 10
class presentations, Congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at
Reinhardt College, will continue his course, which presents the
foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American Civilization.
This week's lesson, pillar four, the Spirit of Invention and Discovery,
focuses on the spirit of invention and discovery and the development of
pragmatism and practical common sense as key characteristics of and
contributors to American Civilization.
<P>
Let me welcome everyone this morning.  Let me, in particular, welcome the
students of Mind Extension University.  And I want to remind everyone that
you can mail your comments to:  Renewing American Civilization, post office
box 6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065, or if you prefer, you can fax your
comments to 404-528-9806.  Or you can e-mail your comments to America
Online, which is at renewam@aol.com.  In addition, for those of you who
want to get the class transcripts and other class materials -and I should
mention that this is available on the Internet web page http//www.pff.org,
but if you check in, we automatically give you permission to reproduce it.
<P>

And I say that because one of the Internet memos we got, or the e-mail
memos we got this week was from somebody who has a totally different
bulletin board in a totally different place who was asking could he take
off the transcripts off of Internet and put them on their particular
bulletin board, and the answer is "yes."  We copyright so nobody can
copyright it.  That is, we wouldn't like to wake up Thursday morning and
have somebody who had copyrighted the whole course and I couldn't use it,
so we copyright it only for protective reasons, but, in fact, we encourage
people to reproduce these things.
<P>
Now, let me also remind folks that a lot of the ideas in the course are
carried out.  You can get either the "American Civilization" newspaper, the
video or audio tape of the course and the course readings by calling
1-800-to-renew, which is, for most Americans, still easier than figuring
out how to get on Internet, although the number getting on Internet's going
up all the time.
<P>
The framework of this course starts with the premise that America is a
unique civilization and that it has five pillars:  the historic lessons of
American Civilization, personal strength, entrepreneurial free enterprise,
the spirit of invention and discovery, and quality as defined by Deming.
And that as we go through these five pillars that define how American
Civilization works and study them, we will then, after we've spent two
hours on each of those, apply them to four areas, and the four areas to
which we will apply these pillars are, one, the third wave and how it will
affect American Civilization.  Two, creating American jobs in the world
market.  Three, replacing the culture of violence and poverty with a
culture of productivity and safety.  And, four, citizenship and community
in the 21st century.
<P>
Now, today's topic is the spirit of invention and discovery, which is
pillar number four, and we're going to talk a lot about the spirit of
invention and discovery, but I can't resist, since just before the class
started here at Reinhardt, I was asking y'all -- you know, I've been
talking a lot about Peter Drucker's "the Effective Executive."  Why you
should buy it, why you should use it?  For anybody who's watching us for
the first time, this is Drucker's "the Effective Executive."  It's
available in paperback.  It is, I believe, the best single volume on being
effective ever written.  I think as you all begin to encounter it, you're
having the same effect.
<P>
One of Drucker's points is that Effective Executives monitor their own
time.  That they actually, by 15-minute increments, will record how they
spend time just to find out:  what are they really doing with their time?
How many of you did that over the last week?  Okay, almost half of you.
What was your big learning?  What did you learn from doing that?
<PRE>
>> I have a lot more time than I thought.

>> you have a lot more time than you thought.  Who else?

>> I didn't spend the time where I actually thought that I had spent it.

>> what was the difference?

>> I think the big difference was I wasn't able to focus on the priorities
>>that I thought that I was focusing on.  I need to refocus my priorities.
>>

>> who else?

>> I spent a lot of time in the car, and I found that by planning on doing
>>things, like taking tapes or taking my recorder or whatever, I can
>>utilize that time rather than just being dead time.

>> okay.

>> I find that the telephone is interrupting and sidetracking me to other
>>areas that I need to be not so involved on, to keep focused on what I've
>>got to accomplish.

>> who else?

>> I found that if I wrote it down, that I stuck by it.  If I had it on
>>paper, then I'd actually do what I was planning on doing.

>> yeah, but, you know, if you planned it in advance, if you planned it,
>>like, the night before, if you planned it out in 15-minute increments,
>>you got a lot more done the next day.

>> yeah.

>> but it's hard to stick to that 15-minute increment when things come up
>>in the middle of the day and you go, "oh, my gosh, I have to take care of
>>this and this," and that sets your whole schedule back.

>> now, let me ask you something:  if you found, as you kept track of your
>>schedule, that that was happening to you every day, what would you do?

>> plan in time to --

>> Right, start saying, "okay, I really know that I'm going to spend two
>>hours every day doing things I didn't plan on, so I will block in two
>>hours every day."  Because part of the message is you have a finite
>>amount of time, and so -- and you're going to lose a fair amount of that
>>time because things will come up you can't avoid, so you have even less
>>time than you thought you had.
</pre>
So you'd better really decide:  what are my highest priorities?  And that's
what you do during the time you have available.  And then gradually, you'll
get into the habit, as I am today, you know, I now plan my schedule on an
annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, and sometimes hourly basis.
<P>
And I'll redesign my schedule three or four times a day and stop and say,
"we've got to change this, change this, add this, move this," and the
result is you're constantly coming back to first priorities:  what are the
things you have to get done?  And Drucker has a rule that you get 80% done
in 20% of the time. Yeah.  And then the other -- the rest of the time you
spend finishing it, and so his theory is if you get 80 done and then you
shift and you get 80 done, remember, five 80s is 400.  So in the length of
time it normally takes a person to complete the first 100%, under the
Drucker model, you're consistently dropping the 20% that's least important.
So you're actually getting four times as much done.  Do you all follow me?

<P>
And if you then set priorities so that you're actually focusing each time
on the most important priorities, it is amazing how it changes your
effectiveness.
<P>
So anyway I'm glad to see that at least half of you now are up to speed.
The rest of you -- everybody ought to, just for a few days, track your time
for 15-minute increments, and then look at what you thought you were doing
and look at what you're actually doing, and I think you'll all be very
surprised. And if you get in that habit and then the rest of Drucker's
"Effective Executive" works just as well.  That if you take each of the
ideas and actually do it, apply it to your life, don't just go, "that's
interesting," apply it to your life, you'll be shocked a year from now how
much more effective you are.
<P>
Now, for today, though, we're going to talk about the spirit of invention
and discovery.  And we deliberately talked about it as a spirit, because
it's not how to be a scientist or how to be an engineer or how to be an
inventor.  It's an attitude.  It's a way of thinking about things.  It's an
approach to life that emphasizes Inventing and discovering.  And in a way,
I think that America's uniquely committed to this, because the pioneering
spirit led to the spirit of invention and discovery.
<P>
Remember, pioneering occurs first in your mind.  Very important concept.
That what you have is a pioneer of the mind.  You think about going west.
You think about going to the mountains.  You think about reaching the
Pacific Ocean.  Lewis and Clark started by visioning in their own head the
idea of an expedition to the pacific.  You thought about creating a wagon
train.  It's something you'll see again when you come to Deming next week.
That the father of the quality movement talks about the idea that first
there has to be a theory.
<P>
You know, your theory may be:  if I put water on the stove in a pan and I
turn the stove on and the water bubbles and I take an egg out of the cold
thing called a refrigerator and I put it now on the hot thing called a
stove and I let it wait three minutes, it will cook.  That's a theory you
have of how eggs get cooked.  And if you don't have the theory before the
action, there's no reason for you to take the action.
<P>
That's part of why when you're young and you're first learning how to cook
and you don't quite get the theories right, like putting water in the pan,
and then you have a  whole -- and many of you probably had these kind of
experiences.  Or, you know, remembering that you're actually supposed to
put yeast in with the flour so it rises, or whatever it was that you goofed
up on when you were younger.
<P>
Now, if you think of all -- the American tradition is to be a pioneer in
your own mind, which in a sense is a quintessentially American sense of a
spirit of seeking the new.  More than any other country on the planet, we
have this constant passionate desire to reach out to something new.  I
mean, that's why New, Improved Tide is a term that's been used now for 30
years or 40 years.  I mean, every other year there's a new, improved Tide.
And it works.  It works every time.  That's why they've been successful for
so long.  But this is a nation where if you say to people, "wow, they're
opening a new mall," or "there is a  new" -- you know, "there's a new six
flags ride," or "have you seen the new Nikes" or whatever, but it's a very
powerful word, and it's because I think we are permanently intrigued with
the idea of being at the edge of the future.
<P>
There's a fascinating book called "At the Edge of the Future" which argues
that Los Angeles -- that Americans kept moving west until they reached Los
Angeles.  That you can't go any further on the continent, and so they sat
around waiting for the earthquake.
<P>
Think about California.  There was recently a James Gardner -- a "Rockford"
movie where they had the fire and Malibu, they had the earthquake, and they
had the riots all in one movie, and at the end of the movie, he's still
staying in Los Angeles, and, of course, millions of people are, but there's
a sense of overcoming that Americans are just remarkable at overcoming.
You know, you know there's going to be eight inches of snow in Washington
today.  People will go rush about and overcome.  I mean, it's automatic.
<P>
And so the sense of the spirit of seeking the new.  I think that this topic
matters because inventions and discoveries, science and technology change
things dramatically.  And this is a point I want to make just for a second,
because it's one of the places where bureaucracies and academics least
understand the world.  People are used to this kind of a gradual change.
<P>
And when you read government reports and you look at most academic studies,
they're talking about very, very incremental change. But if you have a
stagecoach and then you have a railroad and then you have an airplane --
and this is what Drucker means by the word  "discontinuities" -- that you
can say over here:  we're going to really improve stagecoaches, make them
lighter, better wheels, you know, grow bigger horses, et cetera, train
people so they can really change the horse teams fast.  Then you get to a
railroad.  A railroad is not a better stagecoach.  A railroad takes a huge
capital investment.  You've got to lay all the rails.  You've got to build
the engine.  You've got to find a system of procuring -- early on it was
wood, and then it became coal, and then it became fuel, diesel fuel, or
oil.
<P>
Okay?  So now you've got:  well, we'll build better rails, they'll last
longer.  One of the early problems in the early American railroads,
Boorstin's book "the Americans" really describes some of this.  Early
American railroads were built with very shoddy ties and with iron that
wasn't strong enough, so they wrecked all the time because the Americans go
very fast.  Europeans complained -- would talk about how exhilarating it
was to be on American railroads because it scared you to death and they
wrecked all the time.  Then you come over here, and the airplane is a
totally different system.  Doesn't require rails, but does require
airports.
<P>
And it occurred to me the other day, I mean, it's just an interesting
study, the fastest way to -- if you want to go from this point to this
point and the airport is here, you actually move away from your destination
to get there faster. Just think about the logic of that.
<P>
Each of these has its own objective requirement.  Each of these is an
invention.  This one was invented probably by the Assyrians, who invented
chariots. This one was invented, of course, by George Stephenson in England
about 1820 and became very popularized.  And this was invented by the
Wright brothers.  But what I'm trying to suggest to you is that inventions
like this dramatically change our lives, and as you'll see later on, one of
the great weaknesses of the modern period is when we run into a problem in
the period of the counterculture, we just stop and get fascinated by the
problem.
<P>
Historically, Americans immediately said, "so what's the solution?"  And
the passion was not for studying the problem. The passion was for finding
the solution.  And you're going to see that right now, because you're going
to see a video about one of the most remarkable Americans who is almost
never studied in the counterculture because all of his values are exactly
wrong. He was successful, he was a work -- he was very work-oriented, he
was highly creative.  He was generous, and he was a unique individual who
changed the history of America as much as any single person other than
Washington and Lincoln.  And so I'd like you to spend just a couple minutes
now with Thomas Edison.<P>
<PRE>
>> born on February 11th, 1847, in Milan, Ohio, Thomas A. Edison applied
>>for his first patent, an electrical volt recorder, in 1868 at age 21.
>>Before he died at age 84 in October of 1931, Edison had received patents
>>for an incredible 1,097 U.S. Inventions and changed the world we live in
>>forever.  Although he is perhaps best known for inventing the
>>incandescent lamp, which now lights the dark of night for people the
>>world over, Edison's genius gave us hundreds of other inventions that
>>have become indispensable parts of our daily lives, from simple
>>conveniences like waxed paper, band-aids, and the gummed envelopes in
>>which millions of letters are mailed every day, to major contributions,
>>such as the phonograph, the motion picture projector, the automatic
>>telegraph system, the universal electric motor for AC and DC current,
>>fluorescent lights, the alkaline storage battery, Edison Portland cement,
>>the fluoroscope, which Edison chose not to patent because of its
>>universal need in surgery and medicine, and hundreds of others.  Among
>>them are the first embossing machine, Edison's electric pen, the
>>mimeograph machine, and an early Edison ediphone.
</pre>
Here we see a display on the invention that gave Thomas Edison the most
difficulty, the storage battery.
<P>
In fact, after 9,000 experiments, all failures, his assistants tried to
discourage him.  "those are not failures," he responded. "those are 9,000
things we've learned that don't work."  And after 41,000 more experiments,
he gave the world his nickel alkaline storage battery, which for more than
75 years has been used on everything from London transit buses to the
submarines of the U.S. Navy.
<P>
Thomas Edison gave birth to the motion picture industry with his invention
of the kinetoscope, kinetograph, and kinetophone, which are displayed here
and which combined made possible the sound movies we all enjoy today.  Of
all of his inventions, Edison's personal favorite was the phonograph,
because the phonograph offered music in every home and he felt that music,
next to religion, has done more to elevate man than any other thing since
the birth of Christ.
<P>
Charles Kettering, famous in his own right as an inventor, said that as
surely as if they were named in Edison's last will and testament, every man
and woman alive was the beneficiary of the labors of this great man.  For
he was the founder of organized research and gave us the principles of
modern electronics, and today as we watch television, listen to the radio,
pound a typewriter, send a telegram, talk on the telephone, go to the
movies, listen to recorded music, turn on an electric switch, take the
waxed paper from a loaf of bread, or put a band-aid on our finger, we are
in debt to the genius of Thomas Edison.
<P>
His friend and neighbor, Henry Ford, called him the world's greatest
inventor and worst businessman.  However, in 1931, the year that Edison
died, businesses that were created by his inventions amounted to
$25,683,544,000.  This was twice the total of all federal, state, and local
government budgets.
<P>
Edison said that anything we had the mental capacity to conceive, we had
the physical ability to produce.  To Thomas Edison, nothing was impossible.
Yet all this man wanted was to make the world an easier, more enjoyable,
and comfortable place to live.  Edison himself said, "if I have spurred men
on to greater effort and if our work has widened the horizon of man's
understanding even a little and given a measure of happiness in the world,
I am content."
<P>

How many of you had any notion that he was that broadly the base of your
life?  Okay.  About a fifth of you.  And there are a couple things here.
One is, inventions change everything.  I mean, the discovery of the polio
-- or discoveries do.  The discovery of the polio vaccine changed
everything.  The invention of the electric light which we're using, the
invention of television which we're using, the invention of the satellite,
which is how we're projecting the  show -- this particular class is shown
all over the country by things that are inventions.
<P>
So one thing, you know, that we're going to argue today is that you want to
have a society which focuses again and again on inventions.  But there's a
second part:  look how persistent he had to be.  50,000 experiments to get
to the electric battery? 4,000 to get to the electric light.  And think of
what lessons children could learn if it was routine in third, fourth, and
fifth grades to study Edison, and how much it would liberate you.
<P>
I mean, the fact that you may not be a great academic or you may not like
sitting still or you may not like doing whatever it is that modern
academics wants you to do, people like Edison would all have been
considered hyperactive children.  They were too aggressive, too energetic,
too persistent, and far from seeing himself as a victim, I think it's a
true story that Edison was very hard of hearing and actually used his teeth
on the edge of the phonograph machine in order to check the records,
because he couldn't hear.  He was a very persistent man.
<P>
And think about all the habits we ought to be teaching ourselves just
coming out of the life of this one man.  He actually contributed about
one-sixth of the gross national product came out of his inventions by the
1930s.
<P>
Now, to give you an example of how it applies to the modern world and why
I'm an optimist.  People -this is not just glandular.  It's based on
serious thought about how the modern world works.  Bill Loughrey, who's a
good friend of ours at scientific Atlanta, he has the following rule:  the
computer chip now has over one million times the power of a vacuum tube for
the same price.  If the federal government had improved in efficiency as
much as the computer has since 1950, we would only need four federal
employees, and the federal budget would be $100,000.
<P>
Now, the analogy's not actually -- is not actually a valid analogy, but
it's a wonderful way of thinking about this.  There's a similar version of
that that talks about cars.  You'd pay, you know, $300 for a car and would
get 90 million miles to a gallon.  That's how dramatic the computer chip
industry is.  You're about to have the same explosion in biology, as we'll
discuss later.  I mean, there are places where suddenly -- and this is why
I talked earlier, people get used to the idea of, "okay, this is what my
life will be like."  And then suddenly you hit a discontinuity, and now
it's here.
<P>
This is what happened to physics in the first half of the 20th century.
>From Einstein around 1913 to the atomic and hydrogen bombs.  This is what
happened to the computer chip -- to the computer beginning about 1950 to
the transistor, which was discovered in 1949.  This is what happens right
now.  We're just seeing the beginnings of the DNA revolution in biology.
It will do this.
<P>
And that's why sometimes what you're really looking for -- remember
Drucker's "Effective Executive," you're sitting right  here -- what you're
really looking for all around you is:  where are the places that are about
to go through this discontinuity?  Because that's where the big money is,
that's where the big change is, that's where you have the real
opportunities.  Now, the point at one level of this -- of focusing in on
this as a pillar is that as technology changes, we change.  The technology
has a tremendous impact on us.
<P>
I mean, why do more people move to Florida?  Because of air conditioning.
And try living in Florida in mid summer without air conditioning.  It's a
big factor in the rise of Florida as a year-round place that was the
popularization of air conditioning after World War II.  Similarly, I think
you've got to look at the degree to which change occurs over time.  One of
the people -the person who is the center of next week is W. Edwards
Deming, and Dr. Deming was born in 1900, and he is a man who taught the
Japanese the concept of quality.  And his lifetime was a lifetime of
commitment.
<P>
I want to use -- next week we're going to talk about his ideas in detail.
But what I want to do for a few minutes today is to get you to think about
a lifetime, your own lifetime, somebody else's, because Dr. Deming, who is
a man who really did change history.  He taught the Japanese the concept of
quality.  He came back home and taught us a lot about it.  He had a set of
ideas that are very, very profound about how the world works.
<P>
And yet he is well worth looking at in his own right, but he's also a very
useful analogy for us, because Dr. Deming was born in 1900.  He was very,
very active.  He stayed very busy, and he was still teaching four days a
week, 10 hours a day, when he died at the age of 93.  He died in 1994
before his 94th birthday.  Now, what I want you to think about is: look at
1900 to 1994 as a lifetime of change.  I mean, think about Dr. Deming's
lifetime.  1903, the airplane is invented by the Wright brothers.  1903,
the first motion picture with a -- with a plot, first American motion
picture with a plot, "the Great Train Robbery," was made, which you see at
Disneyworld.  1903, Henry Ford begins his first mass-produced automobile
and begins lowering the cost of buying a car.  After that comes commercial
radio, commercial television, microwave ovens.
<P>
I mean, just go down the list sometime.  Dryers, refrigerators.  I'm old
enough, I still remember the ice man.  That was the very end of the age of
the ice man when I was a child.  I know friends who remember when
electricity came to their home.  All of this occurred in Deming's lifetime,
so if you will, I mean, think about the notion what a lifetime -- what an
incredible lifetime that was and how much the world changed.  And guess
what?  It's going to change for us, too.  Now, to give you a sense of how
-- in Deming's personal life, one lifetime, let's take a look at the spirit
of flight, and look from the Wright brothers to the space shuttle, all of
which occurred in Deming's lifetime.
<P>

We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not
because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal will
serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because
that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to
postpone, and one we intend to win.
<PRE>
>> altitude 4200.

>> you're a go for landing, over.

>> putting down feet two and a half, picking up.  Two and a half down, four
>>forward, four forward.  Drifting to the right a little.  Two and a half,

>> that's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

>> three, two, one, touchdown.

>> look at the sand! Man! [cheering and applause]

</pre>
All of that is in one man, one lifetime.  Now, which then leads you to ask
about your own lifetime.  You see, one of the great failures of the
counterculture and one of the places where it broke with the American
tradition, if you remember the thesis I've been developing that you've had
a continuous American pattern of cultural thought up to 1965, then you had
a discontinuity, a breakdown, and we are now beginning to reassert
traditional American Civilization.
<P>
One of the problems you're going to see is the way in which -- and just
think about all the news stories you see and all the analysis you see which
is static, and let me show you how it works.  The current counterculture
view of technology is from us to the past.  Okay? So everything is
described as though the present is the end of history.  In fact, the term
"history," history means that's past, but so that, for example, my favorite
line was a woman who wrote Wernher von Braun during the effort to get to
the moon, and he was the head of the program at Redstone arsenal over in
Huntsville, Alabama, and she wrote him and she said, "you know, you
shouldn't try to go to the moon.  "you're breaking God's will.  "why don't
you stay home and watch color television the way God intended?"  Because
wherever we are now is stasis.
<P>
Now, there's a very different way to think of it, and this is the way I
think -- this is one of the things which has made American history, I
think, remarkable, and it's a much more accurate view of technology.
Notice where it puts you.  The reason you study the past is to learn the
future.  You're in the middle.  So not only do you look at Edison, but you
say:  okay, where are the Edisons of 1995?  Where are the Wright brothers
of 1995?  Where is the -- what's our generation's equivalent of the Apollo
program to get to the moon?  So you're constantly seeing yourself in a
continuum where on the one side is the past, on the other side is the
future, you're in the middle, but it's a dynamic environment, because you
always have this opportunity to invent the future.
<P>
And let me put it in actual terms.  Take Deming's lifetime, 1900 to 1994.
Imagine that a child was born last year and lived to be Deming's age, 2088.
A way of illustrating that would be to do this.  This is the amount of
change in Deming's lifetime.
<P>
So you can make one of two assumptions.  The Toffler assumption is change
is accelerating.  Now, if you think change is accelerating, let's say
there's going to be twice as much change in the next lifetime.  If that's
true, then this would be the amount of change that the child born last year
will live through.  Now, when you start describing:  what does lifetime
learning mean, what should you prepare your life for, how will you earn a
living?
<P>
I mean, can you imagine in 1900 saying to somebody that "by the time you're
27 or 28, you can go to work for eastern airlines"?  "by the time you're
45, you can be flying routinely as a transcontinental pilot."  In 1900,
they hadn't invented the car -- I mean, they, hadn't invented the airplane
yet.  I mean, imagine you'd said to somebody born in 1920, the year that
the -- the year before the first commercial radio station, KDKA in
Pittsburgh, opened up, what if you'd said to them, you know, "you're now 3
years old.  "you could have a future in television"?  Which would have
been, by the way, about right.
<P>
That's -- do you all see what I'm talking about?  It's a dynamic.  It's not
a static.  It's not past.  You look to the past in order to create the
future.  And you're always constantly saying to yourself:  wow, what comes
next?  I mean, how can you be a pessimist?  If you think about all the
breakthroughs of his -- of Deming's lifetime, which would be a great paper.
I mean, the discovery of Penicillin, the invention of the Polio vaccine,
or the discovery of the Polio vaccine, the inventions of new kinds of
surgery, the development of the Cathode Ray Tube -- I mean, of cat scans.
The development of all sorts of things that will -- remember, x-rays were
invented when Deming was already a mature adult.
<P>
Now x-rays are something you get routinely when you go to the dentist.  I
mean, x-rays were very expensive in Texas in 1948.  I talked to a doctor
who brought the first x-ray to Dallas.  It was a big deal.  If we'd had the
modern government controls, they probably would have only had three there
today because it was expensive and it was new.
<P>
Now, one of the people who's trying to say to us, "be optimistic, be
aggressive, be risk-taking, the world is changing," is George Gilder.  And
I want you to look just for a minute at Glider's very, very optimistic
vision of the future, and then I want to share with you very briefly a
point that Gilder makes about how big the change is going to be.

<P>
In the next decade, it's going to be possible to put a billion transistors
on a single sliver of silicon.  That will be shortly after the turn of the
century.  A billion transistors is equivalent to 16 Cray Ymp supercomputers
that would cost some $320 million to buy today.
<PRE>
>> that's extraordinary.

>> that kind of computer power will be manufacturable for less than $100
>>shortly after the turn of the century.  That means approximately a

For example, the home life.  I mean, what the computer allows connected to
fiber optic networks is a return to the home.  The home can become the
center of production in the society again.  Each person with a personal
computer can command the creative power of a factory tycoon of the previous
era and the communications power of a broadcast executive. It empowers
people.

Gilder is one of the great writers of modern times.  His book on wealth and
poverty is maybe the classic modern restatement of entrepreneurial free
enterprise.  This is "Microcosm," and if you want to pursue just the scale
of the ideas, the sense of how big the change is going to be, just in one
area, remember that there are other areas, like biotechnology, the DNA
revolution, that are equally powerful, but he does a neat thing.
<P>
He quotes from people.  This is from Carver Meade.  "listen to the
technology and find out what it is telling you."  Let me explain to you
about this notion of you let the technology draw you forward, let the
technology tell you what you're doing.  He then has -- and I'm quoting him
from.  Page 61, he quotes Victor Hugh go in "Les Miserables":  "the common
sand that you tread under foot, let it be cast into the furnace to boil and
melt, and it will become a crystal as splendid as that through which
Galileo and Newton discovered the stars."  That is, the sand can be
converted into fine crystal and into telescopes and other things.  What
else is sand converted into?  Computer chips.

>>sounds -- that supply creates demand.
</pre>
Now, a modern economist, because all modern government economists start,
and all -- virtually all bureaucrats and academics start with the idea of
continuities, so if you're going to measure demand, the demand is for
postal service.  Then you say:  somebody invented the fax.  But there was
no demand for the fax.  Because nobody knew it existed.  The second they
learned it existed, guess what?  There is huge demand for the fax.  Huh?
Now it's e-mail. Cellular telephones.  There were no cellular telephones.
People had very expensive radio telephones which only very, very wealthy
people or government institutions could afford, and then one morning
somebody invented the cellular phone.
<P>
How many of you have a cellular phone?  Look at this.  I mean, what a --
now, granted, you're an upper middle-class group of people and you're all
sort of semi-wealthy, at least by the standards of Bangladesh, but, you
know, you look around, there are 20 -- I think the number now is 25 million
people use cellular phones. 10% of the country has a cellular phone.  It
will probably be 40% by the end of the decade, and it's routine, right?  I
mean, there are now billboards telling you how to order your domino's or
your pizza hut on the way home so it will be there by the time you are.  I
mean, just think about that concept.  I mean, home delivery pizza was an
invention which promptly found a demand.
<P>
It's very important.  If the concept is that -- and this is why all modern
liberal economics is essentially wrong.  I mean, if the concept is supply
precedes demand, then what you want to do is maximize the number of
inventors.  If the idea is that demand is a limited thing, what you want to
do is what the federal reserve does, which is control demand.  But, in
fact, if you are an entrepreneurial, "spirit of invention and discovery"
oriented society, you never worry about it, because you figure out people
will come along and invent the next phase of winning.  Microwave ovens,
which are now invaluable.
<PRE>

>>demand, so it's not just you've studied the market.  You have a vision of

>>what they need.
</pre>
Now, let me give you an example out of the counterculture of how different
it is.  I think of it as imagine that Thomas Edison invented the electric
light today in the age of the counterculture.  I think it would be reported
on the evening news in a story which began, "the candlemaking industry was
threatened today."  Okay?  Or imagine the Wright brothers going into EPA
and OSHA to get permission to try to fly at Kitty Hawk?
<P>
Have you ever thought about what it would have been like, you know, having
to do the surveys, having  to -- you know, how unlikely it would be that
they'd ever get around to doing it? What I'm trying to suggest to you here
is that invention and discovery are a matter of mind, that they are a way
of life. That, in fact, people -- you have to think about the eccentricity,
the energy, the spirit, the attitude that led to this.
<P>
One of the really superb works on this is Peter Collier and David Horowitz,
their biography of the  Fords.  This is quite a remarkable book, and I want
to just share with you a couple of quick examples from the history of Henry
Ford.  This is the prologue:  "Detroit, June 4th, 1896.  "it was after
midnight when a light summer mist started to fall outside the backyard
workshop and Henry Ford began putting the final touches on the
peculiar-looking machine which had obsessed him in one form or another all
his adult life."  Remember, this is June 4th, 1896. "on most other
evenings, Felix Julian, the old man who lived in the flat next door to the
Fords and had cleared out his half of the shed to give the machine more
space to grow, would have been there too, sitting in a corner of the shed,
watching the painstaking assembly in silent awe.  "in fact,  Ford had often
arrived home from his daytime job" -- compare that to the modern world.  He
worked all day -- "his daytime job as chief mechanic at Detroit's Edison
illuminating company, to find Julian sitting alone in the shadows staring
at the odd contraption slowly taking shape, impatient for him to hurry
through dinner and get to work. "But now on this night of nights, the old
man had unaccountably decided to go to bed early, and so he missed the last
act of the great drama.  "It was almost 2:00 AM. When henry and his friend,
Jim Bishop, finished work.  "although he was haggard from having gone two
nights without sleep,  Ford's recessed gray eyes flashed with excitement.
"his invention was finally ready for a test, but as he began to maneuver it
toward the door, there was a revelation of the myopia everyone who knew him
accepted as a paradoxical part of his visionary nature:  the machine was
too big to fit through the doors of the shop."
<P>
How would you like to have the modern media covering live this
self-proclaimed genius's failure to measure his car?  Can you imagine the
ridicule he would have faced?  And notice again, he didn't apply for a
government grant.  He didn't say, "I can't invent unless you subsidize me."
He worked all day to go home and work all night. "without hesitating,
Ford seized a maul and began to knock out an opening in the brick walls.
"Henry rolled the vehicle he later referred to as the baby carriage, a
light chassis on four bicycle wheels, out into the night.  "the metaphor
came naturally.  "it was as if the womb of his creativity, gravid since
boyhood, was finally opening.  "
<P>
Ford would tell what happened next thousands of times in the coming years,
never tiring of the repetition, always speaking in the tones of wonderment
most men use to describe the birth of their first born.  "as it became worn
smooth with frequent retelling, the story eventually came to have the
understated simplicity of a creation myth.  "quote, it was raining.  "Mrs.
Ford threw a cloak over her shoulders and came outside.  "Mr.. Bishop had
his bicycle ready to ride ahead and warn drivers of horse-drawn vehicles,
if, indeed, there were any to be met at such an hour.  "I set the choke and
spun the flywheel, and as the motor roared and sputtered to life, I climbed
aboard and started off.  "the car bumped along the cobblestones of the
alley as Mr.. Bishop rode ahead on the bicycle to warn any horse-drawn
vehicles.  "we went down grand river avenue to Washington boulevard.  "then
the car stopped".
<P>
Again, imagine the modern media.  "we discovered that one of the igniters
had failed.  "when we had it repaired, we started the car again and drove
back home.  "both Mr.. Bishop and I went off to bed for a few winks of
sleep.  "then Mrs..  Ford served us breakfast, and off we went to work as
usual."  This is the beginning of the second largest industrial company in
the world, in his back yard, in a garage, in his spare time, after he works
all day.  He goes on to say, by the way, "the rest of the week,  Ford drove
all through Detroit.  Jim Bishop bicycled ahead of him as a flagman,
stopping at saloons and stores to tell people to come out and hold their
horses.  "one day, the little vehicle knocked a man down.  "by the time
Ford had turned off the engine and climbed down, the victim lay on the
ground caught between the front and rear wheels.  " Ford leaned over and
discussed the problem with him.  "should he start the engine again and
finish driving over him, or should he try to move the car?  "finally,
another man appeared and helped Ford pick up the quadricycle and move it
off the prostrate man, who stood up, dusted himself off, accepted  Ford's
apologies, and walked off, victim of the first recorded auto accident."
<PRE>
>> too bad an attorney wasn't around.

>> That's right. Just when you need a good trial lawyer, where are they,
>>right?  But again, we tend not to realize how different these things are.
>>"Theodore Roosevelt, the first president to ride in a car, although he
>>would be followed along the Hart Ford parade route by a horse-drawn
>>carriage just in case there was trouble, and would be praised the next
>>day by one newspaper editor for, quote, the display of courage typical of
>>him.  "by about 1900, there were, in fact, 4,000 cars that had been
>>manufactured in America.  Three-fourths of them were steam and electric."
>>
</pre>
Again, if you'd had a government study in 1899 of the most probable system
for propelling cars, it probably might well have come out steam.  It would
not necessarily have come out gasoline.  It was not obvious in 1899 that
gasoline worked.
<p>
There are a couple of other examples of this, though.  In 19 -and this is,
again, so hard to get across in the age of the welfare state and the
counterculture.  Success grows out of failure.  Remember the Edison point,
we've had 9,000 experiments that we now know don't work?  That's progress?
And think about the mindset.  "in 1900, 38 new companies began production.
"another 47 the following year, and 57 more in 1902.  "but others were
falling by the wayside.  27 companies failed in 1903, 37 more in 1904.
"already in the field were Franklin, Pierce, Locomobile, Packard, Stanley,
names to conjure with in the future.  "in 1903, a former carriage maker
named William Durant bought the Buick company and made it the centerpiece
in a grandiose plan to assemble the combine that would eventually become
General Motors.
<p>
"Ransom Olds," for whom Oldsmobiles are named, "stole a march on all the
producers with his vision of a cheap small car, the curved dash two-seater
Oldsmobile costing $650, including mudguards.  "a friendly and familiar car
of the sort that inspired popular songs.  "at this historic moment, Henry
continued to put his efforts into racing, hoping that a fast car would
attract potential investors."  Talks about how he built cars and he
actually won races, and that was the beginning.
<p>
So here's a guy who has to win a race to raise the money to create the
company which invents mass-produced automobiles, which lowers the price of
cars, popularizes the automobile across the entire planet, and invents the
modern automobile age.  And he begins working at night after working all
day in his garage. Compare that to the modern attitude:  if you don't
subsidize me, how can you expect me to do it?  If you don't loan me the
money, how can you expect me to do it?  It's exactly wrong and exactly not
the way the real world works.
<p>
Which gets me to the question I want to close with for this first hour:
how does a pro-invention and discovery way of life work?  That's what I
want you to think about for -- just ask yourself for a second.  I mean,
think about the stories we've heard so far about Edison, about Henry  Ford.
Think about the models we've looked at in terms of change.  What kind of
attitude would you have if this was a society that every morning decided
that we wanted all of our citizens to have a vision of themselves inventing
the future?  What would some of the characteristics be?  Ask yourself:  how
would you wake up?  How would you confront life?  What would your mood be?
What would you think like?  Not necessarily what would you think about.
<p><pre>
>> you'd want to get up in the morning.

>> yeah.  Huh?  You'd want to get up.  Now, again, psychologically, think
>>of the person on welfare who has all day long to invent the automobile,
>>but they have nothing to get up for, because we haven't found a way to
>>plant inside them this sense of wanting to get up.  Somebody said you'd
>>be optimistic. Of course you would.  9,000 down, 41,000 to go.  What a
>>great business.  You'd have a quest for knowledge.  Huh?

>> doesn't fear motivate sometimes?

>> sometimes.  What's a good example of fear?

>> hunger.  Afraid of --

>> hunger is a good example.

>> it is.  When you've got meals to put on the table --

>> that drives entrepreneurs.  Putting the meal on the table drives the
>>entrepreneur.  Show me a fear that would drive the inventor.

>> mortality.

>> mortality.  Can I discover a cure for cancer?  I mean, the number of
>>people who have a member of their family who get sick and that's why
>>they're research biologists.  Somebody who has a friend who goes blind,
>>and that's why they go to work on inventing a computer for the blind.  Or
>>somebody who has a friend who's in a car wreck, and that's why they go to
>>work to invent a better way to rehabilitate.  I mean, fear is a real
>>component. What other kinds of motivations?

>> curiosity.

>> that's right.  Curiosity.  I mean, a big motivation, we tend to be -- if
>>it's not beaten out of us, and the beating can be cultural.  One of the
>>great problems we have now in the inner city is that kids who do well are
>>often literally attacked by kids who aren't doing well.  So they're
>>psychologically under barrage.  I mean, you can beat out of people
>>healthy behaviors, but curiosity is a natural human behavior, it seems to
>>me, and it's one of the things that keeps me going, is I get up every
>>morning curious.  I'm just, you know, what will happen next?

>> looking for cookies.

>> looking for cookies.  I mean, since I'm psychologically 4
Years old and I'm always looking for cookies, you know, I wake up in the
morning and I think my aunts and my mother and grandmothers drilled into me
that there's always a cookie somewhere.  It's my variation on the old
Reagan story about the kid who was looking for the pony.  I mean, you know,
that I wake up in the morning and go:  not just cookies, but it will be
interesting.  A cookie will be under a dinosaur or something. We've got to
-- you know, so you know the cartoon about the kid who has the tiger?
What's the --

>> Calvin and Hobbes.

>> Yeah, Calvin -- I mean, my wife read one of those one day and said,
>>"okay, I get it" and handed it to me, because it was -they both become
>>-- they both had run back and they were being chased by a Tyrannosaurus
>>and they wererunning, that's how I live my life.  I'm permanently
>>fascinated.  I mean, I once had this fantasy I'd be Speaker of the House,
>>and it's -- you know, and so -- one of my best friends said I was the
>>only person he knew who walked into rooms and he heard trumpets whether
>>there were any or not, and so you have there this that comes out of the
>>idea of:  wow, this will be exciting.
</pre>
But notice, see, in the modern age all too often, what we say to people is:
well, be practical.  Be reasonable.  Well, look at the people we're looking
at.  I mean, do you think -- can you imagine a modern therapist dealing
with Edison?  "this fruitcake thinks that 9,000 failures is a great start."
Or talking to Henry Ford.  "this guy is so incompetent, he can't even plan
a car small enough to get out of the garage."
<P>
I mean, he literally knocked down part of the wall of the garage.  That's
right.  I mean, he was not a young guy.  He was already on -- I mean, just
think about all the things that your vocational counselor at school would
tell you. "you really want to go off with your brother and fly what?"  I
mean, and this is my point:  there's a dull grayness in the counterculture
and the modern bureaucracy and the welfare state that says:  "oh, don't
break out.  "conform."  But out here -you can break out if you want to be
a performance artist doing something weird.  But don't break out if you
want to be an inventor, or a scientist or a discoverer.
<P>
But the great breakthroughs are out here.  They're the people who say:  I
think I'll be nutty for five years.  I think I'll just go and work on bread
mold, penicillin.  Or:  I think I'll go work on inventing an airplane
instead of just being a bicycle mechanic in Toledo. Or in Dayton, rather.
I mean, it's that -- it's that kind of thing.
<P>
So what I'm partly saying to you is almost all of the spirit of invention
and discovery is in our minds, and our minds are shaped by our culture, and
so the question is:  how do we -and we're going to come back to this in
the second hour -- how do we now come back and make American Civilization
healthy so that every child in America, male or female, any ethnic
background, could say:  I could be Edison, I could be Carnegie, I could be
the Wright brothers?  Because the real answer is:  why not?  If that's the
game you want to play, if it's the contribution you want to make, go for
it.  Have a great time.  Not guaranteed to succeed.  We're guaranteed the
right to pursue happiness.  And we'll pick this back up when we come back
in a few minutes.
<P>
(break)
<P>

We were just talking during the break about Thomas Edison and the fact that
companies were called, for example, Edison Electric.  He didn't own them.
But one of his major fights early on was Edison was a genuine populist.  He
wanted everybody to have access to power.  And so Edison insisted on
central generating stations so that everybody could have electricity.  One
of the arguments early on had been that -- by financiers that you could
have a very profitable company that just made individual generating
stations for factories and for rich people so that you would have bought
your own small generating plant.
<P>
And there was a very serious debate for a few years about which way to go.
And Edison was adamantly in favor of large central generating stations that
would allow how everybody to have access to electricity, and he was a
genuine populist.
<P>
Let me explain -- somebody asked me during the break what happened to some
of these attitudes and ideas?  Which I think if you were to look at America
from really its founding up through the beginning of the Depression,
clearly was a dominant attitude and remained, I think, the preeminent
attitude till 1965, gradually being undermined to some extent, but was in
many ways still the preeminent attitude until 1965, and then broke down.
<P>
And what I would suggest to you is that the spirit of invention and
discovery is undermined by seven welfare state cripplers of progress.
There are seven things the welfare state does to cripple progress:
credentialism, bureaucratism -- we're going to go back through these in a
minute -- taxation, litigation, centralization, an anti-progress cultural
attitude, and just plain ignorance.  Let me walk you through this for a
second.
<P>
The first is credentialism.  What did it take to be an inventor or a
discoverer?  It took inventing and discovering.  I mean, it's very
interesting that Bill Gates dropped out of college.  That the founder of
Apple Computers dropped out of college.  I mean, the fact is a lot of great
entrepreneurial inventors and discoverers just go do it.  I mentioned the
other week the author of "T-Rex," one of the leading dinosaur -vertebral
paleontologists in the country was a college dropout. But he -- but he's
interested in dinosaurs.  I mean, he wasn't interested in learning all the
other junk you have to get out. He was interested in learning about
dinosaurs which he learned a lot about, and he's now a world authority.
<P>
And the reason I start from here is that in an earlier era, if you could do
it -we had this discussion this week, in fact.  We had 10 street salvation
specialists.  These are people who help drug addicts, they help alcoholics,
they help prostitutes, they help teen gangs.  None of them have a college
degree.  Many of them are former addicts themselves.  And they were making
the point that in the modern bureaucratic age, they are being asked by the
government to hire somebody who has the right master's in social work, who
knows nothing about the street, because the people they are hiring are all
ex-addicts from the street who have no degrees.
<P>
So even though they're doing a wonderful job, they're saving people, and
they have much higher salvation rates in terms of drug addiction and
alcoholism than do the traditional government programs -- sometimes it's as
much as 10 times as high, but they don't have any degrees.
<P>
Therefore, they can't really be good people, so the state says we have to
hire somebody who has graduated from college, and this one guy said, "I
only hire drug addicts and street people."  So it's an interesting -- just
a very different kind of way of thinking about it.  Do you measure what
people can accomplish, or do you remember what papers -- what piece of
paper they have?
<P>
The second one is bureaucratism.  I started earlier telling you about -- I
want you to think now about the Wright brothers.  They walk into the
Environmental Protection Agency, Orville and Wilbur, and they say, "hi,
we're bicycle repair people in Ohio, and we want to fly an airplane, and
the best place to fly an airplane is on the Atlantic coast near Kitty Hawk
where there are big sand dunes and lots of wind."  Sand dunes?  Just
typical of those kind of Ohio industrial types, right?  Don't even care.
There's only about 1500 miles of sand dunes left.  And, of course, the
first key question: "have you done the endangered insect species form?"
<P>
You can imagine now these two bicycle mechanics, right?  "what endangered
insect?"  "well, you're going to have this plane, it's going to go through
the air, it's going to have a propeller, it's going to hit things.  "how
will you know whether or not you wipe out a species if you don't first
check to see if there's a species to be wiped out?"  You can imagine going
through all this stuff, right?
<P>
Then they walk down the hall to OSHA, the occupational safety and health
agency.  Have you ever seen the Wright brothers' original flyer which was
made of spruce and muslin?  It's very, very light.  One person lays down
flat.  The reason they had to find a windy hill was they couldn't get
enough power for it to fly if it flew -- this is how light it is and how
underpowered it is.  Can you imagine what it would have looked like if OSHA
had gotten done?  The sucker would never have worked.
<P>
So you couldn't have flown anyway.  You'd have had to take a train, unless
in the 1820s, George Stephenson, when he was inventing the rocket, which
was the first train, had had to walk into OSHA to get their approval for a
train.  Which would mean, of course, you'd ride in a stagecoach, unlessduri
ng the Assyrian era there had been an OSHA which had said, "wheels?  "you
want people to ride on wheels?  People should walk.  God wanted them to
walk."
<P>
Now, you may think I'm exaggerating.  I can find you books that literally
outline that kind of attitude.  So bureaucratism, the idea that filling out
the paperwork is more important.  Can you imagine filling out 50,000 failed
inventions, I mean, failed tests with Edison?  Can you imagine the
paperwork the modern government would want?
<P>
The third big problem is taxation.  Now, why is taxation a problem?
Because if the central government takes away from you the resources, if
Henry  Ford had to work so hard and had no money left after he got done
working, he couldn't have invented -- he couldn't have built his first car.
You have to have after-tax income in order to have the freedom to try to
do the things you want to do.  And if a government takes the tax money away
from you to give it to a bureaucrat, you've taken it away from the inventor
and the discoverer, and so you've actually lowered the amount of resources
available.
<P>
Litigation.  You know, we were kidding earlier, and several of you
spontaneously said, when I talked about Henry  Ford running over this guy
in the first week, you know, "where's the trial lawyer?"  But litigation's
a major problem.  Hi-tech companies will tell you that high taxes, raising
the cost of capital to build the next factory, and litigation, particularly
strike law firms that automatically sue them if their stock goes up or
down, automatically sues them, that those are two major impediments to
hi-tech companies in America today and that --
<PRE>
>> I'm sorry, you look at the current aviation industry, Terry and I both
>>can agree to that.  The current aviation industry is so saturated with
>>litigation --

>> yep.

>> -- about incompetent pilots getting killed because they flew an airplane
>>they shouldn't have been flying anyway.

>> aviation is just about extinct now.

>> That's right.  Litigation has driven the production of light aircraft
>>out of this country, to take an example.  So litigation's a major killer
>>of invention and discovery.
</PRE>
Centralization.  Because what happens in centralization? Remember I drew
earlier, it's a very important psychological model for you to think about.
The more centralized you are, the more decisions will be political and
obsolete.  In other words, the bigger the centralized system, if you have a
great idea out here but the decisions are made right here, and this is the
decision point, it's inside this huge bureaucracy, you've got to somehow
convince all of these layers of people that your nutty new idea is
workable.
<P>
Now, can you imagine going to a modern bureaucrat in a big-government,
centralized system?  This is also true, by the way, of big corporations.
It's why IBM didn't invent Microsoft, nor did it invent Apple.  It's why
General Motors for a while was too slow to understand what was happening
with Japanese cars, because when you're a big enough system, you can
protect yourself by staying inside the system, even if you're wrong.
<P>
Remember we talked about this last week.  Well, if you're -- what you're
trying to do, imagine the year the iron lung industry and Jones Salk shows
up and says, "I have this great new idea.  "let's eliminate iron lungs.
"we'll just have a vaccine, and nobody will get Polio."  Is that a good
idea or a bad idea? Do you want to encourage the end of your industry, or
are you really busy working on project 12, which is right here, which is
the better, more portable iron lung, the aluminum lung?  Which one are you
going to invest in?  So what you want is a society with many, many small
institutions.
<P>
Now, another big problem is the anti-progress cultural attitude.  You were
laughing about when I said the modern TV would report Edison's invention as
a negative, but isn't that exactly what happens?  The O.J.. Simpson trial
is big news.  The breakthroughs in genetic biology liberating the age of
molecular medicine and saving people with fundamental genetic defects
doesn't get page one very often, and -- you know, and the news media can
say, "well, that's because they don't read it."
<P>
Part of the reason they don't read it is because we don't report it.
Remember, supply leads to demand, and that's part of why:  what's the
public reaction?  You get Internet, you get talk radio, you get efforts.
But because we've had such a deep anti-progress cultural attitude, I mean,
"progress" was not even a word you were allowed to use for a while.  It was
-- you know, it was like, you know, you must be some kind of romantic, you
know, highly self-deceptive person if you actually think human beings can
have progress.  And there was a period there when everything was terrible.
<P>

We talked about nihilism.  I mean, you listen to some of the rock music in
periods when there's a sense that there is no future, that it's not going
to be any better.  Meanwhile, all around us there's scientists and
engineers and naturalists who are discovering and inventing a lot of
things.
<P>
The final one, though, is just plain ignorance.  The fact is, if you don't
teach how to think scientifically and you don't think how to be a creator
-- I mean, you don't teach how to be a creator and you don't teach how to
discover, you don't teach how to explore, it shouldn't shock you that
people can't do it.
<P>
It's a very major problem that we tend to consistently score 14th or worse
in science and math.  Because it means we don't have a basic -- we don't
have the alphabet.  We don't have the basic principles of being able to
operate in a world in which science is important and which learning is
important.
<P>
And in the 19th century, people like Edison, Carnegie, the Wright brothers,
Henry  Ford, all got a basic education, some of them by the 8th grade.  It
was sufficiently powerful that it carried them the rest of their lives.  We
now have some people who get through two years of college and are still
illiterate.  I mean, just a totally different attitude towards what real
learning means, what you have to master in order to be effective.
<P>
Now, this does not mean, by the way, that I'm against government.  I would
say just the opposite.  That government can play a powerful role in basic
research and development, as long as it's willing to get -- get it out of
the bureaucracy.  If you go back and look at Powell's great trip down the
grand canyon on the Colorado, which is one of the great journeys of
discovery in American history, it was a government expedition.  It was the
U.S. Geological survey.  If you go look at Lewis and Clark reaching the
pacific, that was a government expedition.  If you look at the Apollo
program, the fact is, much of the progress on the airplane and the computer
chip are financed by the government.
<P>
But the trick is to get it out of this big system over here as a
freestanding, small project.  You cannot successfully make big
breakthroughs.  You can have resources leave here, the big central system,
and go to a point where somebody's doing something interesting, but if you
keep the resources in here, if you tie them up in bureaucracy, you will
guarantee that you'll get very, very minimal progress at very big expense.
Now, government can do selected big projects well, again, if they're off to
one side.
<P>
So let me draw two distinctions here.  Government can do basic research and
development, or government can come out here and set up the Apollo project.
Remember, NASA was brand new.  They built it up, they did it, and if they
disbanded it at that point, I think they'd have been better off.  And said,
"okay, now what's our next project?"  So you build a project team, you get
the job done, and you close it down and start a new project team.
<P>
Because if you keep the people there, they become obsolescent and they
become bureaucratic.  And what you're looking for, remember, is not
incremental change.  You're not looking for a slow, gradual change.  You're
looking for the breakthroughs.  How do we manage -- what is it that's worth
doing that's big?  Now, big projects must be focused, lean, and tightly
managed.
<P>
We're going to look at the Skunk Works at Lockheed as an example, but it's
a very important concept that they have to be focused, you have to know --
you know, in other words, why are we setting up this agency?  To accomplish
"x."  Not to do 12 things.  To do one thing.  It's got to be lean, and
you'll see what I mean by "lean" in just a minute.  Very few people.  And
you've got to have very tight management.  The fewest people possible
working as well as they can, getting it done, and then getting it over
with.
<P>
Now, I want you to look at Kelly Johnson, who's the father of the Skunk
Works, who is, in a sense, to aviation sort of the Thomas Edison of modern
aviation.  Let's take a look at Kelly Johnson.
<P>
Lockheed was already swamped in terms of manpower, tooling, and facilities
with wartime contracts.  But this was a blessing in disguise, an
opportunity to implement an idea he'd been pestering Robert Gross about for
years.  Let him round up a small group of talented people, designers,
engineers, and shopmen, put them under one roof where they could all work
closely together, and give him complete authority over everything from
procurement to flight test.  With no other options, Gross said, "go ahead."
Stealing people from around the plant, just 28 engineers including himself
and 105 shopmen, he also built a small facility out of discarded shipping
crates, using a circus tent for a roof.
<P>
On June 19th, he laid down the principles under which the project would
operate.  In one and a half pages now preserved on old photostats, it
formed the basis for how he'd try to operate for the next 30 years.  He'd
be responsible for all decisions. Paperwork and red tape would be cut to
the minimum.  Each engineer would be designer, shop contact, parts chaser,
and mechanic, and each would remain within a stone's throw of the shop at
all times.
<P>
There'd be but one object:  to get a good airplane built on time.  He'd
promised the airplane in 180 days. As would become his custom, he gave his
men 150.  The clock started ticking on June 23rd.  Remarkably, the
completed aircraft arrived at Muroc on November 14th, just 143 days after
start-up. When he retired in 1975, Kelly Johnson had been on the cutting
edge of an advance from 200 to more than 2,000 miles per hour. He'd been
involved in the design of 44 different airplanes, many of them among the
classics of aviation history.
<P>
And at the time, he was still looking very much into the future.  He'd
gotten the Skunk Works into a project which would bear fruit in the
F-117-A, the world's first true stealth aircraft.  What was his secret?
Well, he had a remarkable capacity to take a complex problem, reduce it to
its simplest components, and then take the most direct and sensible
approach to its solution.  Always a maverick, he was smart enough and tough
enough not to follow the committee rule of conventional wisdom.  This gave
him remarkable freedom. With that freedom came a tremendous burden of
responsibility.
<P>
Finally, and most important, he understood himself well enough to realize
that with a few good people, you can do remarkable things.  Kelly Johnson's
greatest legacy wasn't just what he did, but the way he did it.
<P>
Let me give you a couple of quick examples of the Skunk Work rules, because
this is what we ought to apply across the whole culture, I mean, to the
federal government, to state governments, to private business, to
universities.  "first, the Skunk Works manager must be delegated
practically complete control of his program in all aspects, complete
control.  "second, strong but small project offices must be provided by
both the military and industry.  "third, the number of people having any
connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner.
Use a small number of good people, 10% to 25%, compared to the so-called
normal system."
<P>
Now, I just want you to think about that.  This guy's saying:  you take
whatever a normal college administration is, cut it by -- cut it to 10 to
25%.  Take a normal government bureaucracy, cut it tono more than 10 to
25%. "a very simple drawing and release system with great flexibility for
making changes must be provided.  "there must be a minimum number of
reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly.  "there
must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and
committed, but also projected cost to the conclusion of the program.
"don't have the books 90 days late, and don't surprise the customers with
sudden overruns. "the contractor must be delegated and must assume more
than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids or subcontract on the
project.  "commercial bid procedures are very often better than military
ones".
<P>
We could save, I believe, 20 to 40% of the Pentagon just by applying the
Skunk Work rules to military procurement across the board.  20 to 40% on
big projects.  "the inspection system:  push more basic inspection
responsibility back to subcontractors and vendors.  "don't duplicate so
much inspection.  "the contractor must be delegated the authority to test
his final product in flight.  "he can and must test it in the initial
stages.  "if he doesn't, he rapidly loses his competency to design other
vehicles."  Johnson required that he fly the aircraft so that he would have
the feeling.  You go through the whole thing.  "funding a program must be
timely so that the contractor doesn't have to keep running to the bank to
support government projects.  "there must be mutual trust between the
military project organization and the contractor, with very close
cooperation and liaison on a day-to-day basis.  "this cuts down
misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum. "access by
outsiders to the project and its personnel must be strictly controlled, and
because only a few people will be used in engineering and most other areas,
ways must be provided to reward good performance by pay, not based on the
number of personnel supervised."
<P>
So there's not an incentive to have more people under you so you get a
higher salary.  You get a higher salary for doing the job.  Very different
model from most modern bureaucracies.  This is what Tom Peters in "the
Heart and Soul of Excellence" said about Kelly Johnson:  "Kelly Johnson was
responsible for about one-third of what flies in the sky today. "right
after World War II, he developed the first of the military jets, the f-80.
"subsequently he developed the F-104, the C-130, the U-2, the SR-71, to
name only a few.  "at one time, Kelly took an ailing satellite program,
which was behind schedule by three years and was 700% over budget.  "it
had, in just one part of the
Program, 1271 inspectors.  "for all this, its successful launch rate was 12
and a half percent.  "Johnson reduced the number of inspectors from 1271 to
35.  "getting the project back on schedule" -- "got the project back on
schedule, began operating below budget, and increased the successful launch
rate from 12 and a half percent to 98%.
<P>
"At one point, the Air Force sent a team to consult with Kelly as they were
working on a project which was equal in magnitude and complexity to a
project he was working on.  "the Air Force was four years behind schedule,
700% above budget, and had 3750 people working on it.  "Kelly Johnson's
project was on schedule, slightly under budget, and had 126 people working
on it."
<P>
Just think about that number, 3750 to 126.  The name "Skunk Works" was
taken from the Li'l Abner comic strip and refers to a half-licit,
half-illicit innovative activity operating on the periphery of an
organization.  I think the Skunk Works was actually a still, wasn't it, in
Li'l Abner?
<P>
The point is that there is a style here.  There's a way -- it's not just
that Johnson's an individual genius.  It's a way of cutting through the
baloney, eliminating the layers of bureaucracy, focusing responsibility,
hiring a very few people who are very good and letting them do the job, and
then holding them accountable for how they function so that they invest
themselves in getting the job done.
<P>
This is part of why I think you can really think about a dramatically
smaller system, is because when you look at what really works, it's very
small. It's not some huge, complicated bureaucracy.  It's a very flat
hierarchy, with relatively few people.
<P>
Now, what you have to ask yourself about the future is:  how much has
changed and how much will change?  And this is part of the point of
Toffler's concept of the Third Wave of change, because the truth is, if you
look at how much has changed in the 20th century, it's amazing.  I mean, if
you could go back to 1900 and show them a hologram and a videotape in color
of everything that will happen in the 20th century, they'd be astonished.
Well, guess what?  More's going to happen in the next century.  Change is
accelerating.  It's not even staying level.  It is accelerating.  There's
no question change is accelerating.  I mean, whether or not  it accelerates
in the U.S. Is -- I mean, the Chinese, the Japanese, the Germans, the
Brazilians, the Indians, the second largest center of software in the world
is Madras, India.  Change is coming.  The only question is whether or not
America is going to be part of it, but the changes are coming.
<P>
Now, in that framework, I would suggest to you that every citizen must know
the basics of science and technology.  And one of the things we have to
have, I think, in our generation is both a re-establishment, a reassertion,
of what the minimums are that you need to know about science and technology
to be functional, and I think we need to say that we are committed to going
back and, in a sense, retrofitting adults.
<P>
I mean, how do we make it possible for adults to learn the basics if they
didn't get it during school?  This idea that we'll now teach this
generation of second graders and 40 years from now we'll get there is
nonsense.  We've got to find a way to make it relatively easy and
relatively accessible for every citizen to learn things.  In addition,
we've got to change the game so that every citizen learns to be problem
solving, solution oriented, persistent, and strategically optimistic.
<P>
Now, I say strategically optimistic for a second, because I don't think you
get up in the morning and go, "wow, everything will work well." But you get
up in the morning and you say, "if the tire's flat, I'll fix it."  "if the
car is not working, I'll fix it."  "if I haven't quite solved, you know" --
"if I'm losing hearing, I'll learn how to adjust or I'll get a hearing
aid."
<P>
I mean, the whole notion that when you're faced with a problem, your first
reaction is to start hunting for the solution is very different than the
current system, where your first reaction is to relax and feel like you're
a victim.  It's a very different model.  And I talked about specific skills
here: problem solving, you've got to start -- these are habits.  You
practice solving problems, you learn how to do it.  Automatically being
solution oriented, which, by the way, means you have to be persistent,
because the truth is, it's hard.
<P>
I mean, every time we say to people, "we can give you an easy solution," we
actually weaken them.  Which is why persistence matters.  If you teach
people to be persistent -- and again, Edison has probably -- I mean, we
don't expect people to try 50,000 times.  But how about five?  I mean, this
is a society where one is seen as an imposition.  "you really want me to do
that?"  I mean, "I should actually do my homework?"  "I should actually
study?"  "you want me to save?"
<P>
Now, in that framework, I think we've also got to recognize that we are now
faced in a way no other society ever has been with lifetime learning.  And
I think lifetime learning is very, very important.
<P>
Every citizen must know how to learn new things as requirements and reality
change.  And we may -- and again, this doesn't require going back to
school.  It requires saying in the mass media over and over and over again:
you ought to plan to learn all of your life.  And there are lots of ways
to learn.  You can go to seminars, you can go to school, you can get audio
tapes, you can get videotapes, you can check out books, you can play with
the Internet, but if you aren't learning something every day, you don't get
it, and this has to become almost a requirement of citizenship in our
culture.
<P>
That we expect every American to learn every day, and so you ought to just
relax and accept it.  This is part of what being an American in the 21st
century will mean.  We also need, I think, to recognize what we mean by the
spirit of invention and discovery.  That is, a learning, attitude,
perseverance, hard work and enthusiasm, that they are the keys to invention
and discovery.
<P>
That's why we talk about the spirit of invention and discovery.  You've got
to have these attitudes in your head.  You've got to be willing to get up
and do it.  Again, I mean, can you imagine saying to the typical teenager
today:  you want to be as famous as Henry  Ford?  Well, so what did you do
after your job?  You have all summer long.
<P>
I mean, it's part of why I'm somewhat resistant at times to midnight
basketball.  Not because I'm opposed to midnight basketball as something to
do if you've already done everything else, but because I'm opposed to the
idea that as a culture we would send a signal that instead of working hard,
instead of studying hard, instead of, you know, going out and inventing
your generation's version of the car, that recreation somehow is, in and of
itself, a replacement for these other things.  It keeps them busy.
<P>
And again, we're going to get to this when we talk about replacing the
culture of poverty, but remember, the original midnight basketball was set
up by the Salvation Army to attract people there doing what they currently
do in order to save them and change their lives so they would do something
different.  It wasn't a maintenance program.
<P>
Now, I mean, if you say, "we're going to have this great midnight
basketball league, and by the way, we're also going to read books and look
at useful educational films and do other things,"  then I'd say:  okay, now
I get it.  You're using their current behavior to draw them in to change
their behavior.  Yeah, if it's a stepping stone, it's good.  If it's a
stopping place, it is exactly the wrong signal. And again, I'm not talking
about the people who already work, you know, 12 hours a day and they want
to go play midnight basketball because they need physical recreation and
they need mentally to re-create.  That's what "recreation" means.  But in
order to need to re-create, you need to do something first.
<P><PRE>
>> you can't re-create unless you've created.

>> Right.  So, I mean, I'm as interested in:  what are you doing to create,
>>and how do we get you to that point?  I also think that it's very
>>important to have the old Reagan line:  you ain't seen nothing yet, or
>>the notion that the adventure is only beginning.  And I think this is,
>>frankly, one of the reasons that the "Star Trek" series has been
>>successful.
</pre>
And the "Star Trek" series, I think, was a great shock because it didn't
fit any of the elite culture's views when it first came out.  It only ran,
you know, for four years, and then -- but it wouldn't die.  I mean, it just
kept hanging around.  I think part of the reason is that in American
society, there is this innate sense of:  the adventure's just beginning.
What's going to happen next?  Where are we going to go next?  And that's a
very deep part of how we operate and of what we look for.  At a vision
level, what I'm suggesting is that we want to have a pro-spirit of
invention and discovery America creating a better future through better
ideas.
<P>
And we want this to be an active, positive commitment, where our attitude
is, when we bounce into a problem, "wow, an opportunity to have better
ideas.  "I wonder what we should do to solve this one?"  Which, if you
think about the tone, is a totally different tone and is an energy-creating
tone.  I mean, if being hungry is an excuse to bake a cake, that's a
totally different thing than being hungry being an excuse to sit and whine.
One depresses the energy level, the other increases the energy level.
<P>
Now, there's a book on it called "Learned Optimism" which argues that
leaders consciously know how to increase the energy level by deliberately
being optimistic.  In addition, let me suggest to you that we ought to have
a vision that the goal of a free society is not an American dream.  It is
to have 260 million Americans dreaming.  I mean, the whole neat thing about
being an American is that each of us gets to pursue happiness.  Each of us
gets to go out and define who we are and what our future is.
<P>
There's not "the American dream."  Rather, there are 260 million Americans,
and the truth is, how many of you've had several dreams already in your
life, where you thought you were going one way and now you've gone a
different way?  Seriously, raise your hand.  How many of you found -- okay,
so the 260 million Americans dreaming, that's why we didn't say there are
260 million American dreams, because any individual American might have
multiple dreams, right?
<P>
I mean, I want to be a dinosaur collector, I want to be a zookeeper, you
know.  I have five or 10 other things I won't bore you with right now, at
least three of which my wife will shoot me if I say in public.  But the
whole point is that people are allowed to -- and particularly if we're
going to live to be 90 or 100.  I mean, why not go for it?  Have three or
four or five dreams in your lifetime?
<P>
Now, if that's our vision level, it seems to me our strategies ought to be
to have big goals, to have a cultural change in attitude and understanding,
to rethink government so it encourages the spirit of invention and
discovery.  And to have changes in learning, a pro-invention, pro-discovery
tax code, set up prizes, set up x-projects, have a common-sense legal
system, encourage small business, and encourage genius.
<P>
Now, this is a lot, so let me just walk you through some examples, but
you'll see how some of them fit together.  First of all, we ought to set
big goals for our generation.  I mean, I think we ought to certainly have a
permanent base on the moon in the next few years.  We ought to reduce the
cost of space travel to a point where it becomes a reasonable alternative
to a honeymoon at Disneyworld.  I think that we ought to certainly be on
Mars within 15 years, maybe less.
<P>
I think that we ought to design an information system in such that every
person who gets ill, if it's a serious illness, you can access through the
Internet all the current data on your disease so you can learn about your
problem, because you're going to study it a lot more than your doctor is.
I mean, just -- we ought to have a whole series.
<P>
We ought to have a lifetime learning system so that it's easy access for
every citizen, probably through the libraries rather than the schools.  So
we have -- so we don't have a teacher-dominated, bureaucratic, credentialed
model.  But where you can say, "I need to learn 'x.'  "I think I'll go
check it out."
<P>
We ought to have huge goals.  We ought to eliminate poverty in America by
being serious about reaching out to help the poor instead of just sending
them a check, and we ought to say: here's what it takes to eliminate
poverty in America.  You've got to be persistent, you've got to work hard,
you have a sense of the future.  I mean, these are -now, there will always
be a willful minority who say, "I don't want to."  Fine.  Those -- I mean,
you are in a free society allowed to not be part of the common culture.
But then we're going to say:  okay, that's your choice.  Now you have
consequences.  It's a very different model than the current model.
<P>
Now, so let's think about big projects.  You know, what if one of our big
goals was to find five Edisons in the next generation?  Think about what he
contributed.  If you had five in parallel each in their own zone playing
their own game?  Think of the -- in a sense, Bill Gates is like that, but
smaller than Edison.  I mean, Edison truly was a historic phenomenon, but
what would a society be like that encouraged that rather than discouraged
it?
<P>
Look at just the scale of change at the DNA revolution in health.  We're
entering the age of molecular medicine, but it's combined with an explosive
capacity to share the information through the computer system.  So
literally, it's conceivable in the next 10 or 15 years, if every citizen
could have access, it is conceivable that you'd have just a remarkably
different environment.  And that as each breakthrough is occurring, you
could be applying it in a very different style than we've ever thought
about in the modern age.  But there's no reason for doctors to have a
monopoly of knowledge.  It's just a question of how you want to organize
it.  Yes, sir.
<P><PRE>
>> although I have not read the article in this morning's
>>"Journal-Constitution," the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, is now on
>>the Internet, and one can access CDC research.

>> Which is good.  It's the beginning of the new way of doing things.  And
>>you can design expert systems where you literally enter it and it will

>>suggesting it's a very -- I have several friends who are pretty
>>sophisticated whose children have very, very rare diseases.  They found
>>the right doctor somewhere on the planet because they went through all
>>the various libraries that are on line.  It's a totally different way of
>>thinking about what you are doing.  Now, and also, by the way, the
>>molecular -the age of molecular medicine is going to be as different
>>from what we do as what we do is from the 18th century use of leeches.
</pre>
I mean, you are not going to recognize medicine 30 years from now.  It's
going to be that big a change.  Now, notice also the DNA revolution in
agriculture.  Huge breakthroughs in productivity, in how long you can keep
things, in how you design things.  Consider the next phase of the
information revolution. Rising power, declining costs, worldwide networks,
and real-time information.
<P>
Nobody yet -- and this has been -- it's been fascinating to me, and people
like George Gilder come close, and Alvin and Heidi Toffler come close, but
nobody's yet quite been able to figure out how to describe the scale of
this revolution and how it will change us.  This is going to literally
bring to you -- remember what Gilder said.  You're going to carry a
cellular telephone, which is also your computer.  It may also be your
portable television.  It may also be your Walkman.  May also be your
checkbook.  I mean, you'll have all sorts of conveniences, many of which
did not exist 25, 30 years ago, in one hand-held device, and you'll be able
to -- you know, you'll access all your friends' telephone numbers, and you
can also then call them.
<P>
And in that kind of setting, have any of you noticed, there's one -- I
can't remember now which of the computer companies has a commercial on now
where the person is sitting at their computer console watching the
television and talking on the phone while typing simultaneously, and she
changes the price on the menu because she gets a good review in the local
TV, you know -- I mean, it's a great example.  Well, that's the beginning,
and it's going to be available to everybody.  And we don't have a clue yet
how that world's going to work.
<P>
But let me give you some examples, because it will change your life as
profoundly as the automobile liberated North Georgia.  Remember, back when
you had to use a horse and buggy, the reason county seats aren't very far
away is it took you all day to get there.  Now, in the length of time it
took your great-grandparents to ride in a buggy to the county seat, you can
drive across three states or you can fly across the whole country.  Well,
this is about to happen to information in a big way.
<P>
Some examples:  self-learning and distance learning.  Nobody's really
thought through yet.  We can liberate the smallest, most rural school in
America.  We can liberate the poorest child, and we can liberate the
busiest person.  I mean, people say, you know, welfare mothers have to stay
home and take care of the kids.  Fine.  Then let's build a learning module
so while the kids are asleep at 3:00 in the afternoon, the mother's
learning, but let's set standards of behavior.
<P>
Let's do something, but let's not say to people:  why don't you waste 20
years of your life?  Why don't you sit around and do nothing all day?  Soap
operas are fine.  I mean, why do we have so many people who watch soap
operas?  Partly because we've set a cultural standard that says:  killing
time's fine.  You're probably bored.  Why don't you watch soap operas.  If
instead we said:  why don't you take at least three hours a day to learn,
if we're going to pay you full-time to do nothing?
<P>
I feel the same way about unemployment compensation.  If you can't find a
job and we're going to give you money so you're being paid to not do
anything, then why don't you learn something 40 hours a week, and why don't
we make it freestanding and easy so it is self-learning, and if you want to
interface with somebody, why don't you just pick up your phone, turn on
your TV, you know, turn to cable channel 65, dial them up and you talk to
them direct then, and so you don't have to schedule:  when do I drive to
the campus to see the advisor?
<P>
None of this stuff's very far away, and some of it's actually happening all
across the country in pilot projects.  But it requires rethinking
institutionally how we function, and rethinking how we score things and how
we measure things.  It means you don't measure how many people are at
average daily -- average daily attendance, which is how schools get money.
You measure:  how much did your students learn this year?  I mean, right
now, if you have a big average daily attendance, even if nobody in the room
learned a thing, you get the cash.  Now, that's got to be about as dumb a
way to measure as you can get, and if you taught all them calculus in three
weeks, think of how much money you'd lose?  I mean, what's the incentive
plan for the school?  Keep them.  Don't let them get out.  You'll lose the
money.
<P><PRE>
>> in classes, like, in some schools, if you go to class all day, you can
>>exempt your final exams.

>> Uh-huh.  Because they made the money.  Think about it.  I mean, think
>>what the incentive systems work.  And what we ought to be doing is saying
>>to people:  you want to go to Panama city, Florida, and relax for five
>>days, but you're willing to guarantee you pass your chemistry exam?
>>Here's the material.  Now, you don't pass the chemistry exam, you're in
>>big trouble.  But it's a totally different way of organizing.  And it
>>also means you're 40 years old, you never did chemistry, you decided now
>>you need to know chemistry, here's the material.  And if you can only
>>study it on Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings, fine, we don't care.
</pRE>
I mean, I was looking at some of Dr. Minnix's lectures, which I thought
were marvelous, on World War II.  I learned a bunch of stuff last night
just looking.  You know, we're at the point now where we can produce
materials that is freestanding sitting there, you pick it up, you don't
have to drive 55 miles to be at point "a" at 10:05 for 55 minutes.  We
could mail it to you or Fed Ex it or UPS or whatever.  It's a different way
of thinking. And then test:  did you learn it or not?  Which is a different
question than:  did you sit through it?  Similarly, self-health and
distance medical care.  Why shouldn't you be able to diagnose a lot of
things?  Why shouldn't you be able to simply, if you're in a rural area and
you need the best doctor in the  country -you know, the army's now working
on this.
<P>
They have a system which they call Jumping Echelons, where the field
hospital with the person with the unique injury skips every hospital in
between and goes back to Walter Reed or goes to the best brain surgeon in
America, and they in real-time look at the materials electronically, and
the field hospital is getting the best advice from the right specialist to
save the life of this young person. Why can't that be true everywhere in
America?
<P>
Now, it's a totally different model, it's a totally different way of
thinking about things.  But I'll give you the parallel example: how many of
you now pump gasoline for your own car?  Go back sometime -virtually all
of you raised your hand.  Go back sometime and read the arguments in the
late 1970s about why we could not allow self-service gasoline.  People
wouldn't be able to do it.  They'd spill gas all over.  There'd be a fire
hazard.  I mean, go back and read them sometime.  Trusting in people,
sharing information, broadening out the base of everybody having a chance
to play is very, very important.  Now, really radical idea, probably get in
trouble again, but I can't help --
<P><PRE>
>> sounds like it.

>> self-law.  If you and your spouse decide to get divorced, why do you
>>need a lawyer if you both agree?

>> because the state defines the marriage.

>> the state is, but why is the lawyer?

>> because you need a lawyer to discern what the legalese says.

>> why?  But that's because the way they write the legalese.

>> and because most people don't have access to that kind of information or
>>know how to find it.

>> you need a lawyer to fill out the paperwork.

>> right, but what if we organized a system that said:  here is your
>>self-enhanced guide to getting a divorce?

>> so what is their possible incentive to let go of that kind of control?

>> I didn't say the lawyers would like it.  I mean, you think the gas
>>station owners in the late '70s liked giving up full-service gasoline?

>> no.

>> right.  They lost.

>> right.

>> well, that's what life's about.  Sometimes you win and sometimes you
>>lose.  Imagine blacksmiths the first time a car came through.  I mean,
>>blacksmiths took it on the head.  Buggy whip manufacturers hated it.  Do
>>you know how seldom you ever see anybody using a buggy whip on a car?

>> I hate it when that happens.

>> I mean, just think about it.  My point is if we're talking about
>>self-learning, if we're talking about self-health, how many things that
>>are currently part of our legal system could, in fact, be done if you
>>built expert systems and you made it available and knowing adults read it
>>and said, "I am willing to sign a bond that I accept this.  "I don't want
>>to worry about a lawyer.  "I'll just bond that this is okay."  And how
>>many things could you do that on?  Simple wills?

>> courts don't allow that.

>> you can do that on your computer.

>> I do that myself anyway.

>> see?

>> I've done it several times, and it's not that hard.

>> yeah, but speaking of court actions, there have been time and time
>>again, and you can research this, where couples go in and they tell a
>>judge, "we've already got it worked out.  "just sign it.  It's written."
>>"no, you can't have it this way because the law says that you need to do
>>this and you need to do that."

>> no, no, no, you're talking about the world as it is today.
I'm talking about the world as it can be in the information age.

>> so how do you step from where we're at now to  where --

>> you do it over time.  You do it politically, you do it culturally.  You
>>teach courses.  Stay controversial.  You know, really, this is how you go
>>through an age of change.  I mean, you just -- first of all, you talk
>>about it.  Remember, supply leads to demand.  People suddenly go, "oh,
>>yeah, why can't I do that?" And you begin to say to people:  why
>>shouldn't you be allowed to have conflict resolution without a lawyer?
>>People start to go: oh, yeah.  Particularly since a lot of lawyers
>>actually make their living by increasing the conflict level.

>> we're already working with the helicopter, though.  We're taking a
>>television camera out, and our field medics can actually televise a
>>patient condition and a doctor doesn't have to --

>> right.  See, the real time and media capability in the field -- I mean,
>>you are a living example because of what you do with rescue medicine.
>>You're a living example of what I'm talking about.  That we're seeing
>>breakthrough after breakthrough after breakthrough.  Now, let me carry it
>>a stage further.  Public safety in the information age.  You have a
>>particularly dangerous store, you put a camera in it.  You have a
>>particularly dangerous street, you put a camera on it.  You release a
>>felon on parole, you put an ankle bracelet on them that is exactly the
>>way you used to track elk and bear and other things in biological
>>surveys.  You track them by computer, and if it turns out they happen to
>>be at the 7-eleven exactly at the time there was a -that there's a
>>robbery, you have a theory.

>> aren't we getting then towards Orwell's "1984"?

>> You are if you're a felon.  Yeah.  But, I mean, you are, in that sense,
>>in Orwell's -- you're always potentially in Orwell's "1984," because you
>>always have the potential power of the state to do that if you let them.
>>The question is -- I mean, the other option you can say to the felon is:
>>you don't want an ankle bracelet?  Fine.  Stay in jail.  But if we're
>>putting you out on parole and we know that 65% of the people we put out
>>on parole who were convicted of this particular kind of crime are likely
>>to do it again, why can't we protect ourselves?
</pre>
And the other option is just not let him out, which I'm equally willing to
do. Which, by the way, if you think about distance work as one reason
prisons ought to be made to pay for themselves.  I mean, prisoners ought to
work 48 hours a week and study 12 hours a week, and you'd have a different
world.  You'd also have a different prison, because they'd be busy 60 hours
a week.  Just a different system.
<P>
Okay.  Let me talk about another one where -and this is one, if I can
slightly cross the bridge to my other job, this is one where we first
started talking about three years ago, and I am really excited about this
particular one.  We have the potential in this information age with the
spirit of invention and discovery of fully enhancing the potential of every
challenged American.  Now, this one, to me, is really exciting. And we just
agreed at a meeting yesterday to set up a task force to do this.
<P>
I believe if you talk about the severely challenged, people who have
genetic problems, who have been in a wreck, people who are in wheelchairs,
people who are maybe born with down's syndrome or born with a variety of
problems, I believe we're on the edge of a revolution.  And part of what
we're going to do, and this is part of why I teach the course, and this is
one where I can actually tell you, we've now gone from idea to
conceptualizing it in more detail to beginning to move it into the
legislative process.
<P>
What we want to do is take this body of people and talk to the best
rehabilitation people in the country and the best technical people in the
country and say:  if we bring to bear all the computer revolution, all the
information revolution, all the DNA revolution, how can we improve their
lives?  And my theory is this, that when you talk about welfare, that there
are very different populations engaged.  And that for most Americans, this
goes back to Deming's notion that you have to start with a theory.
<P>
For most Americans, when they talk about wanting welfare reform, what
they're talking about is three groups:  those who are able but not willing,
those who are able but don't know how, and those who are truly challenged.
People with severe disabilities.  Now, I think for most Americans, you can
draw a very sharp line right here, and you can say:  for those who are able
but don't know how, we're going to massively invest in helping them get
across the line.  Most of that investment is spiritual.  This is where
we'll talk about later on when we get to this section of the course, Marvin
Olasky's great work "the Tragedy of American Compassion."
<P>
For folks who are able but genuinely not willing, this is what the
Victorians called "the Undeserving Poor."  In the 19th century in America,
if you were homeless, you could get lunch, but in order -- or a meal, but
in order to get a meal, you had to chop wood.  You chopped wood both for
yourself and for a widow.  That both gave you dignity and it proved that
you were willing.  If you weren't willing, they would resolutely refuse to
give you food.  They'd say:  no, we're not going to give you food.  Because
they had a profound sense that to give people who were not willing was to
subsidize their self-destruction.
<P>
Yeah, so think of this as subsidized self-destruction.  And, in fact, I had
a man the other day -- and we'll talk about this more  later -- who said
when -he had a friend -- he was at a press conference.  He had a friend
who was -- who got his first supplemental security income check just at
Christmas and was able to shift from drinking cheap wine to bourbon and had
a heart attack on the second bottle.  He said:  You and the government
killed him.  He said:  let me tell  you -he said let me tell you:  you
should not give money to people who are not able to govern their own lives,
because they destroy themselves.
<P>
This group, we want to reach out and say:  here's how you work, here's how
you learn, because they're really willing to, but they've had no
background, no cultural framework.
They've grown up in a culture of poverty and violence where they literally
don't know what to do.  But they're willing to do it if somehow it's not
200 families to one caseworker, it is one to one, or one to two, and we're
helping them learn these new habits.  This is actually very solvable.  But
this one's different.  Here what you want to do, I think, is you want to
invest in technology, in rehabilitation, and in maximizing opportunities.
And you want to say -- and this is almost case by case.  You want to say to
somebody who's going to spend their whole life in a wheelchair or somebody
who's born blind or somebody who has a particular problem of great
difficulty:  how do we maximize your chance to pursue happiness?
<P>
And I believe most Americans would, in fact, want to increase the resources
applied here, because all of us recognize that this is through no fault of
their own and that this could happen to any of us.  Any of us could have a
child that has a problem.  Any of us could have a relative.  Any of us
could have, you know, the Charles Krauthammer effect of diving into a
swimming pool and breaking your neck or being in a car wreck.  So here I
think we should actually increase resources, but in a very focused, very
spirit of invention and discovery kind of model.
<PRE>
>> and also, you never know what one might have to offer.

>> Yeah.  There's some very great creative people who come out of this
>>background.  Now, last example is telecommuting.  That you literally will
>>see, I think, a decline in rush hour traffic in the 21st century, because
>>people will just stay at home and work.
</pre>
You'll see actually a substantial drop in the number of people who go to
work.  Not that they're not working, it's just that they get up and they go
into their office, which is in their house, or they go into a room in the
basement or they go across the street, but it's a totally different model,
and we have not thought very much.  If you had to spend the next billion
dollars on highways or on telecommuting, which would be better?  And, in
fact, the IRS has adopted exactly the wrong rule, because it has made it
harder to have a home office, not easier, okay?
<PRE>
>> but you can file your tax return electronically.

>> right.  Well, you can, but I met with them the other day. It's still not
>>as easy as it should be, and actually, we ought to let you have half the
>>savings.

>> sure.

>> If we said, "if you'll file electronically, it will be $20 less, take
>>$20 off the bottom," you'd have 90% of the country filing electronically
>>within five years.  Today there's no value, yet you are saving the
>>government a lot of money, and it's more accurate, according to the
>>government.
</pre>
All right, as we look at the spirit of invention and discovery, remember,
we want to think through applying what's our vision of getting there, what
are our strategies for getting the culture to move in that direction, what
are the projects we want to use, and what are the tactics we want to use?
<P>
Now, as you go through that planning, remember that the next phase then is
you think you've gotten the breakthrough, you go out and you do what we're
going to do with disabilities, you start listening to people who are in the
situation, you try to learn from them, so they're telling you about their
world.  If you listen to them and learn from them, you can begin to help
them, and in a rational, healthy society, people who know that you'll
listen to them, learn from them, and help them want you to lead them.
<P>
I believe if we can  apply -- if we can begin to shift the entire culture
into a spirit of invention and discovery, we'll be shocked how big the
impact will be, we'll be shocked how much we invent, at how much we
discover, how much more dynamic we are, and how much progress we've made by
about 2020.  And so it has to be a culture-wide basic shift in attitude and
in approach.
<P>
Now, next week we're going to pick up pillar five, Quality, Customer
Orientation, Team Work, Continuous Improvement, Systems Analysis, and the
spirit of Edwards Deming, the man who taught the Japanese the concept of
quality.  I think you'll find it very useful.  Next week's reading, Kenneth
Delavigne and J. Daniel Robertson, "Deming's Profound Changes," Chapter 3.
And this is all being given out to you here.  Lloyd Dobyns and Clare Craw
Ford-Mason, "Thinking About Quality," Chapter 3.  And Peter Senge,
"Building Learning Organizations," from the "Journal For Quality And
Participation," March 1992.

<B>August 1996</B>
<P>
<DD>Liberals no longer call themselves liberals; they prefer to be known 
as &quot;moderates.&quot;  Now a recently established California foundation has come 
up with a fresh way to market discredited liberal ideas of munificent government.  The 
California Wellness Foundation (CWF) is using the expansive concept of &quot;wellness&quot; to 
advance a broad-based policy agenda that is hostile 
to individual liberty and responsibility.
<DD>Created by the privatization of a major nonprofit Health Maintenance 
Organization (HMO), the foundation is emerging as 
a grantmaking behemoth.  With a multi-million dollar budget and nearly a billion dollars 
in assets, it has already become a major player in the nation's largest state.
<DD>CWF has taken on a cornucopia of concerns: gun ownership, smoking, 
consumption of alcoholic beverages, teenage pregnancy, to name a few.  In FY 1994-95 
CWF awarded 129 grants totaling nearly $40 million to institutions, organizations and 
individuals to tackle these and other issues that 
constitute what CWF has defined as 
&quot;prevention&quot; and &quot;wellness.&quot;
<DD>Wellness is the latest buzz-phrase among hip grantmakers.  Sufficiently vague, this 
all-encompassing term appeals to foundation professionals who believe that specific 
missions and mandates hinder their creative grantmaking talents.  Like the &quot;general 
welfare&quot; clause of the Constitution, wellness provides the imaginative foundation 
officer with limitless possibilities.
<DD>CWF's stated goal is &quot;to improve the 
health of the residents of California&quot; and 
&quot;foster healthful lifestyles, behaviors, and values.&quot; 
 To CWF, health or illness is defined not as the absence or presence of disease, &quot;but by a complex web of conditions in [the] physical and social environment,&quot; and CWF has determined its grantmaking must address &quot;the multiple barriers to healthful living from personal behavior to social and 
economic influences such as poverty, unemployment, inadequate schools and racism.&quot;  In other words, wellness means whatever CWF wants it to mean.  Sound familiar?  Such a program is simply an updated version of the root-causes rationale used to justify the 1960s War on Poverty.  
<DD>Grants are awarded in five program areas: Community Health; Population 
Health; Worksite Health Improvement; Violence Prevention; and Teenage Pregnancy and 
Birth Prevention.  Each of these creates a theater 
of operation for government intervention.  CWF's first project, the Violence 
Prevention Initiative, is fully developed and being 
expanded.  The ominous-sounding Teenage Pregnancy and Birth Prevention Initiative 
is still in the formative state.<P> 
<CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER>
<P>
<DD>Although a grantmaking foundation obligated to foster a public charitable 
interest, CWF is a recent offspring of a 
commercial enterprise.  CWF's &quot;parent&quot; is Health 
Net, the second largest health maintenance organization (HMO) in California, with 1.3 
million commercial and Medicare HMO members, many of them subscribers with CalPERS 
(the state Public Employees Retirement System).  CWF benefits from the considerable 
cachet associated with its parent's former status as a nonprofit insurer.
<DD>In 1990 the previously nonprofit Health Net became a for-profit  corporation.  
Because California law requires nonprofits that privatize to leave their assets in the 
nonprofit sector, Health Net created CWF in 1991, funding it in 1992 to the tune of $300 
million ($75 million cash, $225 million in a 
long-term, interest-bearing note), plus 25.7 million 
shares of Class B nonvoting stock, which convert 
to Class A voting shares when sold.  Its most recent Annual Report (1995) posts assets 
of $851.8 million.
<DD>In January 1994, Health Net merged with QualMed, a Colorado-based HMO, to 
form Health Systems International, which has been actively acquiring smaller HMOs, mostly 
in the Northeast.  Health Net-today a subsidiary of HSI-is actively pursuing the 
Medicare and small-group market, moves that have interesting implications for CWF and its work.  
<DD>As a new foundation, CWF's Board of Directors (then headed by Roger 
Greaves, founder, president and CEO of Health Net) was free to set priorities &quot;unencumbered 
by past funding commitments&quot; (as the 1993 annual report put it) or, for that 
matter, unencumbered by earlier ideological baggage.  Unlike such organizations as the 
Pew Charitable Trusts or the Ford Foundation, which had left-wing agendas thrust 
upon them, CWF has been &quot;progressive&quot; from 
the start.
<P>
<a name="regs"></a>
<B>Education for Regulation</B>
<P><DD>CWF's central organizing concept is &quot;prevention.&quot;  In today's political lexicon, that means far more than immunization programs for kids, X-ray screening for TB or breast cancer, or providing physical exams and dental work for the poor.  The new 
&quot;prevention&quot; includes these, but also much more:  it aims for total elimination of &quot;risk behaviors&quot; 
and anything &quot;bad&quot; in that &quot;complex web of 
conditions.&quot;  A report funded by CWF for the Washington-based Partnership for 
Prevention (of which Health Net is a member) puts it this way:
<DD>&quot;Imagine a new drug that would cure an epidemic . . . a new surgery that would 
correct . . . heart disease . . . a new prenatal 
therapy that would help over 100,000 
low-birthweight babies survive. . . .  Let's go one step further.  Imagine a way to 
<I>prevent</I> the epidemic; to <I>prevent </I> the heart disease; to 
<I>prevent</I>  the low birth weight&quot; (emphasis in original text).
<DD>Desirable as that may sound, full realization of such goals would require 
constant government intervention in people's 
lives, with every behavior added to the lists of targets for modification.  CWF gives 
few details on how this is to be accomplished.  What is clear, however, is that CWF's 
prevention paradigm is a model for a major expansion of the nanny state.
<DD>CWF is not a membership organization, and as a nonprofit with an IRS 
501(c)(3) status it is not permitted to lobby on 
specific legislation.  But it does engage in 
&quot;effecting policy change through public education.&quot;   
In practice, this means convincing the public to 
<I>accept and demand</I>  the laws, ordinances, and regulations CWF believes are 
necessary for public health and &quot;wellness.&quot;  
<DD>Like other foundations, CWF is a money machine; it funnels grants to 
community-based nonprofits and individuals eager 
to make demands for government action, and sponsors university research to bolster 
&quot;progressive&quot; policy initiatives.  But more 
importantly, CWF is a modern, high-tech foundation that recognizes the value of getting 
out the message  especially in California, a big state with expensive media-driven 
politics and a tradition of creating policy by means of ballot initiative.  Thus, CWF recruits 
experienced consulting firms that develop and implement campaigns even to the point 
of serious involvement in state ballot measures and national legislation.  Examples listed 
in the 1995 annual report include:
<UL>
<LI> $500,000 to Public Media Center &quot;to support a public education project on 
health impacts of proposed federal budget cuts on children and families in California.&quot;  
&quot;The campaign joined advocates from a wide 
range of organizations, bringing a unified voice 
to the debate.&quot;
<DD>Public Media Center is a nonprofit, public interest advertising firm based in San 
Francisco, which  as the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> puts it  &quot;Goes for [the] Jugular to 
Push Causes.&quot;  The 20-year-old PMC places more than $1 million in newspaper ads a year in major papers on behalf of clients such 
as Planned Parenthood, Sierra Club, and Handgun Control Inc., according to the 
<I>Journal</I>.  Last year, it placed fear-inducing ads 
opposing the Contract With America.  The Contract &quot;guarantees drastic losses for 
children,&quot; warned one such hyperbolic ad, which 
delineated a parade of horribles that would plague the nation if the Republican agenda 
were enacted, e.g., &quot;neglected and brutalized 
children will not be protected.&quot; 
<LI> $363,000 to the Marin Institute, &quot;to 
build the capacity of five target California cities 
to effectively address the role of alcohol marketing and availability in the economic 
development of these communities.&quot;
<DD>This nonprofit research firm in the North San Francisco Bay Area is hostile to 
both tobacco and alcohol consumption, and explores ways of &quot;empowering&quot; local 
communities to restrict access to them through 
ordinances limiting or banning advertising, sales, and consumption.  The Institute grew out 
of the famous Buck Trust controversy and was established with funds from the Trust.
<LI> $4 million to Public Media Center &quot;to develop and implement a campaign to 
increase [public] awareness about ... Proposition 188.&quot;  This was a 1994 California 
ballot initiative, sponsored by tobacco companies, that sought to curb the ability of local 
communities to enact anti-smoking ordinances that were more stringent than state law.  
PMC &quot;used print, radio and television ads to 
inform Californians about the threat to the 
public's health.&quot;  CWF reports that surveys at 
the start showed Californians in support of the proposition.  After the emotionally 
charged propaganda blitz by PMC, voters rejected 
it (1995 annual report).
</UL>
<P>
<a name="fav"></a>
<B>Currying Favor with the State?</B>
<P><DD><I>Organization Trends</I> has previously documented how foundations establish a 
financial relationship with state and local governments as a shortcut to achieving their 
policy goals, e.g., a new health care plan or 
education reform.  Often these programs have 
little public support  hence, lawmakers are unlikely to provide funding  so the 
foundation gives the state money to run a pilot program.  The state legislators are often 
hardly aware that state agencies are relying on outside grantmakers for policy direction.  Yet the program becomes entrenched.  Eventually the government takes over the funding 
 and the public gets stuck with something it never wanted.  It's an easy way to avoid 
the sticky problems associated with democratic self government.
<DD>Like other large philanthropies, CWF gives money to selected government 
institutions and agencies, local and state, for 
start-up costs of scholarships, fellowships, and 
research projects.  Some examples:
<UL>
<LI> $775,000 to UC Berkeley in 1995 to support the Schools Wellness Project, 
&quot;a...model aimed at transforming 11 K-12 Bay 
Area schools into centers of community health promotion.&quot;
<LI> $30,000 to the L.A. Unified School District in 1995 &quot;to create a program to identify, 
track, and assist pregnant teens.&quot;
<LI> $15,000 to UC Berkeley, School of Public Health, in 1994 &quot;to conduct research on 
the politics of prevention in health care reform and to assess the influence of the work 
supported by [CWF].&quot;
</UL>
<DD>Commenting on this connection to government, former CWF president and 
CEO Howard Kahn wrote:  &quot;Recognizing the central role of government in the lives of all Californians, we have not shied away from involvement with government and 
public policy issues.  Instead, we have embraced opportunities to affect public policy and 
leverage public funds.&quot;  (Leverage is the key word; the foundation provides $100, 
and soon the government is spending $10 million on a state-wide prevention program.)
<DD>This means, Kahn explained, &quot;evaluation of government-sponsored social and 
health service programs,&quot; and &quot;partnering&quot; 
with government &quot;to attempt to influence the shape of new or existing public programs&quot; and to ensure that &quot;prevention assumes a central role . . . in . . . efforts [of health care reform] within California.&quot;
<DD>To those who would raise an eyebrow over a possible conflict of interest between a 
foundation established by a major HMO that is aggressively pursuing Medicare and 
other government contracts at the same time that 
it gives money to government agencies and attempts to &quot;influence . . . public health 
programs&quot;:  Be advised that such activity is 
not only condoned, it's applauded as a fine example of &quot;partnering.&quot;
<P>
<a name="prev"></a>
<P><B>The Violence Prevention Initiative</B>
<P>Although millions of dollars have been awarded for projects in all five program 
areas (cited above), CWF's top priority has been the Violence Prevention Initiative (VPI).  
In just four short years CWF has positioned itself in the vanguard of the gun 
control crusade.  It has committed $30 million to 
this project, with other foundations kicking in an additional $10 million.
<P>Basically this is a gun-control campaign.  It has drawn nationwide public attention 
and has endeared the fledgling foundation to a sympathetic media.  Consistent with its 
organizing principles, CWF claims to have been the first organization to make gun control 
a public health issue.  &quot;The Initiative 
breaks with tradition by putting the issue . . . in 
a public health perspective that centers on prevention,&quot; says CWF literature.    
<DD>Yes, prevention.  What good is it, asks CWF, for a man to receive a clean bill of 
health at the local clinic, if he is killed by gunshot 
on his way home?  The solution?  Get rid of firearms.  After all, if a public health 
department can order the capping of a contaminated water source to stem cholera or order 
restaurants to stop selling tainted hamburgers, it can surely halt an &quot;epidemic&quot; of 
gun-related injuries and deaths.  
<DD>Not surprisingly, many challenge this view.  Edgar Suter, M.D., of Doctor's for Integrity 
in Policy Research, a nonprofit organization in San Ramon, Calif., has analyzed such 
allegations.  In a report titled <I>Targeting 
Deceit</I>, Suter observes that &quot;The chief strategists of the gun ban lobby have attempted to reframe the debate as a `public health' issue 
rather than a crime issue precisely because they have recognized . . . that two decades 
of criminological research has shown the bankruptcy of the claim that gun control 
reduces crime or violence.&quot; 
<DD>By using FBI and Bureau of Justice Statistics, Suter points out that drug dealers 
and drug users are &quot;overwhelmingly and disproportionately the perpetrators and victims 
of violence....[F]ar from being `innocent children,' an alarming two-thirds of gun 
homicides are of teens and young adults in the drug trade.&quot;    
<DD>Such facts make little if any impression on the anti-gun advocates, and they are 
confident of ultimate success.  &quot;This is the 
beginning of a long journey,&quot; Dr. Michael Rodriguez, Research Director of the 
CWF-funded Pacific Center for Violence Prevention, told a Sacramento anti-gun group 
last June.  As reported by the <I>Sacramento Bee, 
</I> Rodriguez warned his audience that they would face &quot;formidable obstacles, much 
like the pioneers of the anti-smoking crusade.&quot;
<DD>&quot;Twenty years ago, people were able to light up wherever they wanted,&quot; Rodriguez 
is quoted as saying.  Indeed.  And CWF is determined that just as the public was 
eventually conditioned to demand local ordinances and state laws to ban smoking in 
restaurants, work sites, and government buildings, 
&quot;education&quot; by CWF will provide the changes 
in public opinion and policy that will cause citizens to surrender their guns.  Here's 
how some of CWF's grant money is being spent on its anti-gun initiatives.
<UL> 
<LI>$650,000 every other year to fund two-year fellowships for ten community 
activists scattered throughout the state.  Also 
three annual $25,000 &quot;Peace Awards&quot; to 
selected community leaders.
<LI> $400,000 each to 17 community organizations &quot;to implement violence 
preventionprojects.&quot;
<LI> $200,000 to the Center for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco to produce 
and distribute a national televised documentary on the firearms industry.
<LI> $40,000 to the San Francisco-based Legal Community Against Violence (LCAV) for 
a resource manual, <I>Addressing Gun Violence through Local 
Ordinances</I>, a how-to book for anti-gun activists and attorneys.  It 
explains how to enact municipal ordinances that outlaw &quot;Saturday night specials&quot; 
and banish dealers from residential and other &quot;sensitive&quot; areas.  It offers advice on 
how activists can build public support for so-called &quot;rational gun regulation,&quot; and how 
to resist legal challenges to already enacted anti-gun ordinances and regulations.
</ul>
<DD>In 1992 a major grant of $1.3 million (part of an eventual total of  $7.5 million) was 
allocated to establish Rodriguez's Pacific Center for Violence Prevention.  The money went to the Trauma Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group based in San Francisco's 
General Hospital.  The Trauma Foundation has long assaulted gun ownership  going so far as to run full-page ads in major newspapers to promote anti-gun legislation.
<DD>CWF's 1993 Annual Report detailed the work of the new Center:  &quot;[L]inking 
several leading activist organizations, the Pacific Center is helping train those involved 
with the [Violence Prevention] Initiative in order to create a statewide network of 
advocates who can educate the media, public 
officials and other leaders on the public health 
perspective for violence prevention.&quot;
<DD>One such &quot;linking&quot; was with LCAV to produce the resource manual on 
passing local ordinances.  Pacific Center provided staff assistance, while Policy Director 
David Farrar contributed his expertise.  The LCAV project also borrowed anti-smoking 
activist Mark Pertschuk, son of former FTC 
Chairman Michael Pertschuk, of the California 
Preemption Education Project (a joint project of Western Consortium for Public Health 
and Americans for Nonsmokers Rights), which receives funding from CWF.
<P>
<a name="child"></a>
<B>Playing the Child Card</B>
<P><DD>Of all CWF activities, the one generating the most publicity has been the Campaign 
to Prevent Handgun Violence Against Kids.  Begun in 1993, it uses TV ads, public 
service announcements and direct mailings &quot;to 
mobilize citizen action.&quot;  CWF shamelessly 
plays the child card.  This tried-and-true tactic originated with Marian Wright Edelman 
and her Children's Defense Fund.  It entails a three-step process:  First, define an 
issue (e.g., health care, gun control, poverty) as 
a children's problem.  Second, propose a government solution.  Third, attack those 
who disagree with the specific policy as anti-children.  Thus, &quot;There are too many 
handguns, too many gun dealers and too many kids losing their lives to this epidemic, and it needs to stop,&quot; foundation President Gary Yates told the 
<I>L.A. Times</I> in April. 
<DD>The TV ads, narrated by veteran Hollywood leftist Ed Asner, told Californians 
the &quot;number one killer of kids . . . is handguns.&quot; 
 A second ad shows guns on an assembly line, with a voice-over: &quot;Business is 
booming, a handgun is produced every 20 seconds and they're put to use on our kids.  Ten kids are killed every day.  A kid commits suicide with a handgun every 8 hours.  It's an epidemic.&quot;  Suter notes that a &quot;kid&quot; 
includes anyone up to age 18  even young thugs involved in drug trafficking.
<DD>Viewers could call a toll-free number and receive a Citizen Involvement Kit, a 
brochure containing the names of community organizations to contact (most of them funded 
by CWF), names and addresses of elected officials, and a list of meaningless &quot;facts&quot; 
with which to confront officials, e.g., &quot;There are 
18 times more gun dealers than McDonald's in California.&quot;  The kit also contained 
three postcards to send to legislators asking: 
What are you doing to prevent handgun violence against California kids?
<DD>Behind the scenes of this endeavor has been the private political consulting firm 
of Martin &amp; Glantz.  Based in Marin County, it lists among its clients The Nature 
Conservancy and the Ford Foundation.  Partners Angie Martin and Gina Glantz (no relation 
to anti-tobacco enthusiast Stanton Glantz) have earned a reputation for the skill with 
which they manage advocacy campaigns.  They received over $2 million through 1994, and 
in 1995 were awarded an additional $6 million over three years &quot;to continue and expand 
the multimedia public education campaign.&quot;
<DD>A highlight of this campaign to date was a statewide, 90-minute teleconference 
titled &quot;First Aid for What's Killing Our Kids: 
A Prescription for Prevention,&quot; which 
&quot;joined the public and policy makers in 
Washington, D.C. and 18 conference sites in an 
unprecedented discussion of specific policy options for reducing violence.&quot;  The 
teleconference, held in February 1995,  featured 
pre-recorded appearances by Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services, 
and U.S. Senators Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA).  The 1,600 participants 
made the following predictable policy recommendations:
<UL>
<LI> Banning so-called Saturday night specials
<LI> &quot;Home rule&quot; for handgun regulation 
(the preemption tactic)
<LI> Regulation of handguns as a consumer product
<LI> Increasing the penalty on carrying a concealed handgun
</UL>
<DD>The 1995 annual report describes &quot;the groundbreaking video-conference&quot; in 
glowing terms as &quot;an important tool for [CWF's] policy goal of developing long term public awareness and support for preventive 
solutions to handgun violence.&quot;  Ironically, 
these recommendations would result in greater violence.  Since criminals ignore gun laws, 
disarming innocent citizens is a policy that costs more, not fewer, lives.
<DD>The obsession with guns explains CWF's mission completely, and it also says a great deal about modern-day liberalism.  CWF 
and politicians like President Clinton focus on issues like gun control and cigarettes 
because they do not have the answers to the broader 
problems afflicting society.  Thirty years ago, liberals 
thought they had the answer:  massive government 
spending and regulation.  But that didn't work; as the 
president said in his State of the Union Address earlier this year, 
&quot;the era of big government is over.&quot;  Intellectually exhausted 
and unable to win popular support for big new 
statist schemes, those seeking to score political points 
have found that guns and tobacco companies provide easy 
targets.  It is no surprise that the president has tried to make 
so much of his opponent's assertion that cigarettes are 
not necessarily addictive for everyone.  Likewise, CWF 
and other foundations have no solutions to the social 
issues confounding America.  So they rail against guns and cigarettes.
<P>
<a name="preg"></a>
<B>The Teenage Pregnancy and Birth Prevention Initiative     </B>
<P>
<DD>While the lion's share of CWF activity to date has focused on the gun &quot;epidemic,&quot; 
it appears that the foundation has even bigger plans for its teenage pregnancy initiative 
 that is if money allocation is any indication of intent.  
<DD>Until this year the Initiative received comparatively little funding, but that has 
suddenly changed.  CWF plans to award $60 million over ten years.  Only two grants 
were listed in the 1995 annual report, though they were sizable:
<UL>
<LI> $570,000 to the California Public Health Foundation to support the organizing 
and implementation of planning and advisory groups meetings.
<LI> $3.5 million to the Public Media Center 
&quot;to design and implement the first phase of a public education campaign.&quot;
</UL>
<DD>More recently, the April 18 <I>Chronicle of
Philanthropy</I> listed nine newly awarded grants totaling $6.14 million for this Initiative. 
 Of that, $5 million is to be paid over four years to the California Family Planning 
Council based in Los Angeles, &quot;to implement a 
clinical-services and prevention model for pregnant teenagers at family planning 
organizations in high-risk areas.&quot;  Also listed in 
the <I>Chronicle</I> as a special grant on 
Reproductive Health and not as part of the Initiative, 
is $50,000 to the Washington-based National Advisory Board on Ethics in 
Reproduction for &quot;administrative support and . . . 
ethical review and analysis of reproductive-policy issues.&quot;
<DD>The VPI is a cover for promoting public acceptance of gun-control.  Is the 
teenage pregnancy initiative just camouflage for 
pushing abortion as a public health measure?  While the word 
<I>abortion</I> is never mentioned in CWF literature, the title  &quot;Teenage 
Pregnancy <I>and Birth </I> Prevention Initiative&quot; 
 presents unclear euphemisms that make one wonder what the program envisions.  
The 1994 annual report admits part of the program will include finding out &quot;what has been 
learned about preventing pregnancies and births among teenagers.&quot;  Sex education and 
family planning, we're told, &quot;are <I>not</I> enough&quot; 
(emphasis in original).  CWF seems to be planning programs far beyond condom 
distribution and birth control pills.
<DD>The rationale for doing something, anything, about teenage pregnancy is 
presented in terms sure to appeal to overburdened taxpayers.  Most teenage girls who 
have babies are poor and go on welfare, and they and their children are caught in a 
descending spiral of poverty and welfare 
dependence which costs tax dollars.  Perhaps it's just 
an oversight, but CWF does not seem at all concerned about illegitimacy and 
focuses attention on teenage pregnancy <I>per 
se</I>--which could include young married couples. 
 That is, as CWF presents the issue, the problem is not so much girls having 
babies out of wedlock, but girls having babies.<HR>
<B>Rather than orchestrating propaganda campaigns, why 
doesn't CWF underwrite the research necessary to discover the cause 
and cure of cancer, AIDS, stroke, and other diseases to which 
humans are prone?<HR>
</B><BR>
<DD>One can appreciate concern about welfare and other costs to the taxpayer.  But is 
there another, more pressing consideration?  A full-term birth in a hospital runs 
anywhere from $2,000 to over $5,000plus prenatal and post-delivery care.  However, an 
elective abortion costs only a couple of hundred dollars.  
<DD>Health Net, CWF's parent, is in stiff competition with other HMOs for 
MediCal (California's Medicaid program) contracts. 
 Under capitation, the government pays an HMO so much per member.  The 
more MediCal members are assigned to it, is it 
more cost efficient to &quot;educate&quot; teenagers 
and their families to agree to abortion when 
there's an &quot;unplanned&quot; pregnancy, rather than 
giving birth, keeping the child or placing it for adoption?  A cynical observation?  Perhaps. 
 But Health Net has the reputation among health care professionals as being the 
most cost-conscious of all the HMOs.  And one of the biggest criticisms of managed care 
in general is that too much attention is paid to costs at the expense of care.
<P>
<a name="tragic"></a>
<B>A Tragic Allocation of Funds</B>
<P>
<DD>With its vast resources and connection to a major HMO, CWF could do truly 
wonderful things in the field of biomedical research.  
In a January 22 article, <I>Time</I> detailed how 
HMOs are swelling their coffers through increased memberships, only to renege when it 
comes to paying for expected medical care.  
<I>Time</I>  reported several cases of women being 
denied bone-marrow transplant therapy for breast cancer  a last-ditch, though 
not extraordinary procedure which might have saved their lives, or at least relieved 
their suffering.
<DD><I>Time</I> explained that Health Net won't 
cover any treatment it deems experimental or investigative, and considers bone marrow 
transplants such, yet like other HMOs, &quot;it 
spends nothing on research to hunt for new treatments for disease....[I]t feels bound by 
law and competition to avoid such research.&quot;  According to 
<I>Time</I>, Health Net recently rejected a proposal to allocate money to 
research ovarian cancer, fearing that under the Americans with Disabilities Act the 
company would be held liable for discrimination against people with other forms of cancer 
and other diseases.  
<DD>But if an HMO itself can't or won't pay for research, would it not be a true benefit 
to humanity for its foundation to do so?  Rather than orchestrating propaganda 
campaigns against unapproved behaviors and attempting to strip us of our right to 
self-defense, why doesn't CWF underwrite the 
research necessary to discover the cause and cure 
of cancer, AIDS, stroke, and other diseases to which humans are prone?
<DD>The tendency of foundations such as the California Wellness Foundation to 
support strategies for social and political control 
on individual behavior in the name of &quot;prevention&quot; is one of the oddities of 
contemporary liberalism.  Once defenders of individual 
freedom, they have become prim overseers of personal deportment.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P><H1>Recognizing real heroes of free-market principles</H1></P><P>11/30/94</P><P>By John A. Baden</P><P>WHAT is a hero? In literary epics such as &quot;Gilgamesh,&quot; the &quot;Illiad,&quot; or &quot;Beowulf,&quot; heroes are those who defy pain and death to live out a personal code of unqualified honor. In economists' parlance, heroes risk significant personal costs to help others. Heroism continues today, though it is, as always, in short supply.</P><P>       The familiar hero jumps into an icy river to save a drowning child. Such isolated, impulsive acts are dramatic and admirable, but are not the most important kind of heroism. The more important involves standing against the tide of opinion to do what is right. Such people may resist the power of an abusive government or cultural norms that harm the less fortunate or the environment. Two heroes in this tradition are Arthur Temple and Harry Teasley.</P><P>     Arthur Temple Jr. was born in l920, and for 26 years ran the Temple family's extensive timber empire in east Texas. In l973, he merged Temple Industries with the much larger and highly diversified Time Inc., becoming a major shareholder in Time. Arthur Temple was an entrepreneur who transformed Temple Industries into a major forest products company.</P><P>     But Temple's heroism is only tangentially related to his business success. For many years, Temple's formative years, rural people in southeast Texas attached little importance to environmental values. Since wildlife habitat had no immediate dollar value, it was ignored by the east Texas forest industry. Forest-dependent wildlife were open-access, common-pool resources. With no one to protect them, entire species were decimated by poor forestry and poaching.</P><P>     Temple stood against these pressures for years to enforce stewardship on his lands. His conservation efforts affronted the dominant culture. Arson and threats of violence were commonplace. But Temple persisted and today Temple Inland remains a national leader in supporting and applying wildlife research.</P><P>     Temple is also a civil-rights hero. Six years before &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; he led the integration of schools in his company's town of Diboll, Texas. In the mid-1960s, a group of civil-rights activists was traveling through the South, going into segregated restaurants and staging sit-ins if they were refused service. Temple Industries had built a cafe in Diboll, the Pine Bough, to provide company visitors and residents with a quality restaurant.</P><P>     The manager called Arthur Temple, then company president, saying these activists would soon test the Pine Bough - what should he do? &quot;Serve 'em&quot; replied Temple. Then, realizing this might be difficult for the manager, Temple said he could work the cash register and his wife could wait tables. Temple led by example to overcome the prejudices of his time. With such leadership, the regular staff handled the situation.</P><P>     Our other hero is Harry E. Teasley Jr., CEO of the Coca-Cola Nestle joint enterprise headquartered in Tampa, Fla. Teasley vigorously opposed the construction of a taxpayer-subsidized hotel intended to boost business for Tampa's money-losing, city-owned convention center.</P><P>     Teasley had a principled opposition to this misadventure in civic socialism. He spent $15,000 of his own money on a public opinion survey. The survey, done by a professional polling firm, showed 90 percent of Tampa's voters wanted a referendum on the hotel's bonds. Two-thirds of registered voters opposed publicly subsidized funding. Teasley then purchased an ad in the Tampa Tribune Times explaining the economic and ethical problems with the hotel. Teasley had no financial interest in the hotel or convention business. He was simply a public-spirited citizen with the means, the character, and the intelligence to promote good public policy.</P><P>     Like Arthur Temple, Harry Teasley took the hero's stance. In doing so, he demonstrates the difference between being pro-business and pro-free market. There was strong business support for the hotel - the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and Tampa Downtown Partnership urged the City Council's support. Before Teasley, there was only weak opposition because people of substance wouldn't take a public position.</P><P>     Like Dr. Stockman in Henrik Ibsen's &quot;Enemy of the People,&quot; Teasley stood up and told the truth. Defying the business community, he kept standing and telling the truth. Unlike Dr. Stockman, Teasley won.</P><P>     Teasley offered a pro-free market position with strong theoretical and ethical legitimacy: Government should not subsidize services that are provided by the market. Since wealth and political power go together, such subsidies become socialism for the well-off. Tampa's convention center was an economic loser, and the hotel could not rescue it. As Ludwig von Mises noted: &quot;Government intervention always breeds economic dislocations that necessitate more Government intervention.&quot;</P><P>       Heroes such as Arthur Temple and Harry Teasley are important to all societies; their behavior exemplifies values we want people to emulate. They defy prevailing opinion, be it racial prejudice, faith in socialism, or poaching. Heroes are role models who make it easier for the less-courageous to act justly. At a time when there is widespread cynicism toward those active in public affairs, we should recognize and honor our heroes. We are going to need more of them.</P><P>_________</P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

<title>Directory of Public Policy Organizations -- Intro -- 
Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h2>Introduction</h2><hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The <a href="dppo-toc.html"><i>Directory of Public Policy Organizations</i></a> is a publication of The Heritage Foundation's <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/rban.htm">Resource Bank</a>. This first 
edition lists public policy organizations that may generally be said to 
share the broadly "conservative" or "classical liberal" point of view. It is 
our hope that this directory will be helpful to the news media, 
government officials, policy groups, academic institutions, and the public 
in locating organizations on the full range of public policy issues.
<p>
	Building the conservative movement is the main function of the 
nineteen-year-old Resource Bank. Part of Heritage's <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/extrel.html">External Relations 
Department</a>, the Resource Bank is a communications link and 
information clearinghouse for some 400 conservative policy groups and 
2,000 conservative experts and scholars around the world. 
<p>
	Its main activities include publishing the monthly <a 
href="rtoc.html#insid"><i>Insider</i></a> newsletter and biennial 
Guide to Public Policy Experts; hosting several regular policy working 
groups; building directories of policy organizations, experts, and 
activists; organizing conferences and meetings of conservative scholars 
and policy group directors; and handling referrals concerning 
conservative groups and experts. 
<p>
	Placing special emphasis on the growing network of grassroots 
and state policy organizations, The Heritage Foundation's Resource 
Bank advances the conservative cause by highlighting the work of other 
conservative groups, promoting strong intra-movement communications, 
and organizing timely leadership strategy forums.

Founded in 1973, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> is a research and 
educational institute -- a think tank -- whose mission is to formulate and promote 
conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited 
government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national 
defense.
<p>
Heritage's staff pursues this mission by performing timely, accurate research addressing 
key policy issues and effectively marketing these findings to our primary audiences: 
members of Congress, key congressional staff members, policymakers in the executive 
branch, the nation's news media, and the academic and policy communities.  Heritage's 
products include publications, articles, lectures, conferences, and meetings.
<p>
Governed by an independent Board of Trustees, The Heritage Foundation is a non-
partisan, tax-exempt institution.  Heritage relies on the private financial support of the 
general public -- individuals, foundations, and corporations -- for its income, and accepts 
no government funds and performs no contract work.  Heritage is one of the nations 
largest public policy research organizations.  More than 200,000 contributors make it the 
most broadly supported think tank in America.

<h3>March, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Understanding Corporate Government Relations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join The Heritage 
Foundation after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.<P>
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isnt the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business communitys pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted usso far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolutionfocus and closure are critical.<p>

<H2>Business Relations Department</h2>

<hr>
<p>
The primary mission of the Business Relations department is to educate and mobilize the business community -- entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, trade associations, and activists -- on behalf of the  free enterprise/limited government policy agenda.  The department has coordinated briefings for industry groups on the current status of health care reform, telecommunications deregulation, trade, budget and tax reform, and deregulation.  
<p>
	In addition to meeting and briefing corporate representatives, the Business Relations department is working with industry coalitions to advance our agenda; coordinating working group meetings on the flat tax and regulatory reform; creating a "Resource Bank of Business" by identifying businessmen willing to speak, write, and testify on behalf of free enterprise/limited government policies; coordinating the activities of  our <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/physc.html"><b>Physicians Council</b></a>; and launching a new <a href="#council"><b>Business Council</b></a> of the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	In addition to smaller, informal briefings, we host Heritage's regular <b><i>Washington Policy Roundtable</i></b> meetings which bring Heritage experts, industry representatives, and policy makers together to discuss issues that are being debated on Capitol Hill.  <b><i>Roundtable</i></b> meetings this year have included:

<h3>Business Council</h3>
<p>
Heritage launched a Business Council, which will educate business executives, small business owners, and entrepreneurs about issues that directly affect them.  Our goal in establishing a Business Council of the Heritage Foundation is to identify a group of businessmen activists who, through their civic, business and community activities will help us leverage our own work on issues like tax and regulatory reform, health care, the federal budget, and education reform.
<p>
Members of the Council receive receive Heritage reports through the mail and by fax.  And serve as a source of information for Heritage experts on the impact government policies have on real people. 
 <p>
	If you are interested in joining the Business Council of The Heritage Foundation, please contact:  Bridgett Wagner, Director of Business Relations at 202/608-6050 or via email at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<p>
<a name="flattax">
<h3>Flat Tax Transition Rules Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation and the Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation have conducted a series of meetings that address various aspects of making a successful transition to a fundamentally reformed tax system.  These meetings will result in "white papers" and recommendations on moving towards effective transition rules. Topics have included: Accumulated Depreciation; Interest Deductibility; Health Care and Employee Benefits; Border Adjustability and Foreign Taxation; and Charitable Contributions.  If you are interested in learning more about these meetings or being added to our mailing list, please contact Bridgett Wagner at (202) 546-4400 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:wagnerb@heritage.org">wagnerb@heritage.org</a>.

<p><a name="regs">
<h3>Regulatory Reform Working Group</h3>
<p>

	The Heritage Foundation leads the way in promoting regulatory reform by bringing together Hill Staff, lobbyists, and regulatory reform experts to address the ways in which we can make regulatory reform become a reality.  Topics include "How to Win the Environmental Debate," as well as other business, health and safety regulations.

	The  Project on Federalism and the States, formerly the Governors' Forum, was established in 1993 to enhance the role of the chief executives and legislators of the fifty states in the public debate on issues of national importance.  The broad purpose of the Project is to help increase the voice of the states in Washington to ensure that their interests command greater attention from officials in the federal government.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States is committed to restoring a balance between federal and state responsibilities through a reinvigoration of federalism.  The transfer of power from the states to Washington over the past decades has reached an unprecedented level, with virtually no area of public policy free from directives from Washington.  As the authority of state and local governments has declined, their ability to protect the interests of their constituents has continued to erode.  With decision-making on most major issues now firmly centered in Washington, state and local governments and their constituents are subjected to an ever-expanding list of mandates, regulations, and financial burdens which take little or no account of the differences between the states or of the wishes of their electorates.
<P>
	The  Project on Federalism and the States provides a platform in Washington for governors, state legislators, attorneys general, and other state and local officials to articulate directly to the Congress their positions on issues such as welfare reform, crime, education, and unfunded federal mandates on the states.   The Project highlights public policy innovations occurring outside Washington DC  through activities such as gubernatorial lectures, press conferences, position papers and editorials on key issues affecting the states, and extensive networking with national, state, and local media.

 The Heritage Foundation's research in the area of health care has always underscored the importance of consumer choice and patient power in our health care system.  Individual ownership of health care insurance and individual control of health care spending are critical if we are to contain health care costs and preserve the high quality health care delivery Americans have come to expect. <p>
 In 1994 at the time of the debates over the Clinton Health Care Plan, Heritage formed a Physicians Council made up of doctors who were concerned about the increasing role and interference of the federal government in the practice of medicine and the prospect of the Clinton Health Care Plan becoming a reality. Members of the Physicians Council helped Heritage publicize the details of the Clinton plan, its costs, its complexities, and its unprecedented control of both public and private health care spending.

<P>

	Today, the Physicians Council of The Heritage Foundation continues to play an active role in informing the medical and policymaking communities about what's at stake in the health care policy debates in Washington.  The Council brings together physicians from all over the country and from many different specialties.  It has no fancy offices and no high-paid lobbyists like many of the large medical societies.  Its aim is simple:  To communicate with patients and physicians about what reforms would mean and to provide ways to let politicians know the views of doctors.  The Heritage Foundation provides for the research needs of the Council and keeps members up-to-date on what is happening in health care reform through a broad range of easy-to-read studies and regular mailings.
<p>
	The Physicians Council is chaired by Heritage Board Chairman, David Brown, M.D., a retired orthopedic surgeon from Oklahoma City, OK.  The more than 700 members of the Council help Heritage leverage our own research and marketing efforts through their use of Heritage speakers, their use of our materials in their own communications, and their distribution of our publications to colleagues and patients.  The membership dues of the Council members ($250/year) help to fund much of the work of our health care analysts, the publication of our policy papers, and distribution of our <i>Physicians Council Reports</i>.  
<p>
	The past year has been an active one in the area of health care.  In 1995 Heritage's model became the framework for the legislation to reform Medicare.  The Heritage plan called for the "voucherization" of Medicare so that seniors could choose private alternatives to Medicare.  Ultimately, legislation did not pass the Congress, but we continue to work with members of Congress and senior staff aides on this issue.   In fact, our June 1996 <i>Physicians Council Report</i> titled, "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/pcr3.html">Average Household Faces $14,000 Tax Bill to Keep Medicare Afloat</a>," highlights the urgent and continuing need to reform our Medicare system.
<p>
	On lessening the daily regulatory burdens doctors face, one Heritage paper has proved especially influential:  "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1056.html">Cutting Red Tape on Clinical Labs:  Why Congress Should Deregulate Doctors</a>."  Written by Physicians Council member Sandra Mahkorn, M.D., the report was used by Representative Bill Archer to convince fellow Members of Congress of the need for his crucial reform legislation.  And another paper, "<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1059.html">Reforming Medicare:  What Congress Can Learn From the Health Plans of America's Corporations</a>," by Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D., was circulated throughout Congress by Congressman Charlie Norwood of Georgia.

<h3>Activities -- Second Quarter 1996</h3>
<p>
	Second quarter health care reform activities focused on providing the medical community with a better understanding of the elements of the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform legislation and the latest news on the Medicare Trust Fund.  
<p>
	An April 24 Physicians Council dinner in Chicago brought Heritage members and staff together with AMA President-elect Daniel "Stormy" Johnson to discuss the AMA's public policy activities and positions on the latest health care legislation.  At this dinner, Johnson credited Heritage's Bob Moffit with educating the AMA board of directors on the fundamental flaws of our health care financing system, and Heritage Vice President Grace-Marie Arnett shared an early copy of her publication, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/pcr2.html">"Cops And Doctors, Part II"</a> which broke the story on the very frightening waste, fraud, and abuse provisions contained in the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation.  At this meeting, Johnson pledged to review these provisions, and the AMA subsequently mounted a substantial lobbying effort to remove or modify this portion of the bill.  This publication was released as a <i>Physicians Council Report</i>, and copies were distributed to Physicians Council members, Hill offices, and the AMA.

	On May 17, physicians who are members of the Heritage President's Club met with Rep. Greg Ganske, M.D. (R-IA) to discuss managed care's "gag rule" on doctors and brief them on his pending legislation addressing this issue.  And, our June 20-21 Physicians Council meeting brought members together for a program of panel discussions on the current political debate over health care reform and Medicare.  For the first time, we asked that presentations at this meeting incorporate a message of how to communicate our message to patients and colleagues.  And, we used this meeting to learn more about how Heritage can better work with doctors to deliver the message of consumer choice and competition in health care.
<p>

	Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), chairman of the Speaker's Steering Committee on Health and the Resource Group on Health of the Health Care Task Force in the House of Representatives, opened our meeting with a dinner address.  Morning speakers included:   Stuart Butler, Marshall Wittmann, Grace-Marie Arnett, and Mike Franc, now Director of Communications for House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT), chairman of the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force, closed the meeting with a luncheon address on "Why We Need Tax Reform to Truly Reform our Health Care System."  Sen. Bennett's speech provided such a thorough and understandable overview of the problems of our health care financing system and the reforms necessary that we plan to publish his remarks as a <i>Heritage Lecture</i> and distribute these to our Council members, medical societies, and specialty organizations.

<p>
	Upcoming Activities:  The next meeting of the Physicians Council is scheduled for December 3-4 in Washington, D.C.

<H3>Corporate Responsibility</h3>
<p>
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5><tr><td>
	On Thursday, May 16, President Clinton and Vice President Gore will convene a White House conference on corporate responsibility.  CEO's have been invited to participate in a program of panel discussions that will highlight "good corporate citizens" and emphasize behavior the President wants other companies to follow.  What will President Clinton and the White House team propose, and what will America's CEO's report from the front line?  The Heritage Foundation's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy Mark Wilson's essay below highlights several key issues business leaders should keep in mind when politicians turn to the topic of "corporate responsibility".
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	After three years of talking about economic insecurity and pursuing government solutions, President Clinton is now trying to walk a fine line between encouraging corporate citizenship and mandating it.  Hence, we see the White House promoting principles of corporate responsibility, while members of the President's Administration and political party propose more government mandates and incentives.  Americans are concerned about their jobs and wages, but in an election year politicians would rather focus that concern on business instead of the real problem: the high cost of government.
<p>
	Do companies have obligations beyond the bottom line?  Of course they do, but <b>the primary responsibility of companies is to produce the best possible products and services for the best possible price.  This, in turn, will ensure the most secure jobs for workers at the highest possible wages, as well as the highest profits for shareholders.</b>
<p>
	Striving to be competitive in a global marketplace does not mean that companies do not care about their workers or communities.  In fact, it can be argued that it is the competitive market forces a business faces every day, not government regulations, that cause it to be responsive to its customers, shareholders, employees, and communities.  For example:
<p><ul>
<li>Between 1942 and 1970, before the creation of OSHA, companies steadily improved workplace health and safety on their own as the total number of work-related injuries in the U.S. declined by 45 percent.  
<p>
 <li>Companies also recognize the goodwill generated by community giving.  In 1994, corporate giving totaled $6 billion.  Thirty-seven percent went to education, 26 percent went to health and human services, 12 percent went to cultural and arts activities, and 10 percent went to civic and community groups.
 <p>
<li>Companies also recognize the importance of training their workers.  Virtually all large establishments, and 69 percent of small establishments, provide some formal training to their workers.<sup>i</sup>  Over half of all establishments that provided formal training made it available to all employees.
</ul><p>
	Companies that are downsizing are not undertaking these measures just to increase their profits.  Rather, they are fundamentally restructuring how they operate in response to competition and to better serve their customers.  In a competitive marketplace no company can be sure how its customer demands will change, what its products will be, or even exactly what business it will be in five years from now.  Moreover, customers are demanding more for less.  If one company can not meet their needs, customers will look for another that does.  So, companies must remain flexible and innovative.
<p>
	The recent pummeling that business has taken in the press is largely undeserved.  And the President should be applauded for highlighting the positive contributions that companies make to society.  In fact, the innovation and invention inherent in business rarely gets much press or attention, but it is crucial to social progress and improvements in American living standards.  
<p>
	The problem, of course, is that politicians are not elected for talking about good deeds.  They are elected to solve problems by passing laws, creating programs, and legislating benefits.  Hence, we see liberals pressing for another mandated increase in the minimum wage and hailing the passage of the Family Medical Leave Act as a great accomplishment.  The dichotomy between the President's recent statement that the government can't make all companies do good things, and his proposal to mandate that all businesses provide health care insurance to their workers is a troubling contradiction.
<p>
	The public, Congress, and the President need to keep in mind that there are no government programs that will make layoffs disappear.  Mandating benefits and training will not eliminate layoffs or increase real wages.  Shutting off imports and immigration will not guarantee everyone a well-paying, secure job.  And sending every American to college will not end economic growth and its accompanying dislocations.  For as long as there has been economic progress, there have been layoffs.
<p><ul>
<li>Although over the past 15 years an average of 20 million workers per year experience at least one spell of unemployment, the economy has managed to create 25 million <i>net</i> new jobs. <sup>ii</sup>
<p>
<li>Sixty percent of the companies reporting job cuts in the twelve months ending June 1995, were also creating new positions at the same time.<sup>iii</sup>  The net workforce change in companies reporting job cuts was only -1.1 percent, down from -5.2 percent the year before.  Because of concurrent job creation, job elimination is no longer synonymous with downsizing.<sup>iv</sup>
<p>
 <li>Of business layoffs that involved 50 or more workers from October to December 1995, most were due to seasonal jobs ending (41.6 percent), slack work (12.2 percent), or the completion of contract work (8.4 percent).<sup>v</sup>  Company reorganizations, business ownership change, and domestic relocation together accounted for 10.9 percent of layoffs.  Import competition and overseas relocation together accounted for less than 1 percent.
 <p>
<li>Those companies that are downsizing many have taken a variety of actions to avoid workforce reductions.  Forty-three percent implement pay cuts and transfers, 40 percent offer voluntary separations, 10 percent offer voluntary job sharing.<sup>vi</sup>  Further, most downsizing companies (75 percent) offer a variety of outplacement assistance to laid-off workers.  Forty-six percent provide extended severance pay, 40 percent provide extended health coverage, and 19 percent provide job retraining.
<p>
<li>Seventy-five percent of all displaced workers who lost their jobs between January 1991 and December 1992 found new jobs.<sup>vii</sup>  Only 11.5 percent remained unemployed.
<p>
<li>Most displaced workers (53 percent) who found new jobs were earning the same as or more than their old job paid.  Over 27 percent were earning 20 percent more.<sup>viii</sup>  And, 82 percent of workers who were previously covered by group health insurance were covered in their new jobs.  Median weekly earnings, however, were 8.2 percent less than the old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>ix</sup>
<p>
<li>Although the overall distribution of job duration has not changed over the last two decades, the distribution of long-term jobs across the population has changed in two ways.<sup>x</sup>  First, individuals, particularly men, with little education (less than twelve years) are substantially less likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago.  Second, women with at least a high-school education are substantially more likely to be in long-term jobs today than they were twenty years ago. 
</ul><p>
	Competition and economic change are a source of America's strength and opportunity.  Government mandates limit innovation by requiring a one-size-fits-all solution, and they will only diminish economic growth. Employment security in the 1990s and beyond will depend upon business flexibility and individuals' ability to adapt to the changing demands of jobs and the job market.  Workers who will fare the best are those with a good basic education, a strong work ethic, sound communication skills, and a willingness to relocate. 
<p>
	Corporate citizenship can not be enhanced with complex tax code changes, trade restrictions, or job-killing increases in the minimum wage.  Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems: high taxes on labor and capital, and job-restricting regulations.  Correcting these problems will increase economic growth, real wages, and job opportunities.

<H3>How Congress Won the Budget War</H3></center>
<P>Its one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; its quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to a new Heritage Foundation analysis.

<P>	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics Ron Utt.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices, and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  

<P>"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war."

<P>	Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.

<P>	Utts conclusion: Congresss accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agencys budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagans goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congresss 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.

<P>	Granted, theres much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congresss performance was," Utt says,  "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congresss cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the countrys four "power marketing administrations."

<P>	With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congresss goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "Theres no reason it cant cut spending a second time."

<H3>PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3><p> 
<table border=2 width=75% cellpadding=7 cellspacing=7><tr><td>
	President Clinton signed the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform bill on August 21, 1996, and the provisions of the bill will become effective on July 1, 1997.  The exception being the four-year Medical Savings Account demonstration project, arguably the most "controversial" provision of the bill, which will become effective January 1, 1997. The huge margins of support for the bill in both the House and Senate reflect the deep desire of Members of Congress from both parties to address the serious and continuing problems faced by workers and their families in getting and keeping health insurance coverage.  Despite the voting margins, many Members remain concerned that specific provisions, even though drafted with the best of intentions, could have unintended and seriously damaging consequences.
<p>
	Over the next several weeks, in the wake of the political conventions and into the election, analysts, aides, and members of the business community will analyze the legislation to determine its impact on employees and businesses, as well as its impact on the American health care system.  Legal teams from the various professional associations will pore over the new law, trying to ferret out the meaning of some of the more abstruse provisions of this highly technical document, and you can be sure that they will find a few surprises--the unexpected always happens in the legislative process.  Heritage's Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies, <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a> shares his "preliminary observations" of the legislation below.
</td></tr></table></center>
<p>
	With the number of uninsured Americans rising by about a million a year, the 104th Congress was anxious to pass some type of health care reform legislation that would begin to address the serious problems facing the health insurance market.  Provisions of the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation are designed to reform the employer-based health insurance market and guarantee portability of insurance coverage for workers.  Our analysts believe that its provisions for guaranteed issue, limitations on pre-existing condition exclusions, and guaranteed renewal of policies may make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market, but they will not make it more <i>affordable</i>.  
<p>
	The bill increases the deductibility for the self-insured, but not by much.  And the long-fought-over MSA demonstration project most certainly will disappoint those longing for a more open market in health care.  The government will dictate MSA policies instead of letting them develop in response to consumer demands, and the four-year trial is limited to 750,000 MSAs -- hardly an incentive for the private sector to compete.  How did this happen?  And what else can we expect from the bill?
<p>
<b>1. The bill is the lowest common political denominator. </b>
<blockquote><p>
	The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was the only vehicle that Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives and moderates could agree to vote on and pass into law this year.  It passed the Senate by 98 to 0; the House 421 to 2; only liberal Democrats Pete Stark of California and Pat Williams of Montana voted against it in the House of Representatives.  (Many in the business community know Congressman Stark as a major congressional champion of a single-payer system.)
<p>
	In one respect, this is a limited bill.  It has a very narrow focus, namely, health insurance regulation.  And, regardless of the particulars of health insurance rules, they are not decisive in terms of the structure of the market.  What is decisive is the tax treatment of health insurance and medical services.  At best, and putting the very best face on it, this bill should only be seen as a down payment on real market reform--and real market reform will come only with tax reform.  In that respect, we have not even begun to reform the American health care system.  In fact, we have a very long way to go.  
<p>
	The good news is that the debate on the tax treatment of health insurance and health care services is unavoidable, precisely because the debate on tax reform, including a major overhaul of our tax code, is unavoidable.  
</blockquote><p>
<b>2.  The American people should not expect dramatic changes resulting from the President signing the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.</b>  
<blockquote><p>
	We will not see a drop in health care costs.  Unfortunately, we probably will not see a drop in the rate of uninsurance either. Also, we will not see <i>true</i> portability in health insurance, like we have in auto insurance or homeowners insurance or life insurance, the kind of portability that we take for granted in all of these areas.  The reason:  Americans will still not be able to own their own health insurance policies, like they can in other areas of insurance, and take it with them when they change jobs.  Policies will still remain the property of employers. 
<p>
	Once again, we should remember that insurance regulation, no matter how well- or ill-intentioned, does not and cannot fix the major distortions in the broken health insurance market.  Only changes in the federal tax treatment of health insurance can do that.  This bill does <i>not</i> do that. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>3.  There are certain features of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that will help millions of Americans who already have insurance at their place of work. </b>
<blockquote> 
<p>
	The bill sets up unprecedented federal ground rules for the health insurance market, so that Americans who are working will be able to keep health insurance from job to job.  In this way the new law does address the very real worries of millions of Americans who will lose health coverage if they get sick or lose their jobs.  It does this by establishing rules to guarantee, through regulation, portability of health coverage.  With guaranteed issue, health insurance companies must sell you policies in the individual market after you have exhausted your COBRA coverage.  With a limitation on exclusion of pre-existing medical conditions, they cannot deny you or your employer a policy because of your medical status.  With guaranteed renewability, your insurance company in the individual market cannot drop you if you get sick.
<p>
	The bill, therefore, will make health insurance coverage more <i>available</i> in the individual market.  It will not, however, make it more <i>affordable</i>.
</blockquote><p>
<b>4.  In fixing <i>some</i> problems in the health insurance market, the bill could create others.</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
	The American health insurance market is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy.  This regulation is overwhelmingly done at the state level, and state regulation imposes rules on insurance ranging from rate setting for doctors and hospitals to mandating that companies include very specific benefits, everything from in vitro fertilization to psychological counseling.  These state regulations are costly for individuals, families, and small businesses.  In the state of Maryland, for example, these mandates add about 25 percent to the costs of health insurance premiums.  Furthermore, the bill creates two potentially serious problems:
<p><ul>
<li><b><i>First, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill adds a new layer of federal regulation on top of the existing morass of state rules.</i></b>  The concern among analysts at The Heritage Foundation and elsewhere is that the new federal rules will drive health care costs up.  The reasons:  nobody, no matter how sick, can be denied health insurance; nobody's health insurance can be canceled, except for cause, such as fraud; your medical conditions are henceforth not a barrier to health insurance.  Of course, many medical professionals find these changes desirable. 
<p>
These new federal rules may establish equity of sorts among patients--which is what they are designed to do--but, taken alone, without any other offsetting market changes, they will add to the cost of insurance.  We don't all automatically win.  There will be losers with this bill: those who become uninsured because they can't afford the premium increases or because individual insurers in this new and even more highly regulated environment may withdraw from the market. 
<p>
How much will costs go up?  Nobody knows for sure but there are a range of estimates.  The American Academy of Actuaries says that it will be a modest increase, between 3 and 5 percent.  Individual insurers say we will see anywhere from 10 to 30 percent increases in the individual market.  The increases and adjustments are hard to predict in a rapidly changing employer-based market.  But, in any case, we should be going into this with our eyes open. 
<p>
<li><b><i>Second, the bill sets up a vast, federal data collection apparatus at the federal level, including the storage and sharing of patient records. </i></b>    Each person will have, under the bill, a "patient identifier" code, and this is designed to simplify the administration of the system.  In the text of the conference report, the Congress restates its good intention to protect privacy.  Good intentions are not enough.  As the <i>Washington Post</i> pointed out recently, unauthorized leaks could result in confidential data being sent into electronic mailboxes all over the country.  At The Heritage Foundation we are more than a little nervous about the potential for abuse. This is only the first controversial issue to surface with the passage of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.  There will doubtless be others.
</ul><p>
	A "technical corrections" bill will likely be introduced early next year to fix the glitches created by various provisions of  Kassebaum-Kennedy.  Two items should be at the top of the agenda:  First, further modification or elimination of unnecessary fines and penalties on doctors.  My colleagues at The Heritage Foundation have opposed, on sound federalist principle, the nationalization of criminal law, usurping or overriding the authority of the states.  There are today over 3,000 criminal laws.  The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill has added a half dozen more of them.  While Members of Congress insist that they have heard the message from physicians justifiably angry over the imposition of new fines and penalties amidst the growing underbrush of thorny and complicated rules and regulations.  Members of Congress claim to have "fixed" the problem, but we believe that more can be done to protect honest physicians from overzealous bureaucrats.  If Congress remains conservative, the deregulation of the medical profession should be a top priority, just as the deregulation of agriculture and communications has been a top priority in this Congress.  
<p>
	Second, no personal medical record should be turned over to any public or private agency without the express, written permission of the patient. 
</blockquote><p>
<b>5. The Kassebaum-Kennedy Bill could have, but didn't, advance health care reforms that would have made the American system work better for individuals and families. </b>
<blockquote><p>

	<b><i>First, the bill is not nearly generous enough in providing tax relief to individuals and families, regardless of where they work or even the status of their employment.</i></b>  It increases the deductibility for the self-insured from 30 percent to 80 percent--by the year 2006!  While this is a step in the right direction, in itself it is no big deal.  It falls far short of tax equity for individuals and families--and there is not much pizzazz in waiting ten years for the full implementation of a measure that will approach a bare modicum of tax equity.
<p>
	Real tax relief either in the form of tax credits or vouchers for low-income persons, would be a far more generous approach.  It would expand personal choice for individuals and families, and make health insurance and health care itself more affordable.  In any case, tax credits would be more equitable than deductions, especially for lower-income and lower-middle income working families.  
<p>
<b><i>Second, a related item, the MSA demonstration program looks as if it were designed to fail.</i></b>  We hope it doesn't fail, but that's how it looks.  The four-year demonstration project imposes a cap of 750,000 policies that get tax equity, including the self-employed and individuals in firms with anywhere between 2 and 50 employees.  And it is hobbled by literally dozens of statutory conditions on employers and insurers, too extensive and intricate to enumerate here; and it requires a tight policing of these policies by the IRS. 
<P>
	With all of the attendant paperwork, two problems are immediately evident:  (a) small employers are wrestling with too much government paperwork now.  And this program, with its strict reporting requirements and conditions, is hardly designed to make it an attractive option for harried small businesses; (b) such an artificially small pool of potential policyholders--over a four-year period--is not likely to be inviting to a broad spectrum of commercial insurers.  This means that only a small number of insurers currently specializing in high-deductible polices, who are also willing to put up with the government's regulatory regime, will venture to participate.  The likely result: premiums will be higher than if the option were open to a much broader competition. 
<p>
	If you are interested in a demonstration of the dynamism of the market, the powerful and fruitful collision of the forces of supply and demand, designed to unleash free market forces, this is not it.  This is a political compromise.  Others can judge who got the best of the compromise; the market reformers or the regulators?  Furthermore, the very premise of a demonstration program for medical savings accounts also should be questioned.  Over 2,500 companies already have adopted MSA's, and we know that they are very popular with employees and have been successful in controlling costs in the companies where they are used.  And, as for adverse selection, employers have managed risks with managed care, and there is no reason why they can't manage risks with Medical Savings Accounts.  Moreover, they are popular with employees, even though their savings accounts are subject to federal and state taxation and thus are hobbled by an unfair discrimination in tax treatment.
<p>
	The opposition to individual tax relief and Medical Savings Accounts seems to be grounded in fear; not a fear that they are a bad idea or will fail, but rather that they are an excellent idea and will succeed.  Once individuals and families have individual tax relief, they will pick and choose their own plans and policies, their own doctors and medical treatments and procedures.  And, liberals in Congress know that once families start exercising this level of personal choice, they will never - politically -- be able to take that freedom of choice away.  Families with Medical Savings Accounts are hard, if not impossible, for regulators to regulate; huge, consolidated managed care networks, dominated by a few large insurers in any given area of the country, are comparatively easy to regulate.  It is also easy to transition from such a consolidated corporate system into a single-payer system.
<p>
	The short-term value of Medical Savings Accounts, even in the truncated form found in Kassebaum-Kennedy, is that it will give some employers another health care option that can help them hold down costs, and it will give thousands of individuals and families the power to choose their own physicians, medical treatments, and medical services.  And ultimately this is the kind of health care system Americans want.  
<p>
	Unfortunately, we still have a lot of work to do to get there.

<title>Average Household Faces $14,000 Tax Bill to Keep Medicare Afloat -- Heritage</title>

<h3>AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD FACES $14,000 TAX BILL TO KEEP MEDICARE AFLOAT</h3>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Physicians Council Report No. 3<br>
June 20, 1996<br>
</center><hr width=50%>								
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The tax bill for every household in America will come to $14,000 to keep Medicare afloat through the year 2005, according to a new Heritage Foundation analysis of the recent Medicare Trustees' report on the program's financial condition.


	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As has been widely reported, the hospital insurance portion of Medicare (Part A) will run out of money in 2001, at which point it will literally be illegal for the program to pay full benefits.  To keep this segment of Medicare operating until 2005 will require a $400 billion bailout, or $4,000 in new taxes on every household in America, according to the Heritage analysis.
<p><i>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi110c1.gif">Chart 1:</a> Money Available to Pay Hospital Benefits<p>
</i>


	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The situation for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other services, is in many ways even worse.  Under current law, the cost of Part B is paid partly by beneficiaries (about 30 percent) and partly by taxpayers (about 70 percent).  Yet, if no changes are made to Medicare, by 2005 the taxpayer share of Part B costs is projected to rise to 84 percent.  With Part B costs expected to total $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years, that translates into a taxpayer share of $950 billion, or $10,000 for every family in America.
<p><i>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi110c2.gif">Chart 2:</a> Who Pays for Part B Costs<p>
</i>
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite this bleak forecast, the Medicare Trustees balked at proposing serious solutions to the program's terminal financial condition.  Instead, they proposed a "national commission" to recommend solutions to Congress.  But all this will do is allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years, and by that point, the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic.

	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress and the White House should act now to repair Medicare's finances by making three structural changes to the program:<ol>

 <p><li>Turn Medicare into a "defined contribution" program, which would give seniors a specified amount of money to purchase health coverage instead of providing specific benefits.  
 
 <p><li>Allow Medicare recipients to choose from a wide range of health plans, which would give them access to fuller coverage (prescription drug benefits, for example) and spur competition between plans to hold down costs.  
 
<p><li>Reduce the Part B subsidy for those who don't need it, which would correct a costly situation in which millionaire seniors get just as much help paying their doctor bills as those who rely entirely on Social Security checks to make ends meet.

	</ol><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Policy makers have limited choices when it comes to fixing Medicare: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms.  Only the third choice makes any sense, and the quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	While Members of Congress try to reform Medicare and reduce the paperwork burden on doctors and patients, they also should realize that doctors' medical laboratories are caught in a web of government red tape that adds billions of dollars to America's health care costs. This misguided regulatory intervention is based on faulty data; has caused the loss of private, physician-based laboratory testing by thousands of doctors throughout the United States; and has compromised patient access to timely, high quality care for millions of Americans. To eliminate unnecessary regulation of the health care sector of the economy and improve both the productivity and efficiency of patient care, Congress should eliminate the burdens imposed on doctors by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. This can be done easily within the broader context of Medicare reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) constitute the nation's most sweeping regulation of physician-based laboratories. Under CLIA, doctors must submit to regulatory requirements for the simplest and most common tests used in the routine treatment of patients, including tests for pregnancy and strep infections. According to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid, and CLIA, implementation of CLIA adds between $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion annually to the cost of performing clinical laboratory tests in doctors' offices.<sup>2</sup> To the extent that they are aware of them at all, most taxpayers probably think laboratory regulations affect research centers, hospitals, or other facilities staffed by white-coated researchers in sterile rooms filled with exotic equipment. CLIA applies to these entities, but it also reaches into the two-room doctor's office in New York's central Harlem and the private practice of an internist in Ames, Iowa. As Representative Bill Archer (R-TX), Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has noted:
<blockquote>
	The CLIA restrictions have caused thousands of physicians to discontinue all or some portion of essential clinical laboratory testing in their offices. This creates a barrier to patient compliance with diagnostic treatment protocols and causes patient inconvenience. For example, for many tests a patient must be referred to an outside laboratory to have a specimen taken and tested. This poses a substantial hardship for many patients, most notably the elderly, the disabled and families who live in underserved areas. Often times, these patients cannot travel or find someone to take them to these facilities. The result is that they do not obtain the necessary testing.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Doctors and hospitals must struggle with mountains of government-generated paperwork to comply with thousands of pages of rules, regulations, and guidelines promulgated by the Health Care Financing Administration.<sup>4</sup> As Congress debates Medicare's future, particularly how to ensure its financial solvency and stability, it also must address the impact of these rules and regulations on doctors, hospitals, and private medical practice. Though responsible for only a part of this paperwork burden, CLIA's impact on private medical practice has been significant. Not only is it costly; it has lowered the quality of patient care by causing unnecessary changes in office practice:  inconvenience for doctors and patients alike, decreased patient access, and diagnostic delays.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In recent years, Members of Congress have begun to rethink CLIA. For example, Representative Archer and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) have introduced legislation to correct CLIA's excesses. Representative Archer's Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act Amendments of 1995 (H.R. 1386) would exempt physicians' office laboratories from CLIA rules. Senator Hutchison has introduced similar legislation (S. 877). To reform the American health care system, especially the bureaucracy that runs federal health programs, Congress should lift this unnecessary burden on the expeditious delivery of high-quality health care.
<p>

<b>THE ROOTS OF LAB REGULATION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	CLIA is rooted in congressional deliberations almost thirty years ago. When Wilbur Cohen, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), and Dr. D.J. Sencer, Director of the U.S. Public Health Service's Communicable Disease Center, appeared before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on May 2, 1967, they testified that the error rate in laboratory testing was as high as 25 percent. Secretary Cohen's testimony also included a sensational case of a woman who lost her breast because of a lab error that occurred in 1936.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Dr. F. William Sunderman, noted pathologist and father of the quality control methodology known as proficiency testing,<sup>5</sup> challenged Dr. Sencer's testimony. Along with other noted pathologists, Dr. Sunderman questioned the statement that "erroneous results are obtained in more than 25 percent of all tests analyzed."  Dr. Sencer responded but included no timely supporting data, except for the results of analyses done by Dr. Sunderman himself 22 years earlier in 1945,<sup>6</sup> before the laboratory profession voluntarily began to conduct proficiency testing.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Based on the archaic data presented by HEW (predecessor of today's HHS) and fueled by the political intervention of Senator Jacob Javits (R-NY) and a front-page story in <I>The New York Times</I>, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1967. Members of the professional medical community protested. Twenty-two pathologists submitted refuting testimony, delineating numerous technical errors in previous HEW testimony, but to no avail.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In 1980, Dr. Joseph Boutwell, Deputy Director of CDC's Bureau of Laboratories, charged that there was a 14 percent error rate in some of the most commonly performed medical tests. Dr. Boutwell eventually admitted his estimates were much too high,<sup>8</sup> but no anxious reporters were waiting to publish the CDC's retraction of the misleading data. The damage had been done. Boutwell's error laid the foundation for a governmental grip on laboratory and medical practice that became increasingly stifling as the 1980s came to a close.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Twenty years after CLIA '67, in 1987 and 1988, federal regulation of laboratories again surfaced with naive and sometimes sensational articles in the <I>Wall Street Journal, New York Times,</I> and <I>Ladies Home Journal</I>. A February 1987 <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article, "False Negative:  Medical Labs, Trusted as Largely Error-Free, Are Far from Infallible," by Walter Bogdanich began, "It was 4:30 a.m. when cancer finally choked the last breath of life from Janice Johnson. She was 34 and the mother of two, and she died never knowing why her disease had been so unforgiving."  Describing this and several other negative outcomes of laboratory error, the story railed against the lack of government regulation of laboratories, focusing on Pap Smears and shopping mall cholesterol screening. Members of Congress held a frenzy of media-oriented hearings. Senator Brock Adams (D-WA) called as a witness a woman who had cancer of the cervix, but an expert reviewer of a preceding malpractice suit indicated that no laboratory error was involved.<sup>9</sup> Unfortunately, no HCFA or CDC witness ever acknowledged that "not only did they already have jurisdiction over the so-called Pap mills, which they did under CLIA '67, but also that they could have closed any one of them at any time if they elected to do so."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The federal regulatory locomotive steamed along with unrelenting speed, and Congress passed CLIA '88. Pamela Nash, Director of Governmental Affairs for the American Association of Clinical Chemists, called it "legislation by anecdote, not by overwhelming evidence, and not by an understanding of this very complex and technical field."<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The scope of CLIA '88 is daunting. It includes not only the 13,000 laboratories regulated by CLIA '67, but also an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 physician office labs. CLIA's real significance, however, lies not in its numerical reach, but in its jurisdictional impact. For the first time, Congress established federal authority to regulate the practice of medicine, and the regulatory regime expanded dramatically. Sponsored by Representative John Dingell (D-MI), the eight-page bill led to 1,600 pages of bureaucratic regulation after a three-and-a-half year gestation period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Congress gave the Department of Health and Human Services the authority, under CLIA, to regulate laboratory testing tools and procedures employed in a physician's office. The agency responsible for drafting the regulations was HHS's Health Care Financing Administration. Despite the fact that many simple and accurate technologies would qualify for a certificate of waiver because so many of these tests "have an insignificant risk of an erroneous result" or "pose no reasonable risk of harm to the patient if performed incorrectly,"<sup>12</sup> only nine tests were exempt. Moreover, HCFA has not proven to be a model of flexibility in granting waivers. As a result, the same paperwork that is required of the megalabs is required of individual physicians.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Physician laboratories that perform only an occasional test for mononucleosis now must conduct two additional control specimens, tripling the cost of the test. Proficiency testing<sup>13</sup> is required for all tests regardless of where they are performed. The list of regulatory requirements is considerable and has prompted a cottage industry of physician office lab consultants. As Michael Jahn, senior editor of the <I>Medical Laboratory Observer</I>, has noted, "With or without extra schooling, CLIA is providing a sizable number of laboratorians with new career options. Nearly one-third of respondents (30%) report that they or a colleague in their laboratory have begun acting as a consultant to POL's (physician office labs) as a result of CLIA."<sup>14</sup>  Few busy physicians could keep up with the reams of regulations and the frequent revisions and additions generated by regulators. In a letter to the White House shortly after the regulations were issued, an Iowa doctor poignantly described his dilemma:  "I have taken what little time I have and consulted laboratory personnel, laboratory directors in larger hospitals, paid and sent for materials explaining the standards, and spent several thousand dollars in equipping and changing our laboratory to meet many of the regulations that are impacting our office at this time."<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The final HHS regulations, drafted by HCFA officials, became effective at the end of 1992. In 1993, however, it appeared that even members of the Clinton Administration recognized that CLIA was an unnecessary burden. Initial drafts of Hillary Clinton's health care reform proposal, leaked in September 1993, would have provided substantial "CLIA relief."  But as the health care reform debate intensified, concessions to powerful liberals in Congress led to the unraveling of any CLIA reform efforts on the part of the Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the meantime, thousands of physicians have closed their simple labs; numerous on-site testing kits and devices, once in the pipeline, have been scrapped; and countless patients have fallen victim to diagnostic delays or, in some areas, to complete lack of access to simple, on-site diagnostic technology. Ironically, though CLIA '88 mandated on-site proficiency testing for technicians interpreting Pap smears -- the very problem that generated the legislation -- this testing still has not been implemented.
<p>



<b>A LAW IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	A Personal Observation. One day, after an extended weekend vacation, I returned to my office a little early, knowing that I would be facing a five-day pile of mail. While sifting through test results that had been returned, I came across a positive strep screen. The patient's throat had been only slightly infected, and I had performed a throat culture that was sent out to the reference lab. Had this been 1991, I would have performed a simple strep screen, realized treatment was needed, and sent her on her way, prescription in hand. She had gone untreated for five days, but had not developed rheumatic fever. She was lucky, and I was relieved. Months earlier, we had been advised by hospital laboratory consultants that it would be better to eliminate any test that the CLIA bureaucrats considered "moderately complex" because the cost of complying would be too high. Since we served the poor and the Medicaid population, we knew the projected threefold price increase for doing strep screens under CLIA would be prohibitive. I thought back to my experience in Africa several years earlier. My patients there had access to more on-site testing than patients in my inner-city clinic in 1995. Moreover, my practice was not unique. A January 1994 article in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> indicated that because of CLIA, almost a quarter of all pediatricians had stopped or had planned to stop office testing for strep infections.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The 1988 legislation mandated that five studies relating to the relevance and impact of CLIA be conducted by 1990,<sup>17</sup> two years before the final regulations were issued. One mandate required HHS to examine the validity, reliability, and accuracy of proficiency testing, something physicians' office labs now must perform three times a year, and at considerable cost, for each non-waived test they conduct on-site. Today, proficiency testing is a multimillion-dollar business, with most of the testing performed by the College of American Pathologists. Another mandate required an examination of the "extent and nature of problems in the diagnosis and treatment of patients caused by inaccurate laboratory test results."<sup>18</sup>  By the time the final regulations were published in 1992, not one of these studies had even been initiated; HHS officials complained no funds had been allocated. Federal bureaucrats were unwilling or unable to spend a few million dollars to conduct research that might have guided the regulatory pen. Nonetheless, HHS officials had no hesitancy about charging ahead with a final regulation that would cost consumers billions of dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In 1992, after issuance of the final regulation, the <I>Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine</I> conducted a literature search to determine the impact of laboratory errors. The "bottom line" question was whether testing errors that occurred in physicians' offices before CLIA '88 resulted in negative health outcomes for patients. The question could not be answered because the data did not exist. Only one hospital-based study even examined the impact of testing errors. Of the 328 patients involved in those incidents, not one was "harmed."<sup>19</sup>  No true outcomes data existed for physicians' offices.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In other words, there are no data showing that patients are harmed as a result of testing in the physician's office as opposed to a reference lab. In fact, recent evidence collected by the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN) suggests that sending specimens off-site for analysis may increase the likelihood of lab error.<sup>20</sup> Consistent with earlier research, the ASPN found that 83.4 percent of lab test-related problems occurred before or after actual performance of the test itself (pre- or post-analytical); 75 percent of all identified problems occurred in tests referred to an outside laboratory. Of the ten problems judged to have a significant impact on patient care, half occurred because specimens were delayed or lost -- hazards related to transporting specimens to outside labs. The logical interpretation:  Because fewer tests are performed on site, more negative outcomes are likely.
<p>
<b>RISING COSTS</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	CLIA was not supposed to add to America's tax burden, but recent HHS budgets have seen millions of dollars allocated to various agencies for CLIA-related costs. Because physicians and laboratories must assume the many extra costs attached to CLIA, charges are likely to be passed on to working families, adding to the health care cost-shifting they already experience from Medicare and Medicaid. Of course, HCFA officials know this:  "The final rule will significantly increase the operating expenses of the nation's laboratory industry -- perhaps by as much as 6% per year. Most laboratories will successfully pass on these cost increases to patients and other consumers of their services."<sup>21</sup>  Officials felt they could even predict how "willing" the public was to pay the extra costs:  "We project that non-poor American households may be willing to pay anywhere from 5 percent to 25 percent more for laboratory services.... "<sup>22</sup> At the same time, however, "many physician offices may see their laboratory costs increase by 10 percent or more--and the cost of an average test rise in excess of a dollar."<sup>23</sup>  HCFA's glib analysis reflects government's failure to understand "real world America."  With medical overhead costs already running over 60 percent and tens of millions of uninsured unable to pay for basic health care, CLIA has forced tens of thousands of physicians' office labs to curtail their operations or shut down altogether.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Though HCFA officials acknowledged that CLIA would add $1.2 billion to $2.1 billion to America's health care cost burden in 1994 alone, and even more in later years,<sup>24</sup> they failed to account for many other cost factors:<ul>

<p><li>Abrupt changes in practice patterns and the number of POLs that would cease operation;

<p><li>The cost of return visits to have test results, previously often available at the time of the initial visit, explained and a treatment regimen advanced or initiated;

<p><li>Unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits when a physician cannot perform certain tests in the office because of excessive administrative and regulatory costs;

<p><li>Increased morbidity and complication rates from diagnostic delays and difficulties in notifying patients of serious problems because tests now are sent out and the results not returned until at least the next day; and

<p><li>The dramatic market shift that would make this new technology inaccessible.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Yet these officials did not hesitate to impose a multibillion-dollar regulatory burden even though "These cost increases may reduce the ability of certain already-financially burdened providers to deliver services, and of the poor, uninsured, and underinsured to obtain needed care."<sup>25</sup>  And they showed no hesitation over imposing substantial administrative "hassles" even though "there exists no irrefutable evidence demonstrating that the clinical laboratories or public health status will improve tangibly under our regulation."<sup>26</sup>  Even HCFA officials concede that CLIA rules are expensive. But, given the dramatic change in physician office labs and the testing device industry, it may be impossible to quantify their broad financial impact.

<p>
<b>ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK FOR DOCTORS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	An ancillary benefit of the national debate on the future of Medicare, the huge and financially troubled government insurance program that covers approximately 38 million elderly and disabled Americans, is that taxpayers finally are learning about the mountain of paperwork generated by this bureaucratic system. According to Nancy Dickey, M.D., a practicing family physician and Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association (AMA), "It has been estimated that physicians now spend over 25 percent of their time processing paperwork and complying with the technical requirements of an unending blizzard of Medicare regulations. This is time that could be used more productively treating patients."<sup>27</sup>  This burden has been growing without interruption for many years. In a survey conducted by Louis Harris and Associates on behalf of the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), an independent panel that advises Congress on physician payment in the Medicare program, seven out of ten physicians expressed deep concern over administrative "hassles" and further expressed the view that "red tape" is worse in Medicare than in any other insurance plan, including managed care plans and Medicaid.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	CLIA's regulations are making matters even worse, yet there is no evidence additional lab regulations, paperwork requirements, costs, inspections, and proficiency testing improve the quality of medical care. The Texas Medical Association surveyed Texas physicians in 1994 to determine whether they felt CLIA improved quality. Sixty-eight percent said "no," and only 7 percent responded affirmatively. An American Association of Dermatology survey yielded even more striking results:  97 percent of respondents saying CLIA did not improve accuracy and 82 percent expressing the opinion that CLIA "reduced the overall quality of care."  These sentiments are not confined to doctors. According to a 1994 survey published in <I>Medical Laboratory Observer,</I> "Roughly two out of three laboratorians feel CLIA has failed to improve the quality of patient care and has adversely affected the clinical laboratory profession."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Some professional medical organizations have attempted to help physicians comply with CLIA rules by publishing "How To" manuals. These manuals, often inches thick, describe the tedious documentation required under CLIA. Keeping up can be a full-time job. HCFA's voluminous regulations constantly germinate and spawn revisions, retractions, and additions. The Texas Medical Association analyzed the labor and administrative overhead resulting from implementation of CLIA and discovered that added costs average $10,000 per year per physician office lab site, with one three-person practice running additional costs of $36,000.<sup>30</sup>
<p>

<b>CLIA'S IMPACT ON MEDICAL PRACTICE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Taxpayers should realize that, in principle, CLIA '88 represents a profound change in federal policy. It is the first time the government has succeeded in planting its foot in the physician's office to regulate the everyday practice of medicine. This forerunner of government-run medicine should not be dismissed lightly.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Physicians consider testing devices "tools of the trade" in much the same sense as a stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, or thermometer. They use laboratory tests to confirm what they already expect as a result of their clinical judgment. An ophthalmoscope is an instrument a physician uses to look at the back of a patient's eyeball. What the doctor sees there can reveal many things about the patient. In principle, a physician's use of a microscope to look at blood from that same patient should be regulated no more than his use of an ophthalmosscope or a stethoscope. All are tools that allow the physician to develop a more complete picture of the patient. The ironies are innumerable. A dermatologist may inspect a skin lesion with a magnifying glass or under a special fluorescent light (Wood's lamp), but scraping off a few flakes of skin to examine under a microscope is a federally regulated lab activity. But most patient laboratory testing errors are not caused by the testing device or procedure itself (7.3 percent); they are attributable to events occurring before (preanalytic, 45.5 percent) or after (postanalytic, 47.2 percent) the test itself was performed.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lab Closures. It is estimated that 50 percent of all laboratory testing occurs on an outpatient basis. Before CLIA '88, physician office laboratories were the most rapidly expanding segment of the laboratory industry, representing about half of all outpatient lab testing in 1986.<sup>32</sup> The projected annual growth rate for this sector was about 16 percent through 1990.<sup>33</sup> According to recent CDC data, of an annual total of 4.2 billion tests, physicians' offices now perform 294 million per year, or only 7 percent of the total.<sup>34</sup> Pre-CLIA projections were for 2.7 billion tests performed in physicians' offices.<sup>35</sup> By all estimates,<sup>36</sup> the 1994 CDC data represent a dramatic departure from predictions just a few years earlier and have stunning implications for the future of the market. The American Academy of Family Physicians noticed a particularly steep drop. When asked, "Do you perform <I>any</I> clinical laboratory tests in your office?"  only 78.9 percent responded that they did. A few years earlier, the same question elicited a 93 percent affirmative response.<sup>37</sup>

	The 1994 Texas Medical Association study found that CLIA's impact was greatest among the primary care specialties. Thirty percent of Texas family physicians and general practitioners, 19 percent of pediatricians, and 20 percent of OB/GYNs have closed their labs because of CLIA,<sup>38</sup> while 57 percent of OB/GYNs, family physicians, and GPs and 59 percent of pediatricians have stopped doing some tests because of CLIA. The American Academy of Dermatology found the same thing when it surveyed its members at a February 1995 conference:  75 percent of dermatologists had eliminated testing altogether or cut the number of tests they did in their offices, while 82 percent felt CLIA led to a reduction in the overall quality of care.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Factors other than CLIA, such as the growth of managed care, are often cited as responsible for this shift in practice patterns. However, in a survey of family physicians, among those who felt their in-office testing capabilities were insufficient to meet the needs of their patients, "too much government red tape" was mentioned by over 90 percent as the main reason.<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Advances in lab technology were promising before CLIA '88. The development of highly accurate test kits and devices, as simple to use as home pregnancy testing devices and home blood sugar monitors, was skyrocketing. These testing devices were subject to rigorous FDA approval standards. But with imposition of CLIA '88, potential markets for the promising new technology quickly disappeared. Some large companies abruptly changed course. Some persevered, finding new markets for their on-site diagnostic tests in European and Third World countries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Consider the computer industry. In the beginning, there were the big mainframes. Giant computer "brains" were needed to store masses of data that now can be stored in a small shoe box-size container that fits comfortably beneath a desk. Data entry was tedious and depended on keypunch operators and stacks of manila cards with various patterns of rectangular holes. Extracting and manipulating data was equally challenging, requiring a sophisticated understanding of computer language. Problems were common. Computers required a special expertise. Over the past two-and-a-half decades, however, computers have become efficient, "user friendly," and relatively problem free. Even children have become computer literate, fail-safe systems have eliminated data loss crises, and machines that once required moving vans can be tucked away in the side compartment of a carry-on bag.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But imagine that as the technology improved, as it became smaller and simpler to use, as it became available to the average person, the federal government required all purchasers and users of the new laptops to purchase and possess a license to use them, to keep log-in records, and to be inspected and tested on their ability to use correctly each item of software they loaded onto their hard drives. That, in effect, is what CLIA '88 has done to the clinical laboratory community. As the technology has become more accurate, user friendly, and available to the primary care physician, costly regulations and red tape have caused tens of thousands of physicians to lock up their labs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Not all lab tests are subject to the rigors of CLIA. Nine are "waived."  Three of these are available to the public for home use, three were invented before World War II, and the urine dipstick test has been available for well over three decades. CLIA's "Complexity Model" indicates that the new technology is what should worry Americans.<sup>41</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Strep throat screens, for example, have been labeled "moderately complex" even though they are as simple to perform as home pregnancy tests. A 1992 study published in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> found that sixth and seventh grade students in the Augusta, Georgia, public schools were able to perform this test with 95 to 100 percent accuracy on their first attempt after reading the directions.<sup>42</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Because their performance was so successful on the first try, the study was unable to demonstrate a learning curve. CDC's "moderate complexity" ranking, for this test and for others using the same technique, has resulted in abandonment of on-site labs in thousands of physicians' offices across the United States.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Such results and incongruities call CDC's entire complexity model into question. This model depends on subjective ratings of testing devices against several arbitrary criteria. Despite its far-reaching impact, however, federal bureaucrats never tested its real-world validity and reliability before it was imposed on the testing device marketplace and physicians' offices.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The CLIA Police. The CLIA police were out in force this past year. Thousands of physicians' offices were cited for violations, the vast majority of which were procedural and paperwork irregularities irrelevant to patient care. Penalties for noncompliance can be as high as $10,000 a day. While the fines on doctors can be onerous, in many cases the inspectors themselves do not know the first thing about patient care. A New York dermatologist, for example, was surprised to find that he was being inspected by a former patient who had been an unemployed engineer.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Unquestionably, the federal regulatory police did find deficiencies in the labs. But the vast majority were classic bureaucratic transgressions related to neglected paperwork and documentation errors:  a missing signature, for example, or the lack of procedure manuals (which no one consults anyway). Just as CLIA regulatory policy promotes the "dark ages" of testing techniques, it also represents a throwback to the dark ages of quality management. Modern quality management addresses outcomes. In not one instance can CDC officials say with certainty that adhering to any aspect of this strangulating body of regulation improves the outcome for the patient.

<p>
<b>REGULATING WITHOUT SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Within the scientific community, a great deal of discord exists regarding CLIA. In the multimillion-dollar proficiency testing business, for example, manufacturers of laboratory "instruments and reagent systems design and then manage and control the manufacturing process to ensure consistent results on fresh, human specimens."  But there are a number of flaws in the proficiency testing program. One is that materials sent to physicians' offices to test the accuracy of their results frequently are taken from chickens or cows, often are frozen and thawed numerous times, and frequently have to be reconstituted when received.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Even the founder of proficiency testing, Dr. F. William Sunderman, opposes using it as a regulatory device.<sup>44</sup>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Proficiency testing was never intended to be a regulatory tool. No existing studies link better scores on proficiency testing to improved patient outcomes. Many scientists have raised questions about the very nature of proficiency testing specimens (analytes). Proficiency testing specimens that are accurate for one type of machine often are not appropriate for another. Often, these analytes are non-human materials. For example, measuring a physician's ability to perform accurate testing on chicken blood has become the important regulatory measure of excellence, but medical device manufacturers sought to develop on-site testing devices that would perform best on fresh human serum. Now promotion of their products depends more on passing proficiency tests on chicken sera than on accuracy in testing human blood.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Cutting Services. CLIA 1988 unquestionably has dampened and even deadened on-site laboratory testing and the promise it held. Because of the formidable regulatory costs and the realization that patients and the health care system cannot afford any additional financial burden, physicians have closed and cut back on many services they once offered their patients, in many cases for free or at "break even" rates. Testing devices are relegated to dark corners on storage shelves, and microscopes have been boxed. To escape CLIA's costly embrace, and to be classified as a "waivered" lab, doctors often have traded 1990s' technology for pre-World War II models like copper sulfate hemoglobin analyses and centrifuge-generated hematocrits.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But patients are the real losers. The ultimate financial burden generated by the additional costs of paying for cholesterols and strep cultures performed in outside laboratories rests with them. They must endure the unavoidable delays that result from sending specimens off site, or the preanalytic and postanalytic errors that make up the bulk of laboratory testing problems. They have to take more time off from work. They have to pay "Elderbus" fares for return visits that now have to be scheduled to discuss test results after they have come back from outside labs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But no data show, and no scientific research confirms, that a major national problem ever existed. The inconsistencies in the federal "complexity models" and "quality standards" are apparent. A 20 percent failure rate is acceptable in screening for cervical cancer, but an elevated cholesterol level must be more accurate than most physicians feel is necessary to make treatment decisions. Even worse, the problem that initiated this federal fiasco -- erroneously read Pap Smears -- still has not been addressed. Despite the specific attention given to this problem in the original legislation, on-site proficiency testing for this cytology test has not even been started.
<p>
<b>THE BUREAUCRACY'S EXCUSES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The office of the HHS Inspector General (IG) recently conducted a study to determine whether CLIA resulted in laboratory availability problems for Medicare patients. The conclusion:  "The CLIA appears not to have affected physician ability to secure laboratory services for their patients."<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  This report represents a stunning lack of understanding of the important issues surrounding CLIA. Instead of addressing the effects of CLIA, its conclusion deals with physicians' efforts, despite regulatory obstacles, to secure needed health services for their patients. But the lack of availability of tests was never the issue. No one said patients would not be able to obtain tests; Americans no longer depend on the pony express, and medical tests can be sent to, or performed at, reference laboratories. The issues that were not addressed are precisely the ones that should have been:  issues that relate to increased inconvenience, increased costs, lack of immediate access to test results, consequent treatment delays and the need for follow-up visits, and -- most important -- the inevitably decreased quality of care and increased morbidity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In other words, the IG's study failed to address the very issue -- quality of care -- that formed the impetus for the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. It also failed to analyze CLIA's impact on physician practice patterns after the final regulations took effect. Surveys by professional organizations indicate that CLIA's major impact on physician practice occurred after the final regulation took effect in late 1992.<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	  Hence, the data regarding the impact on physician office practice prior to that time are irrelevant.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The IG did find that "CLIA appears to have some effect on the volume and types of tests being billed by POLs. Shifts from moderate and high complexity to waived testing procedures are evident.... "<sup>47</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 But that finding is, in effect, an admission that physicians have returned to pre-World War II technologies. Most of the highly accurate, new on-site tests are out of reach for the "waivered" site.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Consider what would happen if the HHS bureaucacy's reasoning were applied in any other sector of the national economy. Suppose, for example, that a large plant employing two thousand workers closes down because the owners cannot afford to comply with regulations requiring them to remove asbestos from sealed encasements and inside walls. No scientific study has shown that encased asbestos poses any harm to humans, but publicity related to deaths among asbestos-exposed shipyard workers spills over to cause a rash of regulations not supported by fact. Two thousand workers lose their jobs, but a government study determines that the regulation has had no significant impact because 95 percent of these displaced laborers find work within two years. The lesson is simple:  Those who ask the wrong questions get irrelevant answers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


	Congress can return to reason in regulating clinical labs. Already, new Members are rethinking how federal regulation has been implemented in the past. Cost-benefit analyses are being considered before any new layers of regulation are imposed. Existing regulations are being reexamined for reasonableness and scrutinized for need. The fact that hundreds of billions of dollars are taken from hard-working consumers because of regulatory costs added to the price of goods and services finally is being taken seriously.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Fortunately, CLIA's regulatory burdens on doctors and impact on patients have attracted attention in both the House and Senate. In the House, Bill Archer and dozens of his colleagues are leading the effort to reintroduce some sense and sanity to this issue. Representative Archer has introduced H.R. 1386, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act Amendments of 1995, and Kay Bailey Hutchison and colleagues are sponsoring a similar bill, S. 877, in the Senate. Congress can release the physician's office from a set of costly and unnecessarily restrictive rules that amount to regulation in search of a problem. By changing policy, Congress can change the environment in a way that benefits both doctor and patient.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><p>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>C</b>ongress is trying to reform the financially troubled Medicare
system, the huge, 30-year-old government program that insures
almost 38 million elderly and disabled Americans. The House of
Representatives recently passed the Medicare Preservation Act
(H.R. 2425). The Senate is working on similar legislation. As
both chambers consider this legislation, and how it might work
in practice, Members of Congress can learn much from the experience
of private corporations, where innovative plan designs have cut
costs  sometimes dramatically  while improving the quality of
care.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congressional action on Medicare is historic. The House bill will
save approximately $133 billion in the Hospital Insurance program
(HI, or Part A) over a seven year period and keep the hospitalization
trust fund solvent until 2010. It also will save $137 billion
in Part B, the part of Medicare that reimburses physicians, by
freezing Part B premiums at 31.5 percent of program costs, restructuring
payments to providers, and introducing market based reforms.<sup>1</sup> 
And it establishes a &quot;Medicare Plus&quot; option, where prpivate
plans, including plans with medical savings accounts, may compete
for the business of senior citizens who wish to obtain different
benefits or special medical services or procedures beyond what
is currently provided by traditional Medicare.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Financial Necessity</B>. Congressional action is also financially
necessary. Medicare is growing at 10.5 percent a year, a rate
of growth that most policymakers think is unsustainable without
unprecedented tax increases on working American families.<sup>2</sup>  Therefore,
the price of failing to reform Medicare will be alarming for America's
taxpayers. There are structural reasons why the program is so
costly. The program is based on 1960s-style concepts of government
central planning and price controls.<sup>3</sup>  And both of its key components
have failed to control costs. While costs have been exploding,
draining an ever-larger share of general revenues from other government
programs, the system has not been able to adapt quickly to innovations
in the financing and delivery of health care services that are
becoming common in the private sector.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress can learn much from the experience of private corporations.
To be sure, it must realize this experience has not occurred within
a normal market. The private-sector health insurance market is
distorted by the federal tax system, which discriminates against
individual and non-employer coverage, and hampered by complicated
rules and mandated benefits at the state level. Nevertheless,
Congress can apply key lessons from the experience of the private
sector to reform of the Medicare system. In particular, it can
obtain some insights into how a reformed Medicare might evolve
by examining the remarkable degree of innovation in corporate
plans.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The shape of private-sector insurance is changing rapidly. Two-thirds
of the private sector is covered by some kind of managed care
health plan, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs),
preferred providers (PPOs), and point of service (POS) plans.
Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are emerging in various forms,
but their emergence has been frustrated by the tax code. &quot;Scheduled
benefits&quot; or &quot;defined contribution&quot; plans are rare,
but they provide employees with a broader set of personal options,
particularly in terms of choice of doctors or specialists, than
is commonly found in conventional company-based insurance plans.
The empirical evidence shows that where there is the widest freedom
of choice and the most intense competition among providers and
health insurance options, one finds the lowest costs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Among the innovations in the private sector:
<P><UL>
<LI><B>The International Paper Company</B> established a &quot;scheduled
reimbursement&quot; plan for its employees based on the median
costs of medical services in the community. After an annual deductible,
the plan reimburses employees for 100 percent of the charges up
to the amount of the scheduled reimbursement. Employees are thus
encouraged to choose wisely among medical providers. The result:
 International Paper saw no increase in medical costs in 1994
and 1995. 
<P>
<LI><B>Golden Rule Insurance Company</B> established a medical savings
account for its employees, along with a catastrophic health insurance
plan, as an alternative to traditional health insurance plan offered
by the company. Over 90 percent of the employees participated
in the MSA option. Under this option, whatever employees do not
spend, they keep. The result:  In 1994, Golden Rule employees
had approximately $1,000 per person left over in their accounts,
and the company's insurance premiums have been flat. 
<P>
<LI><B><i>Forbes</i> magazine</B> started a cash bonus system for employees
who refrained from filing unnecessary health insurance claims.
The result:  The company has lowered its health care costs by
25 percent since the inception of the program.
<P>
<LI><B>Coors Brewing Company</B> established a &quot;wellness,&quot;
or health promotion program, for its employees in 1981. The result:
 The company has saved an estimated $1.9 million annually by decreasing
its medical costs, reducing sick leave, and increasing productivity.
</UL>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress thus has an opportunity to improve the Medicare system
as well as re-establish Medicare on a firm financial footing.
At the same time, taxpayers should understand that failure to
do so will have a profoundly negative economic impact on working
families:  High payroll taxes will have to be imposed just to
sustain the current level of Medicare spending. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In discussing the need for Congress to reform Medicare, the Medicare
Trustees call for &quot;prompt, effective and decisive action&quot;
because &quot;under the present financing schedule for the Hospital
Insurance program, it is sufficient to ensure payment of benefits
only over the next 7 years.&quot;<sup>4</sup>  Beyond inevitable tax increases
on working families, the failure to reform Medicare also has broader
negative economic consequences. According to Martin A. Regalia,
Chief Economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the tax increase
needed to save Medicare would bring the economy to the &quot;brink
of recession.&quot;<sup>5</sup>  The Chamber's study concluded that the Medicare
payroll tax would have to be raised from the current level of
2.9 percent to 6.42 percent. This would have the effect of lowering
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) $179.4 billion within two years,
a decline of 3.1 percent, thus threatening the national economy
with a recession. Employment levels would be cut 1.5 percent.
For a typical worker earning $30,000 a year, the Medicare tax
would be $1,928 instead of the current $876.<sup>6</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Barring huge tax increases, Congress must import free-market principles
of consumer choice and competition into the antiquated Medicare
system. Otherwise, costs will always be just one step ahead of
financial disaster. If Congress fails to reform Medicare, not
only will the hospitalization trust fund face a shortfall, but
the drain on the federal treasury will increase, taking critical
funds away from other federal priorities and programs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In reconciling House and Senate versions of Medicare reform, Congress
therefore must make the right decisions in reforming the program.
The experiences of the private sector, to the extent that consumer
choice and competition are vital operating principles, can provide
Congress with solid lessons for improving Medicare and eventually
adopting overall reform of the American health care system.
<P>
<h2>THE EVOLUTION OF EMPLOYER-BASED HEALTH PLANS</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a free market, informed people make rational choices among
competing services. History shows that the free market creates
the best products at the best price.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most Members of Congress appear to favor the reconstruction of
Medicare on the basis of the market principles of consumer choice
and competition. For this very reason, the private, employer-based
health insurance system is an inherently flawed model. The reason:
 The market principles of consumer choice and competition are
severely frustrated by the tax-related distortions that exist
in employer-based insurance, and, in many cases, consumer choice
is a precious market principle that appears in truncated form
or not at all.<sup>7</sup>  Generally, American consumers of health care services
do not make the key decisions over the financing and purchasing
of those services; these decisions are reserved, in many cases,
exclusively to corporate benefits managers or employers. As a
result, the consumers of health care services, including health
insurance, and the customers for health care services are different
personalities with different, and often conflicting, economic
incentives:  Employees want high quality health care, and employers
want to protect their corporate bottom line. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Historical Accident.</B> These peculiar patterns exist nowhere
else in the American economy. They are an accident of history,
not the product of congressional deliberations over the kind of
health care financing and delivery systems Americans should have.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before the Second World War, most health care was purchased out
of pocket, and costs were in line with general inflation. With
the outbreak of the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress
put the national economy on a war footing and imposed wage and
price controls throughout the economy. Labor could not bargain
for higher wages, and business could not compete for labor under
the Roosevelt Administration's wage and price guidelines. To rectify
this compensation problem, the IRS, with the support of Congress,
established the principle that health benefits would be counted
as compensation which would be exempt from the standard wage and
price guidelines and tax-free. As a result of these major tax
policy decisions drafted under wartime conditions, the United
States developed a unique system of tax-supported employer-based
insurance, which in effect amounted to prepaid medical care, exclusively
supported by the federal tax code through the place of work. Employers
bought health insurance tax-free, and employees consumed health
insurance tax-tree. This new system of &quot;third-party payers&quot;
separated employees' decisions to use health care services from
the economic consequences of their use of health care. With the
development of first dollar coverage, it is not surprising that
many American employees have come to look at health insurance
as a &quot;free good,&quot; or a beneficial &quot;add on&quot;
that simply comes with a good, solid, high-paying job. Worse,
many think that the employer's contribution to their health benefits
package is the employer's money and not their own, thus failing
to realize that increases in health care benefits packages are
a trade-off for decreases in wages and other compensation. The
central economic problem with this arrangement is that on the
demand side of the economic equation (the employees' demand for
medical services through the third-party payment system) as well
as on the supply side (the supply of medical services by doctors
and hospitals), there was no incentive to control costs. Thus,
especially in the 1960s with the advent of the giant government
health insurance programs, costs began to grow at a rate greater
than inflation. As out-of-pocket health care spending declined
and third-party payment assumed a greater share of the purchases,
national health care costs increased. From 1960 to 1993, out-of-pocket
costs dropped from 56 percent to 20 percent. For each 10 percent
decrease, the national expenditure for health care, as a percentage
of Gross Domestic Product, increased 2.4 percent.<sup>8</sup>  With the nation's
elderly coming under Medicare in 1965, a government third-party
system with the addition of taxpayer subsidies, and even higher
rates of utilization, health costs skyrocketed.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While Medicare has changed little in design over the last 30 years,
its growth rate has accelerated much more than the general levels
of inflation. Taxpayers can look for continued acceleration, largely
because of the rapid aging of the American population.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although restricted by federal tax policy that separates insurance
consumers from customers and health care costs from the consequences
of consumer decisions, private employer-based health insurance
has made some significant and positive changes in the financing
and delivery of services. Experience shows that these different
health care options result in very different costs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following is the cost control performance of several types
of private plans in 1994.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The cost is per employee and covers employees, dependents, and
retirees.
<P>
<b>TABLE</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;(Data in the table above are from a stratified random sample drawn
by Foster and Higgins from the Dunn and Bradstreet database of
private firms to assure a statistically valid sample in eight
company size categories. The Census of Governments was used to
draw a sample of state, county, city, and local governments. A
weighted scheme was used to combine the results and create one
database. The last two options are such a small part of the 1994
market that they did not appear in the larger random study. The
companies with these plans were contacted directly by the author
to obtain cost information.)
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These costs include both employer and employee costs. During this
same time frame, Medicare costs were $4,360 per person. Even given
the actuarial disparities between the older, retired element and
the younger, working element of the American population, the difference
is significant:  Medicare costs per person were $500 more than
the most expensive coverage for employees and their dependents
in the private sector.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Degrees of Freedom.</B> Information and choice are possible
on two levels. Corporate benefits managers and employers can choose
at a system level between medical groups and between insurance
plans. Or, at the level of individual service, patients can compare
costs and benefits of different plans or choose among doctors
or hospitals. Obviously, there is greater scope for market pressures
where more detailed and frequent choices can occur. It is therefore
relatively easy to rank the prominent private-sector options on
an index that includes consumer choice, information, the level
of competition, and the financial consequences that follow from
individual choices. This free-market index, with the actual costs
in each of these systems, is calculated in the chart that follows:
<P>
<b>TABLE</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Members of Congress can evaluate the specific provisions of the
House and Senate bills reforming the Medicare system in accordance
with their conformity to free-market principles of consumer choice,
competition, and openness to new information. If legislative provisions
increase consumer choice, competition, and availability of information,
the likely consequence is a decrease in cost. If they decrease
consumer choice and competition, then these provisions will likely
increase costs, either directly or indirectly. On the one hand,
premium caps or price controls (as found in the House bill, for
example) are classic mechanisms to shift costs to consumers in
non-controlled sectors of the health care economy. On the other
hand, House proposals to allow seniors the opportunity to choose
both providers and plans, and to reform antitrust laws so that
competitive new systems can be developed, should increase market
efficiency. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Medicare reform also should establish a user-friendly framework
for new information systems available to doctors and patients,
as well as organizations or associations serving the needs and
interests of senior citizens. In a reformed Medicare system, the
federal government should not intrude into every aspect of the
financing and delivery of medical services; it should establish
the ground rules of a free market and a level playing field for
different types of health care options, with individuals and private
organizations working together to make informed decisions. When
Congress mandates coverage beyond a basic minimum (as it does
in the House bill) or resorts to price-fixing, both the flexibility
and the efficiency of market-based reform, with its promise of
high quality health care at a reasonable price, are compromised.
The inevitable result:  increased costs and decreased availability
of different or innovative medical services. 
<P><h2>
PATTERNS OF PRIVATE-SECTOR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<P>

<B>Experience #1:  Using Managed Care </B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Complete choice of doctors is one of the main strengths of the
current Medicare system. Seniors generally value their ability
to choose their own doctors and correctly fear any change that
would block that choice.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One way private employers have responded to the increasing costs
of employer-provided health insurance is by limiting this choice
for employees and their families. Managed care arrangements such
as HMOs and preferred providers allow patients to choose from
a limited number of providers. Companies and corporations, through
insurance firms, have negotiated tough bargains with doctors,
hospitals, and other &quot;providers&quot; to lower costs. In
this sector of the economy, as penetration of the market by HMOs
increases 1 percent, costs have decreased 1.14 percent.<sup>9</sup>  In recent
years, the number of workers covered by managed care firms has
increased dramatically. Today, some 66 percent of all workers
are now covered by such managed care arrangements (see Chart 1).<sup>10</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Currently, HMOs are rapidly increasing their market share by offering
premiums that rise more slowly than other health care models so
that costs initially decrease and grow more slowly than in traditional
indemnity programs. Two features of private-sector managed care
experience are emerging. First, the amount HMOs actually spend
on medical care is decreasing, but insurance premiums continue
to rise. As noted in Chart 2, KPMG has reported that although
the annual growth rate of premiums has been 6 percent to 8 percent,
the costs of providing actual care decreased from 82 percent of
premiums in 1990 to 75 percent of premiums in 1994.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, according to Bernstein Research Associates, the largest
HMOs spend less than 70 percent on actual care (see Chart 3).
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, the employer shift to managed care has had an enormous
impact on the financial position of the managed care industry.
The HMO industry alone had pre-tax earnings of $3.3 billion in
1994.<sup>11</sup>  Many managed care companies use this capital to consolidate
their holdings and expand their share of the employer-based health
insurance system. Indeed this process is accelerated by state
health care reform proposals based specifically on the &quot;managed
competition&quot; theory, which is designed to promote geographically
based networks of managed care companies and increase the government's
regulatory control over the new &quot;managed market.&quot;  As
Heritage Foundation analysts and others have argued, &quot;managed
competition&quot; leads to even more government control over the
health care system and the likely concentration of the market
in the hands of large, geographically based health insurance cartels.<sup>12</sup>
 In other words, there is more management, less competition, and
greater levels of regulation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Minnesota, for example, has adopted and recently modified a major
health care reform proposal based originally on &quot;managed
competition.&quot;  Minnesota COACT (Citizens Organized Acting
Together), a grassroots organization that has evaluated health
care in Minnesota, finds that consolidation has occurred to such
an extent that just four vertically integrated managed care companies
now provide 80 percent of the medical care for Minnesota residents.
It points out that the latest studies of cost by the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) and Physicians Payment Review
Commission (PPRC) found that Minnesota's health care costs are
now 5 percent above the national average.<sup>13</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, COACT is concerned about heavier provider workloads,
decreased health care quality, and the undue political influence
of new networks on health care policy decisions made by the state
legislature. The Basic Health Care Action Group, composed of 22
large corporations in Minnesota, also is concerned over the economic
concentration of insurance power in the state and is planning
to contract outside these networks beginning in 1997. Given the
penetration of HMOs into private-sector insurance around the nation,
it is important to remember that while their initial bargaining
power helps curb costs, these cost savings are blunted as their
economic control increases. It is no surprise that a state's insurance
system can be dominated by a few strong companies, thus rendering
it an oligopoly.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;HMOs control costs by reducing the use of services. Staff model
HMOs (those HMOs that actually have doctors on a payroll) reduce
services by nearly 20 percent according to a February 1995 CBO
evaluation of managed care.<sup>14</sup>  Most studies indicate that people
in reasonably good health do well in HMOs.<sup>15</sup>  Preventive care may
even be better than in fee-for-service plans. But a Rand Health
Insurance Experiment found that individuals who were low-income
and in poor health when they entered the study had more serious
symptoms, more bed-days due to poor health, and a greater chance
of dying if assigned to the HMO.<sup>16</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second longitudinal study in Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles
followed 1,208 chronically ill patients with hypertension, diabetes,
heart disease, depression, or a combination of these problems.
The patients were divided into fee-for-service or prepaid care
groups (HMOs or IPAs). Those in the prepaid group had improved
coordination of care but reduced physician continuity and a less
comprehensive level of care. More patients reported organizational
access difficulties, such as problems obtaining emergency care,
or problems seeing a doctor when they thought they needed one,
with the prepaid plans.<sup>17</sup>  Another study of home health care services
reported that outcomes of home health care are superior for Medicare
fee-for-service patients when compared with Medicare HMO patients.<sup>18</sup>
 So chronically ill, older patients may not do as well with traditional
HMOs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #1 for Congress.</B> In terms of private-sector experience
with managed care, the lesson for Congress is that managed care
plans often generate initial savings but do not guarantee long-term
control of health care costs. Moreover, in terms of quality care,
their record is mixed. As with any health care delivery option,
there are excellent plans and poor plans. Managed care plans often
provide superior preventive medicine and often are excellent options
for persons in reasonably good health. While they are enormously
popular with private-sector employers, they may not be the best
option for low-income individuals with poor health. This means
that Congress should be neutral in devising a defined contribution
for Medicare and should avoid any government contribution or statutory
provision biased in favor of managed care at the expense of other
private health care options for the elderly.
<P>
<B>Experience #2: Scheduled Benefits. </B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of paying their workers' health care compensation in the
form of a standardized, defined set of benefits, or limiting their
choice of doctors or access to medical specialists through a company-based
managed care arrangement, other companies have limited their contributions
to a specific dollar amount while simultaneously encouraging complete
freedom of choice in selecting doctors and medical specialists.

<P>
<B>Example:  International Paper. </B>Perhaps the best example
of this approach is International Paper Company, headquartered
in Memphis, Tennessee. A <I>Fortune</I> 500 multinational producer
of paper and forest products with 52,000 U.S. employees in 44
states, International Paper considers employee choice vital to
its success in curbing health care costs.
<P>
Like so many other large corporations faced with runaway increases
in employee health care costs during the 1980s, International
Paper began to introduce standard cost sharing, with employees
paying larger premiums and copayments. Like many other companies,
it shifted from traditional first dollar coverage to an 80/20
ratio, a standard employer and employee cost-sharing arrangement.
That arrangement, in terms of the company's bottom line needs,
failed to solve the problem, so International Paper tried managed
care-type plans, as most companies are doing today. Although these
plans clearly restrict choice, increased health care costs were
so overwhelming that the managed care option was especially appealing
to the company. But International Paper's experiences were similar
to many others examined by the U.S. General Accounting Office,
the investigatory arm of Congress.<sup>19</sup>  As with so many other companies,
despite an initial decrease in the cost of health care insurance,
the rate of growth soon erased any savings. In fact, it took International
Paper just two years under its HMO plan to reach previous cost
levels.
<P>
In 1990, International Paper's corporate leadership conducted
an innovative pilot project for a new plan that maintained full
employee freedom to choose providers but used &quot;scheduled
reimbursements.&quot;  Their scheduled reimbursement plan, the
brainchild of Jerry Bowers, one of their employees, is designed
to help employees become more knowledgeable consumers of health
care by giving them a meaningful financial incentive to seek out
doctors and medical specialists who are both effective and cost-efficient.
The company's &quot;scheduled reimbursement&quot; is a set amount
for a medical service that is based on median costs for that service
in the community. In other words, the contribution is geographically
based. After an annual deductible, the plan reimburses the employee
for 100 percent of charges up to the amount of the scheduled reimbursement.
Under a separate arrangement, to cover medical catastrophic events,
the plan also pays 100 percent of &quot;usual and customary&quot;
charges, the traditional insurance reimbursement of physicians
under fee-for-service arrangements, after an employee reaches
an annual out-of-pocket maximum.
<P>
For International Paper Company, the results of this financing
arrangement have been dramatic. For employees who shifted from
the 80/20 plan in 1991 to the scheduled reimbursement plan in
1992, total medical costs per employee (including out-of-pocket
expenses) actually declined a total of 12.5 percent. That was
a savings of 14.5 percent for the company and an average savings
in out-of-pocket costs of 5.7 percent for the employee. During
1993 the cost remained largely steady, even in the face of large
cost increases for the company's more traditional 80/20 managed
care plan. International Paper, using the scheduled benefits plan,
did not have increased medical costs in 1994 or 1995.<sup>20</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #2 for Congress. </B>The lesson is clear:  Americans
can have the same or superior quality of health care and enjoy
more choice at less cost. Instead of restricting the market principles
of consumer choice and limiting choice of physicians to control
costs, International Paper has employed consumer choice to control
costs directly, with significant savings to the company and to
employees. The key is putting dollars directly in the employees'
(patients') hands. As is true of all other purchases in a market
economy, consumers indisputably are much more careful with their
own money than with someone else's. The positive experience of
International Paper clearly demonstrates the economic effectiveness
of a defined contribution approach. Its application goes beyond
Medicare to broader health care reform, including the principle
of direct tax relief in the form of tax credits and vouchers for
individuals and families.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The market experience of International Paper can also provide
a model for the &quot;look back&quot; mechanism to control Medicare
costs to meet budgetary targets. Congress is considering an across-the-board
cut in rates, as Medicare has done in the past, to guarantee this
objective. The problem with this solution is that non-discriminatory
providers who are overpricing services will be hurt a little,
but providers who are pricing wisely will be hurt even more. It
is a perverse system of rewards and punishments. The consequences
of the market must be real. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A better model for value, and a solid basis for budgetary control,
is the &quot;scheduled benefits&quot; model, another variant of
the &quot;defined contribution&quot; model, developed by the International
Paper Company. With this model, which pays up to the median cost,
prudent providers will be rewarded with more business and overcharging
providers will not be paid more than is reasonable. International
Paper, in using this principle, is spending $1,000 less than the
average fee-for-service program while still offering complete
choice of doctors. Its experience proves that normal people, given
information and a reason to use that information, can control
costs and make wise health care decisions
<P>
<B>Private Sector Experience #3: Medical Savings Accounts. </B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Medical savings accounts are another new method of health care
financing that puts the power of the dollar directly in employee
hands. The current tax laws do not allow company-based medical
savings accounts to be set up so that individuals may contribute
to them with pre-tax dollars. But companies can contribute pre-tax
dollars for the employee and can purchase a back-ended catastrophic
health care insurance plan.
<P>
<B>Example: Golden Rule. </B>While relatively new in concept,
the medical savings account model is used by about 1,500 companies
nationwide. Plans vary widely. Perhaps the most famous example
is the one developed by Golden Rule CEO Patrick Rooney and used
by managers and employees of the Golden Rule Insurance Company,
based in Indianapolis, Indiana. At Golden Rule, the company deposits
$2,000 for family coverage into a medical savings account (MSA)
to pay for routine medical expenses, even those traditionally
not covered by insurance, such as eye glasses or medication. There
is a catastrophic health care insurance policy purchased by the
company with a $3,000 deductible. This costs $1,862 per year for
family coverage. The savings account covers the first $2,000 of
the deductible; if needed, the additional $1,000 is out of pocket.
What employees do not spend on doctors, they get to keep. In 1994,
this amounted to about $1,000 per person in leftover funds. Golden
Rule's premiums have not risen since the plan was offered to employees.
Over 90 percent of the company's 1,100 employees participate in
the plan and are highly satisfied. The Luntz Research Company
has reported that 98 percent of Golden Rule employees are satisfied
with the MSA and 88 percent prefer it to past plans. Actual costs
for the Golden Rule Company are about $2,900 per family, which
includes the catastrophic policy and the actual $1,000 spent from
the MSA fund.<sup>21</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A cautionary note is provided by the Morris County Hospital in
Council Grove, Kansas. It had a medical savings account-type program
from 1983 to 1992. At first it worked well. But in the seventh
year, the total work force increased 25 percent and there was
a huge employee turnover. Medical spending below the deductible
increased 44 percent in just one year and another 27 percent the
following year. For the first seven years, the increase had been
only 3.5 percent per year. The large increase was thought to be
caused by failure in employee education. In the last three years,
the employees, especially new ones, thought the fund was a &quot;free&quot;
benefit, and spending increased dramatically. The hospital then
converted to a traditional indemnity policy.<sup>2</sup>  The message is clear:
 For MSAs to provide the savings that are needed, they must be
structured correctly. However companies may design the medical
savings account option, their experiences generally show lower
costs with MSAs than with traditional indemnity policies.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Stephen Barchet, M.D., an expert on health policy based in Washington
State, reports actual costs for seventeen different plans in the
current <I>American Compensation Association Journal</I>. An examination
of the data provides a clear picture of the potential success
of Medical Savings Accounts (see Chart 4). 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Each of these examples shows the financial impact of consumer
choice of physicians and other medical specialists. But consumer
choice of plans still is not a predominant feature of private,
employer-based health insurance. Since the private sector operates
on the basis of a third-party payer system, consumer choice of
doctors and other medical specialists is a matter of corporate,
rather than consumer, decision. The company may choose from groups
of doctors or other providers who agree to lower costs or capitate
payment (the HMO or preferred provider model). This lowers cost
but decreases the patient's choice, including the choice of a
doctor. The evolution of employer-based insurance presents a major
challenge to the traditional doctor-patient relationship, so fundamental
to the ancient ethical imperative of the medical profession itself.<sup>23</sup>
 In the International Paper Company's &quot;scheduled reimbursement&quot;
or &quot;defined contribution&quot; model, consumer choice of
providers is encouraged, and the employee is rewarded directly,
not only with a revitalization of the traditional doctor-patient
relationship, but also with the personal economic benefit of choosing
value for money.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the most dramatic development in health care financing
in recent years is the medical savings account. Once considered
a marginal contribution to health care reform efforts, MSAs have
become politically popular and are finally getting the theoretical
attention they merit from the health care policy community. The
American Academy of Actuaries, in attempting to estimate average
costs nationwide for MSA plans, reports that costs will depend
ultimately upon three critical variables. First is the existing
distribution of health care costs. Eighty-five percent of insurance
claims today are below $3,000, so a $3,000 deductible policy should
cover 85 percent of possible charges. The second factor is utilization.
The Academy says that this depends largely on the amount that
must be out of pocket in the insurance policy. The last factor
is perhaps the most important:  whether users of the medical savings
account option consider the MSA balance as insurance or savings.
At Golden Rule, for example, it clearly is savings for the employee,
since what is not spent is received by the employee in cash rebates.
Because of these variables, the American Academy of Actuaries
says that total expenditures for health care per individual could
be a band of costs ranging from $2,695 to $2,976 using an MSA
model.<sup>24</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #3 for Congress.</B> While medical savings accounts
hold great promise, it is essential for Congress to design them
correctly. Specifically, Members should make sure the patient
using the account understands that the money is his money and
he receives the direct financial benefit by spending it wisely.
<P>
<B>Private Sector Experience #4: Private Competition in the Public
Sector.</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A third model is one with which Congress already is intimately
familiar:  the right of an individual to choose among various
private health care plans, well beyond the range of choice afforded
by private companies choosing between health care plans. This
model is illustrated uniquely by the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program (FEHBP), the popular system with almost 400 private
health care options competing for the business of Members of Congress,
congressional staff, federal workers and retirees, and their dependents
 roughly nine million Americans. The Heritage Foundation, the
American Medical Association, and several other prominent institutions
and organizations, have suggested that Congress should use the
FEHBP as a basic model in reforming Medicare.<sup>25</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the FEHBP, individuals are offered private insurance options
once a year. No other class of Americans enjoys the choice of
plans and benefits available today to federal workers and their
families. For all practical purposes, federal workers and retirees
can do something that most Americans cannot even imagine:  choose
the kinds of plans and benefits they like at prices they wish
to pay. There is no government-standardized benefits package,
but a wide variety of benefit options. There are no set copayments
and deductibles, but a wide variety of copayments and deductibles.
The government offers federal workers and retirees a contribution,
fixed by a formula, for any plan they choose. The government contribution
is about 72 percent of the cost of premiums. If these consumers
wish to pay more, they may do so. If they buy a less expensive
plan, they can pay less, and thus take advantage of the savings
from picking less expensive health care options. As a model for
Medicare reform, the FEHBP is important also because 40 percent
of its policyholders are retirees and therefore represent an older
workforce compared to the private sector.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result of consumer choice and competition in the FEHBP is
a solid performance in controlling health care costs, especially
in recent years. For 1996, according to the Office of Personnel
Management, the federal agency that oversees the program, the
projected overall increase in premiums is only four tenths of
one percent. Premium growth for the past three years has been
essentially flat.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The role of the federal government in the FEHBP is to make sure
that plans offered are sound. The government does not actually
run a plan, as in the Medicare system, or even in the reformed
Medicare system envisioned in House and Senate legislation. It
simply ensures that all plans are solvent and meet standard marketing
and consumer protection requirements. The law creating the FEHBP
does not outline a system of standardized benefits like Medicare's;
nor does it standardize co-payments and deductibles as Medicare
does. And, of course, there are few Medicare-style price controls.<sup>26</sup>
 The law merely lists the categories of benefits, such as hospitalization
and physicians services and outpatient services, that plans must
offer; the health plans themselves, responding to OPM's call for
negotiation on rates and benefits each year, largely determine
the health benefits they want to offer without OPM's trying to
micromanage the process.<sup>27</sup>  From the standpoint of administration,
the program is comparatively simple. Washington economist Walton
Francis compares FEHBP and Medicare:  &quot;The FEHBP is run by
150 government bureaucrats. Medicare is run by more than 3000
bureaucrats (neither of these numbers include people paying claims).
To be sure, Medicare serves three times as many people, but FEHBP
runs three times as many plans (counting Medicare's 100 participating
HMOs).&quot;<sup>28</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Within the FEHBP, there are two persistent problems, both aggravated
by federal government policy. The first is &quot;adverse selection,&quot;
the tendency of younger and healthier people to migrate to lower
cost plans, leaving older and sicker workers in high-cost plans.
This has been a special problem for the Blue Cross/Blue Shield
plans in the program. In recent years, this problem has abated:
 &quot;More recently, the risk segmentation has stabilized, in
the sense that the high risk groups have separated so that high
risks are in the high option plan with high premiums, and the
low risk predominate in the standard option with lower costs.
In fact, for awhile the Blue Cross plan was required to increase
its premium even more in order to create greater reserves in anticipation
of high claims. Thus, the spiral has slowed, but the pricing issue
remains.&quot;<sup>29</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the adverse selection problem may have abated in recent
years, it remains, but persists only because of congressional
insistence on a crude form of community rating. Retirees and active
workers pay the same premiums regardless of age. Since older workers
have higher health care costs, private plans competing in the
FEHBP market cannot price for those differences, offsetting the
risks of enrolling older and sicker workers by charging them higher
premiums. This problem could be resolved by allowing plans to
underwrite on the basis of age, sex, and geography, at the very
least treating retirees and active employees differently, and
offsetting the resultant increase in retiree premiums with an
increase in the government contribution for retiree health care.
This might not save money, but it would minimize the adverse selection
problems the federal government created in the FEHBP market. FEHBP's
current government contribution formula, based on the premium
performance of the six largest plans participating in the program,
is also an odd political artifact. According to the Clinton Administration,
if federal workers and retirees were under a defined contribution
formula not unlike that being proposed for Medicare, rather than
the current FEHBP financing arrangement, they would be ahead in
compensation by $424 million in 1996 alone.<sup>30</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second problem is the regulatory potential of OPM to undermine
market forces and frustrate consumer choice and competition by
restricting options, mandating benefits that workers or retirees
may not want, or dropping specific benefits that federal workers
may want. The FEHBP has no flexible spending account or medical
savings account options, and OPM historically has been biased
against allowing high-deductible insurance plans to compete in
the system. While OPM has played largely a passive role in FEHBP
administration, to the general benefit of the program, this could
vary with presidential administrations.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #4 for Congress.</B> Congress should treat the elderly
like congressional retirees and make available to citizen retirees
a degree of choice equal to or superior to the level of choice
available to retired Members of Congress and their spouses. Moreover,
Congress should introduce improvements in the design of a consumer
choice system in Medicare that would lessen the problems of adverse
selection and forestall the kind of government regulatory interference
which frustrates consumer choice and competition in the FEHBP.
<P>
<B>Private Sector Experience #5: The Use of Cafeteria Plans and
Flexible Spending Accounts.</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Within the private sector, there is a limited version of the consumer
choice found in the FEHBP. Currently, one of four American workers
has some degree of choice in selecting benefits. Over the past
25 years, 250,000 employers have turned to flexible benefit plans.<sup>31</sup>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;TRW, the aerospace industrial giant, and the Educational Testing
Service of Princeton, New Jersey, both claimed to have started
the first cafeteria plans in 1974. Congress encouraged this corporate
policy by establishing flexible benefits accounts under Section
125 of the Internal Revenue Code in 1978. Under this section,
employees can deposit otherwise taxable cash compensation into
a pre-tax account for the purchase of benefits. But employees
cannot roll this account over tax free from one year to the next.
Nevertheless, the option has become very popular, particularly
among large corporations. According to an analysis conducted by
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 48 percent of employers
with 1,000 or more employees offered flexible spending accounts
in 1991 for health care.<sup>32</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Cafeteria plans, flexible benefits options, and flexible spending
accounts have been successful in controlling costs. Employers
have realized that by allowing employees to choose their benefits,
making decisions based on value for money, they have been able
to control overall costs. According to the Employers Council on
Flexible Compensation, while average medical claims costs for
all employers rose by approximately 15 percent in 1992, costs
for those with flexible plans rose by 11 percent.<sup>33</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #5 for Congress. </B>As the private sector experience
with cafeteria plans and flexible benefits shows, increased consumer
choice means increased cost control.
<P>
<B>Private Sector Experience #6: Using Private Associations.</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An American cannot get tax relief for health insurance unless
it is purchased through an employer. Thus, most Americans are
covered by employer-based plans. Yet, despite the tax discrimination
against them, non-employment health insurance plans continue to
exist. If private association plans were on a level playing field
with traditional insurance plans, their market share could be
enormous. Indeed, in a reform of the general health insurance
market of the sort suggested by The Heritage Foundation and others,
they could be a perfect way to address the problem of many uninsured
Americans. It is noteworthy that in the FEHBP, where there is
a level playing field, about one-third of all workers and retirees
choose plans sponsored by federal unions and employee organizations.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Already, over six hundred private associations, organizations,
and groups provide health insurance for their members.<sup>34</sup>  They range
from professional organizations like the Alabama Oilmen's Association,
American Society of Travel Agents, Colorado Grain and Feed Association,
and Independent Garage Owners of North Carolina to fraternal,
legal, and political organizations like the Association of the
United States Army, B'nai B'rith, Federal Bar Association, and
National Organization for Women. Many medical and health care
groups also have plans:  the American Dental Hygienists, American
Academy of Family Physicians, American Society for Microbiology,
and many more.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One of the attractions of association or organization plans is
that they combine a professional or fraternal interest with health
care concerns of their members. The Golf Course Superintendents
Association of America and National Sash and Door Jobbers Association
may not have much else in common, but they do offer health insurance
to their members. Religious institutions and labor unions also
have a potentially beneficial role in this area. Indeed, the stronger
the personal affinity of consumers with these organizations, the
more likely these institutions will be to emphasize consumer protection
and information.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Lesson #6 for Congress.</B> Members of Congress have personal
experience with being able to join health plans sponsored by groups
with which they have an affinity. Numerous associations, unions,
and organizations now offer health insurance in the private sector.
They should have the opportunity to market solid plans in the
Medicare system as well.
<P>
<h2>THE INFORMATION EXPLOSION</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to control cost most effectively, consumer choice requires
informed consumers. Nowhere is the need for solid information,
for consumers as patients and doctors as providers of health care
services, more evident than in a reformed health care market.
While consumers need solid information on plan options, and the
prices and benefits available to them, doctors and hospitals and
medical specialists in a new consumer-based market will have a
continuing need for up-to-date information, including clinical
and scientific data, on the treatment and cure of disease, as
well as cost.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The good news is that the information explosion, a post-industrial
revolution that promises to improve the quality of life and the
efficiency of America's economic system, is shattering the traditional
way doctors and patients interact with one another:  &quot;Patients
are interviewing physicians, hiring and firing them.&quot;<sup>35</sup>  At
the same time, the information superhighway is an avenue of information
on specific illnesses where patients can exchange information
on treatments, physicians, and outcomes. America Online, Prodigy,
and CompuServe already are providing such services to American
consumers. Moreover, through the Internet, consumers can get access
to federal health documents and databases.<sup>36</sup>  While the information
revolution is well underway, it is straining the capacity of corporate
structures of delivery and intensifying the internal contradictions
between an information age that is inherently compatible with
personal freedom, consumer choice, and competition and older,
paternalistic systems of health care delivery in which the patient
is on the receiving end of somebody else's decisions. The contradiction
is nicely articulated by Dr. Catherine De Angelis of the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine:  &quot;It's crazy. On the
one hand you're raising expectations and raising the level of
understanding of patients regarding disease process or illness,
and on the other hand corporate medicine is forcing physicians
to just crank out patients. You don't have the time to respond
to patients.&quot;<sup>37</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While managed care may be the latest evolution of &quot;corporate
medicine,&quot; it is managed care that has contributed to the
very information explosion that is taking place in a rapidly changing
private sector. Perhaps the most important contribution of managed
care has been its intense concentration on the actual costs of
providing medical care. In the recent past, insurance reimbursement
for doctors and hospitals often was &quot;usual and customary&quot;
or &quot;cost-plus&quot; reimbursement. In a system without consumer
pressures to control cost, this type of arrangement is a natural
incentive to drive up costs. Moreover, until recently, even with
closer attention to the problems of administration and overhead,
hospitals did not always have the software used by manufacturing
companies in their production process  software that would enable
them, for example, to look at the actual cost of each step in
the process of treating or caring for patients. Given the incentives
of the predominant third-party payment system and the cost-shifting
that is rampant in the health care sector of the economy, hospital
bills that include $10 for an aspirin should not seem shocking.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>An Existing Network.</B> For congressional and federal employees
and retirees, the consumer information infrastructure for the
informed purchase of health insurance plans is already in place.
Beyond the personal experience of shopping for the best value
for money in the FEHBP insurance market, there is a vast network
of public and private information on health insurance plans, including
the level of benefits and the quality of care and medical services.
Approximately one half of all people with health insurance in
the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area are covered by the FEHBP's
35 competing plans.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the Office of Personnel Management publishes a comparative
FEHBP &quot;Guide&quot; to private health insurance plans, that
effort is supplemented by a variety of other information sources,
including advice to employees from federal agency personnel managers;
newspaper articles outlining comparative plan benefits; television,
radio, and newspaper advertisements; federal union and employee
association information campaigns; and even town hall programs,
sponsored by Members of Congress with large numbers of federal
employees and retirees in their districts, outlining the best
offering for the coming year. The National Association of Retired
Federal Employees (NARFE), which describes all FEHBP plans as
&quot;good,&quot; publishes a booklet comparing plans and benefits
for retirees, even describing which plans provide the best treatments
of interest to this age group. Perhaps the most widely quoted
information source is <I>Checkbook's Guide to Health Insurance
Plans for Federal Employees</I>, published by Washington Consumers
Checkbook, which outlines all of the plans in the FEHBP, including
information as to which will be better for certain medical conditions.
Everyone from government couriers and janitors to postal workers
and senators use this information to choose health care plans
yearly. Where only the employers make choices, the cost control
has not been as impressive.<sup>38</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Just as enrollees in FEHBP get solid information on different
insurance plans, employees of the International Paper Company
get solid information on the cost of services and qualifications
of local providers. Relying on consumer choice and promoting the
availability of such information, International Paper experienced
no increase in costs for three years.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>New Consumer Information Technology.</B> With the limited exceptions
of the FEHBP and companies that provide a degree of consumer choice
through flexible spending accounts and medical savings accounts,
there is no broad consumer choice in employer-based insurance.
But the technology for giving consumers even more information
on the price and performance of providers already is well underway.
One innovative approach is the proposed R.E. MEDI system developed
by Dr. Jack Tawil, an economist and President of Research Enterprises
of Richland, Washington, Inc. R.E. MEDI is a software system that
can accumulate and present all of this diverse information on
price and performance in a simple format. Each patient has a computer
disk, protected by an individual password, that contains medical
information and cost data. Access to the main memory bank is effected
by an access code, just as is done with a bank teller card. When
the patient goes to the doctor, the code handles electronic billing
in a quick, efficient manner and records the cost of the visit
in the central system. The central computer system gathers all
of the charges from multiple patients and then produces a comparison
of physician charges. This has enormous potential application
for companies and systems (International Paper, for example) trying
to bring down the cost of health care through consumer choice
and competition among providers. Beyond price information, the
R. E. MEDI system also collects treatment outcomes and provider
qualifications. This gives each patient access to a periodic publication
of price, performance, and qualifications.<sup>39</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Hospital and Physician Information.</B> Largely because of
the economic pressures exerted by new managed care arrangements,
doctors and hospitals need precise cost information. The actual
number of hospitals that have effective, decision-directing cost
analysis is not known. The estimate by companies which produce
such software is around 15 percent.<sup>40</sup>  Those hospitals able to use
such software have dramatically improved their ability to provide
better care at lower costs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach,
California, has lowered patient costs and improved hospital profits
by using a data system called the &quot;Affinity Program.&quot;
 The hospital used the computer to generate information in a clinical
pathway. The steps were to find a process to improve; organize
a team of physicians, nurses, and staff; understand the variations,
such as length of stay; plan the improvement; implement improvement;
check results; and revise. From 1990 to 1994, the hospital lowered
its charge per case of  Coronary Bypass (DRG107) from $55,418
to $42,093 (24 percent) and its charge per case of total hip replacement
(DRG209) from $20,793 to $18,688 (10 percent).<sup>41</sup>  The implications
for the nation are staggering. This is not an isolated case. For
example, in 1993, the average charges for another coronary procedure,
transluminal coronary angioplasty, ranged from $16,770 in Ohio
to $28,110 in Colorado.<sup>42</sup>  Using the &quot;affinity program&quot;
for this procedure, Hoag Memorial has reduced its charges to $12,650
for coronary angioplasty. And the hospital has increased its profit.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beyond price, however, is the sheer explosion in biomedical research
and technology. Biomedical sciences, including anatomy, biochemistry,
microbiology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology, at the
125 medical schools all over the United States are in a period
of tremendous growth. Beyond this academic complex, private biomedical
research and technology firms are making progress on many fronts
 everything from AIDS and Alzheimer's disease to cancer and cardiac
devices. At least 90 percent of the nearly $5 billion spent in
1992 on research and development has come from private-sector
investors. And since it takes seven to ten years, under current
regulatory timelines, most biotech companies must seek successive
rounds of financing. Most of the nation's 1,300 biotech companies
are small start-up businesses with a powerful entrepreneurial
spirit. More than three quarters have fewer than 50 employees,
and most are less than ten years old. More than 50 percent of
their costs are research and development.<sup>43</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, some of the companies fostering new health care breakthroughs
are providing information about the cost impact of their products
in addition to their medical usefulness. American Biogenetic Sciences
Inc. is such a firm. It is conducting clinical trials of a new
test, called the Thrombin Precursor Protein, which could save
billions of dollars.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Cardiovascular diseases rank as America's number one killer. The
cost of cardiovascular disease in 1995 is estimated by the American
Heart Association at $137.7 billion. Much of that money is spent
on the treatment of patients who present themselves to emergency
departments with symptoms of chest pain. All such patients must
be treated as if they are having a heart attack until heart attack
can be ruled out. Approximately eight million Americans present
themselves to emergency departments annually with symptoms of
a heart attack, but only 20 percent actually are having an attack.
This creates many hospital admissions and procedures which could
be prevented if doctors could diagnose accurately at the time
they first see the patient. According to Dr. Paul Gargan, the
firm's research expert, the new test will detect a blood clot
that causes a heart attack immediately after chest pain begins.
Current tests pick up evidence of heart muscle damage at 12 to
24 hours after pain begins. The new test, pending FDA approval,
would make immediate diagnosis possible for the first time.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;American Biogenetic Sciences calculated the amount Medicare patients
could save just by using the new test to screen patients before
admitting them to coronary care units. According to the firm,
the amount saved by using the test in this way alone would be
$130 billion during the next seven years.<sup>44</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, there are new &quot;clot-busters&quot; that actually
may reverse the heart attack process and prevent heart damage
if doctors give them in the first two hours after the onset of
an attack. Since it has been very difficult to tell who is having
a real heart attack, and since these &quot;clot-busters&quot;
have rare but serious side effects (like strokes), doctors have
not been able to use them as much as they would like. With a new
test that accurately makes the diagnosis, doctors should be able
to save many lives and prevent heart damage that leads to chronic
heart problems in many more. This new technology could offer impressive
new methods of prevention and thus reduce the unnecessary long-term
costs and effects of cardiovascular conditions.
<P>
<h2>NEW MODES OF COMPETITION</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Traditional market competitiveness  either between health insurance
plans as in the FEHBP or between doctors and other providers as
at International Paper  lowers costs. For Members of Congress
engaged in reforming Medicare, the private sector has suggested
new models that promote competition.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Total systems of care like HMOs offer a complete range of services.
Theoretically, a complicated patient can receive better care if
all the care is coordinated. In the private sector, there is a
trend toward larger and larger HMOs. The larger companies spend
less on actual care, and large companies are charging about 30
percent above health care costs. That means the same care perhaps
can be given at lower cost to the consumer. Smart providers looking
at these numbers have suggested that provider networks, organizations
run directly by doctors, could give the same or better care at
lower cost by decreasing management costs. The problem has been
that antitrust laws prevent more than 30 percent of doctors in
a community from joining in such a provider network, even on a
non-exclusive basis (they also provide care outside the network).
The HMO could have 100 percent of the doctors in the same community
in its network, however, and be perfectly legal. The American
Medical Association recommends that the Department of Justice
and Federal Trade Commission develop guidelines that allow physician-sponsored
coordinated care organizations to operate on an equal footing
with traditional HMOs. The House bill provides for such physician-sponsored
organizations. Final congressional guidelines should permit greater
numbers of physicians to join in networks and should define financing
structures that recognize physician services as a financial asset.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other provider networks have offered new plan designs that should
give better care to specific groups. One such group is older people
with chronic medical problems. For example, Wesley Woods, an Atlanta,
Georgia, senior citizen care facility, reports that 30 percent
of its residents have mental difficulties. It is very difficult
for them or their families to handle all the paperwork of traditional
Medicare. New systems that would coordinate all needed care with
one capitated payment would make this much easier. The director
of Wesley Woods supplies a case study illustrating the point.
Mrs. B is over 70 years old. She lives in an apartment and is
low income. She has a long history of chronic mental illness,
but that problem is managed when she is on medication. Under the
current Medicare system she does not always receive her medication.
When that happens, she hears voices, accuses neighbors of threatening
behavior, and becomes a police problem. Her behavior problems
lead to eviction, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, and
discharge. This pattern recurs every two years at a current cost
of about $27,000 per cycle. A new provider network would permit
quarterly psychiatric visits and a weekly psychiatric nurse visit,
and would cover her medication at a cost of $4,400 per year. Even
better, Mrs. B could stay in her own home.<sup>45</sup>
<P>
<B>Using Consumer Incentives</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whenever the copayment in fee-for-service plans is increased,
over all costs and utilization decrease.<sup>46</sup>  When a policy increases
the financial consequences of the consumer's decisions, the consumer
uses it more carefully. This principle underlies &quot;defined
contribution&quot; plans like that of the International Paper
Company. This has implications for broader health care reform,
including reform of the Medicare system. If a person wants to
spend more for health care than the company provides, he assumes
the extra cost, utilization of care is decreased, and costs are
controlled.
<P>
<B>Example: <I>Forbes</I> magazine.</B> <I>Forbes</I> magazine
illustrates a more direct effect of using financial incentive
to control costs. With its cost-sharing plan, costs were decreased.
But <I>Forbes</I> did not achieve maximum cost savings until it
initiated a plan whereby employees received bonuses for not filing
insurance claims. Employees may receive a bonus of $1,500 if they
do not file any insurance claims. For claims up to $750, the amount
below $750 is doubled. For example, if an employee files a claim
for $300, the difference would be $450 and the bonus to the employee
would be $900. <I>Forbes</I> also pays the extra taxes on the
bonus for the employee. <I>Forbes</I>, not surprisingly, has lowered
health care costs by 25 percent since initiating this program.<sup>47</sup>
<P>
<B>Encouraging Wellness</B>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Historically, company-based programs focused on preventive medicine,
health care promotion, and wellness have been uncharacteristic
of private employer-based insurance. But this is changing. As
more and more companies seek to control health car costs, they
are relying upon such methods as preventive health care programs
emphasizing diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes.
<P>
<B>Example: Coors Brewing Company.</B> One of many companies encouraging
wellness among its employees, Coors Brewing Company opened a wellness
center in July 1981. James R. Terborg, a professor at the Graduate
School of Medicine at the University of Oregon, conducted a cost
benefit study of this program. He found that for every dollar
invested, the company saved $6.15 and estimated that the program
saved the company at least $1.9 million annually by decreasing
medical costs, reducing sick leave, and increasing productivity.<sup>48</sup>
 One very clear example of this is the cardiac rehabilitation
program. Coors officials provide a free, comprehensive cardiac-rehabilitation
program to employees, spouses, retirees, and dependents recovering
from cardiac illnesses. The program's main object is to return
employees to work in their original jobs as quickly as possible.
To date, 98 percent of employees have completed the program and
returned to work in about 1.3 months. The national average is
70 percent and eight months, respectively. Many of these Coors
employees were able to assume their original jobs, and the program
has saved a total of more than $3.5 million in lost wages and
$2.6 million in actual costs overall. Coors pays $662 per patient
for the cardiac rehabilitation program, but the average external
cost of such a program is $1,700.<sup>49</sup>  In addition, Coors offers special
incentives to employees to develop and maintain healthy behaviors.
For example, nonsmokers pay 50 percent less for supplemental life
insurance than smokers do.
<P>
In January, Coors adopted a flexible benefits package that allows
employees to earn up to $250 in additional benefit dollars, as
well as $250 for spouses, when they make these six wellness pledges:
 to abstain from tobacco; to consume alcohol responsibly; to use
safety equipment, such as seat belts and helmets; to assume responsibility
for their mental health by promising to seek counseling for stressful
situations; to stay physically active; and to have their blood
pressure checked every six months. Employees are on their honor
to keep these pledges, and Coors deducts the benefit dollars they
earn from their insurance premiums.
<P>
<B>Example: Quaker Oats Company.</B> Quaker Oats Company also
has developed a positive incentive wellness program. Employees
who exercise three times a week, use seat belts, use no tobacco,
and promise no drug or alcohol abuse earn $150 annually in flexible
benefit credits. Employees who take and meet the company's Health
Risk Appraisal earn an additional $110 in flexible benefits. The
positive cash incentives and emphasis on wellness have resulted
in a reduction of almost 50 percent in hospital admissions over
ten years.<sup>50</sup>
<P>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Members of Congress can learn a great deal from the experience
of the private sector, particularly the innovations of America's
corporations. While the private sector's employer-based, third-party
payment system is far from an ideal model of a normal market,
it has responded rather quickly, if imperfectly, to cost pressures
and introduced genuine innovations in the financing and delivery
of health care. Using advanced computer systems, making information
more available to employees and promoting wellness, and using
flexible spending accounts and medical savings accounts, corporations
and private businesses have accumulated ample experience in controlling
costs. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If Congress changed the tax treatment of health insurance and
levelled the national playing field, giving equal tax treatment
to employment-based and non-employment-based health options, the
competition would be intense and the private system even more
flexible. Organization and association plans sponsored by fraternal
and religious institutions, unions, and employee organizations
would likely flourish. But a free market with real consumer choice,
intense competition, and access to solid information through America's
emerging network of information superhighways can reduce costs
even more while providing Americans with even higher levels of
quality health care. While the interaction of all these forces
may seem complex, a simple relationship is evident. The closer
a system is to a free market, the lower are the costs of that
system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What applies to the innovative firms in the private sector and
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program applies also to
Medicare:  A market provides the best service at the best price.
It is characterized by choice, information, and competition. Americans
deserve this kind of health care system.

increased. Nevertheless, Mr. Tiller notes that the main problem
of increased costs was the change in employee behavior. He adds

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The health care reform bills that have been approved by both the House and the Senate are being touted as a tiny step toward reform.  Perhaps, but when a giant like the federal government takes even a small step, it can create a thunderous reverberation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Some of the provisions of the legislation may help -- like increasing the deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed to 80 percent by the year 2006.  Others are mixed: the requirement that individuals can purchase health insurance is designed to assure "portability," but state experiences indicate the new mandate likely will destabilize the market for private health insurance policies by driving up costs. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Still others are echoes of a health care reform bill that crashed to defeat less than two years ago.  The House bill and to a lesser extent the Senate bill contain a confusing plethora of new fines, penalties, and jail terms for doctors, with broadened investigative powers for federal agents.  These provisions are designed to stop the leakage of an estimated 10 percent of Medicare dollars that are lost to "waste, fraud and abuse," and to stop overcharges in private plans.  But experience proves that trying to enforce cost containment with laws rather than market dynamics is a no-win game.  In the process, a huge amount of expertise and expense goes toward compliance rather than patient care.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Here are some of the provisions drawn from the two bills that will be on the table when the House-Senate health care conferees go to work to produce a final bill:
<p><ul>
 <li>A new category of crime would be created, called "Federal Health Care Offenses."  Doctors could be sent to jail for 10 years if they misapply any assets used in health care, and they could be sentenced to life in prison if their wrongdoing results in a death.  They would go to jail for five years if they obstruct a health care investigation.
 <p>
 <li>A national health care Fraud and Abuse Control Program would be created to investigate the actions of doctors and other medical providers.  Doctors and health plans could be required to pay stiff civil penalties, forfeit property, and even pay for the investigations against them. In the House bill, the feds would issue special "Fraud Alerts" to warn people about offending doctors and health plans.
 <p>
 <li>Doctors could be fined up to $10,000 for delivering medically improper or unnecessary health care services, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services -- not patients and doctors -- defining what is medically necessary.
 <p>
 <li>A new crime is created for citizens who "knowingly and willfully" dispose of assets to qualify for Medicaid. They could be fined $25,000 or jailed for five years or both.
 <p>
 <li>Under the House bill, doctors also could be fined $5,000 or more if they certify that a patient who doesn't meet requirements is eligible for home health services.  
<p>
 <li>The federal government also would develop new standards for health plans to report financial and administrative information on patients.  The penalty for violating the standards:  up to $25,000 a year.  If the information is wrongfully disclosed: $250,000 and 10 years in jail.
<p>
 <li>The FBI would get involved in inspections, investigations, and prosecutions regarding health care matters with the aid of $47 million in additional funding next year and more each year after.  HHS also would get new money to go after doctors and health plans in the Medicare program -- more than $430 million in 1997, with funding increases each year.  The cost to taxpayers is only the tip of the iceberg; health care costs inevitably will rise as facilities devote even more resources to produce the information to defend themselves.
 <p>
 <li>The bills are very generous with long-term care services:  If a person needs help with any two daily living activities ("eating, toileting, transferring, bathing, dressing, or continence"), he or she would be eligible for payment under long-term care insurance -- which, by the way, receives a special new tax break.  Worse, any licensed health care provider, not just one associated with the insurer, could determine eligibility.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
	Certainly, if there are laws, they must be enforced.  But the requirements would be so confusing that doctors and patients would have trouble knowing the rules. Doctors, nurses, and health plans would be forced to focus even more on whether they are running afoul of a "Federal Health Care Offense" instead of treating their patients. If they slip up, they may find the FBI at their doorstep.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	It is ironic that at a time when the Congress is trying to devolve more power to the states,  it is giving the federal government broad new powers to go after doctors, hospitals, and health plans -- powers that are eerily similar to those granted to the much-despised Internal Revenue Service.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	A system based upon regulation requires tighter and tighter rules to close an ever-growing number of escape hatches.  Ultimately, regulators cannot win. The only way to stop this escalating spiral is to give individual consumers more control over decisions about their health coverage, not to further criminalize the health care system.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The bills do give patient watchdogs new incentives -- such as offering Medicare beneficiaries a payback for reporting erroneous billing.  The conferees are expected to go to work soon and hope to have a final bill on President Clinton's desk before Memorial Day. When they convene, they would be well advised to give cost-conscious consumers -- not a brigade of federal agents -- more control over health care dollars.

<a href="fyi96t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Employment, Wage, and Compensation Growth, Current Expansion Vs. Previous Expansions
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of good economic news in recent months, many Americans are concerned about their economic security, stagnating family incomes, and less money in their paychecks after taxes. They have a sense the economy is performing below its full potential and do not accept President Clinton's claim that the economy is the "healthiest it has been in 30 years."<sup>1</sup> 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A comparison of the current economic expansion and the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months suggests that they are right. The economy is failing to perform as well as similar expansions, and over the past three years the job opportunities and real earnings of many Americans have declined.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the current recovery, for example:
<P><ul>
<li><b>The gross domestic product</b> has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.<sup>2</sup>  Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><b>Total employment</b> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li><b>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs</b> has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li><b>Real median family income</b> actually has declined 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average increase of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
<li><b>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers</b> have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an increase of 3.1 percent during the November 1982 to July 1990 expansion.<sup>4</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, the economy is experiencing modest growth, but other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for many Americans in recent years. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Since September 1993, real average hourly earnings have stagnated and real average weekly earnings have declined 1.5 percent.</b><sup>5</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.</b><sup>6</sup> Over the same period, real hourly compensation (combined wages and benefits) has not increased significantly.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs</b> in the 12 months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
<li><b>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet.</b> In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>9</sup>
<p>

<li><b>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.</b><sup>10</sup>  The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.
<p>
<li><b>From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.</b><sup>11</sup> From March 1991 to March 1995, the first four years of the current expansion, manufacturing employment slowly increased (52,000 total new jobs). Over the past year, however, it declined by 1.8 percent.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. Graded on a curve, the economy gets a "D" for below-average performance when compared with other expansions. It is not quite failing, but it clearly is not performing up to its potential.

<li>State of the Union Address, January 1996.<p>
<li>Since the end of World War II, there have been four periods of economic growth longer than 58 months. These occurred from February 1961 to December 1969, from March 1975 to January 1980, from November 1982 to July 1990, and from March 1991 to the present. The data comparisons made in this section refer to similar points in time during these four expansions. For example, average employment growth from March 1991 to the present (59 months) is compared to the average employment growth from February 1961 to December 1965 (59 months), from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to October 1987.<p>

<a href="fyi110c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Money Available to Pay for Hospital Benefits<br>
<a href="fyi110c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Who Pays for Part B Costs?<br>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The latest annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees underscores the severe financial plight of the program and the urgent need for structural reform. The six trustees, who include three Clinton Administration Cabinet secretaries, make clear that no amount of fine-tuning can stave off disaster. The report indicates that the only way to assure Medicare's ability to deliver adequate health care to most of today's senior citizens, let alone the next generation of elderly Americans, is to overhaul the program now so that it can deliver better care for less money.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Most of the recent media attention given to the report has focused on the trustees' assessment of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund, also known as Part A. The trust fund is like a savings account, where the income is payroll tax revenue and the outlays pay for services. The problem is that for a number of reasons, most significantly the aging of the baby-boom generation, the trust fund is being hit by a financing windshear, already causing outlays to exceed income and exhausting all reserves by 2001. In other words, the fund in 2002 literally would have no money to pay promised benefits. Thereafter, for at least the next 70 years (the limit of the trustees' projections), the cost of continuing services would continue to exceed program income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Absent any reform, Medicare can continue after 2001 only if it drastically cuts services or tries to keep the HI program afloat with tax increases. But the cost of a bailout would be staggering. The report indicates that the cumulative deficit in the trust fund (that is, the extra money needed to maintain services) would be over $400 billion by 2005. In that year alone, outlays would exceed income by over $100 billion, and the red ink would be accelerating annually. So just to continue hospital services until 2005, the bailout cost to the average American household would be about $4,000 in new taxes. As the trustees conclude, with classic understatement, "The HI program remains severely out of balance."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But that is just Part A. Part B of Medicare, which pays for physician and other services, is financed only partly by premiums (which cover about 30 percent of program costs), with the rest financed by general revenues. The level of taxpayer subsidy has nothing to do with the beneficiary's income -- elderly millionaires get the same subsidy as the poor. Under current law, say the trustees, taxpayers will have to cover 84 percent of Part B costs by 2005 and an increasing proportion thereafter. According to the trustees' figures, the cumulative taxpayer subsidy between 1996 and 2005 alone will be $950 billion, or roughly $10,000 in taxes for the average American household. The figures for succeeding decades will be even larger.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taking the two parts of Medicare together, to keep the program afloat just until 2005 without reforms will take about $14,000 per household in taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, this stark picture prompts the trustees to call for "the earliest possible enactment of legislation" only to delay bankruptcy for a few years, not to address the long-term problem. Instead, they call for a national commission to recommend long-term solutions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such a commission would be a serious mistake. Rather than encourage serious public discussion of the tough choices that must be faced, it would allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years. But by then the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Advocates of a commission point to previous examples of supposedly successful commissions in making the case for a Medicare commission. Most often they cite the 1982 Social Security commission and the recent panel on military base closures. But the experience of commissions intended to produce legislation is that they are successful in only two situations: first, when only a relatively small mid-course correction is needed in the funding of a sensitive program to keep it in operation for many years (the Social Security commission), or second, when there is almost unanimous agreement on what needs to be done and the commission merely provides political protection (base closing).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Medicare fits into neither of these categories. The problem is not small and short-term: It is massive and structural. And there is no consensus on what needs to be done. To deal with Medicare, major and controversial decisions will have to be made concerning the nature of the entitlement, the benefits, and the role of the taxpayer. These already have been discussed at length on Capitol Hill. In fact, legislative decisions were taken last year, only to be vetoed by President Clinton. All a commission can do, in effect, is take a year or so to put the options already known into a single binder and deliver them back to Capitol Hill. But Congress and the President will still have to make the tough choices --a commission would not render them any easier. With the program so close to collapse, it would be much wiser for the elected government to begin making those decisions today, preferably with the President as an active partner.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To achieve long-term stability in Medicare, three broad changes are needed to encourage much greater efficiency by giving much more economic control and more sensible incentives to the elderly. The bill Congress enacted last year would have begun this reform, but was vetoed. Specifically, Congress and the White House should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Turn Medicare into a defined contribution program.</b> Medicare currently promises a set of specific benefits, rather than a certain degree of assistance to seniors to purchase the benefits they want. Moving to a defined contribution system would give the elderly much greater choice and an incentive to seek better value for money.
<p>
<li><b> Open up new plan choices for the elderly.</b> In today's Medicare, benefits are designed and priced in Washington and updated only slowly, if at all, after months or years of intense debate and lobbying in Washington. That is why the elderly are still waiting for the kind of routine drug benefits, or service options, that are available in almost any standard private plan -- or to retired federal workers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Thus, allowing seniors the right to choose from a wide range of plans and benefit packages is needed to modernize coverage. It also is needed to spur competition between plans to provide the best value for money for seniors.
<P>
<li><b> Reduce the Part B subsidy for those who do not need it.</b> Part B is not a social insurance program. It is a heavily subsidized, optional, government-run physician insurance program. Rich elderly Americans receive the same subsidy as seniors who rely entirely on their Social Security checks. It is time for Congress to rein in the unwarranted taxpayer-funded subsidy for those who do not need it to afford health care.
</ul> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Medicare trustees' report is grim reading. It refutes utterly the nave idea that only a little fine-tuning is needed for the program to exist for the next generation of elderly Americans. The report makes clear that there are only three choices available: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms to enable the program to deliver health care at less cost. Obviously, only the third choice makes any sense. The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be.

BADEN</P><P>           DEFENDERS of Wildlife is a national environmental group devoted to the protection of wildlife and the restoration of habitat. For years, Defenders strongly advocated the regulatory approach to species protection. But they now realize the limitations of regulations, particularly when dealing with private landowners. This October, they published a collection of essays titled &quot;Building Economic Incentives into the Endangered Species Act.&quot; The collection features incentive-based approaches to species preservation.</P><P>       Dayton Hyde has also learned the importance of incentives - negative incentives. Hyde is a rancher, conservation writer, and the founder of Operation Stronghold, a private wildlife-conservation group. He created a lake and new wildlife habitat on his ranch, attracting a variety of species including bald eagles. For his efforts, state and federal agencies increasingly regulated his operation.</P><P>     For a time, the Forest Service actually restricted him from entering his property by truck, claiming he might disturb the eagles.</P><P>     Dayton Hyde's experience is all too common. Under the current Endangered Species Act, as well as other laws, landowners frequently improve or protect habitat, then face land-use restrictions imposed by government agencies (commonly the EPA or Fish and Wildlife Service). These restrictions often have perverse ecological and ethical consequences.</P><P>     First, they often impede efforts to protect threatened species and critical habitats. Second, they constitute uncompensated &quot;takings,&quot; a form of political plunder.</P><P>     The Endangered Species Act has failed to encourage species and habitat protection because it employs the wrong kind of incentives. Landowners with threatened species on their property may face restrictions that diminish the value of the property and reduce their income from ranching, farming and similar activities. The Act's negative incentives do not enlist the talents and resources of private landowners. Instead, they often discourage cooperation and innovation.</P><P>     The Fifth Amendment was designed to protect citizens from government takings. Its framers understood the harm caused by negative incentives. But today their wisdom is ignored. Landowners know that designated species are likely to impose significant financial costs and restrict their use of the land. Anticipating restrictions, they may accelerate the destruction of habitat.</P><P>     Norman Hutson Jr., of Fort Lewis, Wash., reluctantly clear-cut his tree farm in anticipation of restrictions to protect the spotted owl. Other landowners may covertly disobey regulations or eliminate species and habitat to preclude losses.</P><P>     In the United States, 50 percent of endangered species dwell almost exclusively on private lands. Given the Endangered Species Act's dismal record on private lands, a new approach is needed. With the Act facing renewal in 1994, there is a tremendous opportunity to erect positive incentives with the creation of Biodiversity Trust Funds.</P><P>     The trust funds would purchase conservation easements, much as the North American Elk Foundation, Trout Unlimited, and Ducks Unlimited have done. The trust funds would pay landowners to pursue conservation on their property and could copy Defenders of Wildlife's policy of paying landowners a bounty when an endangered species breeds on their land. Another possibility, noted by Vice President Jim Kraft of Plum Creek Timber and professor Bruce Lippke of the University of Washington, is to use long-term federal bonds to accelerate purchase and retirement of critical habitats.</P><P>     The forces that control land use are largely economic. With this in mind, trust funds have a significant advantage over the current reliance on legal penalties. By buying land and easements or paying bounties, trust funds create positive financial rewards for saving species and habitats. At the very least, landowners who already favor environmental improvements on their land (and many do) are no longer punished for their efforts. The Dayton Hyde dilemma is avoided.  Landowners who are good stewards are rewarded or compensated for creating wetlands, preserving old-growth trees, or encouraging wolves to breed on their lands.</P><P>     In the environmental area as elsewhere, rewards work much better than penalties. They foster innovation and entrepreneurship in environmental protection. With rewards, ranchers might reserve some lands from grazing to improve wildlife habitat, then charge recreationalists and hunters user fees. Commercial forest owners could lengthen rotation times of harvest and selectively log their older trees. Whatever specific approach is taken, owners would have financial incentives to nurture environmental health. Rewards also make compliance and progress easy to monitor because landowners advertise their environmental improvements.</P><P>     Penalties, like fines or imprisonment, are often less effective. They make monitoring difficult because they encourage landowners to covertly evade the law, accelerating logging or eliminating species before costly regulations are enacted or enforced. Penalties also encourage some landowners to abandon commercial or recreational projects, even if these projects could have been undertaken in environmentally sound ways. Private caution becomes society's loss.</P><P>     Incentives are a major factor in shaping individual behavior. Reform of the Endangered Species Act offers an important opportunity to encourage species and habitat protection, not discourage it. By linking personal gain with environmental health and by using cooperation rather than fines, imprisonment, and &quot;takings,&quot; a reformed Environmental Species Act can harmonize ecology, individual creativity and initiative, and prosperity.</P><P>_______________</P><P> John A.

<title>Renewing American Civilization: Class Ten -- PFF</title>
Renewing American Civilization: Class Ten

Citizenship And Community In 21st Century America<br>
<br>
Reinhardt College<br>
<br>
March 11, 1995<br>
<p>


The following is a special program produced by RCTV, Reinhardt College
television, in Waleska, Georgia.  From Reinhardt College in Waleska,
Georgia, this is "Renewing American civilization." In this, the final of 10
class presentations, congressman Newt Gingrich, an adjunct professor at
Reinhardt College, will continue his course, which presents the
foundational principles necessary to the renewal of American civilization.
This week's lesson, Citizenship in America, focuses on civic leadership,
communities, and the voluntary community sector as a third part of the
American public-private society.
<br><br>
Welcome to Reinhardt College for the last session.  I want to welcome the
students of Mind Extension University all over America.  And I understand,
also, parts of Canada and Mexico.  I want to remind everyone that they can
mail their comments to: renewing American civilization, post office box
6008, Marietta, Georgia 30065.  Or they can fax their comments to
404-528-9806.  Or they can e-mail their comments to America online,
renewam@aol. com.  Or they can get class transcripts and other class
materials on the Internet web page http://www. pff. org.  Or if they just
want to go to the standard technology of the last 25 years, they can order
"American Civilization" newspaper, video and audio tapes, and course
readings by calling 1-800-to-renew.
<P>
I also want to let everyone know that Mind Extension University will
rebroadcast starting Saturday, march 18th, 9:30 am.  To 11:30 am.  Eastern
time, so people around the country who want to take the course can pick it
up on Mind Extension University for free.  And, of course, we give
permission to videotape it and keep it and share with your friends and
neighbors.
<P>
And an interesting -- a very interesting development.  Michael Ciamarra and
Marty Connors are -- new area code 334-242-7116, they are offering the
course in Alabama at the state capitol, with Governor Fob James as the host
and sponsor, and that will be starting in, I think, late March, early
April.  Anybody who's interested in that can call them at that number,
334-242-7116, and they're bringing together quite a team to help teach the
course in Alabama as an experiment where the governor of the state is
encouraging state senior executives and others to take the course.
<P>
I also want to make a point that this course has been offered here at
Reinhardt College.  Reinhardt College is a tremendous liberal arts college
with a long tradition of giving students an unusual background, unusual
opportunities.  And anybody who is interested in Reinhardt College as an
excellent liberal arts college can either write the college admissions in
Waleska, Georgia, or can call 404-720-5526.  But it's a very, very
interesting blend of the very traditional and the very modern.  And they
have in their broadcast studio I think as fine a facility as anything we've
seen, so it's very, very impressive.
<P>
Now, let me just say -- remind everyone that the five pillars of American
civilization are, first, the Historic Lessons Of American Civilization.
Second, Personal Strength.  Third, Entrepreneurial Free Enterprise.
Fourth, the Spirit of Invention and Discovery.  And, Fifth, Quality as
Defined by Deming.  And that these are the five core things.  We spent two
hours on each one looking at how they apply to America.  And then we have
been applying them to four areas to look at how the pillars apply.  And
that the four areas we've been applying them to are, first, the third wave
and American civilization.  Second, creating American jobs in the world
market.  Third, replacing the culture of violence and poverty with a
culture of productivity and safety.  And, fourth, citizenship and community
in the 21st century.
<P>
And, of course, this is the fourth of these areas and the last class.  And
today's class is going to be on citizenship and community in the 21st
century.  And I think this is, in a sense, the capstone class.  Because
community and citizenship, I believe, are the keystones to the entire
course.  Without commitment to community and citizenship, nothing works.
<P>
And I think one of the things that Dr.  Kathleen Minnix and I have
concluded is that we have to drive very hard at the cultural framework and
at getting across the idea, these are not things your government can
necessarily pass a law about.  They're a part of your culture.  They're
part of the background framework.  They're the way you wake up and how you
think about things in the morning.  They're not what the IRS does to you or
what the FBI does to you.
<P>
Now, this entire two hours is going to emphasize a level of activism people
are not used to.  And part of our core discussion is going to be that you
can't solve our problems within the framework of a government-dominated,
bureaucratically delivered system.  That in a free society, you have to
rely on the culture, on individuals, on values in a way that is different
than, what does the government do?  And a lot of people will say, "well,
gee I'm too busy," or, "I really can't afford it."
<P>
And I want to take you back to something we used very early in the course
which we thought was so powerful emotionally, and we frankly liked so much,
we want to use it again.  And I want you all the way through, this -- we're
going to show you once again Chamberlain talking to the main mutineers.
<P>
Remember, it's on the way to Gettysburg.  The regiment had mutinied because
they thought they had signed up for two years, and the government had now
decided it was for three years, and so they were -- they thought they were
legitimately standing on their rights, that they could not be coerced into
serving.  They'd volunteered, they'd fought for two years, but they didn't
want to be coerced into serving.
<P>
And so the army on the edge of Gettysburg has said to Chamberlain, who is
himself from Maine, that these folks are now in your charge.  Do with them
whatever you want to.  And the officer who comes by says, "you can shoot
them if you want to because they're mutinied, they're refusing to keep
doing things." I want you just to remember what we're going to talk about
for the next two hours is to ask a few hours of time, to ask a little bit
of commitment.
<P>
And as you listen to what Chamberlain is talking about and you think about
what he was asking them to do as citizenship, I just want you to put in
context the person who says, "well, I'm really too busy.  "I really don't
have the time." Or, "that would really be awkward," and consider how tiny
the request we're making for people to be citizens compared to what
Chamberlain had to ask.  So let's take a minute or two and let's look at
Chamberlain just before Gettysburg.
<PRE>
>>I've been talking with Private Bucklin.  He's told me about your problem.
>>There's nothing I can do today.  We're moving out in a few minutes.
>>We'll be moving all day.  I've been ordered to take you men with me.  I'm
>>told that -- that if you don't come, I can shoot you.  Well, you know I
>>won't do that.  Maybe somebody else will, but I won't, so that here's the
>>situation.  The whole Reb army is up that road a ways waiting for us, so
>>this is no time for an argument like this, I tell you.  We could surely
>>use you fellows.  We're now well below half strength.  Whether you fight
>>or not, that's -- that's up to you.  Whether you come along is -- is,
>>well, you're coming.
</pre>
You know who we are, that we're doing here, but if you're going to fight
along side us, there's a few things I want you to know.  This regiment was
formed last summer, in Maine.  There were 1,000 of us then.  There are less
than 300 of us now.  All of us volunteered to fight for the union, just as
you did.  Some came mainly because we were bored at home, thought this
looked like it might be fun.  Some came because we were ashamed not to.
Many of us came because it was the right thing to do.  All of us have seen
men die.
<P>
This is a different kind of army.  If you look back through history, you
will see men fighting for pay, for women, for some other kind of loot.
They fight for land, power, because a king leads them, or just because they
like killing.  But we are here for something new.  This has not happened
much in the history of the world.  We are an army out to set other men
free.  America should be free ground, all of it.  Not divided by a line
between slave states and free.  All the way from here to the pacific ocean.
No man has to bow, no man born to royalty.  Here we judge you by what you
do, not by who your father was.  Here you can be something.  Here is the
place to build a home.  But it's not the land.  There's always more land.
It's the idea that we all have value, you and me.  What we're fighting for
in the end, we're fighting for each other.
<P>
Sorry.  I didn't mean to preach.  You go ahead, you talk for a while.  If
you -- if you choose to join us, you want your muskets back, you can have
them.  Nothing more will be said by anybody anywhere.  If you choose not to
join us, well, you can come along under guard, and when this is all over, I
will do what I can to see you get a fair treatment, but for now, we're
moving out.  Gentlemen, I think if we lose this fight, we lose the war.  So
if you choose to join us, I'll be personally very grateful.
<PRE>
>>Now, we used that to try to drive home the point that, you know, it's not
>>just enough to say, "we want to honor our veterans," or, "we sure are
>>proud that they're willing to die for freedom." But the question is, in a
>>sense, from Valley Forge through the war between the states, to San Juan
>>hill, to the troops at Chateau-Thierry in World War I, to Guadal Canal at
>>Normandy all the way up, what are you prepared to do to now to live out
>>what they sacrificed for?
</Pre>
And so in a context, in a sense -- and I think this is ultimately a moral
argument.  You cannot have a free society which lacks courage.  And the
courage isn't just, well, if it was a real battle and I was there and I had
to stand, you know, of course I'd get up and fight.  Nonsense.  The
question is, are you prepared to spend some time every month, some time
every day or every week, are you willing to be a citizen in peacetime to
actually use the freedom that your parents or grandparents bought for you
in wartime? And we want to drive this home.
<P>
I should also say I want to correct something.  The last time we used this,
I misspoke myself.  Chamberlain was not at the -- did not meet with Lee.
Grant and Lee met alone in a private home in the county seat of Appomattox.
However, two days later, when the Confederate army -- the army of Northern
Virginia surrendered, quote, the road leading into town was lined by
federal soldiers under the command of Brigadier General Joshua
Chamberlain."
<P>
Chamberlain had been picked for this duty.  He had won the medal of honor,
he'd been severely wounded, they thought he would die.  He had consistently
been courageous.  And at, "the impressive sight of the approaching
soldiers, Chamberlain was so moved that he recorded, quote, I thought it
imminently fitting to show some token of our feeling.  And he instructed
his officers to bring their troops to the position of the marching salute
as each body of the confederates passed.  When General Gordon rode opposite
him, Chamberlain had the bugle blown to bring the line to attention
preparatory to executing the marching salute movement successfully by
regiment."
<P>
And so you had Chamberlain, who is an American, sees himself as an
American, who understands the tragedy of the Civil War, which is that it's
between Americans, consciously, much as grant had two days earlier trying
to communicate this sense of mutual respect, of rebonding the country.
<P>
And Chamberlain's quite a remarkable person.  He goes back to Maine,
becomes governor, becomes President of Bowdon college, and dies, I think,
at 84 still suffering from the wound which had never quite healed from the
war.  But I'm not asking anybody to be Chamberlain.  I mean, very -- you
get one or two Chamberlains in a generation.  What I am suggesting is that
we have to bring into peacetime civilian life a sense of responsibility for
our society.
<P>
Now, because we're going to talk about our society, we're going to try out
something some of you may have seen before.  This is an old consultant's
gimmick.  This is the nine dot problem, called because there are nine dots.
With me so far? I don't want to get too far ahead of you.  I think we can
-- can we put the nine dots up as Chyron there? Okay, here we go.  You're
going to see the nine dot problem on TV.  See, somebody else did these
because they wanted them to be square, and when I do the nine dots, they
don't necessarily come out square.
<P>
Okay, now, what I want all of you to do is draw nine dots, three rows of
three.  Very important psychological gimmick.  And I want you -- making
sure they're all lined up just like they were in the Chyron.  I want you
now draw four lines, and the pencil can't come up, though, because you can
cover them in three lines.  You're going to cover all nine dots in four
lines.  And you can cross the lines if you want to, but they've got to be
straight lines.  All of you, you look frozen.  It's okay.  If it doesn't
work the first time, do another set of nine dots.  I mean, the trick is to
try it.
<Pre>
>>Can you solve it? At the rate you're going, I'm not sure you're-- who
>>knows how to do it? That's because you two took the course.  Tell us how
>>you do it.

>>you go outside the lines.

>>you've got to go outside the lines.

>>go outside what?

>>got to go outside the --

>>all of you listen very carefully.  You have to go outside --

>>you have to work outside the structure that you've created.

>>It's not a line.  What happens is people psychologically create a box.
>>There are no -- there's no box.  The people -- you can go back -- this is
>>really a very powerful -- it's from a book by Watslovic, et al., Called
>>"Change Problem Perception/Problem Resolution."  It's a brilliant opening
>>up to your own mind.  This is why we have trouble talking about balancing
>>the budget or we have trouble talking about replacing the culture of
>>poverty or we have trouble dealing with all sorts of questions, is that
>>people start out, they mentally impose the boundary.
</pre>
The solution is actually, you have to go outside twice, but there is no
outside.  See, watch, they're going to show it right there.  This is one of
Bob Head's fancy Chyrons.  Now, notice how what you create here is two
elbows that are totally legitimate given the definition of the problem, but
that you have psychologically --
<P><PrE>
>>I know.  They said, also a map to the alien's home from that.

>>got to go outside the lines.

>>To understand, so that people who are not in this room can understand
>>this, one of the cameras, pick up his shirt.  Pick up his shirt for a
>>second.  Come on.  Stand there and get him on camera.  The guys here have
>>made t-shirts of the newspaper story about me meeting with an alien, and
>>so that's why they're off - this is alien week at Reinhardt College.  But
>>if I can bring you back to this more normal thing here, okay.

>>yeah, right.

>>This last week is getting a little punchy, I can tell.  What people do is
>>people artificially create a framework.  Now -- and I'll tell you, it
>>took me two years of teaching this class to figure this out.  And one of
>>the break points was, I knew we were doing this last section wrong.  And
>>I couldn't get out of it.  I mean, I kept coming in, it was too
>>political, political in the sense of talking about politics, talking
>>about government, talking about citizenship written narrowly.
</Pre>
And then three things -actually, three things happened.  One was I went and
talked to an Amway group of about 15,000 people, and when we left, my wife
Marianne said to me, "that speech was wrong."  She said, "you reduced their
citizenship to voting."  She said, "these folks are citizens when they work
all day.  "they're citizens when they take care of their children.
"they're citizens when they're involved in Boy Scouts."  She said, "they're
putting in hours of citizenship every week, and you didn't talk to them
about what they were doing right."  And a light went on in my head, and I
said, I think I'm beginning to understand how I'd gotten trapped inside my
own nine dots here, because I didn't have a good enough definition.
<P>
The second thing, which I'll show you in a second, is that Gordon Woods
developed -- helped me understand the model that the Founding Fathers used
and that Jefferson, in particular, used for thinking about America.
<P>
And the third thing that happened was I read Olasky's book on "the tragedy
of American compassion," and Olasky says that in the 19th century, there
was so much volunteerism that there was one volunteer for every two poor
people.
<P>
Now, you think about the scale of involvement, the number of people who
thought, I better put in part of Saturday -- remember, these folks did not
have an easier life than we do.  They did not work shorter hours.  They
didn't have more labor-saving devices at home.  They didn't have fewer
malls to go to.  And, you know, I mean, these people put in very long hours
in a fairly hard life and still found time to be volunteers and citizens,
because they thought it was how they defined being an American.
<P>
And so I began to realize that we have been trying to solve some problems
by being trapped inside the dots in a way that doesn't work.  And that
you've got to have the moral courage to break out and rethink it.
<P>
Now, what compounded that, frankly, was sitting down and having dinner one
night with Dr.  Gordon woods, who's written two brilliant works.  One, "the
Origins of the American Revolution."  And the other on "the Radicalism of
the American Revolution."  And as we talked, he was trying to explain to me
why Jefferson so passionately believed in limited government.  That it
wasn't that he was just anti-government, it was that he was pro-freedom.
<P>
And as we talked about it, it seemed to me you could represent it in a box
that had four quadrants.  That the first and most important one was culture
and society.  That is, when you get up in the morning, who are you?  What
expectations do you have of yourself?  What expectations do you have of
others?  Do you expect to get up and go to work?  Do you expect to obey the
law?  Do you expect to participate fully in your community?  What -- and
what do you teach your children and your neighbors and your friends?  How
do you begin every day all day?  What are you modeling as a way to behave?
<P>

The second was civic responsibility.  That you had to have a sense of your
church or your synagogue, your volunteer association, your involvement in
your community, your help in creating new opportunities, new
philanthropies.  You know, if you don't have a public library, voluntarily
getting together to create one.  Benjamin Franklin is sort of the greatest
of the founding fathers at this, because he found -- he creates the
American philosophical association, the first fire department, the first, I
think, fire insurance company, the first public library in north America.
Helps found the post office.  And it goes through a whole range of these
things where he just -- whenever he'd see a need, he'd get a group
together.  And so he left behind him in Philadelphia this trail of things
where people got together because of Franklin and did something good.
<P>
And again, you see it, for example, in American volunteer fire departments,
which are a huge network of people who get together to do good things.
<P>
The third box is free markets and the pursuit of happiness.  Remember that
Jefferson almost wrote "the Pursuit of Property," and that the Founding
Fathers had -- in the Declaration of Independence, that the Founding
Fathers had a very deep belief that you had to be able to own property, you
had to be able to pursue better economic future.
<P>
And, now, it's within this framework that you get limited effective
government.  This is not weak government.  People misinterpreted Jefferson.
He is, after all, a man who bought half a continent in the Louisiana
purchase, sent Lewis and Clark across the continent on a scientific
expedition, and sent the marines to Tripoli.  But the point is, when governm
ent gets bigger, it crowds out the other three.  When government takes over
the job of acculturating, so we say, "well, I'm not really going to teach
my children anything.  "that's the teacher's job.  "I pay taxes.  "let a
bureaucrat do it."  When government starts trying to create jobs, which
it's inherently bad at, when government starts to take over what
historically -- and this is Olasky's whole point about welfare.  That
government, when it becomes unlimited, becomes ineffective, and in the
process, it crowds out the free society.
<P>
So what today's session is about is, how do we reestablish, in particular,
the core values of our culture and society, and then how do we reassert for
every American civic responsibility?  And we wanted to start with
Chamberlain to just say, you know, how can you with any sense of moral good
faith tell us you're too busy?  It's too hard?  It's too much?  If you're
going to be free, you have to be willing to bear some of the responsibility
of freedom.
<P>
Now, we're also not going to talk about government.  We're talking about
community, which is a much broader idea.  Community is the broad system
within which we live, which nourishes us and upon which we depend.  So
we're really concerned about the entire community.
<P>
And if you'll notice, by the way, the very language of the constitution is
a community language.  The preamble to the Constitution says, "we the
people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union,
establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common
defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty
to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution
for the United States of America."  But notice the broad goals, the broad
interest.  The Founding Fathers did not intend, therefore, to automatically
do all that through a bureaucracy.  But they wanted a government which
reinforced the general direction of society.
<P>
Another way to look at it is that citizenship is the duties, obligations,
rights, and responsibilities necessary to maintain community.  Not
necessary to maintain government.  Notice the difference.  This is not
about paying taxes.  It's about doing what you need.  And I would suggest
to you that people have struggled with the concepts of community and
citizenship for all of recorded time.
<P>
If you go back and look at Hammurabi the Lawgiver or at Moses, if you read
Leviticus and the 10 commandments in that whole process as the rise of an
effort to come to grips with an urban community.  If you look at Confucius'
work in China around 400 BC. , The rise of Athenian democracy with
Aristotle and Plato and the effort to figure out, how do people live
together?  The Roman Republic and the effort to create an orderly world for
the entire Mediterranean.
<P>
And then if you come to the capitol, you can see a reproduction of the
Magna Carta written in 1215 in which the English barons say to King John
that if you will concede that you can only get money from us with our
consent -- this was a very small group, now.  This was not average people,
this was not even knights.  This was only the great barons.  But they wrote
what was called the Magna Carta, or great charter, and it's the beginning
of the change.  It's a process by which you begin to have the government
recognizing that the consent of the governed matters.  And that taxes have
to be given because people are willing to be taxed, as opposed to the
divine right of kings.
<P>
The English Civil War, which was a terrible period in British history in
the mid 16th century -- 17th century in which you begin again to wrestle
with this, what's the power of the king?  What's the power of the House of
Commons?  How do people defend their rights?  And many of our laws, much of
our constitution, defending you, for example, against being tortured -you
can't be forced to testify against yourself -- comes directly out of the
English Civil War, and in the sense of the king using what was called a
star chamber, where you could be taken in and held without Habeas Corpus
and tortured to force you to confess.
<P>
And so a lot of the lessons of that period get embedded in the American
system.  And then, of course, the American revolution and the Founding
Fathers and the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution become our codification of the lessons of freedom.
<P>
And you have to -- again, I want to come back to the notion that America is
a unique civilization, and that part of our uniqueness is the radical
statement of where our power comes from.  Because, remember, you start with
the divine right of kings.  Then the barons sort of fight and say, "you've
got to give us power."  Then you have the English self war, and there's a
tension between commoners and king.  But the American system breaks loose
and goes to something very different.  The American system says, "we hold
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they
are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
<P>
So the assertion is made at the beginning of the American political
experience that power comes from God to you, and then you loan power to the
government.  Which is why you go back to the constitution, we the people
decide to form the government.  This was not, God gives the king the power,
the king then tells you what to do.  This is, God gave you the power, you
then decided to loan it back to form a common government.  It's the most
radical statement of human rights, I think, ever written in terms of where
power comes from.
<P>
Now, the challenge, however, and what we have not been teaching, I think,
since the mid 1960s, is that freedom requires personal strength.  You have
to have integrity, courage, hard work, perseverance, discipline, respect
for yourself and for others, and responsibility.  And here you get into one
of those great test questions about how the world works.
<P>
If you try to design a government which does not have those values, and I
want -- see if they can put that back up just for one second real quick,
John.  Because I want everybody who's watching this on tape and television
to also get a sense of this.  What we've tried to do is we've tried for the
last 30 years to design a government for people who don't have courage,
won't work hard, lack perseverance, have no discipline, have no self-
respect, and are not willing to be responsible.
<P>
So we say, how can we define a welfare state for an irresponsible victim
without any hope of a better future?  And surely you can't actually
challenge them to have self-respect and discipline.  The whole core of this
entire course is, that's hopeless.  You cannot have a free society in which
you have no integrity, no courage, you don't have a work ethic, you're not
willing to persevere, you have no discipline, and you lack respect for
yourself and for others and you're not willing to be responsible for your
actions.
<P>
It is impossible.  You can't build the formula.  And this is at the core of
everything we've tried to say for 20 hours here.  That if you start over
and you say, okay, I'm going to stipulate that's what America has to be
like, now how do I design a government that works, then you can get there.
<P>

And when I talk about big words like "transformation," this is an example.
Designing a government for victims who are irresponsible and unable to take
care of themselves is so different from designing government for people
with self-respect, hard work, and perseverance, that they're two different
worlds and they're not compatible.
<P>
Now, let me give you, again, an example of somebody who personified this
commitment and who understood this, and let's look for a second at
citizenship as defined by Max Cleland, the secretary of state of Georgia.
<PRE>
>>but ultimately, you've got to have a passion for it.  You've got to
>>really believe that this system is yours, that it's truly yours.  That
>>seems to be the toughest thing to sell.  That's what makes people so
>>cynical today, is they really don't believe that.  They think, likeJack
>>Parr said, the comedian, he said, "I don't vote."  He said, "it only
>>encourages them."  The Greek word for "citizen" is "politicos."  And the
>>word "apathy" comes from the Greek word meaning "idiot."  So the Greeks
>>felt that if you didn't participate, you were an idiot.  And that if you
>>did participate, you had a high standard, you were a politicos, you were
>>a citizen.  And that was to be respected.  I think that's what we're
>>after.
</pre>
The Founding Fathers really felt that democracy itself was inherently fully
demanding of participation.  The story goes that Ben Franklin was rushed
after the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, and they said, "Mr.. .
Franklin, what kind of government do we have? " And he said, "you have a
republic, if you can keep it."  Democracy is built on the little person.
God knows it's not built on corporate and labor interests and special
interests and lobbyists.  We have all of those players, but that's not what
gives me hope.  What gives me hope is that individual citizen who has
nothing to gain and still finds his or her way to the polls and makes the
-- and takes their best shot.  Wow! You lose that, and you've lost a
country.
<P><pre>
>>Now, I think we came in, frankly, pretty good danger of losing that.  And
>>again, we want to emphasize this notion that when you come back over here
>>to culture and society, it starts here.  Do you teach your children to be
>>responsible?  Do you teach them to work hard?  Do you teach them to tell
>>the truth?  This is why Washington and the cherry tree wasn't -- whether
>>it was factually true or not, it was morally true.  It was useful to say
>>to young kids, "don't lie."  And compare that to a lot of the situation
>>ethics nonsense that goes -- that passes for wisdom today.
</pre>
Similarly, here, is it your expectation that as you get more successful,
that means you can leave for the lake on the weekend and skip all your
civic responsibilities, and as long as you're selfishly fine, you're okay?
Or does that mean we need to build a little sense of guilt in that says,
hey, what have you done for your country lately?  What have you done for
your neighbors?  If God's been good to you, what are you doing to help
somebody who's had a tougher time?  These two things are at the core of
this.
<P>
When we talk about citizenship, we get to hear a fourth.  You design this
after you've designed the first three.  In that framework, citizenship and
community are far broader than government and politics.  And we've got to
start with the notion of looking at how broad it is.  You know, if you
think about it, community life, working, raising a family, participating in
religious activities, volunteerism, these are at the core of what de
Tocqueville described as America, and these are at the core of what we have
to be willing to reassert is at the essence of this country.
<P>
So I'm more interested in, how much time are you willing to put in to
rejuvenating America, not how much can I raise your taxes to rejuvenate
America.  Because I don't think hiring another bureaucrat to replace a free
citizen gets the job done.  Just as in education, if we don't convince the
parents to care for their children and we don't convince the parents to
carry that their kids learn, it's very hard to substitute for that kind of
psychological commitment, which leads to, I think, some key questions, are
you a citizen?  What do you do?  How do you live out your citizenship?
What is your community?  And how do you help renew it?
<P>
And, of course, one of the points I made last week is our community
ultimately should be every citizen in this country.  Every child is an
American child.  Every neighborhood is an American neighborhood.  And so we
have to somehow draw people together.
<P>
Now, Woodrow Wilson described this in a way that I thought was just
tremendous, and talked about the notion of the refugees who come to America
having an obligation to live out their new Americanism, and he talked about
the idea that people who came to America were seeking freedom.  And that in
that process of seeking freedom, they had an opportunity to continue to
expand.  So he actually said, in a way, your love of freedom as an
immigrant increases our love of freedom, because sometimes we've inherited
it and we lose some of the spirit of freedom.
<P>
Similarly, in "American Civilization," in the newspaper this month on the
front page, they have a quote from F.  Scott Fitzgerald which is just
interesting.  Fitzgerald, who's often a cynic, said the following and wrote
the following in his diaries.  He said, "America is a willingness of the
heart."  I want you to just think psychologically about that concept.  That
it's -- that America is about a heart.  It's about a sense that's romantic.
In fact, I would argue that citizenship and community are the historic
lessons of American Civilization.  That you can't understand what America's
like unless you look at the wagon train, you look at the pilgrims coming
over together in a ship, you look at the barn-raising.
<P>
If you saw the movie "Witness," a wonderful scene of the Amish raising the
barn, and realized that was a standard 17th, 18th, 19th century scene in
America.  That in many ways, America's more about the Boy Scouts, the Girl
Scouts, Big Brother/Big Sister.  It's about people working together more
than about the lone individual living in an isolated kind of environment.
<P>
Ultimately, the essence of community is spiritual, and the essence of
citizenship is moral.  And I think because for a long period of time we
went through sort of a secular fetish where people didn't want to delve in
and explore this, it's been very hard to communicate.
<P>
I think I mentioned in here one time that I was reading Gary wills'
description of George Washington in his book on inventing America, which is
his study of the Declaration of Independence, and he says that modern
academics find it very hard to understand Washington because he was a
spiritual, psychological force, because it was his character that shaped
everything.  It wasn't his writings, it wasn't his rationality.  It was the
fact that he was Washington.
<P>
And I realized all of a sudden there was a profound insight into all of
modern academics, that as it drives out the romantic, as it drives out the
poetry that makes America so remarkable, as it shrink -- as it tries
desperately to shrink the Founding Fathers, and in Flexner's new edition of
his one- volume biography of Washington, he has an almost bitter section
where he talks about the way in which in the modern era, there's an effort
to reduce Washington to wooden teeth and a stiff personality, and that it's
a -- in Flexner's mind, it's an assault on the concept of America, because,
in fact, Washington was a very powerful central organizing figure for 200
years.
<P>
People said, "what is the spirit of freedom? " It's Washington giving up
the army to go back to Valley Forge -- I mean, to go back to Mt.  Vernon.
It's Washington saying his farewell address, when he could have won a third
term.  It's Washington literally dedicating his life to the cause of
freedom.  Spending seven years away from home fighting the war.
<P>
And that people used to know that and they used to teach it from first
grade on, and there was a sense of, this is what it takes to be free.
<P>
And, of course, none of us are going to be Washington.  But every child can
try to be honest.  Every child can try to have courage.  Every child can
learn perseverance.  Every child can learn the work ethic.
<P>
And so you have this sense of, how do you rebuild and reestablish the
spiritual and moral framework?  In fact, if you'll look at two recent
books, "the Demoralization of Society" by Getrude Himmelfarb, and "Building
a Community of Citizens" by Don Eberly, which as you know, we use here in
the course, both of them begin to make this point that our core problem is
not government.  Our core problem -- so it's not down here in this box
four.  Our core problem is culture and society.  That until we're prepared
to have leadership that hammers away at the need to rebuild the spiritual
and moral fabric of citizenship, we can't solve it over here with
government.
<P>
Bureaucracy cannot replace culture as a way of organizing a society.  And,
in fact, I would argue that the opposite is true.  That the genius of
America lies in liberating each citizen to seek community and to define
citizenship in the broadest possible way.  So take church, synagogue, Boy
Scouts, Girl Scouts, Rotary, Kiwanis, business and professional women, the
Audubon society, the Friends of Zoo Atlanta, the Appalachian Trail Club,
the Atlanta Lawn Tennis, the Hash House Harriers, they're all ways of
organizing.  Anybody here know anything about the Hash House Harriers?
<PRE>
>>no.

>>some of you have taken the class.  Do you belong?

>>no.  I've read about it.  I'm not up to that kind of running.

>>My younger daughter and her husband have run marathons, and there's a
>>group founded in the 1920s in Malaya by British soldiers who would go out
>>on Fridays, and they'd carry a bag of flour and they'd send a guy out
>>running, and he would drop it along the -he'd drop a little flour along
>>through the jungle, and they would chase about it, and after three to
>>five miles, which was their standard route, they'd end up at a bar.  And
>>they described themselves as drinkers with a running problem.  And, I
>>think there are four clubs in the Atlanta area.
</Pre>
This is an example of the information age and of Toffler's Third Wave.
They have an 800 number.  You pay $3. 00 a year.  It is a worldwide system
of runners.  When my daughter and her husband went to London and he ran in
the marathon, the Hash House Harriers had a relief station part of the way
through so you could stop and get a drink as you were running in the
marathon, and then later they found a whole group who were, I think, from
the isle of Wight, and they went out with them in the evening.  And they
had this common bond.  And it is just all sorts of unusual people who like
to run and who get together, and they go do it.
<P>
Now, my point is, America is about the right of a free people.  And we have
led the planet in this sense.  That government gets out of your face so you
can organize your life to do whatever neat thing you like.  You like to go
spot whales?  Go join a club that goes and spots whales.  You like to hang
glide?  Go hang glide.  You want to go help people in hospitals?  Form a
group that goes -- you know, that the genius of the system is to liberate
the energy to allow you.
<P>
And again, let me go back to what the pathology of Hollywood doesn't get
today if you see the Hollywood movies, which are in many ways just -- would
be -- would I think literally, in many ways, be seen as sick by any kind of
reasonable -- you know, "Pulp Fiction" and "Natural Born Killers" and this
kind of thing.  Because they are describing a society which is ignomic, in
which people are so isolated from each other that they don't have a clue
how to live in a common human decent system.
<P>
And so the elite culture of Hollywood doesn't get America.  It doesn't
understand how America works.  In fact, and this is one of the great
paradoxes, the freedom to be alone becomes the freedom to join.  We don't
have to have the government force people together.  If you allow people --
because people are natural social animals -- if you get out of their way,
don't raise their taxes, give them enough take-home pay, let them have a
chance to go do it, the natural bias of people is to work with each other.
<P>

And so you see in America, and it was the point de Tocqueville drove at
hardest, was that he was stunned as a Frenchman at the way in which all of
this freedom didn't become, sit around, don't do anything, get drunk, and
be indigent.  It became, be energetic, be excited, pursue your dreams, have
a wonderful life.  Go do something that's fun.  And fun could be becoming a
millionaire.  Fun can be being the best golfer.  I mean, fun is how you
define it.  The pursuit of happiness.  Which is a very broad statement.
<P>
Now, it led to an extraordinary explosion of energy and creativity.  And
yet joining and citizenship in America have been built on a sense of duty.
Again and again for 200 years, you had people saying, of course you're
going to be active.  Of course you're going to do something.  That's what
citizenship requires.  And you didn't have a sense of dignity if you
weren't involved as a civic leader.  You wanted to be involved.
<P>
And if you go back and look at the movies of the '30s and '40s, you see all
sorts of examples where people would go out and they would organize a
better future and they would do things that were positive, and they had a
sense of, how do we come together in order to improve our collective
future?
<P>
Marvin Olasky picks it up when he points out that the word "compassion"
means "to suffer with."  And his whole concern is that in the 19th century,
it wasn't enough just to pay taxes.  In the 19th century, you also had an
obligation to give of yourself.  That you had to be involved.  And that
true compassion didn't mean just writing the check or giving the homeless
person five bucks.  True compassion meant stopping and saying, why are you
on the street?  What can I do to help you?
<P>
And, in fact, deliberately not giving the five bucks until you found out
how you could help them and begin the process of moving them into a better
future on the premise that if you gave them the five bucks without knowing,
you could actually be buying the alcohol that killed them or buying the
drugs that killed them.  You could actually be worsening their life by a
phony compassion that really was designed to make you feel good.
<P>
Morris Schechtman describes it brilliantly when he says the difference
between caring and caretaking.  If I truly care, I have to stop and find
out what's wrong.  If I'm just caretaking, I do something for you that
makes me feel good about myself.  It may ruin you, but that's not my fault.
There's a huge difference between caring and caretaking, and in our
lifetime, caretaking has driven out a lot of caring.
<P>
Much of this goes back, frankly, to the very nature of the religious
underpinnings and the moral underpinnings.  I mean, think about, first of
all, the religious origins of the English Civil War, which was a war over
the nature of man's relationship to God.  Think about the notion of and
Methodism and the great awakening.  Look at the spiritual and religious
underpinnings of the abolitionist movement, the sense of the progressives
that they were carrying out a doctrine of Christian concern.  That what
they saw as their effort was bringing religion into civic life.  The Civil
Rights movement, the profound reason that it is reverend Dr.  Martin Luther
King, jr.  That there was a moral force, a moral basis for what he was
doing.
<P>
Eisenhower's description of what happened in Europe.  His book is called
"Crusade in Europe."  His statement to the troops at Normandy, "we have
embarked upon a crusade," a religious phrase, a sense of moral superiority.
The way in which we tried to do the war on poverty and the war against
drugs implies that these are bad enough things to wage war on.  That
there's a decisive moral difference.
<P>
And, in fact, I would argue that there has always been a deep moralistic
force in American society.  And that as over the last 30 years an
anti-religious bias built into both the elite culture and to elite
institutions, it undermined and it misunderstood the core nature of the
moral force.  This is not about morality in the small sense of, do you
drink or do you dance?  This is about a deeper sense, are your commitments
ultimately coming from a spiritual sense of God, or is it just secular?  Is
that person -- and again, think about it in terms of shooting or raping
somebody.  If you truly believe that other person has been endowed by God
and is equally legitimately authentically a creature of God, now to attack
them is a dramatically higher threshold.
<P>
Whereas, if you think they're just randomly gathered protoplasm, and why
not, I mean, blow them away?  What the heck?  And if you watch a lot of the
sicker parts of the Hollywood elite in terms of the movies they make and
the things they describe, it's clearly man as protoplasm, human beings as
protoplasm.
<P>
Whereas, the core belief system that made America unique was, in fact,
moral and spiritual, and I would suggest it is that moral commitment which
has sustained citizenship and a commitment to community.  That as de
Tocqueville said, America is to be found in its churches and in its
volunteer activities, not in its government.
<P>
Now, let's take just a minute and look at Jimmy Carter, who really, I
think, in a speech he gave during the Atlanta Project process, gave us a
sense of how this all weaves together into a basic framework.
<Pre>
>>I was in a middle school not long ago, bright kids asking me questions
>>that were very hard to answer.  Stimulating questions, questions I didn't
>>hear anywhere else and wouldn't.  Afterwards, I asked the principal,
>>"what are their main problems here? " She said, "Mr. President, the boys
>>believe that their future success, their status in life, is dependent
>>upon their ownership of a semi-automatic weapon."  And I said, "what
>>about the girls? " She said, "pregnancy is a growing problem.  "what you
>>don't know is that the worst problem is among the sixth graders."  I was
>>shocked.  "the drug pushers and pimps prefer sex with the little girls,"
>>she said.
</Pre><br>
That's not Bangladesh, and that's not Addis Ababa, and that's not Lusaka.
That's Atlanta, Georgia.  And the problem is that we don't really know how
to relate to people whose 12-year-old daughters get pregnant, who are
living just a few hundred yards from where we live a sequestered life.
It's no reflection on us except that we need to reach out now in a genuine
way individually with our stimulating capability of analyzing complicated
problems and say, "let me participate in bringing about a change."
<P>
But, you know, what gives me most hope is what I saw yesterday, with
homeless people building each other a little tar paper shack, and the 30
formerly homeless mostly alcoholics who are now every day preparing about
350 meals for other homeless people.  That's the kind of spirit that can
bind us together and bridge the chasm between the rich like us and the poor
who are still waiting for a better life.  So I'm convinced that the
situation is not hopeless.  I'm convinced that it's not an impossible
dream.  The only real failure is not to try.
<Pre>
>>Now, if I could just come back and summarize this first hour for -- very
>>briefly, because I think it is the heart of the course.  America is a
>>romantic, moral, spiritual fantasy.  It's what makes us different.  Take
>>every one of us, drop us off in another country, same body, same mind,
>>and say, "okay, you're not endowed by your creator, you don't have a
>>right to pursue happiness," and we would learn how to change differently.
>>We'd behave differently.
</Pre><br>
But people come from all over the world here, and they become different.
They somehow cross into a magic land where everybody thinks their kids can
be president.  Everybody thinks their kids can be an NFL quarterback or a
ballet star or could do whatever they want to do.
<P>
And somehow, what we have to do is come back here as we start to solve
problems.  What's killed us for 30 years is trying to solve the problems
down in this one box, government.  And government, by definition, cannot
effectively be cultural, because you would have to be a police state.
<P>
I mean, you would go nuts if government tried to do the things Olasky wants
to do.  You'd say, "by what right does some paid bureaucrat tell me about
these things? " And yet what Olasky is saying is, you've got to have people
involved in civic responsibility so they can then teach the right cultural
values, because this is the heart of America, not government.
<P>
The heart of America is a mystical belief that each of us is endowed by
God, that each of us is unique, and then the living out of that belief to
the best of our abilities.  And that's what makes us remarkable.  And when
we come back, we're going to talk about how this fits into the structure of
government and politics.  (break)
<Pre>
>>Let me pick up -- somebody brought me this little note, I think, from a
>>magazine that sort of starts us back on the same theme.  It's a quote from
>>John Adams, who once explained how the framers of the U.S.  Constitution
>>presupposed the necessity of God's grace for the survival of the new form
>>of government.  He said the following, quote, "our constitution was
>>designed only for a moral and religious people.  "it is wholly inadequate
>>for the government of any other."
</Pre>
Because, again, it goes back to the notion that these three sides have to
be working.  You've got to have culture and society working, you've got to
have civic responsibility, you've got to have free markets and the pursuit
of happiness in order to have limited effective government.  And as these
three decay, the natural pressure of government will be to reach out and
take over more and more.
<P>
Now, it's going to lead us to some very interesting implications as we go
through looking at the structure of government which grows out of this
cultural sense of a spiritual and moral society and a free society.
<P>
First of all, remember, the Founding Fathers start with the notion that no
human is perfect, and none can be fully trusted with power.  It's very
important.  Because again, the modern cynicism expresses itself by saying,
either we stipulate that everybody is so sinful that there's no point to
worry about it, or if you're not that, then you must be a saint, so the
minute we can find out that you're not, we can prove you're -- that you're
even worse than somebody who's sinful because you're a hypocrite and
sinful, and therefore, nobody has any moral standing to say anything.
<P>
Who are you to say that using drugs is bad?  Or who are you to say that
whatever the next?  And you can find case after case of this argument for
the inappropriateness of moral assertion.  And yet the Founding Fathers
knew that if everybody involved in a free society was human, that you had
this really core problem.  And they said it well in the Federalist Papers.
The Founding Fathers understood the dilemma, and they said, quote, "if men
were angels, no government would be necessary."  And yet since men aren't
angels, you need government in order to restrain the passions of men.  But
by definition, since the government's going to be made up of men, you're
now giving the power to restrain to the people who you're trying to
restrain.
<P>
Lord Acton captured this in the middle of the 19th century.  He said,
quote, "all power tends to corrupt.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely."
Notice the drop of the word "tends."  Now, this means that people say,
well, you're now Speaker of the House.  You're talking about yourself.  Of
course.  You think if I had power, forever surrounded by people who wanted
me to feel good, and so whatever I did they said, "oh, that's wonderful."
"mud looks good on you" is the right response of a sycophant when you fall
on your face on a rainy day.  And, of course, all power tends to corrupt,
and therefore, everybody is susceptible to it.  Every person in this room
is susceptible to it.
<P>
Now, the Founding Fathers faced with that said -- and this is one of the
great works of genius in human history.  They said, all right, if in order
to be free we have to give power to the very people we fear, ourselves, how
do we structure it so we don't just create a new tyranny?  And this was
their answer.  The American Constitution, to avoid tyranny, they designed a
machine so inefficient that no dictator could force it to work.
<P>
This is a very conscious design.  And you're going to see it happen with
the Contract, because it's going to leave the House, which is designed to
be fast.  Somebody once said -- there was a quote I saw this week that I
thought was a reminder.  One of the Founding Fathers had described, he said
the House is like a cup of hot coffee, and the Senate is designed to be the
cooling saucer that you pour the coffee in.
<P>
So when you see the Senate go slower, every one of the Founding Fathers
would have said, "yes."  And then when you see the bills go down to the
president, who may veto them, and that is his right, the Founding Fathers
would have said, "yes."  And then when the bill's finally passed, it can be
taken to the Supreme Court to see whether or not it's constitutional, and
the Founding Fathers would have said, "yes."  And everybody gripes about it
until you get to something like health reform, where a year ago people
didn't want it to pass.  And guess what?  The American Constitution worked.
<P>

If we had been a European parliamentary system, we would have passed health
reform like that.  But in the American system, where an idea gets beaten up
at every stage, and you better have a really powerful idea and you better
have a lot of people prepared to spend a long time to get it through.  And
that's not bad if your greatest value's freedom.  It's terrible if your
greatest value's efficiency.  For efficiency's sake, get a good dictator.
<P>
For freedom's sake, you've got to start with two notions.  One is -- let me
walk one more step.  Because the corollary of stopping the dictator is that
the American system disperses power so thoroughly, we can barely make it
work when we want to.  Now, you'd better approach all this with a good
sense of humor.  You'd better say, "well, I guess we're going to get messed
up today again."  And instead of seeing that as cynical, it's the price of
freedom.  And you've got to respect that you may have a good idea, but
somebody else does, too.  And the price of freedom is frustration.
<P>
I have two phrases I try to teach people: life is hard.  Freedom is
frustrating.  So when you get up and you say to me, "boy, life is really
hard," the answer is, "yes.  "next question? " That's the thing we don't
teach the poor.  Life is hard.  You want to succeed?  You've got to work.
If you're poor, you've got to work harder than people who aren't poor, by
definition.  And by the way, when you start to succeed, you're still going
to be frustrated as long as you're free.
<P>
I mean, Ross Perot is a billionaire, and he's frustrated, too.  Because
there are 260 million of us, and each one of us is endowed by God with
certain unalienable rights.  So every time you think you've got the right
answer, you've now got to convince everybody else.  And we don't teach -- I
don't believe we teach correctly just how hard and how frustrating and how
difficult a free society is.  And so it's a little bit like thinking you
can play pro football without exercising.  We tell people, well, you're a
citizen, you have all these rights.  Sure, but first you have all these
responsibilities.  You have to work hard to be a citizen of a free society.
And if you're not prepared to work hard, you're not going to keep your
rights very long.
<P>
And I believe that this frustration is at the heart of the permanent
tension between direct democracy and republican representation.  It's a
very important issue and one you'll see come up in the term limits debate
where I favor term limits, but there's still this very real tension.  On
the one hand, direct democracy says, "okay, how do we feel this week? " We
all raise our hand.  Let's rush off and do it.  The concept of republican
representation, which is very clear in the Founding Fathers, is you hire
somebody who you send to a central place.  They study the issues.  They, by
definition, learn things you don't learn, because you don't want to -- I
mean, you sent them.  You didn't send you.  You want to be able to go live
your life.
<P>
They are then supposed to use their judgment to represent you in a
republic, which is very different than a direct democracy, and the Founding
Fathers are very clear about this.  They feared the passion of the moment.
They feared the idea that you could establish a dictatorship with a good
demagogue and the right six weeks of campaigning, and they wanted to create
very hard problems of getting through.
<P>
Now, in that context, let me just say that I think Daniel Yankelovich, who
really developed this, talks about the difference between public opinion
versus coming to public judgment.  I found this to be one of the most
helpful explanations of what I experience.  Public opinion is that you got
a call this morning and say, "what do you think about 'x'? " Public
judgment is six or eight weeks from now, when you've read about it for a
while, you've talked to your neighbors, you've had a discussion at Sunday
school, you've chatted about it over lunch, you've listened to somebody
talk about it on the radio, and now you've formed an opinion.
<P>
There is a huge -- I mean, a judgment.  There is an enormous difference
between public opinion, what's the snapshot this morning, and public
judgment, what do people think after they've talked about it for a while?
And fairly consistently, the judgment is more cautious and remarkably
smart.  I mean, if you look over time at the wisdom of the American people,
the system works, but it takes time.  Takes six weeks to three months, as a
General principle, for the country to talk to itself.
<P>
So when you get a poll that says, "well, this morning, 82% said 'x,'" the
next question is, "yeah, and what are they going to say after they think
about it, after they put it in context, after they talk it out? " Because
then they're going to begin to have public judgment.
<P>
I believe that the sense of frustration is at the heart of the permanent
tension between reform and reality.  What you get is people who jump up and
they say, "I have a new idea," and they're on fire and they're ready and
they're excited.  But the fact is that it's going to be slow.  It's going
to take awhile.  It's going to be hard.  And it's easy, I think, at that
point to break down and to start getting cynical, when, in fact, very often
the system's working.  It is doing what the Founding Fathers designed it to
do.  It's making you prove that your reform is strong enough and good
enough to really be worth changing and having people have to obey a
difference.
<P>
One of the things about entrepreneurial free enterprise is that it tries to
solve the frustration by applying common sense.  That if you think about
this model, what the Founding Fathers wanted to do was have as few things
as possible in limited effective government.  Because they expected it to
be slow and frustrating.
<P>
So they wanted to decentralize away from the government creating wealth,
owning property, what you do with your money.  They wanted to decentralize
away from the government your right to organize any civic group you want to
go and do the things you believe in.  They wanted to decentralize away from
the government establishing the cultural values of the society.  Because
here you can allow people to do things very quickly, because they're not
government.
<P>
But then they wanted to say, now, wait a second.  When you start using the
power of the state -- and there's a great phrase from Washington where he
talks about the danger of the state, and that the power of the state is
like fire, that it can burn you and it's very dangerous.  And in that
framework, they wanted to make sure that this was deliberately limited and
deliberately difficult, because they thought it was the power to destroy.
And they were very cautious about giving the government power.  So
tremendous opportunities in the society at large, very hard in the
government itself.
<P>
Somebody who I think did describe -- and I mentioned this last hour --
somebody who I thought really described the emotion and the spirit and the
sense of being an American is Woodrow Wilson.  And this is from a speech he
gave to a group of brand new citizens who had just become Americans, people
who were first- generation immigrants.  I think you'll find it very
interesting.
<Pre>
>>this is the only country in the world which experiences constant and
>>repeated rebirth.  Other countries depend upon the multiplication of
>>their own native people.  This country is constantly drinking strength
>>out of new sources.  It is as if humanity had determined to see to it
>>that this great nation, founded for the benefit of humanity, should not
>>lack for the allegiance of the people of the world.
</Pre>
You have just taken an oath of allegiance to the United States, of
allegiance to whom?  Of allegiance to no one unless it be to God, certainly
not of allegiance to those who temporarily represent this great government.
You have taken an oath of allegiance to a great ideal, to a great body of
principles, to a great hope of the human race.  You cannot dedicate
yourself to America unless you become in every respect and with every
purpose of your will thorough Americans.
<P>
You cannot become thorough Americans if you think of yourselves in groups.
America does not consist of groups.  A man who thinks of himself as
belonging to a particular national group in America has not yet become an
American, and the man who goes among you to trade upon your nationality is
no worthy son to live under the stars and stripes.  My urgent advice to you
would be not only always to think first of America, but always also to
think first of humanity.
<P>
You do not love humanity if you seek to define humanity into jealous camps.
Humanity can be welded together only by love, by sympathy, by justice, not
by jealousy and hatred.  It is a very interesting circumstance to me, in
thinking of those of you who have just sworn allegiance to this great
government, that you were drawn across the ocean by some beckoning finger
of hope, by some belief, by some vision of a new kind of justice, by some
expectation of a better kind of life.
<P>
No doubt, you have been disappointed in some of us.  Some of us are very
disappointing.  But remember this, if we had grown at all poor in the
ideal, you brought some of it with you.  A man does not hope for the thing
that he does not believe in.  And if some of us have forgotten what America
believed in, you at any rate imported in your own hearts a renewal of the
belief.  You are enriching us if you came expecting us to be better than we
are.
<P>
You have come into this great nation voluntarily seeking something that we
have to give, and all that we have to give is this, we cannot exempt you
from work.  No man is exempt from work anywhere in the world.  We cannot
exempt you from the strife and the heart-breaking burden of the struggle of
the day.  That is common to mankind everywhere.  We cannot exempt you from
the loads that you must carry.  We can only make them light by the spirit
in which they are carried.  That is the spirit of hope.  It is the spirit
of liberty.  It is the spirit of justice.
<Pre>
>>Now, that's Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, talking at a
>>time when we had massive immigration.  I mean, there was an effort to
>>figure out, how do you define this thing we call America?  And, in fact,
>>he is one of the people who defined the modern American tradition of
>>liberty.
</Pre>
But I want to now walk you through what I -- I spent a lot of time thinking
about what's gone wrong, and I believe one of the things that's gone wrong
is in the core values of the elite.  And in particular, in the way in which
the elite, whether it's in the academic world or in Hollywood or in the
news media, has misunderstood how a free society operates.
<P>
And it seems to me that there are two traditions that are in conflict, and
I want to walk you through these two.  I do it building around two
particular individuals who happened to be at the "Baltimore Sun."  But I
think you can make a pretty strong case that these two traditions are
remarkably different.
<P>
And the two people I want to use are H. L,  Mencken and Frank R.  Kent.
Now, now, Frank Kent is not well known today, because his tradition was
defeated intellectually.  Mencken represented the sort of cynical,
contemptive humanity kind of view that assumes that everybody is somehow a
crook, everybody somehow has failings, everybody somehow is doing something
that is contemptible.
<P>
Frank Kent was the political reporter in the same period, where Mencken was
sort of a social critic, and literary types love him.  Frank Kent loved
politics.  He wrote a book called "the great game of politics."
<P>
I was introduced to Frank Kent by reporter-turned-editor named Paul walker
who'd been a reporter in the '30s and '40s and then had opened up a paper
called the "Harrisburg Home Star," whichwas a weekly give-away paper.  And
I'd gotten to know him as almost in the William Allen White -- "the Andy
Griffith show" model of the local newspaper editor who's a wise man and
who's very nice.
<P>
And he took me under his arm and he had me read Kent's works, because he
said Kent understood how politics really works.  We actually have a -- I
guess we don't have Kent's book here.  But it's out of print now, but it's
worth -- it's in libraries.  And Kent went out and really looked at and
lived with and enjoyed politics.  And he was honest about it.
<P>
Now, the difference is that the cultural elites despise politics.  I
believe they despise politics, first of all, because most of the modern
cultural elite starts with the Whig reaction to Andrew Jackson.  And the
Whigs disliked the way in which Jacksonian democracy took over Washington.
<P>

In fact, you don't get a really good biography of Jackson for about a
century and -- about 140 years, 130 years after he's President.  It's only
when Schlesinger writes his book which reestablishes Jackson as a precursor
to FDR, but for a long period, the Whig historians didn't like Jackson
because he represented the rise of populist sheer numbers, democracy in the
masses.  Then you get what is largely a Protestant, economic elite in the
progressive movement reacting to the Catholics who are taking over the big
cities.
<P>
And so you get this fury that here are these Catholics who are organizing,
particularly the Irish, who are organizing the cities and winning, and you
get the rise of the Progressive movement, which is a deliberate effort to
replace politics with bureaucracy.
<P>
And this tradition goes all the way up to present, as you'll see in a
minute, and is involved with people like Nader and Common Cause, and is an
anti-politics movement.  Politics is bad.  Raising money is bad.
Campaigning is bad.  Advertising is bad.  Organizing political power is
bad.  What you really want is some nice, elite intellectual, preferably a
good Protestant, who will then make the decisions outside of politics.
<P>
Go back and read the writing of the Progressive Movement.  It is remarkably
anti-democratic, and it says, "we'll do good things by making sure
politicians aren't in charge."  And Mencken not only had that tradition,
but Mencken personally despised people.  I think it's fair to say he was a
misanthrope.  And as you read his diaries and his letters, I mean, Mencken
came at life from a standpoint of extraordinary cynicism, and he became for
the journalism schools and for much of the modern media the sort of
archetype of the good critical cynic who stands aloof from the game and who
is all wise and all knowing and all contemptuous.
<P>
Now, the problem with that is that cynicism combined with moralism to
produce anti-politics.  So now you have these morally superior people who
are inherently cynical who dislike the process of politics.  And it's
utterly -- and let me tell you what the distinction is.  And it took -- the
person who helped me first begin to break this was Theodore White in "the
Making of the President" in 1960, where he says of Adlai Stevenson, that
Stevenson was like a man who liked the idea of romantic love, but despised
the idea of sex.  And that he was perfectly willing to become President,
but he did not want to do any of the things politicians did to become
President.
<P>
It was a wonderful paragraph.  When I first read it, I had to stop and
think, now, what is he getting at here?  Well, let me draw the distinction
for you.  And you can listen to this tone, and you'll instantly know
whether you're dealing with an elitist or not.  It's the difference between
liking people and liking the people.
<P>
I am always suspicious when somebody tells me about "the people."  Now,
tell me you like people, you're willing to go out and spend time with
people, you're willing to sit around a table and listen to people, and it's
one by one, because that's how people live.  Now you've got the makings of
a politician.  Tell me that you don't really like people, because after
all, they're messy and they're confused and they're strange and they have
desires.
<P>
I mean, it's just -- and it's frustrating.  Takes hours.  People are very
time-consuming, but as an intellectual elitist, you're prepared to help the
people.  I mean, read editorial writers who love the people.  And are quite
willing to dictate to them exactly how they should live.  Usually from a
morally superior position.  But my question to them, there's a great
phrase, and Martin Luther King, jr. , had led his crusade north to Chicago
and ran into the last great old political system, which still exists today.
And Mayor Daley held a press conference, and martin Luther King, jr. ,
went to the press conference and said, "there are people on the south side
who don't have running water."  And Mayor Daley, said, "what are their
names? "
<P>
And Dr. King stopped, because that wasn't the correct answer.  And he said,
"what do you mean, 'what are their names? '" he said, "if there are people
on the South Side who don't have running water, I'm the mayor, I want them
to have running water.  "give me their names.  We'll have somebody down
there by this afternoon, they'll get running water."  He didn't have any
names.  He was making a rhetorical statement about the people.
<P>
This is the -- and I'd never thought about it until today.  This is the
essence of the Olasky argument.  You can't help the homeless.  You can help
Sam.  So when Sam sits there and says, "give me a dime," if you stop and
say, "Sam, would you like to work for a little while?  "I'll be glad to pay
you 20 bucks, but I have some things that need to be fixed.  "would you be
willing to come over and help? " If Sam then says, "no, I'm too busy
begging," you know you shouldn't give him a dime.  But you've got to stop,
focus, and take care of Sam.
<P>
Now, one of the great books -- and the reformers will go nuts at my
reciting this -- but it is a great book, "Plunkitt of Tammany hall."
Plunkitt was a genuine machine politician.  He knew how the machine worked.
And late in his career, he told a young reporter, "this is how we did it."
And the truth was, in many ways, if you were an immigrant, if you were
Catholic in a Protestant world, if you didn't understand the government, if
you had a hard time speaking English, if you were a little scared by the
world around you, the big-city machines delivered, and they were a world
that was different.
<P>
Now, if you want to see what I think is -- and I believe in fiction and in
learning things, and if you want to see a great way to learn about it, take
a look at Edwin O'connor's "the Last Hurrah."  I think we have it on
Chyron, also.  But it is a great book.  This is a novel.  It's easy
reading.  It was a movie with Spencer Tracy.  And it's about -- based on
James Michael Curley, the Mayor of Boston, who was once reelected while in
jail.  Because their theory was the Protestant lawyers had put him in jail,
but he was a good Catholic, and he was going to take care of them.  I mean,
part of the reason I'm emphasizing this is, a, it's historically true, and,
b, as you now look at the rise of Black politicians and Hispanic
politicians and Asian politicians, this is nothing new.
<P>
In Benjamin Franklin's time, the fight was between the English, the
Quakers, who were English but of a particular religious sect, the Germans,
and they had all sorts of ethnic fights in Pennsylvania politics before we
were a state, when Pennsylvania was still a colony.
<P>
So all of these arguments and all these patterns are not new.  In Georgia,
the fight between the mountain poor who had their own farm and no slaves
and the folks down in the plantation area who were very rich and owned
slaves, totally different political styles.  In Louisiana, you have the
Cajuns, you have New Orleans, and you have the North Country, which is
Protestant.  And it's okay.
<P>
Part of the way the American system works is you're allowed to have your
own particular group, to be involved, to be active, and this Edwin
O'connor's book is a great novel about the last great mayor of his cycle
and what the machine was like and how it worked and what he did and why he
did it.  And you'll learn a lot about the process of a free society.  As I
mentioned, in Riordan's "Plunkitt of Tammany hall," you really learn how
power in a free society really works, and it gives you a real introduction
to thinking about it.
<P>
In the modern period, I can say as a practitioner, there may be no single
novel better about the U.S.  Congress than "Advise and Consent."  It's
about the Senate, but the essence of its lessons on the legislative body
are just fabulous.  And I reread it in 1990, and I was stunned at how
accurate it is and how much -- if you read this, it's as good as any
textbook you're going to get.
<P>
But the people who like politics, the people who understand individual
people -- remember the difference between individual people and the people
-- have certain characteristics.  People are human.  All humans have
weaknesses.  Politics will involve humans, politicians will have
weaknesses.  This is like a geometry set of principles, right?  It's
important to understand that.  So when you have the modern scandal
mongering, and again, I mean, I did file charges against the sitting
Speaker of the House.  I did move to expel the member who is a convicted
felon.  I do think there are lines you draw.
<P>
But the general shock of the news media discovering, once again, that
everybody in politics is a human being, unlike the reporters, because, of
course, you could have -- we didn't do it, but you could have done the same
Chyron, people are human.  All humans have weaknesses.  Reporting will
involve humans.  Reporters will have weaknesses, which is fine.
<P>
I mean, the glory of the system for a guy like Ernie Pyle, who's the
greatest war correspondent in World War II, was he knew that.  He covered
the soldiers with a sense of fondness because they were humans, and he was
himself regarded by the soldiers with a sense of fondness because he was a
human, too.  And so they had a common bond.  They didn't have any sense of
either one being morally superior, which didn't mean that they weren't
fighting to a moral end.  But it was the moral end which transcended them.
It was not their personal judgments.
<P>
Now, a fun book to really get a view of this is Franz de Waal's "chimpanzee
politics."  Franz de Waal's a Dutchman who's now actually at Emory.  This
is a study of the chimpanzee colony at the Arnhem Zoo.  Chimpanzees are
primates, they're social animals.  They have hierarchical struggles.
<P>
The book actually starts with a story about a male gorilla who is very
strong and who intimidates another male and two females till the three of
them get so mad at him that they bond together and the three of them almost
kill him, and they have to take him out of the cage.  And -- which is the
nature of politics.  And you start saying, "all right, tell me about
political organisms.  "how do they work? " And what you discover is that
there are all sorts of trappings, whether it's "Hail to the Chief" before
the President walks in, whether it's the Speaker walking in and banging the
gavel and saying, "the house is now in order."
<P>
And that you begin to sort of -- and you can see it in a room, you can see
it -- if you watch C-Span with the sound off when we're voting and just
watch the transactions, Marianne says it's like watching kindergarten at
recess and all the little kiddies running around and chatting with each
other.  But it's good for us to relax about the humanness of what we're
doing.  It's good for us to accept that we're going to get the best 435
humans in the house and the best hundred humans in the Senate and the best
human we can for President and Vice-President, and then they're all going
to be humans with all the passions, all the confusion, all the
complexities, all the ego problems, all the insecurities that are what
being human's about, and then you can relax, and you have a much richer and
deeper and more interesting experience.
<P>
Two really good books on this are both by Edward T.  Hall.  One is called
"the Silent Language," and the other is called "Hidden Communication."
What Hall did is he studied, how do people interact nonverbally?  How close
do people stand?  Greeks stand much closer than Germans.  What does being
on time mean?  It means very different for Germans than Brazilians.  And
you begin to look at different kinds of body language.
<P>
I was given by a Texan who had been assigned by Texaco to be the
Vice-President of computing.  He'd never been out of the state of Texas,
and he arrived in Brussels, and he walked in this room and he said about a
month later, he figured out that the body language of a Swede and an
Italian is radically different.  That a Swede can be furious and give you
no body language signals that they're mad.  An Italian can just be making a
point and you think that they're enraged.  And that he literally went to
these two books -- as a businessman, he read these two books to begin to
get the cross- cultural sense of, what are people saying to each other?
<P>
And what I'm driving at here, of course, is that you have to start with all
of the nonverbal biological natures of being human as an underpinning of
politics.  This is why the Founding Fathers were geniuses, because they
said, okay, we don't care how much you tell us you're going to be
wonderful.  You're a person.  Sooner or later, you're going to break down.
Sooner or later you're going to want to seize power.  Sooner or later
you're going to forget everybody else.  How do I design a machine so when
you are at your worst, you can't do too much damage to the country?  It is
a brilliant design for avoiding dictatorship.
<P>
Now, what Frank Kent did in his book "the Great Game of Politics" is he
came along and he said, "look" -- and this was written in the 1920s.  "here
is how the game is played."  I was looking at it last year.  It's
remarkably similar today.  Now, we do it with television, not with
newspapers nearly as much.  We do it with different kinds of advertising.
We have more consultants.  You know, our political bosses are electronic,
they're consultants rather than being geographic, but you still have very
similar processes, and it's well worth you studying.
<P>
Robert Heinlein wrote a little book just before World War II called "Take
Back Your Government," and it's a practical handbook for the private
citizen who wants democracy to work.  And it's a fun little book.  It's
been republished recently, and I really recommend it to you just as a way
of seeing -actually, I'm sorry, it was written in 1946, and I really
recommend it to you.  It's in paperback, and it's just an interesting
introduction from a guy who was a science fiction writer and a patriot and
understood how hard it was to get a free society to work.
<P>
Now, the dilemma of Common Cause and Ralph Nader is that they love the
concept of helping the people.  But they despise the process by which
politics operates.  Any contribution given must be corrupt.  Any appearance
of corruption must be evil.  Therefore, since -- so in essence, they can
end up in a totally socialist system in which all politics would occur
within government.  And it's a model which is, in fact, I think, in the
long run very, very dangerous to a free society.
<P>
The dilemma of the newsroom and the editorial boards is a different
dilemma.  It is, on the one hand, how do they cover as a legitimate
skeptic?  Difference between a skeptic and a cynic.  A skeptic says, I'd
like to believe you're sincere, but you've got to convince me.  A cynic
says, I know you're not sincere, so let me find -- let me figure out how to
get the mask to be pulled off.  And starting with Watergate, I think, and
with Vietnam, we went from a healthy, skeptical news media that loved
politics and understood it.
<P>
Go back and read the great legislative reporters of the 1950s, their
attitude towards the President, their attitudes towards the congress.  They
loved the business they covered.  They thought it was incredibly important.
Didn't mean they didn't report scandals.  Didn't mean they didn't report
human foibles, but they did it within a larger framework of saying,this is
this remarkable American romanticism, and then look starting with the mid
to late '60s, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Vietnam, and Watergate,
somebody could do a fascinating study of the change in tone, the change in
assumptions, and the change in what was legitimate behavior by the media.
<P>
And you now have a devastatingly more cynical, devastatingly more
adversarial system, which makes it harder to report the truth.  Because the
truth isn't always cynical.  The truth is often romantic and wonderful.
America is a great country with a good people.  And if you're not allowed
to report that because that would clearly not be cynical enough and you'd
be laughed at in the newsroom, you literally distort the whole context of
how America operates.
<P>
What we have to do is invent honest self-government and politics for the
21st century.  We've got to go back -- and notice the term I used, honest
self-government.  Yes, I think standards matter, and, yes, I think you have
to say, we're determined to have an honest system.  That means you've got
to, I think, invent citizenship and community for the 21st century, and
you've got to apply the Spirit of Invention and Discovery.
<P>
You've got to go back out and say, how can we get this to work?  What are
the things, whether it's computerization, whether it is town hall meetings
that are electronic, whether it is putting the Congress on-line as we have
with Thomas at the Library of Congress, how do we reestablish in the 21st
century this sense of citizenship and community?  How do we apply quality
to create citizenship and community?  You know, how would Deming have
approached all this?  And how could we have continuous improvement and a
sense of all of us as a large American team working to create a better way
of doing things?
<P>
I would suggest to you that as part of that, that there are four roles of a
leader, and that we often do this backwards.  That the first role of a
leader is to set the agenda and communicate goals and standards.  That the
second role of a leader is to convey symbolic power.  That is, when the
mayor or the governor or the President shows up, the act of their being
there makes the meeting more important.  They symbolize their community.
The third is to gather resources outside their own system.  That is, they
say, "let's go and create something," and they get volunteers, they get
private-sector money, they focus the attention of the community on doing
something.  Only the fourth is managing their own bureaucratic system.
<P>
Now, what happens to you in Washington and what happens to you at state
capitals is running the government narrowly defined, running this part of
your society.  Remember, the leader is the leader of all of this.  But
instead, what you've got is overfocus on running the government and an
underfocus on leading the culture.  So if you look at them all together,
notice where we place those, the four roles of a leader.  First, the top
one is to set the agenda, to communicate goals and standards.  The second
one is to convey symbolic power.  The third is to gather resources.  Only
fourth comes managing your own system.
<P>
Now, let me show you how this works at three major levels.  The President
of the United States sets the agenda for the nation by leading the American
people, symbolizes, symbolizes, the American nation, is the head of the
American community, and manages the American government.
<P>
But that's his least important job.  By contrast, a governor sets the
agenda for the state by leading the people of the state, symbolizes the
state, is the head of the state community, and manages the state
government.
<P>
But again, notice the thing we normally report on is the least important of
their assignments.  At a local level, a mayor sets the agenda for the city
by leading the people of the city, symbolizes the city, is the head of the
city community, and manages the city government.  And we don't train our
leaders to understand that their most important jobs are not the government
part.  It's the leadership part.
<P>
Now, what will happen is Toffler's third wave information revolution will
lead to new forms of citizenship and community.  And everybody, I think,
gets to play in this.  I mean, just as the Founding Fathers were codifying
the second wave transition from agriculture to industry, and in a sense,
you can see the rise of the constitution as an effort to figure out how
humans live together in that setting, every American can be asked, what is
your vision of 21st century citizenship and community?
<P>
And you can start thinking about, as you see everything that's changing
around you, how are we going to operate?  How is the system going to
evolve?  And then what are the right strategies to implement that vision?
Once we start figuring out whether it's town hall meetings or it's
computers or it's volunteerism or whatever it is, and I think this takes a
lot of discussion, and then finally, what projects and tactics will
implement your vision and your strategies?
<P>
Now, that's the dialogue, I think, of the next four or five years, and it's
a dialogue that the entire nation has to be involved in.  Because in
essence, what is at stake is doing the hard work of freedom.  That we have
to say to a generation, to quote Franklin Delano Roosevelt, that we have a
rendezvous with destiny, and that we have to be reengaged in rebuilding our
understanding of America and creating it.
<P>
And it starts, in part, with myths.  Remember, every civilization has
heroic myths, because that's how people teach themselves.  I mean, one of
the most famous, Frankly, is David defeating Goliath, a very important part
of the Bible, and it's a very important sense of mythology.  Here's this
young kid, he goes out there, and because he's on the right side, he kills
this giant, and therefore as it is described in the bible, the good guys
win.
<P>
Go back and read that and think about all the different lessons that are
inherent in that in terms of why you should have courage.  Why as long as
you're right, as long as you're standing for the right side, you should
take an interest.  In the Roman tradition, it was Horatio at the bridge,
the idea of the individual who stood there and who stood off the enemy and
who saved the society, even at the risk to their life.
<P>
That gets modernized in our system with Patrick Henry, the schoolteacher,
who said, "give me liberty or give me death."  I think he was 23 at the
time.  And imagine the courage, you get captured by the British, you're a
spy, and they say, "do you have any final words" -- I'm not -- I'm sorry,
it wasn't Patrick Henry.  It was Nathan Hale, which I'll get to in a
second.  But Patrick Henry, in a sense, sets up Nathan Hale, because
Patrick Henry in his speech says, "give me liberty or give me death," and
you're going to see this in the series.  The next one is John Paul Jones,
who says, "I have not yet begun to fight" when the British were sinking his
ship, so he had to actually capture their ship in the fight.  Then you get
to Nathan Hale, who says, "my only regret is that I have but one life to
give for my country."
<P>
Now, in a sense, look at the pattern, from David who goes down as a young
man risking everything for his team, to Horatio at the bridge who risked
everything for Rome, to Patrick Henry who says, "give me liberty or give me
death," to John Paul Jones, who was a figure of heroic courage.
<P>
And again, imagine what schools would be like in the inner city if this
kind of heroism were taught again.  If young children learned, well, of
course -- I mean, tell me how hard your problem is.  You think it's as hard
as Nathan Hale's?  And they hung him.  You think the fight you're involved
in is dramatically worse than John Paul Jones'?  His ship was sinking.  But
there was a spirit which is at the heart of a free society, a spirit of
enormous courage.
<P>
In Washington's case, frankly, it's his nobility.  That Washington comes to
personify the sense of duty, honor, country, which is at the heart of a
free society.  And then Washington, who is in some ways a very austere
figure, particularly because he's an older man bythe time he's President,
Washington then is matched in the pantheon of American heroes by Lincoln,
and I think it's because of Abraham Lincoln's compassion and martyrdom, the
fact that he's killed at the very end of the war at Ford's theater.
<P>
But when you look at the Lincoln figure, I mean -- and these, again, are
literally -- I mean, I'm using myth here in the best anthropological sense,
an organizing story which helps a society tell itself about life.  And so
you go from the nobility and courage of Washington to Lincoln's dedication
and compassion, the sense that Lincoln bled for every person killed in the
war on both sides.  That he thought it was a terrible -- if you read his
second inaugural.  If you come to Washington, go to the monument and read
the second inaugural.  You feel the pain.  And so you capture this spirit.
<P>
<P>
And then with the emergence of America as the leading industrial power in
the world, what more perfect mythology than Teddy Roosevelt charging up San
Juan hill?  If you ever get to see a fine little movie called "the Wind and
the Lion," which has a just brilliant portrait by Brian Keith of Theodore
Roosevelt, you get this sense of -- that he was the perfect evocation of an
emerging optimistic, buoyant, adventurous America.
<P>
Remember I read earlier that he's the first President to ride in a car, and
there's newspapers congratulating for his courage in actually riding in a
car.  Remember that he doesn't shoot the baby bear that they've captured,
and so the invention of the teddy bear.  You could argue that in some ways,
he may have been the most popular person ever to be President just as an
individual.  And yet he personified this explosion of energy that is
America at the turn of the century.
<P>
As I've said before, we get into the Depression, the country has deep
doubts, there is a tremendous collapse of belief in America, and then on a
rainy morning on March 4th, 1933, a man who is in braces gets up and says,
"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself," and literally you see just
the country begins to relax.  And, I mean, one of the great stories of
modern times, I was talking to a still photographer the other day who was
saying they never showed FDR in a wheelchair, because they had a sense of
the dignity of the presidency and they had a sense of his personal dignity.
<P>
<P>
And here's a man who by sheer will and discipline stood in his braces, and
if you watch -- I saw the other day some footage of him walking to the
podium that day.  He has somebody on each side helping him, because the
truth is, he could barely -- he couldn't move his legs.  I mean, it's a
remarkable effort of sheer will.  And yet he comes out of all this, having
been through polio, having been told basically -- I mean, his wife strongly
wanted him to quit and his family wanted him to quit.
<P>
He works his way back, he gets a call from Al Smith, who says, "we have to
have you" on the ticket to run for governor in 1928.  He believes in his
heart he's beginning to learn to walk again, and he's faced with the
choice, do I serve my party, run for Governor, and probably never walk the
rest of my life, or do I stay out of politics and recover?  And they say,
"you've got to do it," you know, and so he runs, he wins, when Smith is
losing the Presidency, and then four years later, he's not just a man of
enormous discipline, but he does something that I don't know of any other
American politician who's ever done it.  He has an automatic contagious
buoyant optimism.
<P>
You see it twice.  First as the depression.  The country's a mess, 25%
unemployment, and FDR just picks the country up.  It goes back to this.  He
leads by faith.  He leads the country by just creating a mood that is
amazing that, "we can do it."  And then, of course, it re-creates it in
1941 at Pearl Harbor, and no matter how bad things were the first six
months of World War II, he was always optimistic, he was always positive.
We were going to get there.
<P>
And, of course, in a way, his direct psychological descendant, a Reagan
Democrat turned Republican, is Ronald Reagan.  If you think of, "we have
every right to dream heroic dreams."  He says it two different places in
his first inaugural, "we have every right to dream heroic dreams."  After
all, we are Americans.  And you have this same buoyant, positive sense.
<P>
Now, I want to wrap up this part by bringing together two different
feelings.  One, this is a great country with a good people.  Optimism,
buoyancy, positivism makes sense.  Two, life is hard and freedom's
frustrating.  That underpinning the optimism is brute hard work.
Underpinning the sense that we're a good people is a very tough-minded
willingness to stop the ones who don't want to be good people.  And it's a
- it's complex.  It's not obvious or simple or easy, and yet that's the
magic that for 300 years has grown the process of freedom.
<P>
And to go back to where we started with Chamberlain, we got a section from
Burn's fabulous "the Civil War" I want to share with you.  This is a letter
written by Sullivan Ballou to his wife.  And again, I want you to listen to
this letter and think about what we're asking.  We're saying to you, in
peacetime, you have to take responsibility, you have to give some of your
time, you have to be willing to be an American, which is an act of being.
It means you've got to invest yourself in your community, in your
neighbors, in your children, in your parents.  You have to do things to be
an American.  But we're asking you to do it in peacetime of the richest
society in the history of the world.  Listen for a few minutes to what
Sullivan Ballou wrote his wife.
<Pre>
>>a week before the Battle of Bull Run, Sullivan Ballou, a Major in the 2nd
>>Rhode Island Volunteers, wrote home to his wife in Smithfield.

>>July the 14th, 1861, Washington, D.C.  Dear Sarah: the indications are
>>very strong that we shall move in a few days, perhaps tomorrow, and lest
>>I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write a few
>>lines that may fall under your eye when I'm no more.  I have no misgiving
>>about or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my
>>courage does not halt or falter.  I know how American Civilization now
>>leans upon the triumph of the government, and how great a debt we owe to
>>those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the
>>revolution, and I am willing, perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys
>>in this life to help maintain this government and to pay that debt.
</pre>
Sarah, my love for you is deathless.  It seems to bind me with mighty
cables that nothing but only omnipotence break, and yet my love of country
comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly with all those
chains to the battlefield.  The memory of all the blissful moments I have
enjoyed with you come crowding over me, and I feel most deeply grateful to
God and you that I've enjoyed them for so long.
<P>
And how hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes and
future years when, God willing, we might still have lived and loved
together and see our boys grown up to honorable manhood around us.  If I do
not return, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I loved you, nor that when
my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.
<P>
Forgive my many faults and the many pains I have caused you.  How
thoughtless, how foolish I have sometimes been.  But, oh, Sarah, if the
dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they love, I
shall always be with you in the brightest day and the darkest night,
always, always.  And when the soft breeze pans your cheek, it shall be my
breath, or the cool air your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit
passing by.  Sarah, do not mourn me dead.  Think I am gone, and wait for
me.  For we shall meet again.
<Pre>
>>Sullivan Ballou was killed a week later at the first battle of bull run.

>>Isn't that great?  One of the things Bill Fortune, who's writing a book
>>with me, is a historian of this period, one of the points he makes is
>>that when you go back and read the letters of the period, that it is
>>astonishing how idealistic they are, and how muchit meant.

>>it seems like we're in this period where we're all motivated by
>>self-interest.

>>One of the -- or that if -- that your self-interest also includes God and
>>it also includes your spiritual being and it also -- I mean,
>>self-interest broadly defined is what they've died for.  If you see the
>>wonderful movie Glory, and I get tearied up, too.  I think it's an
>>amazing thing.  Anyway, the point is you listen to that, and then you get
>>told, "I'm too busy shopping to be a citizen."  And you know that right
>>here is what this is all about.  You're either going to turn this culture
>>around and say to people, grow up.  You want to be free, you've got to be
>>responsible, or it ain't going to work.
</Pre><br>
Let me just say in closing, this has been an extraordinary 20 hours.  This
is the close of the cycle of three courses.  I want to thank Dr.  Minnix,
who's right here because -- (applause) and President Floyd Falany, who I
think is in the next room, but without him, we would not have been able to
do this (applause).  I want to thank Bob Head and all the crew both here at
Reinhardt and the crew from VTA that made this possible, and there are most
of them downstairs, although we have several folks around here, but they've
done a wonderful job.
<P>
Jeff Eisenach, who brought us Sullivan Ballou, and who ran the whole thing
for three years.  Nancy Desmond, who did the original story.  Steve Hanser,
who's been our chief intellectual advisor in all.  John McDowell sitting
back there, who's put all this together this time and who stayed on top of
all of it.  Pattie Stechschulte, who is, I think, in the other room.  Maury
Kennedy, who produces the newspaper.  And I want to thank my wife,
Marianne, because this has all been tough.  And we want to thank you.

BADEN</P><P>           Second in a series of articles on the Forest Service and the economics of the timber industry.</P><P>  BROCK Evans, vice president and chief lobbyist for the National Audubon Society, recently spoke at a University of Washington Environmental Management Seminar. In response to a question about reforming the Forest Service, he cataloged many destructive, wasteful and insensitive practices. Below-cost timber sales were high on his list of government boondoggles. We agree on these failings.</P><P>     His cure was familiar too: replace the &quot;bad&quot; people in the Forest Service with new, &quot;good&quot; people; and instill the Forest Service with a new corporate culture that respects environmental values, placing them ahead of logging and exploitation. Here our opinions diverge.</P><P>     I believe there are few bad people in the Forest Service, certainly no more than in any large government organization. What dooms the Forest Service are its bad budgetary incentives.</P><P>     As Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, put it, &quot;It's the budget that energizes the Forest Service.&quot; And the Forest Services' budgeting process is fundamentally perverse. It provides incentives to generate below-cost timber sales and to discount the value of recreation, wildlife habitat and environmental amenities.</P><P>     In the private sector, business income must cover expenditures. But the Forest Service does not run like that - and it cannot go bankrupt. An obscure 1930 law called the Knutson-Vandenburg Act is important to the budgeting process. Under it, the Forest Service is allowed to keep the revenue from its timber sales while timber sale costs are funded by Congressional appropriation.</P><P>     In 1930 it cost the Forest Service 50 cents per thousand board feet to hold a timber sale. So the Forest Service wrote a rule specifying that 50 cents be returned to the Treasury for every thousand board feet. The 50-cents rule still applies - but today the average sale costs over $50 per thousand board feet.</P><P>     So while the taxpayer pays a timber sale's costs (overhead, planning, road construction, etc.), the Forest Service keeps the bulk of the proceeds. There is virtually no direct connection between income and expense. And if the Forest Service is the budget maximizer its chief suggests, the incentive is to maximize timber sale volume, not net value, and therefore receipts. In this way the Forest Service's budget will rise once when Congress appropriates sale funds and then again when sale receipts are received.</P><P>     As a result, according to forest economist Randal O'Toole, 90 percent of our national forests lose money on their timber-sale programs. This costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars annually.</P><P>     There is another reason why so many sales occur: There are 122 National Forests in 40 states. The Treasury is required to pay 25 percent of the proceeds of each timber sale to local communities. Congressmen put political pressure on the Forest Service to hold sales in their districts, seeking to funnel dollars back home. Tellingly, Puerto Rico (with no vote in Congress) has the only national forest without a timber-sale program.</P><P>     Congress often passes Forest Service appropriation bills specifying harvest levels, often above even what the Forest Service recommends. These timber sales are pork barrel projects. Over time this creates communities dependent upon Forest Service welfare. As people developed stakes in this system, meaningful reform became increasingly difficult.</P><P>     We can see why the Forest Service hosts so many below-cost sales. They provide its life blood, money, as well as a pipeline for Congressional pork. Not that all Forest Service personnel are willing accomplices in a grand scheme to defraud the taxpayer. Why are &quot;good&quot; managers so often captured and co-opted by this budgeting process? Below-cost timber sales provide funding to support the Forest Service's other work, like habitat management.</P><P>     But the result is that the taxpayer gets nothing for something, subsidizing clearcuts that are seldom environmentally friendly. Al Gore states in his book Earth in the Balance, &quot;As the world's leading exemplar of free-market economics, the U.S. has a special obligation to discover effective ways of using the power of market forces to help save the environment.&quot; Market approaches to Forest Service problems can illuminate reform. We can recognize the advantages of private sector timber management. It strives for efficiency. Private firms harvest only timber that can pay its way out of the woods. Concurrently, we recognize the need to develop the environmental sensitivity of private firms.</P><P>     If the Forest Service is to salvage its reputation, it must move toward economic responsibility. The elimination of incentives to hold below-cost sales is a good first step. Make the Forest Service fund timber sales only out of net timber sale receipts. No more incentives to lose money, and no incidental environmental harm in the bargain. Only good people and good incentives can fix the Forest Service.</P><P>_____________</P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

BADEN</P><P>           First of a series of articles on the Forest Service and the economics of the timber industry.</P><P>  IN the fifth grade I started a conservation club for my school. To me, the U.S. Forest Service epitomized conservation and stewardship. Rangers maintained trails, practiced ecology, and found lost hikers while Smokey the Bear admonished us to put out our campfires and appreciate the outdoors.</P><P>     But today we hear that behind the popular symbols is an agency that suffers predictable bureaucratic and political pathologies. We learn that the Forest Service, once a symbol of good government, actually fosters waste and environmental destruction.</P><P>     The Forest Service was founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1905. He initially promised that after a &quot;modest&quot; investment by Congress, the forests would pay for themselves. That has never been true because Forest Service decisions have always been biased by political pressures and budgeting. The deceptions have multiplied to the point that a group of disgruntled employees have set up a watchdog group, the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics (AFSEEE). Its members critique and seek reform of Forest Service policies.</P><P>     The thrust of their, criticism, and that of others, is this: 109 of 122 of the National Forests lose money on their timber sale programs. In doing so they sacrifice the environment and non-timber values of the land. Alaska's Tongass National Forest exemplifies these problems.</P><P>     The Tongass is the largest National Forest, encompassing 16.9 million, acres. It is best known for its temperate old-growth rain forest. This ecosystem has a diverse understory of plants and brush, which provides habitat for bears, owls and wolves, as well as a variety of landmarks including Admiralty Island National Monument.</P><P>     Through massive subsidies, the Tongass is a large supplier of pulp wood and saw timber. While stumpage in the Northwest sells for hundreds of dollars per thousand board feet, in the Tongass it brings under $10 per thousand. Yet the costs of simply administering the timber sales and building the roads is about $56 per thousand. Absent the subsidy, private companies could not harvest such timber. But with the Forest Service footing the bulk of the bill, they do.</P><P>     In the 1950s the Forest Service signed two 50-year contracts to provide logs from the Tongass for two local mills. These contracts oblige the Forest Service to provide highly subsidized timber, up to 300 million board/feet per year, solely to keep the two mills in business. This is regardless of cost, market conditions or the ability of the Tongass to regenerate the timber. So far, over eight billion board feet of timber has been cut and sold for a loss.</P><P>     Under the contracts, the mills are also able to request &quot;emergency rate redeterminations&quot; of contract prices if the market price of milled lumber is inadequate to ensure  profitability. Thus, the mills are assured of a profit. The Tongass returned over $15 million dollars to the mills in 1991 as a refund for &quot;overpayment&quot; in previous years.</P><P>     And, of course, as environmentalists point out, the Forest Service ignores many of logging's cost. Habitat destroyed. Streams and spawning beds silted up by runoff. Sublime forests clearcut. This harms both wildlife and local economies. Healing may take decades.</P><P>     Recently, the Forest Service asked some of its biologists to report on such impacts in the Tongass. The biologists concluded that numerous species would be displaced unless logging were scaled back. But the biologists' supervisors saw a threat to budgets dependent upon timber harvests. They suppressed the report. This is the bureaucratic logic of the former Soviet Union - and the resultant problems are similar.</P><P>     The well-intentioned people of AFSEEE have not been able to change the Forest Service. I have known many people, including some of my best students, who have gone on to work for the Forest Service. Yet little changes. Why do basically good people do bad things?</P><P>       The answer is that with bad incentives, good intentions will not suffice. And the &quot;Forest Soviet's&quot; bureaucratic imperatives continually filter out threatening information. Norman Maclean, author of A River Runs Through It, describes these responses in his last book, Young Men and Fire, telling of Forest Service cover-ups and obfuscation in the deaths of 12 Smokejumpers in a 1949 forest fire.</P><P>     This same process inhibits evolutionary responses to our increasing knowledge of forest ecology and America's changing tastes and values. To prevent such episodes, fundamental reform is required. Personnel changes are not enough. Newcomers will face the same political pressures and antiquated structures. The goals of ecological sensitivity and economic efficiency have yet to be achieved by government bureaucracy.</P><P>     Without proper incentives, reform will fail. There is hope. It lies with alternatives based upon new ways to use property rights and market incentives. With them, we can harmonize economical timber production with environmental goals.</P><P>_______________ </P><P> John A.

Baden</P><P>ECONOMIES are like ecosystems in that everything is tied to everything else. We cannot do only one thing. Protecting owls by limiting timber harvest has multiple consequences, mostly unintended. People anticipate outcomes, estimate how regulations affect their security and livelihood, and often change their behavior accordingly.</P><P>       Regulations that ignore this interconnectedness can make matters worse, despite good intentions. For example, giving people orders seems cheaper than creating positive incentives for them to cooperate, especially if the order limits what people can do rather than taking physical possession of their property. But we should be extremely careful because over the long run, &quot;takings&quot; are expensive. At a minimum, they erode faith in government's most important role: the fair protector of social life.</P><P>     Most people agree that forests are environmentally and economically important. This is why there are strong pressures to impose regulations preserving watersheds, ecosystems, biodiversity and other forest values. But these restrictions do not come free. They may be worth the price they exact but we should recognize that they impose substantial costs upon owners, society and even ecosystems. As John Muir taught us more than a century ago, everything is tied to everything else.</P><P>     In the Douglas fir region of the Northwest a landowner typically invests $300 to $500 per acre preparing the soil, planting it and tending the seedlings until they are established. This investment generates nothing until the first commercial thinning perhaps 25 to 35 years later. In Western Washington a landowner would normally have the final cut 50 to 75 years after planting. Some owners prefer older stands and keep timber standing long after it is economically mature.</P><P>     Restrictive regulations, or the mere prospect of such regulations, reduce or eliminate the owner's future security. Without the certainty that they can harvest their trees a generation or two later, or sell to someone who can, landowners have weaker incentives to be good stewards. Trees are likely to be cut prematurely and the land converted to non-forestry use. This is happening throughout the Northwest today.</P><P>     Throughout the 1980s, small woodlands owners in Washington obtained about 8,000 permits to cut their timber. That rose 50 percent by 1990 and preliminary estimates by the Washington Farm Forestry Association suggest an additional 50 percent increase by 1993. Money and fear, a powerful combination, are two important reasons for this increase.</P><P>     First, let's consider money. Today, owners see extraordinarily high prices for timber from private lands. Concern for the spotted owl dramatically reduced the timber available from federal lands, shifting demand to private and state forests. Until recently, prices in the export market have been high. Finally, low interest rates have substantially increased new home construction and hence demand for forest products. Each factor contributes to higher log prices and stronger incentives to harvest timber.</P><P>     Fear is also important, particularly the fear that if timber is not sold now, it will be impossible to sell later. This fear seems justified to many people who were counting on their timber as an investment, perhaps for retirement. There are many horror stories in the media and far more floating around rural cafes of people whose &quot;nest egg&quot; has been cracked by restrictive regulations. This gives landowners very strong incentives to cut while they still can.</P><P>     Likewise, if timber mills fear that logs won't be available later, their buildings and equipment will decline in value and may become essentially worthless. They have incentives to run as long as they cover their out-of-pocket costs and just a smidgen more and wear out their capital. This fear causes them to buy logs at higher prices than could be sustained over the long run.</P><P>     Forestry is quite different when people are secure in their holdings. Most important, people secure in their rights can prudently look ahead 35 to 60 years. When their rights to harvest in the future are secure, there are many things that landowners will often do to increase yields. For example, people can plant expensive but genetically improved seedlings, and thin, prune and fertilize. These practices can increase productivity per acre over 50 percent. This means fewer acres will be cut.</P><P>     At the minimum, concern over regulatory &quot;takings&quot; causes rational people to dramatically reduce their investment in yield-enhancing efficiency. In addition, when productive forestry practices are reduced on private lands in the United States, more trees will be cut elsewhere. According to U.C. Berkeley forestry professor W.J. Libby, we will lose 49 species for every 25,000 acres of rain forest cut. To the degree that demand is shifted to tropical rain forests, some species will go extinct. Also, as wood supplies are constrained, substitutes with greater environmental impacts will displace wood products, e.g., steel studs in house construction.</P><P>     Actions have consequences, in ecosystems and markets. Regulatory &quot;takings&quot; of private property will encourage behavior that defeats our environmental goals and strengthens opposition to environmental reforms. We should consider the reality of unintended consequences when designing environmental reforms. </P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

Gingrich plan puts focus on Clinton
</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>By Donald Lambro<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>

<BR><DD>Republican leaders, decrying "the looming Clinton
recession," are crafting a legislative agenda for the campaign
year that focuses on economic growth, jobs, incomes and some
issues favored by social conservatives.
<BR><DD>GOP leaders on
Feb. 23 also began fine-tuning their message in an attempt to
better explain how their party's proposed budget and tax cuts
can help average working-class voters worried about a
declining economy.
<BR><DD>House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who
has been keeping a low profile during the early rounds of the
Republican primary fights, laid out the new message Feb. 23 in
a memorandum to GOP leaders that sought to ally his party
with growing voter anxiety and anger over job losses and
stagnant or falling incomes.
<BR><DD>"In the first caucus and
primary votes of 1996, the American electorate reminds us
clearly that the failing Clinton economy has short-changed
American workers and their families. Republicans understand
this anger," Mr. Gingrich said.
<BR><DD>Last year Republicans
passed tax and spending cuts to "allow families to keep more
of their hard-earned income" and to spur economic expansion
and job creation, he said. But in the end these and other
reforms to strengthen the economy "died at the tip of Bill
Clinton's veto pen."
<BR><DD>Haley Barbour, Republican National
Committee chairman, also attacked Mr. Clinton's economic
record Feb. 23, saying the "looming Clinton recession" was the
result of the president's decision to raise taxes in 1993 and
increase government regulations. "No wonder wages are
stagnant -- the government got your pay raise. It's no surprise
there are fewer jobs; the government is soaking up most of the
money that could be used for job creation," he said in a speech
to the Conservative Political Action Conference.
<BR><DD>"The
growing Clinton recession -- with its wage stagnation and
economic insecurity -- is the result of Clinton's high-tax,
big-government policies," he said.
<BR><DD>The combined
RNC-House Republican attacks are part of a new, coordinated
strategy to maintain a drumbeat of attacks on the White House
and the Democrats "from now until the November elections,"
GOP officials said.
<BR><DD>"Our message got lost last year in
the budget negotiations. We did not effectively explain what
our reforms would mean to average Americans. We need to
make sure that doesn't happen this year," said a senior House
GOP official.
<BR><DD>Mr. Gingrich's broadside came at a time of
increasing division and debate among the GOP presidential
candidates over the party's message, and increasing evidence
that GOP primary voters are responding to the economic
anxiety issues that Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes have raised
in their campaigns.
<BR><DD>The Gingrich memorandum came as
welcome news to his GOP colleagues in the House, who have
been urging him to speak out much more forcefully against Mr.
Clinton and the Democrats to counter the primary fights that
have been dividing his party.
<BR><DD>"I'm glad he's speaking
out, finally. We need his voice in this debate about where we're
going," said Rep. Helen Chenoweth, a freshman Republican from
Idaho.
<BR><DD>Mr. Gingrich and his chief deputies continued to
work late last month on a new legislative strategy and a
stronger marketing plan aimed at highlighting policy
differences with Mr. Clinton in the campaign, especially
economic policy.
<BR><DD>His party's case for tax cuts and
fiscal reforms to spur economic growth was bolstered Feb. 23
by new government statistics showing the economy grew by
only 0.9 percent during the last three months of 1995. He also
acknowledged that the GOP has not done a good job of
connecting with the economic concerns of middle-class
families.
<BR><DD>"We must be prepared to communicate our
response to legitimate voter anger in a clearer and more
forceful manner than we have done so far," the speaker
said.
<BR><DD>"We are with the American people now and will
produce legislation that addresses their concerns throughout
the spring and summer."
<BR><DD>GOP officials who attended Mr.
Gingrich's strategy meetings last month said they were
focusing their agenda for the rest of the year on issues that
would "get the economy moving," create jobs and improve
incomes. Most of the agenda will be drawn from the "Contract
With America," including tax and budget cuts, curbs on
entitlements, and regulatory relief for
businesses.
<BR><DD>Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the GOP's
chief deputy whip, was assigned to develop a "market-driven"
health care reform plan that will include medical savings
accounts and provisions to allow workers to keep their health
care protection when they change jobs.
<BR><DD>"We want to
make sure that middle-class Americans can get health
insurance if they lose their job. We'll probably bring it up
before this summer," Mr. Hastert said.

Baden</P><P>1995 will be the silver anniversary of Earth Day. This will be a significant event, for it marks a full generation since we formally recognized our environment's fragility and value. To celebrate the anniversary, I suggest that we begin a campaign to buy Siberia. This would be America's Earth Day present to the world. Buying Siberia was suggested by Walter Mead, a researcher who has traveled in the region and noted the vast scale of environmental destruction caused by insensitive development of natural resources.</P><P>       Earth Day celebrations usually blend pantheism and pontification. There is much blame-fixing, but little careful analysis of the causes of environmental problems. On Earth Day, many greens are carried away by their enthusiasm and identify corporate greed and individualism as our problems. If everyone could purge greed from their hearts, become informed, and commune with earth spirits, all might be well.</P><P>     My approach is quite different. I focus on the critical shortage - lack of good institutional arrangements. If we buy Siberia we can replace its existing institutions, legacies of socialism and corruption, with institutions that harmonize environmental responsibility and economic progress. Like Yellowstone Park, the world's first national park, this can be America's environmental gift to the world.</P><P>     Just as the United States bought Alaska from Russia in 1867, so we could buy Siberia in 1995. We know enough to avoid past mistakes. After the U.S. bought Alaska it made the mistakes common throughout the American West; it gave government bureaucracies and perverse laws control over the land. The results are clear. The Forest Service, Park Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, and the Mining Law of 1872 fostered abuse of the West's land, water and wildlife.</P><P>     Today, the Forest Service subsidizes destructive logging in the Rocky Mountain states, Park Service mismanagement turns Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain National Parks into overgrazed, simplified ecosystems, the Bureau of Reclamation supports dams that lose money and destroy salmon runs, and the Mining Law of 1872 continues the primacy of mining over other values.</P><P>     Siberia resembles the American West of a century ago - a sparsely inhabited, resource-rich frontier. Siberia's 3.5 million-plus square miles are home to fewer than 15 million people and contain enormous reserves of oil, natural gas, gold, diamonds and timber. Siberia also houses environmental treasures such as Lake Baikal, the deepest lake in the world and an ancient ecosystem; diverse taiga forests of cedar, fir, pine and spruce; endangered species like the Siberian tiger, and dozens of free-flowing rivers.</P><P>     Like the American West of the 1800s, Siberia's environment is threatened by reckless economic development. Lake Baikal and the Angara River are dying from pollution, soil erosion is destroying agricultural land, air pollution is poisoning the people, and toxic mining wastes are simply dumped.</P><P>     Russia lacks the technology, expertise and will to protect environmental values. Poverty and hardship encourage extensive logging, mining and drilling with little thought for the long-term consequences. With many resources located in fragile environments, irresponsible development would be disastrous.</P><P>     Recognizing the threat, some environmentalists advocate creating a huge Siberian wilderness area, off-limits to development. Such proposals reflect self-delusion and intellectual naivete. Surging world demand for natural resources and Russians' desire for development make resource development inevitable. The only questions are: at what environmental costs and for whose benefit?</P><P>       Since we could not halt development even if we wanted to, sincere environmentalists have to foster institutions that will ensure ecologically friendly development. Federal management has failed miserably on the public lands of the United States. Responsible management by the nonprofit and for-profit sectors provides the path to responsible greenness. This requires institutions that provide incentives to consider ecology and community as well as economic values.</P><P>     I recommend we create a public, quasi-governmental corporation to purchase Siberia from Russia. The federal government could legitimize the enterprise and perhaps guarantee the bonds used to raise the cash. After an ecological inventory, the corporation would sell some land (with environmental easements and covenants) to companies and private individuals. The rest would be held as a public resource by environmental trusts modeled after the Nature Conservancy, but not managed by politicians or government bureaucrats.</P><P>     Development would be limited in environmentally sensitive areas. There would be no subsidies for economic development or extractive activities. For example, mining rights would not be subsidized as they currently are in the United States by the Mining Law of 1872. Restoration bonds would hold polluters responsible for any environmental damage they cause. This is necessary to constrain industrial emissions and dumps. Development could be prohibited in irreplaceable environmental areas, places like Lake Baikal, an ecological analog to Yellowstone Park.</P><P>     At the same time, environmentally sensitive development efforts would be encouraged, with the developers liable for any damages they cause. This requires clear and enforceable property rights. Finally, land use would be taxed at rates reflecting its actual use, rather than its most financially valuable potential use. This would eliminate the pressures to develop land in order to meet tax obligations.</P><P>     By creating legally enforceable incentives for nongovernmental landowners to responsibly develop Siberian resources we create a situation in which many good things go together: economic progress for local populations, resources for the world, but most important, development with environmental sensitivity. This example could be an Earth Day present for the world.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

BADEN</P><P>           THE RECENT forest conference in Portland was, as expected, both well-attended and highly publicized. The scene, however, was more impressive than was the substance. Virtually nothing was resolved.</P><P>       Unfortunately, this is a predictable consequence of political decision-making. And the conference's politicking and posturing overshadowed that week's true environmental milestone: the inaugural sale of pollution rights by the Chicago Board of Trade.</P><P>     Economists had long awaited this event. It initiated an efficient strategy to reduce pollution from powerplants and factories.</P><P>     The theory is straightforward: Government sets an acceptable overall emissions level for a pollutant, in this case the sulfur dioxide emitted by electrical utilities and factories. It then creates tradable permits and gets out of the way to let the market process produce the best way to achieve the reductions.</P><P>     From 1995 onward, industrial plants must have an allowance to emit sulfur dioxide. The government grants pollution allowances to plants based upon their emissions history. For example, those which emitted an average of 100 tons over the past four years were given grandfathered permits for 75 tons in 1995. (The amount drops to 50 tons in the year 2000.) Each grandfathered permit was subtracted from the national emissions limit. The remainder were then auctioned to the highest bidder by the Chicago Board of Trade.</P><P>     This system has highly positive environmental and economic implications. First, it encourages utilities to find the most efficient way to comply with the law. They may either buy permits at auction or find money-saving ways to cut emissions. A highly successful plant may be able to cut emissions for less than the going price of an emissions permit. It can then cut pollution further, selling or retiring its extra permits.</P><P>     The result is a market which provides incentives for innovative pollution-control techniques. The emitters with the lowest cost of control will reduce their emissions the most. Those who find ways to emit less save money, just what our environmentally conscious nation increasingly desires.</P><P>     The early results seem promising. Illinois Power Company expects to save at least $250 million over the next 20 years by buying permits as opposed to building a new scrubber. But this is not an increase in pollution. Rather, it is a transfer, for a utility somewhere must now emit less. So Illinois ratepayers save money, the nation moves toward its emissions goals, and the government raises revenues by selling permits.</P><P>     In future years the total number of permits offered, and hence the amount of pollution, will be reduced. Illinois Power will continually reassess its emissions costs and control strategies. It may even build a new scrubber. But the expectation is that, when faced with options and competitive pricing of permits, companies will find innovative, and less expensive, ways to reduce their own emissions. So we all get a cleaner environment at lower cost.</P><P>     And since anybody can bid on permits, the system also enables those who most value clean air to enter the market. At least one environmental group, National Healthy Air Exchange, bids on permits, hoping to buy and &quot;retire&quot; them.</P><P>     Northeast Utilities donated 10,000 tons of its 140,000-ton annual allowance to the American Lung Association. Eastern coal miners may buy some to package with their &quot;dirty,&quot; or high-sulfur, coal, and hence save their jobs.</P><P>     These are just some of the possibilities created by tradable permits. Environmental and business entrepreneurs will surely find more. This process unleashes the innovation and creativity which make markets such successful institutions.</P><P>     This sale also illustrates another advantage of market-based environmental solutions: The sale was not the lead story on the evening news. Market solutions promote adjustment and compromise without political grandstanding and public recriminations.</P><P>     In an honest market, there is no angling for a favorable exemption from clean-air laws, no political payoffs for special treatment. The market solves the social problem of distribution efficiently, at low cost and with minimum fuss.</P><P>     As President Clinton grapples with conflicts over old-growth forests, he should learn from the example offered by the Chicago Board of Trade. Markets can be harnessed to help the environment, perhaps through a national biodiversity trust fund which would buy habitat and development rights to important ecosystems.</P><P>     Our president may be the best political salesman in history. Surely if the Chicago Board of Trade can get people to buy pollution, President Clinton can devise ways to sell the spotted owl's recovery. </P><P>_____________</P><P>John A.

Baden</P><P>Some of the questions raised in this column are addressed in FREE's forthcoming book, &quot;Environmental Gore: A Constructive Response to Earth in the Balance.&quot;</P><P>  THE global warming debate, like many environmental issues, is scientifically complex and highly emotional. Its complexity hinders informed debate and its emotionalism makes consensus elusive. Part of the problem is that climatology (the discipline dealing most directly with global climate issues) is a young and inexact science. But much of the problem can be traced to special interest's manipulation of the political process.</P><P>     Contrary to conventional wisdom, many fundamental questions about global warming remain unanswered. Two crucial questions are: 1) Is significant human-induced global warming actually occurring? 2) If it is occurring, will the net effects be beneficial or harmful? In neither case is the answer an unambiguous &quot;yes.&quot;</P><P>       First, significant global warming may not be occurring. Certainly, the historical relationship between CO and temperature changes is ambiguous. Although levels of atmospheric CO have risen nearly 40 percent since the turn of the century, data from within the United States indicates no statistically significant increase in mean annual temperatures. In fact, between 1920 and 1987, there was a slight cooling trend.</P><P>     Data also indicates that the rise in hemispheric temperature has been significantly less than expected given the increase in CO. And the region most likely to see temperature increases, the Arctic, has actually cooled since about l940.</P><P>     Furthermore, the climate models used to predict warming depend on numerous unknowns. For example, we do not know how changes in cloud cover will affect global temperatures. Although the models agree that a warmer earth is likely to be a cloudier earth, it is unknown whether more clouds will cool the planet by reflecting sunlight or warm the planet by trapping re-radiated heat before it escapes into space. The net effect is unclear. Neither do the models explain the impact of temperature changes on polar ice and snow. A warmer climate may increase precipitation and produce more ice and snow in colder areas. This would increase the earth's albedo and cool the planet.</P><P>     The empirical and theoretical uncertainties surrounding global warming counsel caution before making policy. Scientists are certainly being cautious; a Feb. 13, 1992 Gallup poll shows that most climate scientists doubt there has been any significant human-caused global warming to date.</P><P>     But even if global warming does occur, it is unlikely to be a catastrophe. Robert Balling, director of the Office of Climatology at Arizona State University, and Richard Lindzen, Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at M.I.T., conclude that doubling atmospheric CO is likely to produce an average global temperature increase of approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This, increase is likely to be most significant at night, at high latitudes, and during the winter. It will not melt polar ice caps nor raise sea levels more than a few inches. There will not be super-hurricanes and there will not be endless summers of blazing temperatures.</P><P>     In fact, there are many benefits associated with increased atmospheric CO. Doubling CO levels will favor bigger plants and may increase average crop yields by an estimated 33 percent. More atmospheric CO allows plants to grow using less water by reducing evapotranspiration - water evaporating after it is released from plants' pores. Precipitation and soil moisture may rise, and droughts may become less frequent.</P><P>     Amidst the uncertainties, one thing is certain: Some groups benefit if the public believes global warming is a genuine crisis that can only be stopped with massive political mobilization. Irresponsible efforts by these groups fuel fears of widespread drought and crop failures, of super powerful hurricanes, of oceans engulfing coastal cities, and of blazing summer temperatures. How do they gain by hyping global warming?</P><P>        For environmental groups, global warming is the ultimate issue. It affects everyone, it is dramatic and thus captures the public's attention, and it can only be solved by mobilizing government to impose regulations and develop programs. For those environmentalists hostile toward industrial civilization, global warming provides a rationale to impose their version of ecotopia. The threat of global warming gives license to those who seek to profit from crises.</P><P>     Insurance companies may also gain from government efforts to control global warming. Insurers are motivated more by profits than ideology. If global warming causes increased hurricane damage or floods, they may lose immense amounts of money. Massive carbon taxes or regulation may halt warming and their losses. Since they as taxpayers will pay only a trivial portion of any regulatory bill, it is reasonable for them to seek such measures. If global warming never manifests, they lose little, but society loses a lot.</P><P>     When making decisions and facing uncertainty, responsible people evaluate the most likely costs and benefits of alternative strategies. Given our current understanding, the changes wrought by global warming may well bring small costs or perhaps benefits. Massive prevention programs will surely be expensive, they will slow economic progress worldwide. Moreover, delaying action for a few years, while our understanding of climate change improves, is likely to lead to more prudent policies. If substantial warming is going to occur, a few years delay will make very little difference.</P><P>     The global warming debate is far from settled. In deciding what to do, we should consider both the merits of the arguments and the possibility that they are being manipulated for hidden agendas. If we do not, we are likely to be stampeded into public policies with huge immediate costs and few if any benefits.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

GOP: NOT COLORBLIND
</h2>
<h3>
Robert D. Novak

<i>July 15, 1996</i>

</center>

<dd>SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- It is not just presidential candidate Robert J. 
Dole who has backed away from the drive to end racial preferences in 
California. So has the national Republican establishment.
<P>
<dd>House Speaker Newt Gingrich has publicly recommended that Dole not 
actively campaign for the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) to bar 
government affirmative action programs that practice racial 
discrimination. Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour has been 
lukewarm. Jack Kemp has all but opposed the initiative. 
<P>
<dd>So have leaders of giant California-based corporations, whose 
pocketbooks are open to Dole but not CCRI. Fund-raising efforts beyond 
the state's borders have flopped, with normally conservative money 
sources in New York saying no. 
<P>
<dd>In contrast, actively and financially aligned in opposition to the initiative 
are the education establishment, organized labor, the Democratic Party, 
minority-group activists and assorted foundations. "Everyone is against 
us," Ward Connerly, a University of California regent and CCRI state 
chairman, told me. "Everybody but the people." 
<P>
<dd>That is an exaggeration. California Republicans such as State GOP 
Chairman John Herrington, Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle and 
especially Gov. Pete Wilson are solidly supportive. But the real push for 
a colorblind system does come from the public, holding steady at 65 
percent in some polls.
<P>
<dd>Given that popularity, why would Dole back away from CCRI? Arnie 
Steinberg, the veteran political operative managing the proposal, blames 
"country-club Republicans." 
<P>
<dd>One of California's leading corporate executives, a conservative 
Republican, cannot speak on the record because his company has not 
decided whether to oppose CCRI. But he defined his personal views: "If 
we do away with affirmative action, what happens to these young people? 
I worry about the third big riot in Los Angeles."
<P>
<dd>Similar concern was expressed by George Deukmejian, former two-term 
Republican governor of California, when he declined to support the 
initiative and then told of his epiphany. Since he now has to drive his 
own car through the racially diverse streets of Los Angeles, he perceives 
a dangerously "fragile" city.
<P>
<dd>Such talk infuriates Sacramento management consultant Connerly, an 
African-American who contends that big businessmen are seeking 
government protection for their own racial preference policies. He points 
to last month's Los Angeles Times poll of the city's voters showing 69 
percent support for CCRI, including 56 percent from blacks and 68 
percent from Hispanics. He considers absurd the danger of underclass 
blacks rioting because they want to go to Berkeley and demeaning the 
notion that African-Americans can get there only with special 
preferences. 
<P>
<dd>Connerly, who became a Republican in the late 1960s when he observed 
then Gov. Ronald Reagan upholding the rights of the individual, mourns 
the lost political opportunity. A Dole delegate to the GOP national 
convention, Connerly wants his candidate to use this popular issue to 
erase the California gap between him and Bill Clinton. One of the 
president's managers here says privately that while he must oppose CCRI, 
the less Clinton says about it, the better.
<P>
<dd>But it was Dole on his last California visit who ignored CCRI, and 
Connerly privately took issue with him. The response came from Dole's 
wife, Elizabeth, who asked what the initiative would do to "outreach" 
programs. Nothing, Connerly replied, so long as there are no racial 
preferences. But, she persisted, what about "compensatory outreach," 
such as she practiced as secretary of labor?  That suggested the thinking 
of the Doles was frozen in outmoded cliches.
<P>
<dd>Dole's agents ambiguously assure CCRI that he will be aboard the effort. 
When Wilson telephoned Gingrich to protest his contrary advice to Dole, 
the speaker told the governor he would help raise funds for the initiative. 
But skepticism abounds about promises from Washington. "I have never 
in my life been lied to so much and double-crossed so often," Steinberg 
told me.
<P>
<dd>Connerly describes CCRI this way: "This is a defining issue between 
Dole and Clinton. It is the right thing to do, good for the country, good 
for the party. If an incompetent Republican Party cannot understand this, 
it deserves its fate." He is implying that whether Dole ends his retreat on 
a colorblind society may determine not only whether he carries California 
but whether he deserves to.

Baden</P><P>MANY people share my deep concern with improving and protecting the wildlife, watersheds, and recreation values of forests. Good policy links these goods with sound economic practices. All require landowners' confidence in the future. The proposed export ban on raw logs from private lands subverts this confidence and undermines the management required to reach these goals.</P><P>       Proponents of the export ban claim it will save jobs and prevent foreign exploitation of our timber resources. These claims reflect poor thinking or personal interests promoted at the public's expense, not legitimate economic, ethical or environmental arguments.</P><P>     A ban on private log exports has several important, negative effects. It undermines the value of private stands of trees. A ban reduces the prices bid for raw logs and the timber's value. Private owners fear that future laws or regulations may further reduce the value of their timber. Owners and exporters who suffer a politically induced loss today are wary about the possibility of future losses. Hence an export ban shortens investors' time horizons.</P><P>     Trees take a long time to become harvestable; 50 to 100 years is common. Many of us prefer even older forests for we want forests to produce old-growth values. This is what Jerry Franklin and Jack Ward Thomas' &quot;New Forestry&quot; is about: managing forests to resemble old growth.</P><P>     If someone is to invest money, effort and time growing and preserving trees for a lifetime or longer, they need strong assurances that their timber's value will not be reduced by unexpected government intervention. The value of their land depends on expectations of the future value of their trees.</P><P>     Lower timber values immediately reduce people's incentives to preserve and grow timber. Mere talk of a ban could induce some people to log immediately, just as the possibility of endangered species moving to a landowner's land leads many to destroy suitable habitat. A desire to leave the timber market could encourage the rapid conversion of timberland close to cities to residential or commercial use.</P><P>     Moreover, if owners fear for the future, they plant short-rotation monocultures, trees such as cottonwood and eucalyptus that can be harvested for fiber in 10 years or less. By reducing the time between planting and harvest, they reduce the risk of new, unfavorable laws. A ban thus helps promote monocultures and shorter harvest rotations. Do proponents of an export ban really want this?</P><P>        The incentives an export ban creates for timber owners have significant environmental consequences. The public goods associated with long-rotation forests - complex ecosystems, wildlife habitat, biodiversity and aesthetics - will be reduced. We can also expect increased soil erosion, stream siltation and damaged salmon runs.</P><P>     It is important to remember that the most sensitive and valuable ecosystems - those found in old-growth forests - are largely confined to the national forests and parks. Raw log exports from federal forestland have been banned for 25 years. Most private lands harbor second- and third-growth forests. We want their owners to have the means and incentive to adopt ecologically friendly new forestry. An export ban has the opposite impact.</P><P>     A ban will also induce Japan to import more logs from Third World nations that have less stringent environmental protections than the United States. Increasing the demand for their timber is likely to increase environmental damage abroad. Do environmentalists really wish to increase environmental pressures in places with weak democratic institutions and ineffective environmental protections?</P><P>        The employment impact of an export ban, much like the environmental consequences, is sometimes misunderstood. Raw log exports cost few, if any, U.S. jobs. Instead, they create many high-paying jobs in export-related industries such as ocean shipping and inland rail. In addition, the premium foreign timber consumers pay for raw logs is additional money injected into the U.S. economy. Nor are bans likely to protect mill jobs. For example, the 1979 ban of red cedar exports failed to halt a decline in Washington cedar mills from 337 to 52.</P><P>     Raw log exports also lead to the purchase of forest products such as wooden doors and paneling. Raw logs introduce foreign consumers to the quality of U.S. products. The initial exposure builds contacts and leads to the purchase of our timber products. Commerce Department data reveals that processed products comprise 89 percent of the $17 billion market in U.S. forest products exports.</P><P>     Thus, neither economic theory nor historical experience supports the belief that a ban will preserve U.S. jobs. The Center for International Trade and Forestry's (CINTRAFOR) computer model, backed by 10 years of research, supports this criticism. Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and others who support the ban base their position on bad economics or expedient politics, not the public interest.</P><P>     A ban on exports has negative economic and environmental consequences. It contains disincentives to long-term forestry, to environmentally valuable habitat preservation, to jobs in the Northwest and elsewhere, and to increasing the sale of finished wood products in foreign markets. But most important, it erodes the ethical foundations of our society and political economy. The ethical problem alone is sufficient reason to strongly oppose the ban.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

BADEN</P><P>           THE election of Governor Clinton and Senator Gore alerts us to a new environmental movement. They claim to be seeking innovative and efficient ways to achieve environmental goals. For the past 20 years such an alternative approach has been developed. It may at last receive the attention in Washington that it has earned in universities and think tanks.</P><P>       It is called the New Resource Economics (the NRE). It is based upon incentives and voluntary action. It recognizes the role property rights and markets play in coordinating and rationing valuable resources.</P><P>     But other than professional analysts and economists, few people understand the logic or applications. Much of the writing has been scholarly and highly specialized, read only by graduate students under duress. Through this and future columns, I will attempt to bridge this gap between academia and the concerned citizen.</P><P>     Most people in the Northwest are familiar with the battles over timber, spotted owls, and salmon. Traditional lawmaking and regulatory schemes have yet to find productive, mutually acceptable solutions. But there is another way, a win-win approach. It can lead to more environmentally sensitive management. The focus is upon how information and incentives affect decision-makers. There is explicit recognition that differing institutional arrangements generate different incentives and therefore different management decisions.</P><P>     Our natural resources are managed by a variety of legal and economic institutions, including markets, private companies, nonprofit corporations and government. Each has different but predictable benefits and flaws. Markets can only work when we can establish clear and transferable property rights and do so at a low cost. Nonprofits have problems motivating and monitoring their staffs and volunteers. Governmental agencies suffer from bureaucratic inefficiency and often turn into captives of special interests and engines of plunder. When advocating environmental reforms we should recognize that no institutional form is perfect, and consider the information and incentives of each in terms of the goals.</P><P>     This care is required because good intentions are not enough. The forces of self-interest are relentless. Over the long run, if environmental reform is to be successful, our institutions must direct this individual self-interest to environmental quality.</P><P>     Last summer's revelations about political pressures on U.S. Forest Service and Park Service regional leaders are compelling testimonies to the importance of this focus. When our resource and environmental agencies are dependent upon politics, their leaders face incentives to yield to political pressures. When existing incentives remain constant, merely changing agency personnel to those more &quot;committed&quot; will not solve the problem. Only changing the institutions will produce lasting changes.</P><P>     Many of our existing institutions work against environmental stewardship. When decision-makers are insulated from the costs of their actions, or denied access to the benefits, problems follow.</P><P> For example, when individuals are not rewarded for preserving habitat, it is under-produced. When pollution is &quot;free,&quot; it is overproduced.</P><P>     Take the case of the Forest Service. Because it gets money from logging, not recreation, it is no surprise that it zealously promotes logging and road-building. A way to make the Forest Service more responsive to the public is to collect user fees from hikers, bikers, and campers. In a majority of National Forests, recreation could easily generate more net dollars than timber. And in areas where logging continues to be profitable, forest managers would face incentives to reduce its visual and environmental impact to retain their recreation income. In such ways, institutions can be arranged to make economic progress and environmental quality complementary.</P><P>       Private property and markets can be used to foster these mutually beneficial agreements and accommodations. For example, limited oil drilling allowed on the Rainey Preserve, an Audubon-owned migratory bird sanctuary in Louisiana, is an example of this. Oil companies compete to drill and produce in environmentally sensitive ways and Audubon gets royalties with which they expand sanctuaries. In a few more years the wells will be played out but the sanctuary will remain.</P><P>     Contrast this with oil exploration on government lands. Audubon raises money to fight such development. The NRE enables us to see why: By seeking to protect bird habitat on federal lands, Audubon signals environmental concern and generates income. However, it pays none of the opportunity costs of not exploiting that land.</P><P>     Good institutional arrangements, like Audubon's ownership of Rainey, make decision-makers responsible for both costs and benefits of an action, lessen political confrontation, and foster cooperation. Markets and property rights help weigh trade-offs. Because of political pressures, this is exceedingly difficult in government institutions.</P><P>     No institution is perfect, and a mix is required. But private property rights, incentives, voluntary action and entrepreneurial creativity are under-appreciated tools for the environmentalist. They foster the economic progress that encourages environmental concern and the capacity to act upon that concern. These are the features of this new approach that make it attractive to environmental economists and policy analysts. The question is whether the Clinton/Gore administration will demonstrate the political skills required to deliver the outcomes they claim to seek.</P><P>__________</P><P> John A.

BADEN</P><P>           IT is clear from the argument of protectionists in Congress that many are pessimistic about the future of U.S. manufacturing. But recent events suggest prudent optimism, if not unconstrained joy.</P><P> While not all good things go together, some do. Economic understanding can help us find such unions.</P><P>     Environmental leaders show this improved understanding of economics. They are becoming aware that prosperity and environmental quality are complements, not competitors. The anti-business, anti-market, pro-regulatory rhetoric that marked the environmental movement in the 1970s and '80s is being replaced with an acceptance of markets and an appreciation of the advantages of decentralized decision-making.</P><P>       Only a few years ago, many environmental leaders held up the centralized and socialized economies of Eastern Europe as environmentally superior to the market economies of the West. After all, some had constitutional guarantees of environmental quality.</P><P>     But after the revolutions of 1989, the truth seeped out. Chernobyl was only the most graphic example. Even the most committed collectivists had to admit that the systems they championed were economically inefficient, environmentally destructive and thoroughly corrupting.</P><P>     Further, there is increased understanding that only with international trade can nations and regions realize their comparative advantages and increase prosperity through efficiency. This is especially true of poor nations: They have the most to gain from free-trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is such a step toward Mexican prosperity. The argument that NAFTA will harm Mexico's environment discounts an important fact. That is, as poor nations become wealthy their health and environmental standards rise. This holds across time and cultures: richer is cleaner, safer and more environmentally sensitive.</P><P>     Looking across the Mexican border, we simply cannot expect Third World nations to have the standards of first world nations. They have different priorities: food, shelter, clothing. We see horrifying examples of environmental health and safety violations. What would be truly extraordinary would be the absence of this difference. In my judgment, if NAFTA is passed, both the Mexican and U.S. economies will become more productive and Mexican environmental standards will rise toward ours. NAFTA will ultimately &quot;level&quot; both the environmental and wage playing fields with Mexico.</P><P>     And most importantly, American manufacturers are moving up the learning curve in efficiently dealing with environmental regulations. The Amoco Corporation recently conducted a major research project, cosponsored by EPA, at their Yorktown refinery. It was a thorough effort to investigate the costs and effectiveness of current pollution-control structures.</P><P>     The costs of pollution control are significant. That is why we see battles in Congress every time there is an attempt to raise environmental standards. A green world costs money. Our government should do its best to minimize these costs, but the Yorktown project shows that this is not the case.</P><P>       Yorktown was the first systematic attempt to assess all refinery emissions: air, water, soil - and to put a price tag on their control. Historically, EPA has monitored emissions only from selected points, like smoke stacks and containment pools. The Yorktown project found that these are not necessarily the areas which should be controlled. For example, large emissions came from the loading dock, a place EPA has never before checked.</P><P>     The bottom line: Amoco could achieve greater pollution reduction for about $11 million than it is getting for the $41 million in controls specified by EPA. When pollution control is inexpensive, we want a lot of it. When we must give up a lot to get it, we want less. Environmentalists are learning to favor efficient control because in the end it will mean less pollution.</P><P>     This &quot;second battle of Yorktown&quot; has revolutionary potential. It clearly demonstrates that the regulatory command-and-control approach employed to control industrial pollution is seriously flawed. Political incentives make government management costly and inefficient. Agencies should simply set goals and monitor results rather than specify process. The Yorktown Project shows that this is likely to save money and result in lower pollution levels - just as economics predicts.</P><P>     Although it would take a replication of the Yorktown work at many sites to obtain good estimates of potential national savings, the findings of Yorktown seem typical of manufacturing in general. In other words, American manufacturing has potential of meeting high environmental standards at a very substantial discount from today's costs.</P><P>       The lesson here is that while much of American industry can do well in the global marketplace, current government regulations are obsolete. If we are truly concerned about international competitiveness and losing jobs to low-cost foreign competitors, we should seek efficiency wherever possible - even in our environmental regulations. Fortunately, it seems we can do this without sacrificing our health and environmental standards. Amoco and EPA have shown us a beginning. </P><P>__________</P><P>John A.

<TITLE>Foreword</TITLE>
<H2>Foreword</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>

<P>	Much has been made of the collapse of state socialism and the post-Cold War global march 
toward free markets. In reality, however, progress has been slow--and in some parts of the world 
nonexistent. Even today, as the authors show in the study that follows, only a relative handful of   countries--and we are blessed to be among them--have truly free economies. And some of them, our own 
included, are backsliding.
<P>	The recent shift in the congressional balance of power provides U.S. policymakers with one of 
those truly rare opportunities to rethink the way the United States government conducts its business. One 
area in which such a reexamination is long overdue is foreign aid.
<P>	As Admiral James W. Nance, senior Republican staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee told <I>The Washington Post</I> shortly after the 1994 congressional elections, the 
amount of money the United States has spent since 1947 on foreign aid equals more than one-third of the 
federal debt. Much of it has been wasted.
<P>	U.S. development aid should have one priority, and one priority only: promoting the kind of free 
market growth that will enable the recipient country to prosper <I>without</I> foreign aid. If U.S. aid 
does not promote free market capitalism and self-sufficiency, we need to ask the question: Why are we 
giving it?
<P>	The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> provides compeling evidence 
that economic prosperity and economic freedom go hand in hand. Lasting prosperity cannot exist in the 
absence of economic freedom; and a free economy inevitably results in economic growth and rising living 
standards.
<P>	If nothing else, the November 1994 elections reflected the U.S. public's dissatisfaction with 
business as usual. Well-intentioned programs that fail to accomplish their goals--and in some cases 
make matters worse--can no longer be tolerated. The U.S. foreign aid program is a classic example of 
this: good intentions gone awry.
<P>	While U.S. and global policymakers and opinion-leaders have rightly placed considerable 
emphasis over the years on political freedom, economic freedom has received scant attention. It's almost 
as if the policy community has determined that it doesn't matter. But it does matter. In fact, it is the key. 
If a country has a free economy, it can lift itself--and its people--out of poverty. We see this today in 
Asia, Latin America, and even in the early stages in parts of the former Soviet empire. We also see that 
economic freedom is a breeding ground for political freedom. South Korea, the Republic of China on 
Taiwan, Chile, and many other emerging markets provide vivid proof that economic prosperity depends on 
the opportunities created by a free economy, not on U.S. aid, the heavy hand of government planning, or 
even advanced infrastructure and abundant natural resources. Freedom is what counts most.
<P>	Former Treasury Secretary William Simon told me after reviewing a draft copy of <I>The Index 
of Economic Freedom</I> that it may well be the single most important publication ever published by 
The Heritage Foundation, surpassing even the best-selling <I>Mandate for Leadership</I> series which 
guided the Reagan Administration in the 1980s.

<TITLE>Preface</TITLE>
<H2> Preface</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P> Despite the near total collapse of socialism around the world, most countries still do not have free 
economies.  This is the main conclusion of the<I> Index of Economic Freedom,</I> a comparative study 
of economic freedom in the world.  The authors of the <I>Index</I>, Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, 
have discovered that most rich countries are also the most economically free.  Conversely, their research 
shows that most poor countries have economies that are unfree.  Thus, economic freedom is a critical 
factor in the relative wealth of nations.  The more government interferes in the market, the more it 
hampers economic growth and lowers the standard of living of its citizens.
<P>	These issues, though subject to academic study, have never been addressed in such a 
comprehensive manner. Thus, this report should lay to rest once and for all doubts about whether 
economic freedom is integral to economic development.  As the conclusions of this study show, there 
can be no doubt that the more free an economy is, the higher the likelihood of economic development.   
<P>	The idea of creating an index of economic freedom has been long in the making.  Milton 
Friedman and other economists for years have explored ways to measure the relative economic freedom 
of countries around the globe.  Groundbreaking work was done by the Fraser Institute and others to build 
the academic foundation upon which an index could be built.  However, in the mid-1980s analysts at The 
Heritage Foundation began thinking about ways to create an index that would be useful to policymakers, 
particularly with respect to allocating levels of foreign aid.  We were looking for a "user friendly" version 
of the index that could unambiguously show policymakers and investors the positive relationship between 
economic freedom and wealth.   
<P>	Thus was born The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I>, the first study of 
its kind.  It measures the economic freedom of over 100 countries according to the most important 
economic factors determining economic freedom, such as taxes, tariffs, and protection of private 
property.  Not all economic factors could or even should be examined.  Our task was to find accurate data 
for the most important factors, and then to provide the most comprehensive and accurate comparison 
possible. That is what the authors of the<I> Index</I> have done.  Avoiding paralyzing academic debates, 
the authors focus on what is known, and not on what can never be known.  The result is the most accurate 
snap-shot possible of how the countries of the world measure up to the standards of economic freedom.
<P>	There will be many uses for the <I>Index</I>.  Policymakers will find it helpful in determining 
whether Third World countries should be receiving foreign aid; that is, whether it will be squandered in 
economically unfree countries. They can discover that the main cause of poverty around the world is not 
the failure of rich countries to spread the wealth through foreign aid programs, but the misguided 
economic policies of developing countries themselves.  They also will find a paradox: The countries that 
appear to most need U.S. aid are the ones that least deserve it because their government-controlled 
economies will misuse the money.  By the same token, the countries that are least likely to squander U.S. 
aid because they have free economies are the countries that least need it.  Either way, there seems to be 
less of a need for so-called development aid.  The key to economic prosperity in the developing world is 
not foreign aid, but economic freedom.
<P>	Investors should find the<I> Index</I> to be useful as well.  While many countries are 
encouraging foreign investment through privatization and other means, and have more open economies 
than they did a few years ago, the report shows that the countries' economic "fundamentals" can be more 
important to investors than the strengths or weaknesses of particular companies or business sectors.  
These fundamentals include tax rates, the stability of the currency, trade policy, private property rights, 
and other factors considered by the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.
<P>	The<I> Index</I> should be a first stop for any investor who wishes to explore economic 
opportunities in a particular country or region. With the<I> Index</I>, economic trends can be discerned 
and regional comparisons can be made. While investment decisions always require in-depth and hands-on 
research by the companies themselves, the <I>Index</I> can be used as a starting point of research, 
particularly regarding investment decisions in developing countries.
<P>	Finally, the study should be an indispensable source of primary data and bibliographical 
references on the world's economies.  The authors use the most up-to-date information available.  They 
also have assembled an impressive bibliography that not only attests to the depth of their research, but can 
point other researchers in the right direction in their work.
<P>	Future editions of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> will enable readers to compare 
countries over time. Thus, trends in economic freedom will be established, which should be particularly 
useful to policymakers who are concerned with assessing the impact of foreign aid.
<P>	This report is a tremendously important undertaking of which I and the rest of the Heritage staff 
are justly proud.  It should show, once and for all, that economic freedom is no less important than 
political freedom.  As a human right which governments should be bound to protect, if for no other reason 
than concern for the general welfare of its citizens, economic freedom is a critically important key to the 
well-being of people.  It can be a measure not only of how free a person is, but of how rich or poor.  This 
is a powerful, even revolutionary idea.  If applied around the world, it could transform the world's 
economy.   It is in the hope that this report will contribute to that end that I present The Heritage 
Foundation's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.

<H2> Acknowledgments</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	We would like to express our appreciation to several individuals who helped to make the 
<I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> possible.  We thank Dr. Kim R. Holmes, Vice President and 
Director of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, who edited the study, 
and Larry Di Rita, his Deputy, for providing invaluable assistance and support for the project.  
Richard Odermatt and Tom Timmons bore the brunt of the<I> Index's</I> considerable 
production work.  Their good cheer was most welcome.  Rob Chase of the Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies staff was extremely helpful with managing data.  Dr. Edward L. Hudgins, now of the 
Cato Institute, deserves credit for laying much of the foundation of the <I>Index</I> several years 
ago while serving as Director of the Center for International Economic Growth at The Heritage 
Foundation. 
<P>	Countless individuals serving with various accounting firms, businesses, research organizations, 
U.S. government agencies, embassies in Washington, and other organizations cooperated in providing us 
with data.  Their assistance, which so often went beyond our expectations, is much appreciated.  
<P>	The contribution of two individuals deserves special attention.  Christian Asis and Rebecca 
Schaefer, participants in The Heritage Foundation's summer internship program, were indispensable to the 
development of the <I>Index</I>.  It was Christian and Becky who did the legwork, tracking down data 
while exercising excellent judgment in the process.  Their unfailing good spirit and commitment were 
exceptional.
<P>	We would like to thank the Fraser Institute of Vancouver and the many scholars who have 
participated in its Rating Economic Freedom Project for doing groundbreaking work on measuring 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>  
<P>	Finally, we are grateful for the advice and criticism from the experts who reviewed this study. 
Richard V. Allen, Dr. James B. Burnham, Dr. Stuart M. Butler, Nicholas Eberstadt, Dr. Leonid Grigoryev, 
Dr. Henry R. Nau, Thomas L. Rhodes, Dr. Gerald W. Scully, and Hon. William E. Simon all helped to 
make this a better book.
<P>	Of course, we alone bear responsibility for the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Therefore, 
any shortcomings belong to us.

<TITLE> Executive Summary </TITLE> 
<H2> Executive Summary</H2> 
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	The idea of producing a "user-friendly" Index of Economic Freedom for policymakers was born at  The Heritage Foundation in 1989.  The purpose then, as it remains today, was to develop an index that 
measures the extent of economic freedom in countries around the world.  To this end a set of objective 
economic criteria has been established to grade over 100 countries. While there are many theories about the origins and causes of economic development, the findings of this study are conclusive: those countries with the most economic freedom have higher rates of economic development than those with less economic freedom.
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom measures how well these countries score on a list of ten economic factors.  The higher the score, the more government interference in the economy (hence, the less economic freedom there is). The factors are: 
<UL><B>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>
4. Monetary Policy<BR>
5. Capital Flows and Foreign Investment<BR>
6. Banking Policy<BR>
7. Wage and Price Controls<BR>
8. Property Rights<BR>
9. Regulation<BR>
10. Black Market<BR>
</UL></B>
<P>	The study demonstrates unequivocally that countries with the highest level of economic freedom (the lowest Index score) also have the highest living standards (see following chart).  Likewise, countries that have the least amount of economic freedom (the highest Index score) have the lowest living standards.
<P>	A comparison of the Index scores also demonstrates an interesting phenomenon: wealthy and 
economically free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic freedom (see chart). As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare and other social programs that were not affordable when they were poorer. Thus, after they have become economically "liberated," countries like Germany, Sweden, and even the United States tend to fall back down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore. These "Asian tigers" are still growing and developing and have not yet begun to restrict their economies with post-industrial welfare and environmental policies. This phenomenon, when displayed graphically, is called the Curve of Economic Freedom. It shows that economic freedom can rise and fall and that the seeds of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.
<P>	Another conclusion of this report concerns how fast developing countries with free economies grow. The data and scoring show that developing countries that pursued economic liberalization quickly became the richest in the world. Conversely, developing countries that did not pursue economic liberalization remained poor (see chart). Clearly, the path to prosperity is paved by economic liberalization and maximized economic freedom. This is a lesson which all developing countries should learn.
<P>	For example, Hong Kong and Singapore have the highest amount of economic freedom in the world.  In these countries consumers and businesses are free from most government intrusion.  Their economies are based on the mutual consent of individuals to buy, sell, and dispose of property as they see fit.  As a result, they have had extremely high levels of economic growth. Between 1980 and 1991, Hong Kong's gross national product grew at an average rate of 5.6 percent, while Singapore's economy grew at an average rate of 5.3 percent over the same period. While their economic wealth is less than that of some industrial democracies, Singapore's and Hong Kong's economies are catching up quickly with the Western world.  These countries someday may even surpass the U.S. and Germany in per capita GDP if current trends continue.
<P>	In contrast, countries like Angola, Bangladesh, and Haiti have the least amount of economic growth.  These countries have done little to unleash the entrepreneurial forces in their economies.  Instead, they have followed the self-destructive path of central government control and state intervention in the economy.  As a result, they are among the world's poorest nations. Other countries scored poorly as well, such as the newly formed independent republics of Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine.  Their problems stem from slow progress toward free market reforms.  Their economic problems are the worst in the former Soviet Union. 
<P>	Former Marxist countries which have made rapid progress toward maximizing economic freedom are doing relatively well: the Czech Republic and Estonia, for example, score well on the Index.  The Czech Republic has halted an economic decline. It probably will have a respectable growth rate of 3 percent in 1994.  The Bank of Estonia estimates the GDP growth will be in the 3 percent to 5 percent range in 1994.  These countries have managed to begin the process used by Hong Kong and Singapore to promote large economic growth rates by maximizing economic freedom.
<P>	Above all, these findings disprove the assertion that economic growth can be bought by huge transfers of wealth from the industrialized economies to the less developed world.  People in Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, and Ukraine are not poor because wealthy people in the West do not share their riches.  They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic policies that depress free enterprise.  Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free market will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise, but inhumane.

<H3>Why an Index of Economic Freedom?</H3>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>	The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) for years has been giving aid to 
developing countries whose economies are over-regulated, protected by trade barriers, and state-
controlled. Nevertheless, despite billions of dollars of U.S. development aid, most of these countries 
are still poor. The reason is simple: their governments have done little to promote economic 
freedom. Quite simply, the recipient countries are destroying their own economies.  Not only has 
U.S. development aid been wasted, it has actually retarded economic development in the countries 
that receive it. Not one country receiving foreign aid has succeeded in developing sustained 
economic growth.
<P>	It should be no surprise that U.S. aid has done so little to bring about global economic growth. 
The experience of the past three decades shows that economic policy, not aid, is the main factor in 
moving from the ranks of developing to middle and high income countries. For example, the economies 
of Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the "Asian Tigers," expanded their gross domestic product by a rate 
of 6 percent each year between 1960 and 1985.  During this period of rapid development, neither Hong 
Kong nor Singapore received significant amounts of development aid.
<P>	Indeed, these and other Asian countries would not have grown so much if the crutch of foreign 
aid had been available.  If Hong Kong had been flooded with aid, as was Tanzania, it probably would be 
closer to Tanzania's status as the world's second poorest country.  In reality, Hong Kong is one of the 
world's most dynamic economies, growing at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent from 1980 to 1991. 
<P>	The potentially perverse effect of development can be seen in the recent history of Chile. In 
1973, Chile was the world's second largest recipient of foreign aid.  It also had a stagnating economy. 
Under the leadership of Marxist President Salvador Allende, Chile's GDP shrank 5.6 percent in 1973.  As 
with many Latin American countries, the government controlled a large part of the Chilean economy, 
estimated to be around 75 percent of the GDP.
<P>	However, by 1990, Chile's economy changed dramatically.  General Augusto Pinochet launched 
a market reform program that drastically cut back on government intervention in the economy. The 
Chilean government controlled only 25 percent of the economy after Pinochet's privatization program 
was largely complete. As a result, Chile has developed one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  
A GDP growth rate averaging 7.3 percent per year since 1988 has dramatically improved the lives of the 
Chilean people. For example, the infant mortality rate has been reduced as life expectancy has gone up.
<P>	It was with this understanding of economic development in mind that the authors undertook to 
measure the relative economic freedom of most countries in the world. The <I>Index of Economic 
Freedom</I> represents an excellent tool for deciding how best to allocate development aid.  Using it 
would help to ensure that foreign aid is not sent to countries that repress economic freedom and have no 
chance of growing economically.  Countries scoring well or improving on the<I> Index</I> would be 
eligible for development aid if they were using the money in constructive ways--i.e., to help construct the 
building blocks of a free market economy. However, using aid to pay for building stock markets, a banking 
system, and other elements of a free market will always be dwarfed in importance when compared to the 
economic policy decisions of the host country. The greatest advantage of the Index is to ensure that U.S. 
development aid does no harm and is not wasted on countries that demonstrate no commitment to 
economic reform.
<P>	The<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> is not a tool for deciding whether or not to dispense 
humanitarian aid or to promise aid for reasons of national security. A foreign country's economic 
policies have always been and undoubtedly will continue to be irrelevant when deciding whether to offer 
relief to people suffering from hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Moreover, for reasons 
of national security, the U.S. should continue providing foreign aid when necessary to bolster allies 
abroad.
<P>	There is yet another use for the <I>Index</I>.  Investors around the world would benefit from 
knowing  how well countries score on the "fundamentals" of economic freedom.  Although the<I> 
Index</I> would be of  little use in judging the advisability of specific investments or in discerning the 
relative strength of specific business sectors, it could be useful in understanding the overall economic 
environment inside a country and whether the economic trends are favorable to future investments.  
Moreover, the <I>Index</I> would be more useful as a starting place in judging investment opportunities 
in underdeveloped countries than in the advanced democracies.  The relative economic performances of 
underdeveloped countries tend to be less known than those of Western nations.  And perhaps more 
important, an understanding of the economic "fundamentals" would be more important in assessing risk 
for the lesser developed nations.   The economies of poorer countries tend to be unpredictable and 
difficult for investors to understand.  The <I>Index</I> should help them to improve their understanding.

<P>	The U.S. will spend over $13 billion on foreign aid in 1994.  This brings total U.S. bilateral aid      
since 1946 to close to half a trillion dollars.  Of the $13 billion spent in 1994, AID will distribute $2.4      
billion in bilateral economic assistance directly to specific countries.  In addition, the U.S. will give almost a billion dollars in economic support to the former Soviet Union, $1.9 billion through international financial institutions including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and $2.4 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF), which are used to advance U.S. political and security interests.

<H3>Where We Are Going in Foreign Aid</H3>  
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	The Clinton Administration in 1994 made a bid to reform foreign aid. After countless   
commissions and blue ribbon panels over the years, President Clinton introduced the Peace,   
Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994 (PPDA).  Many thought this would be the year in which   
the foreign aid program would finally be revamped.  
<P>	This, however, was not to be. The Clinton foreign aid reform plan ran out of steam, falling prey to   
politics and other priorities. The Senate Democratic leadership was unwilling to devote the floor time that   
the PPDA required. The reason: doing so would have given Clinton critics a stage for complaints against   
the President's foreign policy. Senate Democrats also were hesitant to direct congressional attention   
away from the health care debate.  Thus, the PPDA never made it to the floor for a vote.  
<P>	The PPDA was a weak attempt to reform foreign aid. It failed to address one of the fundamental   
problems of development aid: how best to use foreign aid to advance economic freedom and, as a result,   
spur economic development. <FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>   The central idea of the Clinton reform  
plan was something called   
"sustainable development." In this idea, the state manages the economy, trying to create "sustainable"   
economic growth without harming the environment or unleashing a "population explosion." But the results   
of this approach will be the exact opposite of the free market-driven growth the Administration claims to   
champion. By increasing government intervention in the economy--with intrusive environmental   
regulations and industrial policies--the Clinton plan will only strangle economic growth.  
<P>	The battle over reforming foreign aid is by no means over. AID Administrator J. Brian Atwood   
believes that the U.S. foreign aid program must be reformed or face budget cuts by skeptical legislators.   
But for foreign aid reform to succeed, more will have to be done than pouring old wine into new bottles,   
as the Clinton Administration has done. The greatest weakness of the Clinton approach is that it continues   
to give aid to countries that waste it.  Moreover, the programming emphasis of the Administration is   
wrong, focusing largely on population control and environmental protection efforts, not on economic   
growth.  Unless the purpose of U.S. development aid is to spur free market-reforms and economic   
growth, it will only prop up failing economies, doing more harm than good.  
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom is the ideal mechanism for judging which countries should   
receive foreign aid. This was the conclusion of George M. Ferris, Jr., Chairman of the President's   
Commission on the Management of Aid Programs (1992), who urged AID to establish an Index of   
Economic Freedom for the purpose of allocating development aid among countries. Representative   
Robert Livingston, then ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Foreign Operations   
<P>Subcommittee, stated on the House floor last spring that the Republican Party should "expand on [the   
Index of Economic Freedom] and ultimately adopt it in our foreign aid program."<FONT SIZE="-2"> 
(2)</FONT>    
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom, rooted in the recognition that free markets are the only means   
toward development, should be the foundation of U.S. foreign aid reform legislation. By using the Index,   
policymakers can identify which countries are making progress toward free market reforms and which   
ones are not. Countries reforming their economies could use specially targeted aid to help build market   
institutions. Aid also could provide leverage in persuading developing countries to make market reforms.   
While it may be true that reforming countries over time will have less need for foreign aid, temporary   
assistance can help jump start the process of reform. The ultimate and ideal goal, however, should be to   
end dependence on aid altogether. It is with this goal in mind that the Index of Economic Freedom was   
developed.

<H3>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</H3>   
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	There are many factors that could be used to determine how much economic freedom    
exists in a country.  Economic relations between individuals are restricted to a varying degree by    
government intervention.  By looking at such economic factors as taxes, international trade, and    
banking, the extent to which economic freedom is encouraged or hindered can be discerned.    
</P>










<P><UL>
<B>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</B><BR>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>
4. Monetary Policy<BR>
5. Capital Flows and Foreign Investment<BR>
 6. Banking Policy<BR>
7. Wage and Price Controls<BR>
8. Property Rights<BR>
9. Regulation Policy<BR>
10. Black Market</UL>

<P><B>The Grading Scale.</B> Under each factor is a grading scale.  The scale runs from 1 to 5 with    
1 being the most free and 5 the least free. After each score is either a "-," "+," or "stable" mark.  These    
indicate whether a country is getting worse, better, or staying the same, respectively, in each category.   
<P>	Countries were ranked according to four categories of economic freedom.  Countries receiving    
an Index score of 1.99 or less are considered to have economies that are "free."  Countries scoring    
between 2.00 and 2.99 have economies that are "mostly free."  For scores of between 3.00 and 3.99,    
economies were ranked as "mostly not free."  And economies that obtained a score of 4.00 and above are    
"repressed."   
<P><B>The Sources.</B> In grading the countries, the most recent available information and statistical    
data were used. Where primary sources were not available, secondary sources were used. These cases are    
footnoted accordingly. In each section, a general list of sources is provided for each country. Unless    
otherwise footnoted, these are the main sources used to grade each of the countries.  A general    
bibliography appears at the end of the study.   
<P><B>	Choosing Which Countries to Score.</B> One of the prime motives for developing    
the Index of Economic Freedom is to provide policy makers with a guide for dispensing aid among    
countries. Thus, this edition of the Index rates most current or traditional recipients of significant ($5    
million annually) amounts of U.S. foreign aid.  Some countries, such as Rwanda, Somalia, and Zaire, were    
omitted mainly because reliable data to score their economies were not available. However, this poses no    
significant problem because U.S. aid to these countries is strictly humanitarian; by no measure is it    
contributing to sustained economic growth. Some major industrial and trading countries are included,    
largely for a point of comparison. As the results demonstrate, the respect these countries show for    
economic freedom generally stands in stark contrast to that of countries of the developing world.    
Additionally, a few countries of strategic importance to the U.S., including Mexico and China, were    
included. Future editions of <I>The Index of Economic Freedom</I> might consider even more than the    
current 101 countries.   
<H3>THE FACTORS<BR>   
Factor #1: Trade Policy.<FONT SIZE="-3">[1]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Trade policy is a key factor in measuring economic freedom. The degree to which a government    
hinders the free flow of foreign commerce has a direct bearing on economic growth. Trade policy, in fact,    
is a key factor in industrialization of developing economies. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>     
International trade enables a country's    
industries to maximize production by allowing them to import raw materials and foreign goods and    
services that are cheaper than those produced at home. It can also offer a country greater access to a large    
world market, which can be the source of much wealth.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average tariff rate is used to score a country's trade policy. A    
score of 1 through 5 is given based on a country's tariff rate--the higher the tariff rate, the worse the    
score. Sources to determine the average tariff rate were derived from reports issued by the General    
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  When the average    
tariff rate was not available in these sources, the authors determined the average rate by calculating the    
revenue raised from tariffs and duties as a percentage of total imports. Most of the average tariff rates are    
valid for 1992. In some cases, adequate average tariff rate figures do not exist.  In these cases, the authors    
used publications from the United States Trade Representative's office, the Commerce Department, and    
the State Department. These instances are footnoted. <FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  Such non-tariff   
barriers as trade quotas, overly    
strict licensing, or import inspections also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a    
country's score based solely on tariff rates was moved one point higher on the scale, representing    
decreased economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. has an average tariff rate of 3.6 percent.  Based on a scale    
measuring tariffs alone, it would be given a score of 1.  However, because the U.S. maintains non-tariff    
barriers, such as import quotas on textiles and sugar, it was given a total score of 2.   
<H3>Grading Scale</H3>   




























<BR>
<BR><PRE>
	Levels 		  
	of 
Score	Protectionism	Criteria	
-----	-------------	--------
1	Very low	Average tariff rates less than 4 percent
			and/or very low non-tariff barriers. 

2	Low		Average tariff rate 5 percent to 9 percent 
			and/or low non-tariff barriers.  

3	Moderate	Average tariff rate 10 percent to 14 
			percent and/or moderate non-tariff barriers.  

4	High		Average tariff rate 15 percent to 19
			percent and/ or high non-tariff barriers.  

5	Very high	Average tariff rate 20 percent and higher 
			and/or very high non-tariff barriers that 
			virtually close the market to imports.  
</PRE>   
  

<H3>Factor #2: Taxation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[4]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Taxes are a key factor in measuring economic freedom. While every country taxes economic    
activity to pay for national defense, public health, and other vital government services, too much taxation    
stifles individual entrepreneurship. A tax is essentially a government-imposed disincentive to perform the    
activity being taxed. For this reason, exorbitant taxes slow economic growth. When analyzing this factor,    
taxes on corporate profits, income, and other significant activities are measured.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Two types of taxation are scored: income taxes and corporate    
taxes.  Each country was first scored based on these two major types of taxation, which many economists    
agree have the most negative economic impact on individuals.  These scores were then averaged to get a    
single taxation score.  Then, other taxes such as value-added taxes, sales taxes, and state and local taxes    
also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a country's taxation score was moved one-half    
point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.  This one-half point increase    
represents the relative impact of these other taxes on individual freedom.   
<H3>	1) Income taxes.</H3>    
<P>	Some countries have relatively high top income tax rates, but they apply to very few people. For    
example, Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent, but it is levied on such large amounts of income    
that very few people fall into this high tax bracket. The tax rate that applies to the average Japanese    
taxpayer is much lower.  Thus, to more accurately measure taxation policy, it is necessary to examine not    
only the top income tax rate, but the rate that applies to the average taxpayer.   
<P>	To discover the average income tax rate, a country's total gross domestic product was divided by    
total population. This per capita income figure was then used to determine which tax rate applies to the    
average income level. <FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT>  Once this was done, each country was scored on   
1) the top tax rate and 2) the    
tax rate that applies to average income.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent.  But the 50 percent tax    
bracket applies to income levels that equal about $180,000, which is more than nine times the per capita    
GDP level, which is around $19,000.  The tax level that applies to that amount is 20 percent.  Thus, based    
on the tax scale, Japan would receive an income tax score of 4.   
<H3>	Income Tax Grading Scale  </H3>   
<P>This scale lists a score from 1 through 5. The higher the score, the higher the tax rate. The highest    
level for which a country qualifies is the score that the country receives.   
 <P>  






























<BR>
<BR><PRE>
Score	Tax Rates	Criteria   
-----	---------	--------

1	Very low taxes	No taxes on income; or A flat tax rate on income  
			of 10 percent or less.  

2	Low taxes	A top tax rate of 25 percent or below; or A flat 
			income tax between 10 percent and 20 percent; 
			or A top rate of 40 percent or below, and a tax on    
			average income below 10 percent.  

3	Moderate taxes	A top tax rate of 35 percent or below; or 
			A tax on  average income below 15 percent.   

4	High Taxes	A top income tax rate of 36 percent to 50 percent 
			and an average tax level of 15 percent to 20 percent. 

5	Very high taxes	A top rate above 50 percent and a tax on average 
			income between 20 percent and 25 percent; or A tax 	
			rate on average income of 25 percent or   
			above regardless of the top rate.  
</PRE>

<H3>	2) Corporate taxes. </H3>   
<P>	The second type of tax analyzed is the corporate tax. Each country is scored according to a    
sliding scale based on corporate tax rates.    
<P><B>	Example:</B> Japan has a top corporate tax rate of 37.5 percent. Thus, based on the    
corporate tax rate scale, Japan receives a score of 4.  Japan's overall tax score average is a 4.  But Japan    
maintains additional taxes in the form of a 37.5 capital gains tax, a 3 percent consumption tax, a 17.3    
percent to 20.7 percent local inhabitant tax, and a 14.6 percent social contributions tax.  Thus, Japan    
moves from a 4 to a 4.5.

<H3>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output. <FONT SIZE="-3">[6]</FONT>     
</H3>   
<P>	The greater the degree to which the government intrudes in the economy, the less individuals are    
free to engage in their own economic activities. By taking government consumption as a percentage of    
gross domestic product, the level of government consumption of economic output can be determined. The    
higher the rate of government consumption as a percentage of gross domestic product, the higher the    
Index score, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Measuring a country's government consumption as a percentage of    
GDP reveals only an approximation of the government's role in the economy. <FONT SIZE="-2">  
[7]</FONT>  In the U.S., for    
example, the federal budget is about 24 percent of GDP.  This figure includes servicing the federal budget    
deficit and transfer payments through entitlements like Medicaid. Other government consumption figures    
for most less developed countries do not include funds spent on servicing the budget deficit and some    
transfer payments. While using government consumption figures probably understates the total    
government intervention in the economy, it is a useful tool and starting point for gauging the degree of    
government intervention in the economy.   
<P>	The next step in scoring a country on government consumption is to determine the size of the    
state-owned sector of the economy. If  a large portion of a country's GDP is produced by the state-owned    
sector, it was moved one point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.    
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Russia has a government consumption as a percentage of GDP figure    
of about 22 percent.  This would give Russia a score of 2 because the government consumption figure is    
between 11 percent and 25 percent. However, state-owned enterprises account for a majority of industrial    
production.  Thus, Russia gets a final score of 3, one point higher.

<H3>Factor #4: Monetary Policy. <FONT SIZE="-3">[8]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The value of a country's currency is based largely on the government's monetary policy. If a    
government maintains a "tight" monetary policy, meaning the supply of currency does not exceed demand,    
individuals have the economic freedom to engage in productive and profitable economic activities.  If the    
government maintains a "loose" monetary policy, meaning it supplies more money than demand requires,    
money loses its value and individuals are less free to engage in productive and profitable economic    
activities.  The best way to measure monetary policy is to analyze a country's inflation rate over a period    
of time. The inflation rate is directly linked to the government's ability to manage the supply of money in    
the economy.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average inflation rate was the main criterion for this factor.    
The inflation rate is the best measure of how a country manages its money supply.  Countries with high    
inflation rates have a loose monetary policy and are graded higher because they have less economic    
freedom than countries with lower inflation rates. Countries with a low inflation rate have a tight    
monetary policy and are graded lower because they have more economic freedom.  Countries of the    
former Soviet Union pose a unique problem in determining average inflation rates.  Due to the fact that    
these countries had command economies, annual inflation rate averages from 1980 to 1991 are    
misleading.  Without a market-based system, prices can be held constant because they are controlled by    
the state.  Therefore, countries of the former Soviet Union are graded solely based on 1992 or 1993    
inflation figures.  While these figures are high, especially due to their transformation to a market-based    
system, they are more accurate reflections of the conditions of today than are figures from the Soviet era.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan keeps a tight control over its money supply, and low inflation    
rates are the result. Japan's government has done this by maintaining a supply of yen consistent with the    
domestic demand for the currency.  In addition, Japan has very high savings rates. This supplies the    
financial system with yen that banks and other institutions lend to borrowers. As a result of a tight    
monetary policy, Japan maintained a very low average annual inflation rate of 1.5 percent from 1980 to    
1991. Because of its low inflation rate, Japan receives the lowest score of 1.

<H3>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment Policy. <FONT SIZE="-2">[9]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	Foreign investment funds economic expansion. Investors from abroad supply capital to domestic    
investors who then start or expand their businesses. Restrictions on foreign investment hamper economic    
freedom and thus limit the inflow of foreign capital. By contrast, few or no restrictions on foreign    
investment maximize economic freedom and thus increase the flow of investments. For this category, the    
more restrictions a country imposes on foreign investment, the higher the score, and hence the lower the    
economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> A country's foreign investment policies were scrutinized in order    
to determine the overall investment climate. Among the specific questions asked: Are there foreign    
ownership limits placed on domestic industries? Is there an existing foreign investment code that defines    
the country's investment laws and procedures? Does the government encourage foreign investment by    
providing tax holidays or other incentives? Are foreign corporations treated under the law the same as    
domestic corporations? Are specific industries closed to foreign investment? These questions were    
answered to develop an overall description of the investment climate of the country being examined.     
Each country was graded based on its investment climate.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> Venezuela maintains restrictions on foreign investment.  Foreigners can    
own no more than 20 percent of a company engaged in one of the following industries: accounting,    
architecture, engineering, and insurance.  Foreign investment in oil, gas, coal, petroleum, automobiles,    
and iron ore is prohibited.  Finally, there are some employment restrictions.  On some investments, the    
workforce of a company with more than 10 employees must be 90 percent Venezuelan.  Thus, according    
to the criteria in the scale below, these restrictions are considered as moderately restrictive. Venezuela is    
given a score of 3 because there are restrictions on investment, but government policy at least conforms    
to established foreign investment codes.

<H3>Factor #6: Banking. <FONT SIZE="-3">[10]</FONT>   </H3>   
<P>	In most countries, banks provide the economy with the financial means to operate.  They lend    
money to start businesses, provide services such as real estate, insurance, and securities investments, and    
furnish a safe place for individuals to store their earnings.  The more government controls banks, the less    
they are free to engage in these activities. The consequence of heavy regulation of banks is restricted    
economic freedom. Therefore, the more a government restricts its banking sector, the higher the Index    
score it receives, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> This factor is measured by determining the openness of a country's    
banking system. Among the questions asked: Are foreign banks able to operate freely?  How difficult is it    
to open domestic banks?  How heavily regulated is the banking system?  Are banks free to provide    
customers with insurance, sell real estate, and invest in securities?  The answers to these questions were    
used to develop a description of the country's banking climate.  The Index represents a sliding scale that    
measures the relative openness of a country's banking system.   
<P>	Example: The U.S. banking system is minimally regulated.  However, it maintains federal    
deposit insurance and interstate banking regulations.  Based on the scale below, the U.S. receives a 2    
score, which means that restrictions on banks are considered to be low.

<H3>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls. <FONT SIZE="-3">[11]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	A free economy is one that allows individuals to set not only the prices on the goods and services    
they sell, but also the wages they pay to the workers they employ.  Some governments mandate wage and    
price controls. By doing so, they restrict economic activity, and thus curtail economic freedom.    
Therefore, the more a government intervenes and controls prices and wages, the higher the Index score    
and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  This factor is measured by how much a country lets the market or    
the government set wages and prices. Among specific questions asked: Are there any products whose    
prices are set by the government?  If so, which products?  Does the government affect prices by    
controlling such things as utilities?  Does the government have a minimum wage policy?  Are other wages    
set by the government? A sliding scale is developed to measure the relative degree of government control    
over wages and prices. A 1 or "very low" score represents wages and prices being set completely by the    
market, whereas at the other end of the scale, a "very high" score of 5 means that wages and prices are set    
completely by the government.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  In Hong Kong, all wages and prices are determined by the market. Thus,    
it receives a score of 1. By contrast, in Cuba, wages and prices are set by the government. Therefore, it    
receives a score of 5.

<H3>Factor #8: Property Rights. <FONT SIZE="-3">[12]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The accumulation of private property is the main motivating force in a market economy.  This    
factor examines the extent to which private property is protected by the government and how safe it is    
from expropriation.  The less protection private property receives, the higher the score, and hence the    
lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The degree to which private property is a guaranteed right is    
measured. So, too, is the extent to which the government protects and enforces laws to protect private    
property. The probability that the state will expropriate private property also is examined. The less legal    
protection of private property, the higher the score.  The higher the chance of government expropriation    
of private property, the higher the score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. economic system is based entirely on people's right to    
accumulate property. America's legal system is one of the best in the world. It allows people to use the    
court system for disputes over property and to enforce contracts. Thus, based on the scale below, the U.S.    
would receive a very low score of 1, meaning that the level of protection for private property is "very    
high."

</PRE>

<H3>Factor #9: Regulation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[13]</FONT>  </H3>     
<P>	In many less developed economies, obtaining a business license to sell a good or service is    
nearly impossible.  With so many hoops for the entrepreneur to jump through, it is very difficult to create    
new businesses. In some cases, government officials frown upon private sector initiative and it may even    
be illegal. While there are many regulations that hinder business, the most important ones are those    
associated with licensing new companies and businesses.  In some countries, like the U.S., obtaining a    
business license is as simple as mailing in a registration form with a minimal fee.  In others, especially in    
Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America, obtaining a business license requires endless trips to a    
government building and countless bribes, and may take up to a year.    
<P>	Once a business is open, that is not necessarily the end of government regulation.  In some cases,    
it is just the beginning.  Some countries apply their regulations haphazardly.  For example, an    
environmental regulation may be used to shut down one business while another is not penalized. Business    
owners become confused over which regulations must be obeyed. Moreover, the existence of many    
regulations can cause corruption as confused and harassed business owners try to work around the red    
tape.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  The purpose is to measure how easy or difficult it is to open a    
business.  The more regulations on business, the harder it is to open.  In addition, the degree of corruption    
was examined, as was whether the regulations are applied uniformly to all businesses. Another factor was    
whether the country has any state planning agencies that set production limits and quotas. The scale was    
established by listing a set of conditions for each of the five possible scores.  These conditions include    
such items as the extent of government corruption, the uniformity of the regulations' applications, and the    
extent to which the regulations pose a burden on business. At one end of the scale is the 1 score of very    
low levels of regulation, where corruption is nonexistent and regulations are minimal and uniformly    
applied. At the other end of the scale is the "very high" score of 5, where corruption is rampant,    
regulations are applied randomly, and the general level of regulation is very high. A country need only    
meet a majority of the conditions in each score for it to receive that score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Obtaining a business license in Hong Kong is very easy.  In some cases,    
one can even be obtained by mail. Hong Kong's regulation system is corruption-free, not a burden to    
business, and is applied uniformly throughout the country. Thus, Hong Kong receives a 1.

<H3>Factor #10: Black Market. </H3>   
<P>	Black markets are a direct result of government intervention in the market. In fact, a black market    
activity is one that the government has outlawed.  The larger the black market is in a country, the lower the    
economic freedom.  The smaller the black market, the higher the economic freedom.  This factor    
considers the size of a country's black market as a percentage of GDP.  The higher the percentage, the    
higher the score and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> Information available on the size of black markets in less    
developed countries is extremely scarce. Nevertheless, estimates can be made on the size of black market    
activities by answering several questions. For example, does the country have a large smuggling market?     
If so, this could be an indication that the government imposes too many restrictions on foreign imports.    
Do consumers need to turn to the black market to buy such items as televisions and video-cassette    
recorders?  If so, this could be an indication that these products cannot be bought in stores legally or that    
their prices are too high because of very high tariffs. Are there large numbers of workers who work    
illegally?  If so, this could be an indication that the economy is overly regulated and that labor must be    
supplied by the black market.   
<P>	The existence or absence of these and other activities was used to estimate the size of the black    
market as a percentage of gross domestic product.  In cases where black market information exists for    
specific countries, it is noted. At one end of the scale is the score of 1, where the black market    
constitutes less than 10 percent of GDP. At the other end is the score of 5, where the black market makes    
up 30 percent or more of GDP.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> In Peru, almost 30 percent of the GDP consists of such black market    
activities as labor and food. Other black market activities are outlawed in many cases. Peru receives the    
highest score of 5.

<H2>The Countries</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This section is a compilation of countries, each graded in all ten factors of the Index of 
Economic Freedom. Each country receives a 1 through 5 score for all ten factors. Those scores are then 
averaged to get a final Index of Economic Freedom score. Countries with a score between 1 and 2 have 
the freest economies. Countries with a score around 3 are less free. Countries with a score near 4 are 
over-regulated and need significant economic reforms to achieve even the most basic increases in 
economic growth. Countries with a 5 score are the most economically oppressive nations in the world.

<H2>Conclusion </H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This study demonstrates that the countries with free economic systems enjoy the highest 
degree of economic development.  Likewise, the countries with the least amount of economic 
freedom suffer from the lowest degree of economic development and are among the poorest 
countries on earth.  Throughout the world, free markets have driven development, while heavy 
government intervention has wrought nothing but economic disaster.
<P>	These conclusions are reflected in the scores of 101 countries examined in the <I>Index of 
Economic Freedom</I>. 7 countries were given  a "free" score, while 36 were found to be "mostly free." 
By contrast, 50 nations were "mostly not free," while 8 were deemed as "repressed." As these 
designations show, most of the countries in the world have economies that are not free. 
<P>	The <I>Index</I> demonstrates clearly the positive relationship between economic freedom and 
wealth. Five of the seven advanced industrial (G-7) democracies are among the ten countries whose Index 
score reflects the most economic freedom. By contrast, countries with unfree economies, such as Cuba, 
Mozambique, North Korea, and Vietnam, are among the world's poorest. Predictably Mozambique is 
indeed the world's poorest country.  While Mozambique's long running civil war, which ended in 1992, 
contributed to its poverty, there can be no doubt that Mozambique's long embrace of Marxism has been 
the major cause of its abysmal state of economic development.
<P>	<B>Asian Powerhouses. </B> Nor is it surprising that the Asian "Tigers"--Hong Kong, South 
Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan--are doing well economically. Two members of this enviable group, Hong 
Kong and Singapore, tie for the best score on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Each country 
scored a 1.25, receiving identical scores in all but two categories.  Hong Kong edged out Singapore by 
having lower tax rates while Singapore scored better than Hong Kong on monetary policy.  These two 
countries are paragons of economic freedom.
<P>	When compared with growth rates in many African countries, the "Asian Tiger" success is indeed 
impressive.  By 1965, the Asian Tigers and most Sub-Saharan African nations had achieved independence 
from colonial nation states.  In that year, Sub-Saharan African countries like Gabon had equal to higher 
levels of per capita wealth than Asian Tiger countries like the Republic of China on Taiwan.  For example, 
in 1965, Gabon had a per capita GDP figure of $1,286. By contrast, Taiwan had a per capita GDP of 
$1,133.<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   By 1991, Gabon's per capita wealth had risen to only $3,448. By contrast, Taiwan's per capita GDP had climbed to  $9,805. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>
<P>	Since 1965 , Taiwan has received negligible amounts of development aid. Gabon has been flood-
ed with hundreds of millions of dollars of development aid--over $500 million in the past five years. The 
conclusion is inevitable: Taiwan flourished because it became economically free, while Gabon, awash in 
development aid, languished because it refused to steer a free market course.
<P>	Right behind Hong Kong and Singapore, finishing third overall in economic freedom, is Bahrain.  
This Middle Eastern country scored a 1.60. Despite Bahrain's state-owned oil industry it maintains one of 
the most open markets in the world with average tariff rates of around 3.3 percent.  It makes no use of 
non-tariff barriers such as trade quotas and voluntary export restraints.  It taxes neither income nor 
corporate profits. Because of tight monetary policies, Bahrain actually has achieved what economists call  
"negative inflation rates"--in other words, prices actually dropped in the 1980s.
<P>	Bahrain has few government-imposed prices or set wages, minimal restrictions on foreign 
investments, a limited bureaucracy that imposes scant regulations on businesses. Its black market is 
practically non-existent. In each of the categories where countries were ranked, Bahrain scored among the 
best.  Since Bahrain's independence in 1971, it has achieved a per capita GDP of $11,536,
<FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  which makes it more wealthy than Ireland.
<P><B>	Nations Emerge from Communism. </B> The <I>Index </I>also sheds light on the 
different economic paths taken by former communist countries. Of the countries graded in this edition of 
the <I>Index, </I>the Czech Republic is ranked among the top 12 in the world with the highest levels of 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">[4]</FONT>  Thus, the Czech Republic has the freest economy of all the former East Bloc 
countries. Right behind the Czech Republic is Estonia. Both Estonia and the Czech Republic have adopted 
low rates of taxation, eliminated abusive government regulations, and minimized state constraints on 
individual economic activity. The results are that the economies of these two countries are performing 
better than any other former socialist state.
<P>	Some of the more developed countries have less economic freedom than less prosperous, 
developing countries.  Sweden, for example, scored a relatively weak 2.65.  This score can be attributed to 
Sweden's high level of taxation and the heavy role its government plays in the economy.  Neverthe-less, 
Sweden is wealthier than Malaysia, which scores a 2.15.  Sweden has a per capita GDP amount of 
$17,490, while Malaysia has a per capita GDP figure of $7,400.<FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT> 
<P> 	This finding may seem, at first glance, to invalidate the claim that economic freedom is the most 
important factor in stimulating economic development. However, this would be a misreading of the 
evidence. The Index of Economic Freedom is but a snapshot in time.  It measures economic freedom 
today.  There is no accounting for the economic history of Sweden, nor is Malaysia's past captured in its 
Index score. Sweden is richer than Malaysia, even though it is less free, because Sweden began 
industrialization long before Malaysia. Thus, it has had longer to develop and accumulate wealth. 
However, at present growth rates, it may not be long before Malaysia catches up with Sweden. Malaysia's 
economic growth exceeds Sweden's today, and Malaysia had an average growth rate of 5.6 percent from 
1980 to 1991.  Sweden had an average rate of growth for the same time of 2 percent.
<P><B>	The Curve of Economic Freedom. </B> This comparison of Sweden and Malaysia 
points to an important phenomenon discovered in this study: Long periods of economic growth resulting 
from high levels of economic freedom seem to create states that reverse course and place limits on 
economic freedom.  This is the Curve of Economic Freedom.  As the curve demonstrates, most countries 
with limited levels of economic freedom are grouped together with corresponding low levels of per 
capita wealth.  As some countries begin to reform their economies by establishing market-based systems 
that promote economic growth, per capita wealth increases.  However, once these countries reach a 
certain level of economic prosperity, as in the G-7 countries, they are tempted to regulate their 
economies, raise taxes, and add welfare programs, which results in less economic freedom and slower 
rates of economic growth.
<P>	The Curve of Economic Freedom helps to explain why economic growth rates have lagged lowed 
in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-1980s. Since that time, these countries has increased government 
spending, resulting in corresponding increases in taxation and regulation. If these trends continue, these 
countries will eventually suffer from dwindling economic growth and shrinking per capita wealth. 
<P><B>	Regions of Freedom. </B>North America, parts of Europe, and East Asia have the 
highest amounts of both economic freedom and per capita wealth.  Sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, 
and some republics of the former-Soviet Union are among the least economically free and poorest 
countries in the world.  Yet, while many countries in the developed world have rather high levels of 
economic freedom, many have reimposed restrictions on that freedom while many less developed 
countries have removed impediments to freedom and are beginning to catch up with the advanced 
industrial countries.
<P>	For example, some nations in Europe, mainly Germany, France, Italy, and even the United 
Kingdom to a lesser extent, have economic recessions.  Much of this is a result of increased government 
spending and interference in the economy.  The European Union, for example, will spend about 22 percent 
of its combined GDP on social welfare programs.  This is up from around 16 percent in 1989.  In 
Germany, government spending on social security and welfare now accounts for 49 percent of total 
government expenditures.  In the U.K., social spending is about 33 percent.
<P>	To fund social programs, these countries have raised tax rates to very high levels. Germany, Italy, 
and Japan have top income tax rates over 50 percent.  Britain has a top rate of 40 percent, while that of  
the U.S. is 39.6 percent.  Hong Kong, however, taxes income at a top rate of around 15 percent.  Other 
developing countries, like Estonia, have adopted relatively low top tax rates of 26 percent.
<P><B>	Foreign Aid Failures. </B> The <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> scores 
represent a damning condemnation of the U.S. foreign aid program.  It is well known that many countries 
which have received the largest amount of economic assistance from the U.S., including India and 
Bangladesh, are also the world's poorest countries.  Sadly, many of these countries are only getting 
poorer, and most policy makers know that the U.S. foreign aid program is doing little or nothing to stop it. 
Indeed, this is why Brian Atwood, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, is 
scrambling to "reinvent" his beleaguered agency.
<P>	It is troubling to learn that the large recipients of U.S. aid are also the countries with the least 
amount of economic freedom.  India, for example, scored a 3.70 and Bangladesh scored even worse at 
3.90.  The dearth of economic freedom permitted in these countries has produced nothing but economic 
misery.  It is tragic that this disastrous course has been subsidized by U.S. foreign aid. 
<P>	The record is particularly damning in Africa. The west African country of Ghana scores a poor 
3.20. Nevertheless, Ghana is the "star" of the international donor community, receiving nearly $1 billion 
in development aid each year. The three Sub-Saharan countries, Swaziland, Uganda, and South Africa, have 
the greatest degree of economic freedom, scoring 2.90, 2.94, and 3.00, respectively. Though good by 
Africa standards, these are bad scores when compared to Western standards. Africa's interventionist 
economic policies have drained it of economic vitality. 
<P>	Israel scored a 3.10 and Egypt 3.50.  These two countries together receive the bulk of U.S. 
foreign aid.  They are scheduled to receive over $5 billion in 1995.  Although each country has spoken of 
economic liberalization, little progress has been made, particularly in Egypt, where a reform effort has 
run out of steam.  U.S. aid to these two countries may be justified in terms of U.S. national security.  The 
peaceful relationship between Israel and Egypt is viewed as the bulwark of Middle East stability.  
However, these considerations aside, there can be no doubt that U.S. aid is doing little to promote 
economic development in these countries. In fact, it may be retarding development by delaying economic 
reforms.
<P>	The U.S. has recently occupied Haiti to restore democracy to that poverty-stricken country.  
Haiti scores a 4.20 on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  This amounts to economic repression. 
The Haitian elite has repressed economic activity by every means, including the use of physical violence.  
Haiti's lack of economic freedom has made it the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.  In short, 
Haiti's crisis is as much economic as political. Haiti's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> score 
suggests that foreign aid will do nothing to promote economic development unless the Haitian economy 
is dramatically liberalized.
<P>	Finally, nations still under the control of communist dictatorships like Cuba and North Korea, 
and to a lesser extent, Vietnam, collected at the bottom of the Index.  These countries are controlled by 
regimes that repress most forms of economic activity, saving most sources of wealth for corrupt 
government officials who use their control over the economy as the means to maintain power.
<P>	After all is said and done, the inescapable conclusion of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> 
is that the best way for a nation to grow economically is to tax less, lower trade barriers, better protect 
private property, allow foreign investment, and generally reduce the level of government interference in 
the economy. Whether they be G-7 countries or the Asian Tigers, countries that are the wealthiest and 
growing the fastest are the ones that are most economically free.  While many factors in addition to 
economic freedom account for the absolute wealth of nations--such as size, resources, the absence or 
presence of war, and even culture--no single factor is as important in determining economic development.  
The road to riches, it seems, indeed is paved with freedom.

<TITLE>Albania</TITLE>
<H2>ALBANIA</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Located in southeastern Europe, the Balkan country of Albania gained its independence 
from the Ottoman Empire in 1912. Its struggle for independence, however, resulted in the  loss of 
about half its territory and 40 percent of its citizenry to neighboring Greece and Yugoslavia. During 
World War I, Albania became a battlefield in which much of the country was destroyed. Following 
the war, Albania was an independent state ruled by a monarchy. Although King Zog sought 
economic self-sufficiency, Albania became increasingly dependent on Italy. In 1939, Benito 
Mussolini occupied parts of Albania. The Albanian Communist Party was formed in 1941, and after 
World War II Albania became one of the world's most oppressive communist states. The 
communist regime was deposed in 1991, and current President Sali Berisha was elected in 1992.  
President Berisha is trying to implement an ambitious program of free market reforms. He has, 
however, encountered some political opposition, losing in November 1994 a referendum on his 
proposed constitution.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>   	The North African country of Algeria has had a state-controlled socialist economy since 
independence from France in 1962. Years of government mismanagement and low oil prices in the 
mid-1980s led to anti-government riots in 1988. In 1989, Algeria adopted a new constitution that 
ended one-party rule and called for multi-party elections. But the elections were canceled in January 
1992 after the results of the first round of voting made it clear that the radical Islamic Salvation 
Front would have taken power. This precipitated a rebellion by Islamic radicals against the military-
backed government. Since 1992, more than 10,000 Algerians have been killed in a brutal civil war. 
Islamic terrorists have targeted foreigners to cut Algeria's economic links to the outside world and to 
fuel discontent. In this uncertain climate, real economic growth has averaged barely 2 percent per 
year over the last several years. Under pressure from the international financial community, Algeria 
has committed to economic liberalization. The pursuit of economic reform, however, has been 
erratic.

Algeria has been liberalizing its trade policy. Substantial barriers to free trade nonetheless 
remain. Lately the government has shown some signs of backtracking, tightening import 
controls, for example. Nevertheless, the government monopoly on trade has been 
abolished. The government reformed the tariff schedule in 1992, cutting the top tariff rate 
from 120 percent to 60 percent as well as reducing the number of tariff categories. In 
addition to tariffs, importers must pay two other taxes, adding a combined 17 percent to 90 
percent to the cost of imports. <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>    Some goods require import licenses.

The top income tax rate in Algeria is 50 percent. There is no tax on average income. Income 
earned by foreigners is taxed at a flat 20 percent. It had been as high as 70 percent. The 
corporate tax rate is 50 percent for business profits and 20 percent for earnings that are

maintains a value-added tax of 21 percent.

Algeria has recently improved its foreign investment environment. A 1993 investment code 
includes incentives for foreign investors, though the wording is vague. Laws governing 
hydrocarbons and natural gas exploration have been liberalized and free trade zones have 
been established. Nevertheless, several sectors remain off limits to foreigners. Coupled with 
the large role of state enterprises, foreign investment opportunities remain limited. 
Moreover, it is not uncommon for foreign investors to spend two years negotiating with 
government officials who oversee investments. Finally, radical Islamic groups are 
threatening the stability of the government.

Algeria's heavily state-controlled banking sector has been liberalized. Foreign banks may

<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate wage and price controls) </I><BR>
The Algerian government controls the profit margins and the sales of  medicine, school 
supplies, tobacco, sugar, coffee, and vegetable oil. Subsidies on food items exist, and the

some prices have been decontrolled over the last few years.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-  (Moderate level of protection of private property) </I><BR>
Government expropriation is unlikely. Algerian law prohibits expropriation based upon future 
legislation. Expropriations based upon existing law require fair compensation in foreign 
currency. Of late, collective farms have been parceled into lease properties. This is a 
modest advance for property rights. Overall, private property is reasonably well protected 
in Algeria. This would change drastically if the Islamic fundamentalists were to come to 
power. 
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 3-  (Moderate level of regulation) </I><BR>
Algerian private sector enterprises, of which there are relatively few, must contend with 
burdensome regulations. Algerian workers cannot be easily dismissed. The norm is 
employment for life. This represents a considerable burden to foreign companies and the 
private sector. In addition, it is difficult for foreign companies to hire people from their 
home country. Paying taxes is cumbersome, partly because of the inefficient and corrupt 
bureaucracy.

But following the war, it introduced a host of social and economic policies that sent the economy into a spiraling decline. Under the leadership of President Carlos Menem, Argentina in 1989 began a free market revival that has increased economic freedom. As a result, inflation has stabilized and the economy is growing. While corruption is still rampant, Argentina is now the richest country in South America.

<P>	Austria has long played an important role in European history and culture. Following World 
War I,  Austria's government intervened deeply in the economy, causing massive economic 
recession in the 1930s. At the end of World War II, it was occupied by both U.S. and Soviet 
troops. But in 1955, Austria was freed from occupying armies and became a completely 
independent and neutral country. Although Austria has been ruled by mainly socialist parties since 
then, it has pursued some very free market policies. This has helped Austria maintain a relatively 
high standard of living.

<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of protectionism) </I><BR>
Austria has an average tariff rate of 2 percent to 3 percent. However, some tariffs on specific 
products like agricultural goods can be quite high. In addition, Austria limits agricultural 
imports according to a quota system. Still, as a new member of the European Union, trade 
barriers are expected to fall.

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Austria is very dependent on foreign investment and welcomes it openly. Few restrictions exist. 
However, foreign investors must sometimes deal with slow bureaucratic procedures to gain 
approval for new operations.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Foreign banks can operate in Austria so long as they have prior government approval. Austrian 
banks are permitted to engage in all kinds of services, including the underwriting of loans 
and the brokering of securities and mutual funds. They also may own subsidiaries that 
underwrite and sell insurance policies. Austrian banks are also allowed to invest in, develop, 
and manage real estate ventures.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2- (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
Most wages and prices are set by the market. However, Austrian businesses voluntarily

Although Austria experienced long periods of economic growth after World War II, it allowed 
the state to become involved in regulating the economy. There is a growing environmental 
movement that threatens to shackle many Austrian businesses with burdensome 
regulations. Moreover, workers in Austria are pampered and coddled by the state, hindering 
the competitiveness of business even further. Nevertheless, by global standards Austria's 
economy is only moderately regulated.

<P>	An archipelago some 50 miles east of Florida, the Bahamas consists of some 700 islands, 
only 30 of which are inhabited. The Bahamas is a parliamentary democracy and a member of the 
British Commonwealth. Its biggest industry is tourism and, with a few notable exceptions, the 
economy is essentially free from government controls.

<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of protectionism)</I><BR>
A main source of revenue for the Bahamian government is import duties. Its tariff rates are

<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
The Bahamian government plays a limited role in the economy. Government consumption as a

<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
There remain significant barriers to foreign investment in the Bahamas. For example, the 
government restricts foreign investment in areas that directly compete with Bahamian-
owned businesses, such as construction. It does this by preventing foreign companies from 
obtaining business licenses and by imposing other requirements in areas where Bahamian 
businesses already exist. Further, there is no foreign investment code in the Bahamas.

<I>Score: 2- (Low level of wage and price controls) </I><BR>
The Bahamas maintains some price controls on such items as automobiles, auto parts, flour, 
gasoline, public transportation, and utilities, but its wages are mainly determined by the

<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low levels of government regulation) </I><BR>
Regulation is virtually non-existent in the Bahamas. The government follows a hands-off 
approach to business. Opening a business in the Bahamas is simple. There are no specific 
requirements for establishing a business and English common law is used to enforce 
contracts. Profits are not taxed and businesses are free from burdensome regulations.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of black market activity) </I><BR>
The black market in the Bahamas is like those in most developed countries: restricted to guns

and businesses are free to operate as they see fit, the black market is very small. Still, high 
trade barriers result in some smuggling in such items as auto parts and electronics.

<P>[1 ] It is impossible to generate an average tariff rate for the Bahamas because information on tax 
revenues generated from imports is not available. However, the Bahamas' general tariff rate of 33 percent, 
which applies to most imports, was used. Other tariff rates range from zero percent on foodstuffs to 47 
percent on luxury items to a top rate of 200 percent. Still, since most imports fall into the general 
category, the 33 percent figure most closely represents the Bahamas' average tariff rate. For more 
information, see The Bahamas, International Tax and Business Guide, 1994 edition, Deloitte Touche 
Tohmatsu International, New York, New York, 1994.<BR>

This figure is for 1987, the most recent year available, and was generated from statistics found in World

<P>	Located just south of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the Central American country of Belize 
is among the fastest growing countries in the region. Belize's economy stagnated in the early 1980s 
because its main export, sugar cane, was hit by disease. Since then, however, Belize has had 
extremely high rates of economic growth because of the sound economic policies and favorable 
economic conditions in Mexico and North America, to which many of its goods are exported.

<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Foreign investment is not permitted in a variety of industries and economic activities, including 
accounting, beekeeping, commercial fishing, merchandising and distribution,  sugar cane 
production, and transportation. However, Belize offers tax holidays, which eliminate taxes 
on investments for a specified period, to investments in many other areas. This encourages 
investments that result in increased exports and more jobs.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Bank loans are closely regulated. Banks in Belize are under tight government control. 
Foreigners need to acquire permission from the government to operate in Belize. Foreigners

<P>	Bolivia is a landlocked country in central South America. It is a constitutional democracy. 
While much of Latin America is moving toward liberalized economies and free trade, the 
government still maintains a strong hold on the economy. While the government has controlled 
inflation and the economy has grown somewhat, Bolivia is behind its neighbors in economic growth 
and freedom. In fact, Bolivia is the poorest country in South America.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif">
<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of protectionism)</I><BR>
In 1990, the government reduced the average tariff rate from 16 percent to 10 percent on all 
but capital goods, whose rate is 5 percent. Thus, Bolivia's average tariff rate is between 5 
percent and 9 percent.

<I>Score - Income taxation: 2+ (Low tax rates)<BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 3-Stable (Moderate tax rates)<BR>
Final Taxation Score: 3-Stable (Moderate tax rates)</I><BR>
Bolivia has a flat income tax rate of 13 percent. It does not tax corporate income. Instead, it 
taxes corporations based on their net worth, at a rate of 3 percent. Bolivia also has a 13 
percent value-added tax and a variety of other transaction and property taxes.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Bolivia's government consumes more of its economy than does any other state in South

consumption as a percentage of GDP is 16 percent.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of inflation)</I><BR>
Bolivia has had chronically high inflation rates, though considerable progress has been made 
recently. Its average inflation rate was 264 percent from 1980 to 1991. In 1992 and 1993, 
the inflation rate fell to about 10 percent.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Foreign investment is encouraged in Bolivia. Few restrictions remain on foreign investment. 
While some restrictions remain on the petroleum and mining industries, they are minimal.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Bolivia's banking system is backward and corrupt. Most banks in Bolivia are state-controlled

private and foreign banks are restricted by the government.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
There are few price controls in Bolivia, although the government maintains the right to impose

<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Legal protection of private property is lax. Large property owners are particularly vulnerable to 
official corruption as property can be seized without just compensation and "taxed" by 
corrupt government officials. Although the government has begun an ambitious 
privatization program, expropriation of private property is still possible.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of government regulation)</I><BR>
Bolivia's economy is heavily regulated through haphazardly applied government requirements

Bolivia has one of the largest black markets in the Western Hemisphere. The black market is

<P>	Brazil is the largest country in South America. It was once a colony of Portugal. Under 
President Fernando Collor, who was impeached in 1992, Brazil reduced trade barriers, privatized 
state-owned enterprises, controlled inflation, and maintained a tight monetary policy. When the new 
president, Itamar Franco, assumed office, he stated that Collor's policies would be continued. 
However, this did not happen. Under Franco, Collor's reforms lost their momentum. While he 
continued privatization and reduced government spending, he also raised taxes and increased 
government control over credit. Brazil's new President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, promises to 
reduce taxes and tariff rates, as well as privatize many state-owned businesses.

Brazil maintains an average tariff rate of 14.3 percent. It has other barriers to trade as well, 
such as import licenses and other duties. For example, imported personal computers are 
subject to a 35 percent duty, a 10 percent freight insurance charge, a 15 percent value-
added tax, and a 17 percent sales tax. These duties increase the price of imported 
computers by over 100 percent.

Final Taxation Score: 3+ (Moderate tax rates)</I><BR>
Brazil has a top income tax rate of 35 percent. The Brazilian government determines tax 
brackets based on what it calls a "fiscal unit of reference."  This is a method to determine 
an individual's annual income amount after a year's worth of inflation, which is very high 
in Brazil. With this method, the government gets the maximum amount of revenue from 
income that is continuously inflating. However, the average Brazilian does not pay taxes. 
Using the per capita GDP of $2,800 expressed in U.S. dollars, the average Brazilian 
taxpayer falls into the lowest tax bracket in which no taxes are owed. Brazil has a maximum 
corporate tax rate of 25 percent and a state corporate tax of 5 percent for a total top rate of 
30 percent. In addition, Brazil has a 25 percent capital gains tax, a top federal value-added 
tax of 365 percent, a 7 percent to 25 percent state value-added tax, a 10 percent social

Brazil still maintains barriers to foreign investment. Restrictions on investments in the service 
industries can be high. For example, foreign capital investments in petroleum, banking, 
insurance, telecommunications, and mining are limited. Other investments, such as in 
transportation, utilities, media, real estate, and shipping, are prohibited. Brazil also imposes 
local content requirements on foreign equity participation.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Of the few foreign banks that exist in Brazil, all are restricted from expanding branches or doing 
business with state-owned companies. Brazilian law prohibits new foreign participants in 
the capital stock of national trading banks as well as any increase in equity participation in 
Brazilian banks. Moreover, Brazil has not permitted the entrance of any new banks. 
Indications are that this policy will continue. Domestic banks are allowed to engage in 
securities exchanges and insurance services, but they are prevented from engaging in real 
estate ventures and most equity investments.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Brazil has had a long history of wage and price controls. Brazil last froze prices in 1990, but 
controls have been gradually eased since that time. Nevertheless, Brazil still maintains price 
controls on a variety of goods and services such as some foodstuffs. Businesses may be 
required to ask permission from the government to increase prices, even if production costs 
rise. Many companies are not free to set their own prices. Brazil maintains a minimum 
wage. 
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
There is little chance that the private property of foreign investors will be expropriated in Brazil. 
Because there are a number of major multinational corporations in the country and the 
government is trying to attract foreign investment, the protection of foreign-owned property 
is adequate. However, domestically owned property is at risk. 
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
Government regulation is rampant in Brazil. Its economy is heavily regulated. Environmental, 
health, consumer, labor, financial, and a host of other regulations greatly restrain business 
activities.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of black market activity)</I><BR>
Brazil has a moderate level of black market activity. Brazil's black market has shrunk, 
however, in recent years as Brazil has reduced trade barriers on previously protected 
goods, reducing the ability of smugglers to make a profit on highly taxed products.

Canada is a supporter of free trade policies. Its average tariff rate is 4.9 percent. Canada is part 
of the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Mexico. While 
largely a free trader, Canada nonetheless maintains trade barriers against dairy products, 
liquor, poultry, and wheat. According to the United States Trade Representative's office, 
Canada's Special Import Measures Act has been used to reduce imports. Since the early 
1980s, the country also has increased its use of antidumping laws, further restricting 
imports.

Canada has a progressive tax structure with a top marginal rate of 29 percent. Its tax rate on the 
average income level  is 17 percent. Canada has a massive national debt that amounts to 60 
percent of GDP. This is increasing pressures to raise taxes. Canada has a top marginal 
corporate tax rate of 38 percent. Canada also has provincial taxes ranging from 6 percent to 
10 percent, a 21.63 capital gains tax, and a 7 percent value-added tax called a Goods and

<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Canada has been much more willing to intervene in its economy than has the United States. 
The government consumes 21 percent of the GDP. The Canadian government owns and

Canadian Wheat Board. Nevertheless, since 1984, the Canadian government has 
undertaken a substantial privatization program, which has now stalled.

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Canada maintains several restrictions on investment. The Investment Canada Act, for example, 
requires the government to review each foreign investment to determine whether there is a 
"net benefit to Canada."  While most foreign investments ultimately benefit the recipient 
country, Canada's regulations discourage potential investors. The Investment Canada Act 
often is used to restrict foreign investment in the following industries: energy, publishing, 
telecommunications, broadcasting, and cable television.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Canada has a private financial system with some restrictions. The Canadian banking system

Private property is a fundamental principle of the Canadian economy. Canada's legal and

It is relatively easy to establish a business in Canada. Every business must be registered in its 
province, except in New Brunswick, which does not require any kind of registration. Fees 
range from nominal to nonexistent. Registration is virtually automatic for most types of 
businesses. Regulations are applied evenly and consistently. Some regulations like 
consumer safety and environmental laws, plus occupational and health standards, pose a

<P>	While most of the economic success stories since 1960 come from Asia, Chile is one 
shining example of a Western Hemispheric country enjoying great economic success. Chile

America. This economic transformation continues and has resulted in some of the fastest economic 
growth rates in the Western Hemisphere. <FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   Following this 
steadfast economic transformation, Chile underwent a series of political reforms that culminated in 
democratic elections in 1989. The Chilean Constitution has well defined and protected individual 
liberties. Chile's new president, Eduardo Frei, is continuing the country's free market course.

International trade is the cornerstone of the Chilean economy. Chile has a flat tariff rate for 
most products of 11 percent. However, other tariffs raise the average tariff rate to 12.37

applications are rejected each year. Chile has substantial non-tariff barriers.

taxes its citizens under a complex method of increasing tax rates based on what the 
government calls the "value" of earnings. These values are determined by periodic

Chile is an example of how reduced government consumption produces solid rates of economic

education, pension funds, social security, and some utilities. <FONT SIZE="-

Chile's average annual rate of inflation from 1980 to 1991 was 20 percent. Chile's central bank

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Chile aims to attract foreign investors by granting them quick government approval in some 
industries. Nevertheless, while Chile has reformed its foreign investment code to attract 
investment, significant barriers still exist. For example, all foreign investors must gain 
permission from the government's Foreign Investment Committee. Moreover, the 
government maintains restrictions on investment in the fishing, maritime transport, and oil 
and gas industries. 
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
While Chile's banking system is relatively free from government corruption, it is not a totally 
competitive, market-oriented industry. Chile requires a license for foreign banks. All 
licenses have been frozen. Thus, no new foreign banks now are allowed in Chile. Only 20 
foreign banks operate in Chile. Domestic banks, especially those in the lending business, 
often find themselves in competition with the government-owned banks, thus distorting 
market operations. Chile has a state-operated agency that provides subsidized loans to the 
public and private sectors. Its 40 percent default rate has swallowed up lending capital and 
skewed the banking system with bad loans. Banks are not permitted to engage in insurance, 
real estate, or investment services.
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Chile's price policy is determined mainly by the market. Some exceptions are prices for urban 
and public transport and some utilities. Minimum wages, hours worked, and safety 
regulations are all controlled by the government. Chile also maintains a "family subsidy" for 
poor workers, which guarantees a minimum wage for specified workers.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very high level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Private property is gaining increased protection from the Chilean government through greater 
efficiency in the court system and legal institutions. Chile has had since the early 1980s a 
comprehensive program of privatization, and it continues today. The likelihood of private 
property expropriation is very low.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
Government regulation in Chile runs from nonexistent in some areas to overbearing in others. 
Opening a business in Chile is far easier than in many Latin American countries. 
Regulations are moderate, but some can pose a burden on private businesses. The Public 
Health Ministry, for example, regulates all food and drug products. The Ministry directly 
regulates the production, storage, distribution, sale, and import of all food and drug items.
<P><B> Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate black market activity)</I><BR>
Like most Latin American countries, Chile has a black market. Some estimates suggest that as 
much as 35 percent of the labor in Chile, especially in the bigger cities, is supplied by the 
black market. Nevertheless, as the country becomes more industrialized, the black market 
activities will shrink.

the economic reforms of the 1980s were undone following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 
1989. However, since that time, China once again has pursued economic liberalization. These 
reforms have paid off as economic growth reached 12 percent in 1993. While China's economy is

As a communist system, most property is owned by the state. The World Bank reports that 
China's government consumes only 9.8 percent of the GDP, which is up from 8.3 percent 
in 1980. Still, China's state-owned sector contributes almost all GDP. By definition, 
therefore, China's government consumption is very high due to the fact that the state owns 
most of the economy.

<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of inflation)</I><BR>
Being a command economy, China had an average annual rate of inflation of only 5.8 percent

real rate of inflation because the communist government controls prices.
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
China's government has always maintained barriers against foreign investment. China suffers 
from a lack of foreign investment codes. Moreover, the Chinese use their foreign 
investment policy to prevent foreign investments in industries owned by the government. 
However, China's special foreign investment zones in the south give it a somewhat better

China is a communist system in which most of the property remains in government hands. 
However,  China is currently privatizing some major industries, thus moving state-owned

<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
In an attempt to boost the private sector, the Chinese bureaucracy sometimes does not enforce 
cumbersome regulations. China still has a state planning agency that makes significant

<P>	Colombia's political system has come under much pressure in recent years because of the 
drug trade. However, recent economic reforms have made the economy one of the most stable in 
the region. Colombia's economy remains healthy with some of the highest growth rates in South 
America. While growth has slowed recently, it still averaged 3.3 percent from 1989 to 1993. 
However, Colombia's newly elected President Ernesto Samper has called for increased government 
spending on social welfare programs that could jeopardize recent economic gains.

Colombia has an effective top income tax rate of 30 percent. 
<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   The average income level is taxed at a rate of less than 5 percent. Many 
of these taxpayers are not required to fill out a tax return. 
<FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>   The government is cracking down on tax fraud and more

Even with Colombia's costly war on drugs, its government has managed to reduce its role in the 
economy. Colombia's government consumption as a percentage of GDP is 10.4 percent.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High inflation rate)</I><BR>
Colombia had an average inflation rate of 25 percent from 1980 to 1991. Since then, the

<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Colombia permits 100 percent foreign ownership in almost all sectors of its economy. The few 
exceptions are in national security and hazardous waste industries. Permission for 
investments is needed only for the public service, water, waste, and transportation 
industries, or for large investments in mining and petroleum enterprises. A simple 
registration and licensing process is required for all investments.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
During the 1980s, the government nationalized the banks. However, it now is selling them back 
to the private sector. Still, Colombia has yet to achieve a completely free banking system. 
Domestic banks may engage in selling securities, insurance policies, and investment  
services. 
<P><B> Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Colombia has one of the most free market pricing policies in Latin America. Almost all prices 
are set by the market. The only exceptions are on a few agricultural and petroleum 
products. However, Colombia maintains a minimum wage.
<P><B> Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate protection of private property)</I><BR>
The biggest threat to private property in Colombia is the violence created by the drug cartels 
and the government's attempt to distribute wealth more equally. Private property is 
generally well protected in Colombia. The government is privatizing the state-owned 
enterprises. However, Colombia is also in the midst of a major agrarian reform program 
which may result in the expropriation of private land.
<P><B> Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
Colombia is a free market economy and the government tends to exercise minimal control of 
the private sector. Obtaining a business license in Colombia is not difficult. There is a 
limited registration process. Moreover, the Colombian government tends to allow 
businesses to operate as they see fit. There are very few burdensome regulations on 
business.

tax rate of 30 percent, plus a 25 percent tax penalty for making over a specific income. However, the 25

elections spawned riots and civil unrest. Little progress toward democratic or market reforms has 
been made since.

environmental impact studies. Moreover, the government requires private companies to 
grant vacations, holidays, overtime, and social insurance.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Cuba is one of the most repressed economies in the world. After Fidel Castro seized power 
in 1959, he systematically imposed government control and ownership of every economic activity 
and outlawed private property and individual economic freedom. Cuba's economy remained afloat 
through decades of hefty subsidies from the Soviet Union, which used the island as a base to 
threaten U.S. national security. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Cuba lost its subsidies, forcing it 
to compete internationally on its own merits. Understandably, the Cuban economy collapsed. 
Although Castro has made some reforms to attract foreign investors, Cuba's economy is still 
communist.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif">

<P><B> Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of protectionism) </I><BR>
Castro maintains some of the highest levels of protectionism in the world. All imports into Cuba 
must be inspected and approved by Castro's government. In many cases, customs officials 
confiscate imports for their own personal use, especially if they are scarce goods like 
electronics. Official corruption is sanctioned and supported by Castro's customs officials. 
As a result, Cuba has trade barriers that effectively bar most imports.

Final Taxation Score: 5-Stable (Very high tax rates) </I><BR>
Because the Cuban government controls the entire economy, it essentially confiscates the 
proceeds of all economic activity.  Since the fruits of all economic activity are owned by 
the government, the resulting rate of taxation approaches 100 percent.
<P><B> Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of government consumption ) </I><BR>
Although Castro permits some private economic activity in a restricted way, the means of

Cuban government directly owns and runs most of the Cuban economy.
<P><B> Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high levels of inflation) </I><BR>
The Castro government claims that inflation does not exist in Cuba.  But this is a fiction. If 
price controls were lifted and the true value of the currency were measured, inflation would 
be extremely high. The official prices of goods may be low because they are controlled and 
subsidized by the state, but the tremendous scarcity of goods and services attests to their 
real value. In short, Cuba's currency is worth little, and it is not convertible on the 
international market. Moreover, because money is printed rampantly to cover the costs of 
debts, the peso is greatly inflated. The Cuban government freely admits that 11.5 billion 
pesos are circulating in excess of demand. 
<P><B> Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high barriers to foreign investment) </I><BR>
Foreign investment is effectively barred in Cuba. Castro will permit some foreign investments, 
in tourism for example, but  the Cuban government outlaws full foreign ownership. 
Moreover, the Cuban foreign investment code is unreliable.
<P><B> Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high restrictions on banking) </I><BR>
Banks in Cuba are owned and operated by the government and are heavily influenced by the

Cuba's black market activity is greater than that of the official or legal economy. As might be

black market. Thus, Cuba's black market involves the sale of basic foodstuffs like milk and 
bread, transportation services, and housing.

<H2>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	The Dominican Republic won its independence from Spain in 1865. Since independence, 
this Caribbean island nation has developed a large agricultural industry. The government has 
intervened quite often in this and other industries. In the 1980s the country suffered a major 
economic crisis as its socialist economic policies and bad weather ruined agricultural production. 
Since 1990, the government has been trying to reform the economy, but not much progress has 
been made.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif">
<P><B>Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of protectionism)</I><BR>
The Dominican Republic maintains very high trade barriers. Its average tariff rate is about 27 
percent. Non-tariff barriers include a consumption tax which ranges from 5 percent to 80 
percent; in some cases that tax raises prices so high that some products become 
unaffordable and therefore are effectively barred from the country. For example, a 
consumption tax is added to automobiles based on their engine size. As a result, imported 
cars are far out of reach of the average citizen. Import licenses exist for most products.
<P><B>Factor #2: Taxation</B><BR>
<I>Score - Income taxation: 2+ (Low tax rates)<BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 3+ (Moderate tax rates)<BR>
Final Taxation Score: 3+ (Moderate tax rates)</I><BR>
The Dominican Republic's marginal top income tax rate is 26 percent. This will be reduced to 
25 percent in 1995. People who make an average income pay no taxes. The top corporate 
tax rate is 26 percent in 1994, to be reduced to 25 percent in 1995. The Dominican 
Republic also has a 26 percent capital gains tax and an 8 percent value-added tax.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
According to the World Bank, the Dominican Republic's government consumption as a 
percentage of GDP figure is 8.9 percent. However, this figure is highly understated because 
state-owned companies produce a majority of GDP. 
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of inflation)</I><BR>
The Dominican Republic had an annual rate of inflation from 1980 to 1991 of 24.5 percent. 
Inflation fell to 4 percent in 1992.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Foreign investment is discouraged by government bureaucracy and corruption. Prohibitions on 
foreign investment exist in the following industries: communications, media, national 
defense, transportation, and public utilities. Foreigners need a presidential decree to permit 
ownership of more than one-half acre of land. The Dominican Republic maintains 
repatriation requirements and prevents the reinvestment of some profits. 
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Foreign banks are virtually shut out of the Dominican Republic. The two exceptions are 
Citibank and the Bank of Nova Scotia, which have been operating relatively freely in the 
Dominican Republic for decades. The government strictly controls the supply of credit. 
Foreign companies cannot obtain loans from local banks for a period longer than one year.  
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Most wages and prices are set by the market. The government combats inflation with sound 
monetary measures and price controls. The Dominican Republic has a minimum wage 
policy.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4- (Low level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Property rights are not respected and receive low levels of protection in the Dominican 
Republic. The court system is inefficient; corruption and bureaucratic red tape run high; 
and property can be expropriated by the government.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
Regulations are not applied evenly or honestly. Corruption and red tape pose significant burdens 
to businesses.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of black market activity)</I><BR>
The Dominican Republic has a high level of black market activity, particularly in labor services. 
Competition for workers is so intense that many legal labor regulations are ignored.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Ecuador became independent from Spain in 1822. For the next century, the country was 
plagued by much instability and many dictatorships. Today, Ecuador's economy is based mainly on 
oil. During the oil boom of the 1970s, the government of Ecuador used its increased wealth to 
subsidize businesses and generally to raise the level of government consumption in the economy. 
However, as oil prices plummeted later in the decade and into the 1980s,  Ecuador's oil-based 
economy began to decline. Trying to recover, Ecuador has been making economic reforms that 
reduce the level of state intervention in the economy.

<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of protectionism)</I><BR>
Ecuador's average tariff rate is 12 percent. Importers must obtain an import license that can

<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Ecuador's government consumes only 8.7 percent of its GDP. This may seem very low 
considering the government employs 25 percent of the work force and many industries are 
dominated by state-owned firms. Yet the vast majority of firms are privately owned. The 
state-owned sector contributes less than 8 percent of GDP. 
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5- (Very high level of inflation)</I><BR>
Ecuador's main monetary goal has been to stabilize inflation by controlling the supply of 
money. Yet Ecuador's average annual inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 was 38 percent. 
The inflation rate in 1992 was 50 percent. Inflation ran at about 40 percent in 1994.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
The Ecuadorian government has been liberalizing its foreign investment policies since 1990. 
Most investors are free to invest in almost any industry. Exceptions are in such so-called 
strategic industries as mining, and enterprises owned by the state.
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR> 
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
There are 32 private banks in Ecuador, which is a considerable number when compared to 
many of its neighbors. Ecuador has a large number of foreign banks. Domestically owned 
banks are relatively competitive with foreign banks. However, these privately owned banks 
must compete with state-owned development banks that provide a variety of subsidized 
loans to farmers, ranchers, and small businessmen. 
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Although there are fewer price controls today than several years ago, prices on such items as

maintains a minimum wage policy.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3- (Moderate level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
There are large disparities of wealth in Ecuador that increase the chances that property may be 
redistributed to the poor. In addition, corruption plagues the legal framework, making it 
sometimes difficult to enforce property rights.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>    
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
The Superintendency of Companies, the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance Companies,

haphazardly, which often becomes a burden for business.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>

ruled by President Hosni Mubarak. The government launched a desperately needed market 
liberalization program in 1991. It has attempted to remove the state from the market. However, 
very little progress has been made in privatizing Egypt's massive and inefficient public sector. Nor 
has much been done to reform and reduce the size of the bureaucracy. In the past two years 
Egypt's tourist industry has suffered a billion-dollar-a-year loss because of radical Islamic terrorist 
attacks on foreign tourists and government officials. Egypt is the second-largest annual recipient of 
U.S. foreign aid.

Egypt has made modest progress over the past several years in liberalizing its trade policy.  
Nevertheless, Egypt remains one of the most heavily protected markets in the world. 
Egypt's average tariff rate of around 30 percent is exceptionally high.  Such non-tariff 
import barriers as import bans also protect domestic industries. Some  trade reforms have 
been undertaken, including the 1993 reduction of the maximum tariff rate on most items 
from 100 percent to 80 percent and the elimination of import bans on most commodities. 
Nevertheless, 159 previously banned items have been placed on a "quality control" list.

<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
The Egyptian government has established business zones free of customs duties, sales, and

frustrate foreign investment. Foreign investors occasionally face official discrimination, 
particularly when their proposals threaten public sector interests. While foreign investors are 
allowed to buy most privatized enterprises, Egyptian bidders still receive an advantage in 
the bidding. In practice, 100 percent foreign ownership is rarely approved.
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>

Egypt's banking industry is dominated by the public sector. The state-owned and central bank 
exercises considerable control over private banks. Egyptian banks have formed joint 
ventures with such companies as Barclays' and Bank of America. However, the 
government will not permit the establishment of new joint venture banks or branches. Joint 
venture banks are subject to strict control by the central bank, which determines the fees 
and commissions they can charge. The central bank also exercises control over the 
appointment of directors of joint venture banks and determines their interest rates for loans 
in the economy. The central bank also requires joint venture banks to deposit with it an 
amount of local currency for which they earn no interest.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Price controls have been removed on most products. Remaining price controls should be 
removed within the next year, except on pharmaceutical products. However, gasoline, 
flour, and sugar remain subsidized. The existence of a massive public sector limits the 
private sector's ability to set wages and prices. The government limits the amount of profit 
earned on some imported goods. There is a minimum wage. 
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Egypt's commendable privatization effort is bogged down.  While private property is protected 
by the constitution, the Egyptian judiciary is inefficient. 
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
Corruption is endemic in the Egyptian bureaucracy, which is massive and inefficient. Bribery is 
the norm.  The business environment is overregulated, and investors have difficulty 
obtaining permits for imports. 
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of black market activity)</I><BR>
With its long commitment to a command economy and the slowness of its economic reforms,

percent in GDP in 1990, 3.5 percent in 1991, 4.8 percent in 1992, and 5 percent in 1993. Under 
President Alfredo Cristiani, the government relinquished control of prices, slashed import tariffs, 
privatized most of the financial system, and followed a relatively tight monetary policy. While some

above 10 percent. Another burden for importers is a government requirement for a health 
certificate for imported poultry. Since this certificate is nearly impossible to get from the

government requires 11 days of paid vacation a year, an annual 30 percent bonus after only

Africa and one of its poorest. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Party seized 
power in 1991, having defeated the Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam. The transitional 
government of President Meles Zenawi is now attempting not only to overcome Mengistu's 
economic legacy, but to stop an ethnic-based secessionist movement in the Ogaden. Zenawi's 
government favors a mixed economy and enjoys considerable support from foreign aid donors.

Ethiopia's inflation rate has been historically low. Its average annual rate of inflation from 1980

Zenawi's regime has not done much to dismantle the hostile foreign investment climate created 
by the previous Marxist regime. Sectors off limits to private investment include the defense 
industry, large-scale electric power generation, postal, telecommunications, and major 
transportation services. The new government has been slow to authorize new foreign 
investments. Ethiopians are granted priority for investment opportunities. A heavy

The financial sector, previously an exclusive domain of the state, was recently liberalized. 
Private investment in banking and insurance is now permitted. The dominant Commercial 
Bank of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Insurance Corporation, however, will remain under full 
state ownership; private investment is limited to newly established bank and insurance 
operations. Banking and insurance ownership limits apply to individuals and families, and 
no foreign ownership of Ethiopian banks is permitted. Foreign banks may not operate in 
Ethiopia. 
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Ethiopia has recently liberalized prices. Private operators were permitted to compete with the 
state-run grain and coffee distribution networks, allowing for greater price and wage 
competition. State dominance of the industrial and transportation sectors reduces price 
competition. As with many African countries, only a small percentage of the work force in 
Ethiopia is employed for wages. There is no minimum wage.

The Mengistu regime nationalized most industries and vast tracts of agricultural land. The new 
government has decided that rural land will remain under state ownership. Urban land also 
will remain as property of the state, available to the private sector only through revocable 
long-term leases. Bureaucratic red tape and corruption further weaken property rights in 
Ethiopia. Property may be expropriated legally with compensation.

<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
Impromptu police clearings of street stalls and other persecutions of merchants who threaten

Final Taxation Score: 4-Stable (High tax rates)</I><BR>
France has a top income tax rate of 30.5 percent. The tax rate on the average income is 15 
percent. France's complicated tax structure puts the total corporate tax paid over 35 
percent. In addition, France maintains an 18 percent to 33 percent capital gains tax, an 18.6

contributions tax of 16 percent to 45 percent.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Total government consumption as a percentage of GDP is 18.6 percent.  The French 
government has monopoly control over several parts of the economy, such as energy 
generation and supply, rail transportation, postal services, telecommunications, and tobacco 
production and distribution. Moreover, many state-owned companies dominate various 
industrial sectors, skewing pricing and adding inefficiency to the entire French economy. 
Some of these companies are in such industries as iron and steel, aluminum, coal mining, 
aerospace, nuclear energy, and many forms of transportation except trucking. France is 
undergoing a limited privatization program and for this reason receives an improving score. 
Despite some of its problems, the level of government intervention in the economy is low

<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
The French government controls two of France's largest banks, Banque Nationale de Paris and

foreign investors are finding it easier to invest in French financial services and to open 
banks.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
France has a long history of legalized monopolies in such areas of the economy as 
telecommunications, public infrastructure, electricity, and rail transportation. In 1987, 
however, the French government removed price controls, and most prices are now set by 
the market. Products still under price controls are pharmaceuticals, books, tobacco, 
agricultural products, coal, and steel. France maintains a minimum wage, and some wages 
are controlled by the government.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (High level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
Property rights are uniform throughout France. Enforcement is adequate. However, there are 
some impediments to acquiring property. The French Constitution, for example, states that 
any company defined as a national public service or as a natural monopoly must pass into 
state ownership. The Constitution allows the state to nationalize companies that fall into this 
category. However, in practice and by global standards, protection is high.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
The reforms established by the EU have made opening a business in France easier. Obtaining a 
business license is relatively easy, but some hurdles still must be overcome. For example, a 
company must obtain a registration number from the district commercial court. To do so, a 
copy of the business's lease, plus other documentation, must accompany the application. 
However, France has made some progress in streamlining this cumbersome registration 
process by incorporating all the registration requirements into one office.

sub-Saharan Africa. Gabon is a member of the French Franc Zone and maintains close ties with its 
former colonizer. This relationship has provided Gabon with a measure of economic and political 
stability unusual in Africa. In 1990 French troops stationed in Gabon quelled riots against the regime 
of President Omar Bongo, who has been slowly making political and economic reforms. However, 
Bongo retains tight control over political activity. The Gabonese economy has been partially

Foreign property is unlikely to be expropriated. However, there have been charges that

 While the bureaucracy is generally effective, lengthy delays in the processing of some business 
investments and expansions are common. Regulations have increasingly complicated the 
business environment. Moreover, the success of Gabonese enterprises depends largely 
upon their political connections. A 1992 "Gabonization" program forces employers to 
decrease the number of foreigners in their work force. The President has called upon 
foreign-owned businesses to hire more Gabonese workers.

<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	Germany is the largest economic power in the European Union. Nevertheless,  since 
reunification with East Germany, the Federal Republic has experienced a high unemployment rate 
of around 10 percent per year. To ease the pain of reunification, Germany has increased social 
spending, which now accounts for some 48 percent of total government expenditure. <FONT 
SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   Such large amounts of government spending by Germany and other 
European governments have taken Europe into a recession.
<P><IMG SRC="alb.gif">
<P><B>Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of protectionism)</I><BR>
Like the rest of the European Union, Germany maintains an average tariff rate of 3.6 percent. 
Germany is the second largest exporter in the world, behind only the U.S., exporting some 
$367 billion in goods in 1992. It is very reliant on open markets abroad. Moreover, it is one 
of the most open markets in the EU. However, Germany maintains some non-tariff 
barriers, such as overbearing consumer regulations on the labeling and testing of products. 
A U.S. Department of State report concludes: "Germany's regulations and bureaucratic 
procedures can prove a baffling maze, blunting the enthusiasm of U.S. exporters.... 
[G]overnment regulation does offer a degree of protection to German suppliers." <FONT 
SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>  Nevertheless, by global standards, Germany's level of protection 
is low.
<P><B>Factor #2: Taxation</B><BR> 
<I>Score - Income taxation: 5+ (Very high tax rates)<BR>
Score - Corporate taxation: 5+ (Very high tax rates)<BR>
Final Taxation Score: 5+ (Very high tax rates)</I><BR>
Germany's taxes remain among the highest in the industrialized world and the European Union. 
Germany's top income tax bracket is 53 percent. The tax on the average income level 
varies between 20 percent and 35 percent. In 1994, however, the top income tax rate will 
fall to 47 percent. But the rate applied to the average income will change little. Corporate 
profits are taxed twice. The top rate is 50 percent and is called a "corporation tax."  Those 
same profits are taxed additionally at rates that range from 12 percent to 20 percent, 
depending on the locality of the business. This is called a "locality tax." Thus, in 1992 a 
company's profits could have been taxed as high as 70 percent. The 50 percent top rate will 
fall to 45 percent in 1994. In addition, there are a 7.5 percent tax called a "solidarity 
supplementary surcharge," a 45 percent capital gains tax, a 15 percent valued-added tax, 
and land, property, and real estate taxes.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2- (Low level of government consumption)</I><BR>
Germany's total public consumption as a percentage of GDP was 17.9 percent in 1992, and 
that probably rose in 1993. After reunification, the German government extended its 
generous social welfare system to the former East Germany. Moreover, the German 
government expanded subsidies for private investment. These hefty expenditures have 
increased the role of the German government in the economy. Nevertheless, there seems to 
be a recognition that this social spending has gone too far. Germany's social security and 
welfare spending now amounts to about 48 percent of total government expenditures, 
compared to only 28 percent in the U.S. Nevertheless, by global standards, the level of 
government consumption of economic output is low.
<P><B>Factor #4: Monetary Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1- (Very low level of inflation)</I><BR>
Germany's inflation rate has been among the lowest in the world. Germany had an average 
annual rate of inflation from 1980 to 1991 of 2.2 percent. Inflation reached 4 percent in 
1992 and 3.9 percent in 1993. Germany has been so successful at managing its money 
supply since World War II that the German Mark has become the basis for the European 
monetary system.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Germany welcomes foreign investment. It is one of the few places in the world that imposes no 
permanent currency or administrative controls on foreign investments. However, it 
somewhat restricts investments in insurance, telecommunications, and other services.
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2+ (Low level of restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Germany is a world financial center and banking powerhouse. Some 60 foreign banks from 21 
countries had established German branches and subsidiaries in 1990. In addition, 193 
foreign banks from 39 countries have representative offices in Germany. The State 
Department reports that Germany's banking system is becoming more open to foreigners. 
Nevertheless, Germany still maintains some restrictions on foreign banks. All foreign banks 
must obtain a license to do business in Germany. This process can take up to four months, 
and in some cases the German bureaucracy can be cumbersome, acting as a barrier to 
banks that want to quickly establish themselves in Germany.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
Germany's free enterprise system is based on market-set prices and wages. Minimum wages 
are not fixed by law, but are the result of collective bargaining, which has brought average 
wage increases of between 3 percent and 4 percent annually since the 1980s. While wages 
are predominately set by the market, Germany still maintains a Federal Cartel Office (FCO) 
which monitors prices on specific goods and services. If prices rise quickly, the FCO 
initiates an investigation to discover whether the increase is a result of cartels or 
monopolies. If it is, fines are imposed and prices are reduced. In addition, Germany 
controls the price of rent and agricultural products. 
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1-Stable (Very high level of protection of private property )</I><BR>
Germany's economy is based on the private ownership of property. It is undergoing extensive 
privatization, especially in the former East Germany. Germany is pursuing privatization of 
state-owned property, and the chances of expropriation are virtually nonexistent. 
Germany's court system provides a very high level of property protection, as it is efficient 
and available for all types of dispute resolution.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 2-Stable (Low level of regulation)</I><BR>
Establishing a business in Germany is relatively easy, with little or no barriers to new business 
creation. All that is required is for a new business to notify the local economic supervisory 
office, which supplies a certificate. Corruption is absent, and regulations are applied evenly 
and consistently. However, Germany's employment, product safety, and environmental 
laws pose some burdens on business. Nevertheless, by global standards, Germany has a 
low level of regulation.
<P><B>Factor #10: Black Market</B><BR>
<I>Score: 1 (Very low level of black market activity)</I><BR>
Black markets in Germany involve such illegal activities as drugs and guns. Prostitution is 
legalized, as are some forms of gambling.

Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah quickly transformed Ghana into a one-party socialist state. This 
lasted until 1992 when Flight Lt. J.J. Rawlings legalized political parties. Rawlings won Ghana's 
1992 presidential elections, though their fairness has been questioned. An economic liberalization 
program begun by Rawlings in 1983 has improved what was a collapsing socialist economy. Annual 
growth has averaged 4.5 percent since then, giving Ghana one of Africa's best-performing 
economies. Ghana benefits from a relatively well-developed infrastructure and rich raw materials.

The government developed a new investment code in 1992 that eased restrictions on private

duties on specified products. One free trade zone exists at the port of Tema. Despite these 
liberalizing measures, restrictions on foreign investment remain in several sectors. An 
inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy stipulates the nature of investments, including the 
amount and source of capital, the nationality and number of shareholders, and training 
requirements for Ghanaian labor. Moreover, prospective investors are screened on a case-

Seven commercial banks operate over 200 branches throughout Ghana. Interest rate controls

The investment code guarantees private property against expropriation, which remains unlikely. 
However, domestically owned property is less secure than property obtained through

Soviet Union attempted to take over Greece in 1946. This led to a civil war in which many lives 
were lost. Greece emerged from the civil war as a Western democracy and joined the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952. It has been involved in a bitter stand-off with Turkey over the 
island of Cyprus, which both countries claim as their own. Since joining the European Community 
in 1981, Greece has worked to bring its economy in line with the other democracies of Europe. 
Four years of free market economic reforms undertaken by the conservative government of Prime

Guinea has been opening its economy to foreign investment since 1990. It has adopted an

many industrial sectors. Nevertheless, foreign investments remain at risk because of crime, 
an inefficient bureaucracy, and corruption.
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>

There are few restrictions on banks. Most are in private hands following a massive privatization

many people complain that credit is too tight and interest rates are too high.

1966. Since then, the country has followed mainly a socialist economic course. Guyana is among 
the poorest countries in the world. The government is controlled by the People's Progressive Party, 
which won the election in 1992. Guyana's past economic policies have seriously impeded economic

<P>	The Caribbean nation of Haiti has little economic freedom. Although turning toward 
democracy in February 1991, freely elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is not an advocate of 
free markets. Following his ouster by military coup in September 1991, the country was isolated 
economically and remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Given Aristide's anti-market 
past, the newly returned president is unlikely to launch major economic reforms.

Haiti has a top income tax rate of 30 percent. Haiti's tax collection system is so poor that it is 
impossible to determine which rate applies to the average income. Tax evasion is massive. 
Direct taxes paid represent only 15 percent of total receipts. <FONT SIZE="-

The most recent reliable figures for Haiti's government consumption are for 1987. In that year, according 
to the World Bank, central government expenditure as a percentage of gross national product was 18.7 
percent. However, this figure probably seriously understates the government's true consumption of GNP. 
<FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>
  Gross domestic product, for example, has shrunk every year since 1991. If estimated 
government expenditures remain relatively constant, Haiti's government consumption is 
estimated to be more than 25 percent of GDP.

Haiti's average annual inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 was 7.1 percent. However, in 1992 and

closer to 35 percent.

<I>Score: 5-Stable (Very high level of regulation)</I><BR>
Corruption is rampant. It was virtually impossible to open a business legally under the military 
regime. Members of the military used regulations as a way to extort goods and services 
from businesses. They would, for example, use force to confiscate products directly from 
vendors. With Aristide, these practices are likely to end. However, Haiti's bureaucracy still 
will be corrupt and will continue to pose a burden on business.

<P>	 India gained independence from Britain in 1947 and became a republic in 1950. For much 
of the following three decades, India pursued socialist economic policies, nationalizing industries, 
raising trade tariffs, subsidizing industries, and raising taxes. India's economy suffered as a result. 
However, India began to liberalize its economy in 1991, accepting foreign investment, and reducing 
barriers to trade. As a result, India's economy has been growing.

<P><B>Factor #1: Trade Policy</B><BR>
<I>Score: 5+ (Very high level of protectionism)</I><BR>
India had an average tariff rate of over 40 percent in 1992. In addition, India maintains non-
tariff barriers in a number of ways. For example, the government requires import licenses 
for such products as agricultural goods and pharmaceuticals. India has an outright import 
ban on some products, such as some textiles and clothing.

India's top income tax level is 52 percent. The tax on the average income level is about 20 
percent. India has a top corporate tax rate of 50 percent. India also maintains a 20 percent 
capital gains tax and interest and sales taxes.
<P><B>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of government consumption)</I><BR>

<I>Score: 2- (Low level of inflation)</I><BR>
India had an average annual inflation rate from 1980 to 1991 of 8.2 percent. Inflation reached 
10.1 percent in 1992.
<P><B>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate barriers to foreign investment)</I><BR>
Foreign investors cannot have 100 percent ownership of an Indian concern without government 
approval. Stock ownership is limited to 51 percent in many cases. Moreover, India's high 
trade tariffs stifle investments because businesses cannot import foreign components to 
manufacture their products. 
<P><B>Factor #6: Banking</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4+ (High level of restrictions on banking)</I><BR>
Most Indian banks are government-owned. Only three U.S. banks operate in India with plans 
for a fourth. These banks are under heavy government regulation. While plans exist to be 
more open to foreign banks, the banking market in India remains heavily regulated and 
government-controlled.
<P><B>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3+ (Moderate level of wage and price controls)</I><BR>
India maintains price controls on many items. In addition, the state subsidizes government-
owned enterprises, which has the effect of subsidizing prices. India has a minimum wage.
<P><B>Factor #8: Property Rights</B><BR>
<I>Score: 3-Stable (Moderate level of protection of private property)</I><BR>
The massive gap between rich and poor leads to government policies that redistribute wealth, 
mainly through direct property expropriation. While India has an efficient court system, 
property remains at risk in rural areas from crime and corruption.
<P><B>Factor #9: Regulation</B><BR>
<I>Score: 4-Stable (High level of regulation)</I><BR>
India's economy is heavily regulated. The large public sector must meet all kinds of 
requirements in order to remain open for business, including restrictive licensing

sector. Some corruption remains present.
