&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the coming days, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
may take up the matter of ratifying the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks (START II) Treaty. Signed by President George Bush on January
3, 1993, START II requires that the United States and Russia reduce
their strategic nuclear arsenals to no more than 3,500 deliverable
warheads. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee should not consent
to the ratification of START II, and thereby allow the U.S. strategic
nuclear arsenal to shrink to such low levels, unless the Clinton
Administration first makes some changes in the U.S. nuclear force
posture, strategy, and policy. Before reductions are made, the
U.S. must be committed to four goals:
<P>
1) Building a national missile defense system;
<P>
2) Devising a backup plan in case the reductions process breaks
down;
<P>
3) Continuing nuclear testing to ensure a safe and reliable arsenal;
and
<P>
4) Establishing a clear strategic nuclear targeting policy.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate can ensure that these changes are made by imposing
conditions on the ratification of START II. These are conditions
which the Clinton Administration would have to meet before the
treaty could be brought into force. While these conditions do
not affect the draft of the treaty, and thus would not involve
a renegotiation with the Russians, they would mandate that the
Clinton Administration correct some of the serious flaws in its
nuclear, strategic, and arms control policies.
<P>
<b>PROBLEMS WITH CLINTON'S STRATEGIC POLICY</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On September 22, 1994, the Clinton Administration released a study
of U.S. nuclear doctrine and force structure called the Nuclear
Posture Review (NPR).<sup>1</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The study was designed to establish a new nuclear policy for the
United States covering 1) nuclear doctrine, 2) the force structure
for both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, 3) nuclear arms
control matters, 4) nuclear command and control, and 5) safety
issues. One of the most important of the NPR's findings was that
the doctrine of intentional vulnerability to nuclear attack, called
Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), should be replaced with a
doctrine called Mutual Assured Safety (MAS). Another major conclusion
was that the U.S. should retain the existing &quot;triad&quot;
of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic
missiles, and heavy bombers, even with a smaller nuclear arsenal.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The NPR, however, presents a number of problems which must be
solved before the Senate agrees to ratify START II. Indeed, solving
these problems should be conditions which the Senate imposes on
the Administration before consenting to ratification.<sup>2</sup> 
<P>
<ul>
<LI><B>Problem #1: The Nuclear Posture Review fails to establish a
proper role for strategic defenses. </B>While the NPR declares
that Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) has been replaced with
Mutual Assured Safety (MAS), it fails to provide a clear definition
of this new doctrine. Furthermore, it fails to acknowledge that
strategic defenses, and particularly missile defenses, can play
an indispensable role in buttressing MAS.<sup>3</sup>  Discussion of strategic
defenses was omitted because such weapons are not nuclear-armed
and therefore were deemed to be outside the scope of the study.
This is a mistake. What matters is the strategic nature of missile
defenses, not whether they are nuclear-armed. Missile defenses
are strategic weapons that must be considered in devising a strategy
of Mutual Assured Safety.
<P>
<LI><B>Solution #1: Condition the ratification of START II on submitting
a plan to deploy strategic defenses. </B>In light of the decision
to replace MAD with MAS, the Clinton Administration needs to revisit
the recommendation to defer deployment of strategic defenses.
The President made this decision in 1993 when his Administration
completed its study of conventional military forces, called the
Bottom-Up Review. A deployment plan should provide for defenses
not only against ballistic missiles, but against bombers and cruise
missiles as well. Absent such a plan, U.S. territory and the American
people will remain vulnerable to the broad array of strategic
weapons deployed by foreign countries. This vulnerability will
exist at a time when an increasing number of countries are building
ballistic missiles and the political stability of Russia is uncertain.
The Clinton Administration needs to back up its MAS promises with
action. It needs to present a plan for deploying missile defenses.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate can require the President to order the Secretary of
Defense to revisit the issue of deploying strategic defenses.
Both the House and Senate versions of the FY 1996 Defense authorization
bill already contain provisions requiring the Secretary of Defense
to produce a plan for developing and perhaps deploying a national
missile defense system. But the bill is bogged down in a House-Senate
conference and under the threat of a veto by the President. To
get around this problem, the Senate could impose a condition on
the ratification of START II:  The President should order the
Secretary of Defense to submit a plan to Congress for deployment
of strategic defenses.
<P>
<LI><B>Problem #2: The Clinton Administration has failed to articulate
which steps should be taken if the arms reduction process breaks
down.</B> The NPR requires the Pentagon to maintain a &quot;hedge&quot;
against a breakdown in the arms control process. It fails to state,
however, which steps the U.S. would take under adverse circumstances.
For example, nothing is said about what the U.S. should do if
the Russians delay in implementing the START treaties, or refuse
even to comply with them. In short, the term &quot;hedge&quot;
remains undefined. Since the NPR's force structure recommendations
are predicated on the implementation of START II and START I,
the Clinton Administration essentially is assuming that nothing
can go wrong with the reduction process.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But something already is going wrong:  America is reducing its
nuclear arsenal faster than Russia. The U.S. has cut its arsenal
to 6,000 deliverable warheads, while Russia retains 9,000.<sup>4</sup>  This
kind of unilateral disarmament undermines the strategic balance.
If this trend continues, America may end up with too few weapons
to cover all its strategic targets. Even if the Russians are not
technically in violation of START II, a targeting disparity could
emerge if the U.S. continues to disarm unilaterally. If the U.S.
rushes to disarm too quickly, there will be a disparity between
the number of U.S. nuclear warheads and their respective targets
in Russia  the very nuclear missiles the Russians have been so
slow to dismantle. If Russia were to drag its feet, it would violate
START II. As things now stand, the U.S. would have no recourse
but to issue diplomatic complaints about such violations. There
currently are no provisions specifying how the U.S. strategic
force posture should be adjusted if the disarmament process breaks
down.
<P>
<LI><B>Solution #2: Condition ratification of START II on a halt in
U.S. reductions and, if necessary, the reconstitution of U.S.
strategic nuclear forces if the disarmament process breaks down.
</B>The Clinton Administration, at a minimum, needs to declare
that it will halt the disarmament process if the disparity in
the pace of U.S. and Russian reductions becomes too great. In
addition, the U.S. should state unequivocally that if the Russians
seem poised to break out of the START treaties, it will reconstitute
its nuclear force to the levels necessary to hold the larger Russian
nuclear force at risk.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, in keeping with these provisions, before it agrees to the
ratification of START II, the Senate should impose the following
requirements on the President:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <b>A declaration</b> that the U.S. will halt reductions and reconstitute
the strategic nuclear force if the disarmament process breaks
down;
<P>
<LI> <b>A halt</b> to dismantling strategic nuclear weapons under START
I and START II any time the number of accountable warheads in
the strategic nuclear arsenal of the United States is 500 fewer
than in the strategic nuclear arsenal of Russia;
<P>
<LI> <b>A resumption</b> of U.S. reductions only after Russia has lowered
its strategic nuclear arsenal to a level equal to that of the
United States; and
<P>
<LI><b> A plan</b> to begin rebuilding U.S. strategic nuclear forces in
six months if the number of accountable Russian warheads has not
been reduced to U.S. levels.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Problem #3: The Clinton Administration has no plan if countries
other than Russia build or expand their nuclear arsenals.</B>
The NPR, for good reasons, is focused primarily on Russia. To
be sure, Russia retains one of the largest strategic nuclear arsenals
in the world. Moreover, it remains the only country capable of
destroying the U.S. Nevertheless, because START I and START II
will shrink America's nuclear arsenal dramatically, the U.S. must
be cognizant of nuclear weapons development in other countries
 such known proliferators as China and North Korea, for example
 which may threaten the American people. Otherwise, the combined
threat of Russian and other nuclear arsenals could put the U.S.
at a strategic disadvantage. 
<P>
<B>Solution #3: Condition ratification of START II on a declaration
that the U.S. will withdraw from START II if countries other than
Russia significantly expand their nuclear arsenals. </B>Article
VI of the START II Treaty permits either party to withdraw, with
six months notice, if it determines that &quot;extraordinary events
related to the subject matter of this Treaty have jeopardized
its supreme interests.&quot;  The Senate should require the President
to notify the Russians that the expansion of strategic arsenals
by countries other than Russia may well cause the U.S. to exercise
its option to withdraw under Article VI.
<P>
<LI><B>Problem #4: The Clinton Administration has failed to explain
how the U.S. can retain a modern, safe, and reliable nuclear arsenal
without nuclear testing. </B>The NPR fails to explain how the
safety and reliability of the nuclear arsenal it recommends can
be ensured absent underground explosive tests of nuclear weapons.
If the NPR is clear in declaring that the U.S. will remain a nuclear
power for the foreseeable future, it is not clear as to how it
will assure this outcome without conducting explosive weapons
tests. President Clinton announced on August 11 that he desires
to extend the current moratorium on U.S. nuclear testing until
the ratification of a comprehensive test ban treaty. In reality,
a modern, safe, and reliable nuclear arsenal cannot be maintained
under a comprehensive test ban. The U.S. cannot remain a nuclear
power indefinitely, nor can it modernize its arsenal, if a truly
comprehensive ban on testing is adopted.<sup>5</sup>
<P>
<LI><B>Solution #4: Condition ratification of START II on the resumption
of nuclear testing. </B>The Senate needs to be absolutely clear
in expressing its determination that the U.S. will retain the
capable and reliable nuclear arsenal recommended by the NPR. It
can do so by requiring the Clinton Administration to order the
Department of Energy to conduct at least one underground nuclear
test per year until a comprehensive test ban treaty is ratified
by the United States and enters into force.
<P>
<LI><B>Problem #5: The Clinton Administration has failed to clarify
the connection between its strategic policy of Mutual Assured
Safety (MAS) and the targeting requirements established for the
U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal.</B> A strategic policy like Mutual
Assured Safety is designed to define both the purpose and the
mission of the strategic nuclear arsenal. The purpose should be
to deter an enemy attack on the U.S. or, if deterrence fails,
to stop that attack with nuclear weapons and strategic defenses.
The mission of U.S. strategic forces, whether they be offensive
or defensive, can be defined by assigning enemy missiles and other
strategic objects as &quot;targets&quot; for U.S. forces (called
targeting requirements).<sup>6</sup>  For example, if the mission of the strategic
nuclear arsenal is to deter an attack by threatening the civilian
populations of potential aggressor nations, the targets will be
urban centers. If, on the other hand, the mission is to deter
attack by threatening enemy missiles, the missiles themselves
will be the targets.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The public description of the NPR provides only the most cursory
definition of the targeting requirements it established for the
strategic nuclear arsenal. The NPR is classified, but press releases
state only that targeting requirements are based on &quot;projected
military requirements.&quot;<sup>7</sup>  Absent some explanation of what
&quot;projected military requirements&quot; means, there is no
clear indication that these targeting requirements are connected
in any way to MAS policy. In other words, it is not clear whether
potential enemy missiles will be targeted for destruction by America's
offensive and defensive strategic arsenal. If they are not, Clinton's
MAS policy will have no practical meaning.
<P>
<LI><B>Solution #5: Condition ratification of START II on the establishment
of strategic targeting requirements that assume the destruction
of weapons that threaten the United States. </B>If the word &quot;safety&quot;
has any meaning, the Clinton Administration's strategic policy
should seek to protect the American people against nuclear weapons.
How can safety be achieved?  By developing a strategic mission
for both offensive and defensive weapons that would destroy enemy
missiles and the infrastructure that supports them. The infrastructure
would include such things as strategic nuclear command and control
centers and storage facilities. The purpose of this strategy would
be to use both offensive (nuclear missiles and bombers) and defensive
(anti-missile missiles) weapons to limit damage from an attack
on the U.S.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate can ensure that these targeting requirements are reflected
in America's strategic policy. The Senate can condition the ratification
of START II on adoption of these targeting requirements. Furthermore,
the Administration should be required to certify that the vast
majority of U.S. strategic weapons are targeted on the weapons
that threaten U.S. territory and their supporting infrastructure.
This will ensure that the Administration has taken the necessary
steps to implement the targeting policy required by the condition.<sup>8</sup>
 Finally, the Senate should require the Administration to notify
both houses of Congress in advance of any future changes in strategic
targeting policy. With this provision, future Congresses will
not be caught by surprise in the event there is a decision to
change the targeting policy. 
<P>
</UL>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) has
declared that Mutually Assured Destruction is no longer U.S. policy.
This is a step in the right direction. The U.S. is entering a
period in world history where the threat of retaliation with nuclear
weapons is less likely to deter an attack on the U.S. But the
NPR also contains a number of problems. It does not account adequately
for the role of strategic defenses, and it fails to explain how
the U.S. would react if the nuclear arms reduction process breaks
down. Until these problems are resolved, it would be foolish for
the Senate to agree to the dramatic reductions in the U.S. strategic
nuclear arsenal required by START II.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Senate Foreign Relations Committee can use the opportunity
presented by the ratification of START II to solve the problems
presented by the NPR. This can be done by imposing conditions
on the ratification of START II. Once these conditions are imposed,
the Senate can and should consent to ratification. Only then can
the treaty really help to protect the American people from nuclear
attack.

<P>
Sample Resolution of Ratification
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I>Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring therein),</I>
That the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of the
Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation
on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Weapons
signed at Moscow on January 3, 1993, including Protocols on Elimination
or Conversion and Inspections, and Memorandum of Understanding
on Warhead Attribution (all transmitted within Treaty Doc. 103-1);
all such documents being integral parts of, and collectively referred
to as, the &quot;START II Treaty,&quot; subject to the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> (1) CONDITIONS.  The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification
of the START II Treaty is subject to the following conditions,
which shall be binding upon the President:
<P>
(1) A PLAN FOR DEPLOYING STRATEGIC DEFENSES.  Prior to the exchange
of the instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, the
President shall order the Secretary of Defense to submit to the
Senate and the House of Representatives, by no later than six
months following the issuance of the order, a plan that --
<UL> 
<P>
<LI>(A) recommends the deployment of strategic defenses to counter
the following strategic weapons, which may be used to attack the
territory of the United States and against which the offensive
strategic nuclear arsenal cannot readily be used:  1) mobile intercontinental
ballistic missiles; 2) submarine-launched ballistic missiles;
3) long-range bombers; 4) cruise missiles;
<P>
<LI>(B) recommends providing the means for destroying at least 50
percent of weapons in each category of weapons described in subparagraph
(A) likely to be deployed by Russia after the implementation of
the START II Treaty;
<P>
<LI>(C) includes a plan for the deployment of a national missile defense
system that combines sea-based and space-based systems such that
when the entire system is deployed it is capable of meeting the
requirements established by subparagraph (B) for countering mobile
intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic
missiles.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>(2) PRESIDENTIAL ORDER ON HALTING THE DISARMAMENT PROCESS AND
RECONSTITUTING THE STRATEGIC NUCLEAR FORCE.  Prior to the exchange
of the instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, the
President shall issue an order to the Department of Defense requiring
it to  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(A) discontinue dismantling strategic nuclear weapons under the
START Treaty and the START II Treaty at any time the number of
accountable warheads in the strategic nuclear arsenal of the United
States is 500 fewer than in the strategic nuclear arsenal of Russia;
<P>
<LI>(B) resume dismantling the strategic nuclear weapons of the United
States after the United States halts the disarmament process pursuant
to the requirements of subparagraph (A) only after Russia has
reduced its strategic nuclear arsenal to a level equal to that
of the United States in terms of accountable warheads;
<P>
<LI>(C) initiate the drafting of a plan to reconstitute U.S. strategic
nuclear forces at the time the United States halts the disarmament
process pursuant to the requirement established by subparagraph
(A), which shall be submitted to the President for his consideration
if the number of accountable warheads in the strategic nuclear
arsenal of Russia has not been reduced to a level that equals
the number of accountable nuclear warheads in the strategic arsenal
of the United States by six months following the initiation of
the drafting of the plan. 
</UL>
<P>
<LI>(3) EXPANDING STRATEGIC ARSENALS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN RUSSIA.
 If during the time the START II Treaty remains in force there
is an expansion of strategic arsenals by countries not party to
the Treaty, the supreme interests of the United States could be
jeopardized. Should that occur, it would constitute a basis for
withdrawal from the START II Treaty. This statement shall be communicated
by the President to the Russian Federation, in such form as he
deems appropriate.
<P>
<LI>(4) NUCLEAR TESTING.  Prior to the exchange of the instruments
of ratification of the START II Treaty, the President shall issue
an order to the Department of Energy requiring it to  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(A) conduct no less than one underground nuclear explosive test
in each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year that starts
immediately following the entry of the START II Treaty into force;
<P>
<LI>(B) halt the conduct of underground nuclear tests only after the
United States and an adequate number of additional countries ratify
a comprehensive test ban treaty in order to bring the test ban
treaty into force;
<P>
<LI>(C) pay for the tests described in subparagraph (A) from funds
Congress may make available to the nuclear stockpile stewardship
program.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>(5) STRATEGIC NUCLEAR TARGETING REQUIREMENTS.  Prior to the exchange
of the instruments of ratification of the START II Treaty, the
President shall certify to the Senate that  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(A) the targeting requirements for strategic nuclear weapons of
the United States, along with those for strategic defensive weapons,
are based on a policy that seeks to limit, to the greatest extent
possible, the damage that would otherwise be inflicted on the
territory of the United States from an attack with strategic weapons
by seeking to destroy such weapons and their supporting infrastructure
in a timely and effective manner;
<P>
<LI>(B) the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States, along
with strategic defensive weapons, are now targeted primarily,
although not necessarily exclusively, on the strategic weapons
deployed by nations other than the United States that may pose
a threat to the territory of the United States and their supporting
infrastructure;
<P>
<LI>(C) the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be notified
in advance of any future changes in the policy governing the targeting
requirements for the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States.

<center><h3><i> WILL AMERICA REMAIN A NUCLEAR POWER?  
IMPLICATIONS OF CLINTON'S NUCLEAR TEST BAN</h3></i>
<p>
By Baker Spring<br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Executive Memorandum #427<br>
August 27, 1995<br>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
	" . .. ..  I can foresee a time early in the next century when America will no longer be a nuclear power."
<p>
	
	 -- Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, June 21, 1994</center>
<P>
	On August 11, President Bill Clinton announced a ban on all U.S.  nuclear tests.  This decision is a major step toward making Senator Thurmond's prediction come true.  It effectively reverses the policy the Clinton Administration adopted less than a year ago.  The September 1994 Nuclear Posture Review found that the U.S.  must maintain a stockpile of reliable, safe, and effective nuclear weapons to deter any potential adversaries and fulfill its security commitments.  Because such a stockpile cannot be maintained without testing, President Clinton effectively has committed the nation to unilateral nuclear disarmament.
<p>
	President Clinton's case for a comprehensive nuclear test ban is based on a number of misperceptions about nuclear testing.
<ul>
<li><b>The Administration asserts that nuclear tests are not needed to maintain a stockpile of reliable, safe, and effective nuclear weapons. </b>  Tests are needed.  This was the conclusion of a non-partisan panel of scientists, chaired by Stanford University scientist Sidney Drell, in a report submitted to the House Armed Services Committee in 1990.  Dr.  Drell stood behind this assessment as recently as 1992, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
<p>
	Drell now chairs another study group which has reached the opposite conclusion.  The JASON group, in a report released on August 4, concludes that tests no longer are required to maintain a stockpile of safe, reliable, and effective nuclear weapons.  What accounts for Drell's change of opinion is unclear.  However, even the JASON study hedges on the question of adopting an outright ban on testing.  Its authors conclude that continuing tests of nuclear weapons below the kiloton level can add to long-term stockpile confidence and that unforeseen problems might require the U.S.  to withdraw from a comprehensive test ban treaty. 
<p>
	<li><b>A comprehensive test ban rests on the assumption that America need not develop any new nuclear weapons.</b>  This assumption is false.  The <i>Minuteman III</i> intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which is the only ICBM the U.S.  will retain after implementation of the Strategic Arms Reduction (START) II Treaty, was first deployed in 1970.  If there is no further testing, the <i>Minuteman III</i> will never be replaced with a new missile.  The more modern MX missile will be dismantled under START II.
<p>
	A new missile will be required simply to replace the aging <i>Minuteman III</i>.  But it also will be needed for another reason.  New missile designs will be more accurate, and this will make them more lethal against hardened military targets.
<p>
	<li><b>The President asserts that the nuclear test ban will expedite the adoption of a comprehensive test ban (CTB) treaty.</b>  Even if a CTB treaty is negotiated, the evidence indicates the Senate will not consent to its ratification.  In fact, on August 4, the Senate voted by a margin of 56 to 44 to fund the sort of tests the Clinton policy and a CTB treaty would ban.  Senate consent to ratification of a CTB treaty will require 67 votes, assuming all 100 Senators are voting.  This means that President Clinton will have to find 23 more votes in the Senate to support his desire for a CTB treaty. 
<p>
	Even if a CTB treaty were ratified, it would not impose a global ban on testing.  No country would be compelled to sign the treaty, and even those that do could circumvent it by conducting very-low-yield tests that could not be verified.  Thus, the Clinton policy will not achieve a comprehensive global ban on testing.  However, it will impose a unilateral ban on the U.S.
<p>
	<li><b>The Administration assumes that a CTB can be verified.</b>  The truth is that it will be impossible to verify whether very small nuclear explosions have taken place.  Most nuclear tests can be detected through seismic sensors.  But these sensors are not likely to be sensitive enough to detect a secret test of a very-low-yield device.  Even the JASON group study concludes that monitoring compliance with a treaty barring such tests would require cooperative, on-site monitoring. 
<p>
	<li><b>The Administration asserts that barring nuclear tests in the United States will prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms around the globe.</b>  In fact, a test ban will spur proliferation.  The U.S.  nuclear arsenal serves as a barrier to proliferation, not as an incentive.  U.S.  allies like Germany and Japan are less likely to desire nuclear weapons as long as they view the U.S.  nuclear guarantee as viable.  One of the measures of this viability is the safety and reliability of the U.S.  nuclear force, and this requires testing. 
</ul><p>
	America's nuclear deterrent is a force for good in the world.  Nothing will invite the acquisition and possible use of nuclear weapons by rogue states more than U.S.  nuclear disarmament.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	President Clinton's decision to bar future tests of U.S.  nuclear weapons is short-sighted.  It will not help eliminate the world's arsenal of nuclear weapons.  However, it could result in unilateral disarmament for the U.S.
<p>
	The U.S.  already has been down a similar road.  In the late 1960s, the U.S.  unilaterally banned the development and stockpiling of biological weapons.  But other countries, including Iraq and the Soviet Union, continued to develop and stockpile such weapons, regardless of the 1972 treaty banning them.  The result was that the U.S.  ceased to possess a weapon that other countries continued to build.  President Clinton has adopted a policy that will lead inevitably to the same sort of inequitable outcome with respect to nuclear weapons.  This is a course fraught with risk for U.S.  national security.

The Missile Defense Act of 1995: The Senate's Historic Opportunity -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<CENTER><H3><I> THE MISSILE DEFENSE ACT OF 1995:
THE SENATE'S HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY</h3></I>
<p>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/moore.html">Thomas Moore</a><br>
Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #423<br>
August 1, 1995.<br>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

	Americans concerned about the growing threat of ballistic missiles can take comfort in the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1996, S. 1026, recently reported from the Senate Armed Services Committee. Soon the full Senate will begin consideration of S. 1026, which contains a new Missile Defense Act. If enacted, it could infuse new life into the nation's ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, crippled by the neglect -- and in some cases the outright opposition -- of the Clinton Administration. But supporters of missile defense in the Senate should not be complacent. They should expect floor amendments from BMD's traditional opponents attacking key provisions of the BMD section.
<p>
<b>THE "NEW, IMPROVED" MISSILE DEFENSE ACT</b>
<p>
	S. 1026 replaces the Missile Defense Act of 1991 with a new Missile Defense Act designed to put the nation on a clear course toward deployment of Theater Missile Defenses (TMD) against shorter-range regional missile threats and a National Missile Defense (NMD) of the U.S. homeland against long-range strategic ballistic missiles. It also includes a Cruise Missile Defense initiative for the first time. And it addresses, though does not completely resolve, the problem of the 1972 ABM Treaty, which limits defense of the homeland against strategic ballistic missiles (but does not limit theater defenses).
<p>
	The most positive and significant elements of the new Missile Defense Act are:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Section 234</b>, which accelerates Theater Missile Defense and focuses the TMD program on four "core" systems.<br>

<li><b>Section 235</b>, which calls for deployment of a ground-based National Missile Defense with multiple sites, to be operational by the year 2003. <br>

<li><b>Section 237</b>, calling for a transition from the ABM Treaty regime to a strategic doctrine that is not based on Mutual Assured Destruction, or "MAD."  It would establish a Senate Select Committee to conduct a one-year review of the Treaty's validity in today's new strategic environment, and recommend a course of action for gaining relief from the Treaty's limitations. Relief from the Treaty will be necessary before a multiple-site National Missile Defense can become operational.<br>

<li><b>Section 238</b>, which establishes an ABM Treaty "demarcation" or technical performance threshold that determines whether a BMD system is a theater defense system not limited by the Treaty or a Treaty-limited defense against "strategic ballistic missiles."  If the BMD system in question is flight-tested against a target missile with a range less than 3,500 kilometers and a velocity of less than 5 kilometers per second, then it is a theater defense system and is not covered by the Treaty. If the system is flight-tested against a target missile with a range and velocity above this threshold, then the system is a strategic defense and is covered by the Treaty.
</ul><p>
<b>LIKELY ATTACKS ON BMD IN THE SENATE</b>
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation has proposed an even more robust BMD program to meet the most critical threat to the U.S. homeland, to U.S. forces abroad, and to America's allies -- the threat of ballistic missiles. (1) While the Senate bill does not go as far as the Heritage Foundation "Team B" proposal, it still represents considerable progress toward an effective defense. For that very reason, there may be an attack by opponents of the Missile Defense Act. This would come in the form of floor amendments by Senators traditionally opposed to missile defense.
<p>
<b>Possible Amendment #1:</b> Striking or reducing recommended funding levels. The Senate bill adds $490.5 million to the Administration's budget request for the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, for a total of $3.4 billion. This includes $45.0 million for the Navy Lower Tier system, $170.0 million for Navy Upper Tier, and $300.0 million for National Missile Defense.
<p>
<b>Recommended Response:</b> Even with these additions, a $3.4 billion BMD program represents less than 1.5 percent of the defense budget -- to meet the most serious threat to U.S. security. The U.S. has conducted BMD research for over ten years, and proven technology is now available. The time has come to build and field BMD systems to protect Americans. That requires adequate funds. 
<p>
<b>Possible Amendment #2:</b> Watering down the demarcation standard between permissible TMD and Treaty-limited strategic defenses (Section 238).
<p>
<b>Recommended Response:</b> Despite the vigorous opposition of both houses of Congress, the Administration has persisted in misguided efforts to expand the ABM Treaty to include limits on modern theater defense systems, which are more capable than the systems that existed when the Treaty entered into force in 1972. Unless the Senate wants the ABM Treaty to be become an ABM-TMD Treaty and cripple the performance of the most promising theater systems, this provision is necessary.
<p>
<b>Possible Amendment #3:</b> Eliminating the Select Committee to review the ABM Treaty (Section 237).
<p>
<b>Recommended Response:</b> Section 237 would not force the abrogation or amendment of the Treaty, though it could lead to changes in the Treaty at some future point. But the ABM Treaty is 23 years old, a relic of the Cold War. Today's strategic environment is totally different from that of 1972. Ballistic missile technology and weapons of mass destruction are proliferating worldwide, and the U.S. faces potential missile threats from many regions, not just the former Soviet Union. No treaty should be an end in itself. When the conditions that led to a treaty's ratification change, that treaty should change. The ABM Treaty itself acknowledges this principle, and contains provisions for withdrawal when it no longer serves the national interest.
<p>
<b>Possible Amendment #4:</b> Eliminating or altering a multiple-site NMD (Section 235). 
<p>
<b>Recommended Response:</b> A single NMD site -- for example, at Grand Forks, North Dakota -- would be Treaty compliant but would not protect all of the continental United States, and certainly not Alaska or Hawaii, from a missile attack in the Northern Hemisphere. Coastal regions also would be vulnerable to missiles launched from submarines or from locations in the Third World. The choice is simple:  to protect the U.S. homeland against a limited attack or remain within a treaty that is both technologically and strategically outmoded.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The Senate has an historic opportunity to reinvigorate the BMD program and put the United States on the path to actual defenses for the homeland and forces abroad. As President Ronald Reagan once said, "If not now, when?  If not us, who?"  But supporters of missile defense in the Senate must act boldly, steadfastly, and with vision. Otherwise the U.S. will remain mired in the failed orthodoxies of the past that have left Americans needlessly vulnerable to the most threatening weapons in the world today.<p>

CLINTON'S ABM TREATY MUDDLE -- Heritage </title>
<center><h3><i>CLINTON'S ABM TREATY MUDDLE</h3></i>
<p>

By Kim R. Holmes<br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies1<br>and Baker Spring Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Committee Brief No. 16<br>
July 7, 1995<br>
</center><hr size=3 width = 30%><p>

    The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is at the heart of the debate on ballistic missile defense. Whether to proceed more
quickly or more slowly to deploy missile defenses, and in what way, or whether to proceed at all, is determined by how
the ABM Treaty is viewed. The strategic assumptions underlying the treaty, forged during the Cold War, are very
much alive in the Clinton Administration. They drive the Administration's approach not only to missile defense policy,
but also to arms control and even U.S. policy toward Russia. In short, the Clinton Administration's policy toward the
ABM Treaty has larger significance than the treaty itself. Maintaining the treaty, in fact, is a major force driving overall
U.S. strategic policy.
<p>
    The ABM Treaty is indeed important to the Clinton Administration, but its approach has been inconsistent and
confusing. These inconsistencies raise questions about the ultimate purpose of the Administration's strategic policy.
Why does the Administration believe that America should be vulnerable to ballistic missile attack, even though
countering nuclear proliferation is a top Administration policy?  Why does this Administration want to defend U.S.
allies and forces overseas but leave American citizens and territory vulnerable to nuclear attack?  And why is the
Administration expanding the scope of the ABM Treaty to limit theater missile defenses, even though this was never
intended by the original architects of the Treaty or called for in its text?
<p>
    These questions show that the Clinton Administration's approach to the ABM Treaty is filled with
contradictions. A coherent strategic policy cannot be developed until these contradictions and inconsistencies are
resolved. These inconsistencies are: 
<P><ul><li>The Administration has declared the ABM Treaty to be "a cornerstone of strategic stability," while disowning the
mutual assured destruction (MAD) doctrine that serves as the underlying premise of the ABM Treaty.
<p>

<li>The Clinton Administration declared the central importance of the ABM Treaty to U.S. strategic policy in a
May 10 joint declaration issued during the President's meeting in Moscow with Russian President Boris Yeltsin:  "The
United States and Russia are each committed to the ABM Treaty, a cornerstone of strategic stability."  Yet Secretary
of Defense William Perry during a September 20, 1994, speech before the Henry L. Stimson Center declared:  "We
now have the opportunity to create a new relationship, based not on MAD, not on Mutual Assured Destruction, but
rather on another acronym, MAS, or Mutual Assured Safety."
</ul><p>
For many years, the basic assumption behind the ABM Treaty was that the ability of the Soviet Union (and
later Russia) and the United States to destroy each other was the central factor in maintaining strategic stability. The
ABM Treaty was designed to ensure that this vulnerability continued. It was believed that this mutual vulnerability also
was the key to maintaining and even enhancing arms control, which was the most important policy priority for
defenders of the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    While this assumption was questionable, it was at least backed by a clear and consistent policy. But if MAD
is no longer the guiding principle of U.S. doctrine, then the ABM Treaty can no longer serve as a cornerstone of
strategic stability. Either President Clinton is wrong in the May 10 joint declaration or Secretary Perry is wrong in his
September 20 statement that MAD is no longer U.S. policy. Both cannot be right.
<p>
    Some will argue that MAD and the ABM Treaty were never meant to constitute a nuclear strategy. Rather,
they argue, MAD and the ABM Treaty were only tools for achieving limitations on offensive arms. The goal
supposedly was arms control, not mutual vulnerability. The intention supposedly was strategic stability, not to enshrine
MAD as America's main strategic doctrine.
<p>
    This line of argument suggests that we should ignore the effects of the policy and focus only on the declared
intention:  arms control. But while the intention was supposed to be strategic stability, the effect was necessarily
strategic vulnerability. In fact, vulnerability was considered to be the key to stability. This is the central premise of the
ABM Treaty. Call it MAD or merely offensive deterrence, this strategy absolutely required mutual vulnerability as a
fundamental strategic premise. It cannot logically be argued otherwise. It is myopic to claim that the effect -- mutual
vulnerability -- has nothing whatsoever to do with the intention -- maintaining a strategic balance of offensive forces.
The former is a direct consequence of the latter.
<p>
     Moreover, if the purpose of MAD and the ABM Treaty was merely to limit offensive nuclear arms during the
Cold War, then they were colossal failures. The Soviets increased the number of deliverable strategic nuclear warheads
in their arsenal from just over 2,000 in 1972, the year the ABM Treaty was ratified, to over 12,000 by 1990. 
<p>
     But that is not all. A strong U.S. strategic defense program is far more conducive to offensive reductions than
the ABM Treaty ever was or ever will be. During the 1980s progress toward offensive reductions occurred only after
the U.S. made it clear to the Soviets that the Strategic Defense Initiative would proceed. The Intermediate-range
Nuclear Force agreement, the START I Treaty, and the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty were reached during a
time when the U.S. was committed to moving forward on strategic defenses. It is ironic that no major arms control
agreement with the Russians has been initiated by the Clinton Administration, which has scaled back America's missile
defense programs.2 It is, in fact, no accident; the Russians are quicker to reach arms control agreements
with the U.S. when they face a determined U.S. missile defense program than when they face a weak
one.
<p>
    President Clinton has stated that it is not his intention to apply ABM Treaty-related restrictions to theater
missile defense systems, but his actions indicate otherwise. 
<p>
     The ABM Treaty was never intended to impose any restrictions on theater missile defense systems. In a
January 26, 1995, letter to congressional leaders, President Clinton stated that he understood this and was not seeking
a policy of "expanding the ABM Treaty's limitations."  The Moscow joint declaration, however, either states explicitly
or implies that the U.S. is prepared to impose a whole host of restrictions on U.S. theater missile defense systems.
Specifically, the joint declaration states explicitly that the U.S. will accept limits not only on the number of theater
missile defense systems it may deploy, but also on where they may be deployed. Further, since the Administration
seems to assume that negotiations that are the subject of the joint declaration are about interpreting, not amending, the
ABM Treaty, its policy presumes that these limitations are required by the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    We have been a students of the ABM Treaty for a number of years now, and we cannot find any provisions
that impose limits on the number and location of theater missile defense system deployments. The Clinton
Administration, ignoring its own assertions to the contrary, is in fact seeking to expand the scope of the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    Some in the Clinton Administration have argued that there is no need to be concerned about the Moscow joint
declaration because it is not binding and therefore does not represent a legal expansion of the ABM Treaty.
Technically, this is true. Nevertheless, the joint declaration presumably reflects the true intentions and policy
preferences of the Clinton Administration. In fact, it establishes the goal for the Administration in these negotiations.
Surely the Clinton Administration would not want to argue that its intentions are meaningless or that they are not to be
taken seriously. On the contrary, these intentions represent the desired outcome of policy. In this respect, they should
be taken seriously, especially by the Senate, which has a constitutional interest in substantive changes to treaties. The
Moscow joint declaration represents a declaration of policy that the Clinton Administration intends to expand the scope
of the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    While the Clinton Administration is seeking to expand both the scope and the membership of the ABM Treaty,
which would require legally binding protocols, it appears to oppose taking the required procedural steps.
<p>
    Expanding the scope of the ABM Treaty and establishing new ABM Treaty partners to replace the Soviet
Union are not mere interpretations of ABM Treaty requirements, as argued by the Clinton Administration. They are
substantive changes in the treaty. They require formal protocols, similar to the 1974 protocol to the ABM Treaty
reducing the number of allowed ABM sites from two to one and the 1992 Lisbon Protocol to the START Treaty that
established successors to the Soviet Union. The Administration, however, has studiously avoided making any
commitments about the legal form of any ABM Treaty agreements. Indeed, it behaves as if the discussions are only
about interpreting the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    While it has received less attention in the press than the question of restrictions on theater defenses, this
procedural issue is particularly important with regard to the question of successorship. The Clinton Administration
states that the ABM Treaty is a cornerstone of strategic stability but cannot say which countries, other than the United
States, are parties to the treaty. As such, the ABM Treaty is now a unilateral obligation that imposes restrictions only
on the United States. This is both unjust and contrary to customary international practice. A treaty is similar to a
contract. The parties must be clearly identified and legally bound. No country can be bound by treaty obligations
unilaterally. The ABM Treaty will remain in legal limbo unless and until a legally binding protocol identifying the
successors to the Soviet Union under the treaty is ratified. The Clinton Administration, while stating it wants to
preserve the ABM Treaty, has made no commitment to taking the legally required steps to preserve it.
<p>
    Some in the Clinton Administration argue that this concern about successorship is a whole lot about nothing,
or as Standing Consultative Commission representative Stanley Riveles recently said, "a political argument posing as
a legal one.3"  Riveles and others maintain that since other treaties, like the INF agreement, lack
protocols and yet remain in force, there is no need to negotiate and ratify protocols for the ABM
Treaty.
<p>
    This argument is not convincing. The successorship of the INF Treaty has not been resolved and that treaty,
too, remains in legal limbo. Pointing to the legal problems of the INF Treaty hardly strengthens the case against
ignoring the successorship issue in the ABM Treaty. Both the INF Treaty and the ABM Treaty need successorship
protocols. 
<p>
     Moreover, the ABM Treaty presents far more successorship problems than does the INF Treaty. The Clinton
Administration apparently is offering successorship of the ABM Treaty to all countries of the former Soviet Union.
That is, the Administration desires to "multilateralize" the ABM Treaty by naming at least several of the former
republics of the Soviet Union as the legal successors to the Soviet Union. However, doing this creates a thorny legal
problem:  it changes the substance of the Treaty in a way that requires the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. If all
15 former Soviet republics were designated as legal successors to the Soviet Union, it would imply that as many as 15
ABM sites (one for each designated successor republic) could be legally permitted, whereas formerly only two (and
later one) were allowed in all the Soviet Union. Moreover, multilateralizing the ABM Treaty would substantively
change the procedures of the Standing Consultative Commission. The procedures established for resolving issues
between two partners would have to give way to voting procedures to accommodate as many as 16 partners.
<p>
    Another approach -- of designating Russia instead of several republics as successors to the Soviet Union --
presents a host of other problems. The ABM Treaty says that certain radars must be located on the periphery of
national territory. It also requires designating test facilities. Since the borders of Russia are different from the borders
of the Soviet Union, the location of radar facilities must change. Further, the Sary Shagan test facility designated by the
Soviet Union is located outside of Russia.
<p>
    Whatever the approach, the Senate must and probably will demand that the successorship issue be resolved
through a protocol that would require its advice and consent. In fact, the Senate is already moving in this direction. On
May 2, 1995, 50 members of the Senate sent a letter to President Clinton stating that any agreement to "increase the
number of signatories" to the ABM Treaty should be subject to advice and consent under the law. The law in question: 
Section 232 of last year's Defense Authorization Bill, which says, "The United States shall not be bound by any
international agreement entered into by the President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the
agreement is entered pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution.4"
<p>
    The Clinton Administration states that its counterproliferation policy includes robust missile defenses, but it
is seeking to use the ABM Treaty to make such defenses less capable than the technology otherwise would allow.
<p>
    The Administration's Bottom-Up Review states that the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and other weapons
of mass destruction, particularly those resulting from proliferation, is a new danger U.S. security policy must address.
The recognition of this danger caused the late Les Aspin to announce the creation of the Counterproliferation Initiative
on December 7, 1993. In his speech before the National Academy of Sciences that day, he stated:  "the one [danger]
that most urgently and directly threatens Americans at home and American interests abroad is the new nuclear danger." 
The description of the Counterproliferation Initiative in this year's annual report from the Secretary of Defense states
that missile defense is one of seven areas for technological and programmatic emphasis that have the most potential for
making contributions to U.S. nonproliferation and counterproliferation capabilities.
<p>
    The Administration's counterproliferation policy would make sense if it were not for its policy toward the
ABM Treaty. If the new nuclear danger is among the most important security threats facing this country, then why
would the Administration point to the ABM Treaty, which ensures that the U.S. remains vulnerable to nuclear missile
attacks, as a cornerstone of strategic stability?  It is interesting to note that the section of the report of the Secretary of
Defense that explains the Counterproliferation Initiative mentions a number of arms control agreements that serve the
cause of nonproliferation. The ABM Treaty is not among them.
<p>
    If the proliferation threat poses a danger to Americans at home, as Les Aspin stated, why adopt a policy that
all but eliminates the national missile defense program?  If robust missile defenses are among the most important
capabilities to obtain in order to address the new nuclear danger, then why adopt policies, including those regarding the
ABM Treaty, that ensure such defenses will be less capable than the technology otherwise would allow? 
<p>
     This last point is the one we find most disturbing. As this Administration pays homage to the ABM Treaty,
it is asking the American taxpayer to shell out billions of dollars to deploy theater missile defense systems that will not
be as capable as they could be. Radar capabilities will be limited; interceptor velocities will be limited; external sensor
data will not be used. In short, missile defense systems will be "dumbed down" to fit what the Administration imagines
are requirements of the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    President Clinton states that he wants to work with Congress on resolving ABM Treaty-related problems,
while taking actions that either ignore or circumvent Congress.
<p>
    In his January 26 letter to congressional leaders, President Clinton stated:  "I look forward to working closely
with Congress as we pursue our common objectives in this [missile defense/ABM Treaty] area."  But his actions since
then do not reflect a cooperative attitude. Two examples demonstrate why.
<p>
    First, on May 2, 50 members of the United States Senate wrote President Clinton regarding the then-upcoming
Moscow summit. The Senators stated:  "We are writing in advance of your summit meeting in Moscow to reiterate our
strenuous objections to any action which would politically strengthen the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty....
" Despite this warning, the first substantive declaration in the May 10 joint statement released at the summit was:  "The
United States and Russia are each committed to the ABM Treaty, a cornerstone of strategic stability."  In this case, the
evidence is clear:  President Clinton ignored the expressed wishes of 50 United States Senators.
<p>
    Section 232 of last year's Defense Authorization Bill requires the President to submit ABM Treaty-related
agreements to the Senate for advice and consent. This is the law of the land. President Clinton signed the bill with this
provision in it. As far as we know, President Clinton has yet to make a commitment to submit such agreements to the
Senate for its consideration. While he may yet do so, President Clinton thus far has appeared prepared to circumvent
the Senate on this issue. This is not cooperation.
<p>
<b>OVERCOMING THE CONFUSION</b>
<p>
    To overcome the inconsistencies and confusion in the Clinton Administration's policy toward the ABM Treaty
requires starting over. Above all, it requires jettisoning the fundamental contradiction of insisting that the strategic
vulnerability of U.S. territory is the keystone of strategic security. It means that, particularly in the multipolar threat
environment that will emerge in the near future, maintaining strategic stability through offense deterrence and arms
control alone will be too risky. In short, as countries like North Korea and Iran acquire a long-range nuclear ballistic
missile capability, there will be less safety and more risk in trying to deter rogue states with the threat of nuclear
retaliation. To overcome the contradictions and inconsistencies in U.S. policy, the following steps should be taken:
<p>
<ul><li>Recognize that maintaining the ability to confront, and if need be destroy, the means of attack
that may be used against the American people, their territory, their forces deployed overseas,
and their vital interests will be the cornerstone of strategic stability in the post-Cold War world.
<p>
    Secretary Perry is right and President Clinton is wrong. The U.S. needs to move beyond
MAD. It must be replaced with a policy that:  1) seeks to prevent potentially hostile forces from
obtaining missiles and weapons of mass destruction; 2) deters such forces from using such weapons
if they obtain them; 3) provides a capability for defending against attacks with such weapons; and 4)
provides a capability to destroy the means of attack with offensive weapons in a timely (preemptive)
fashion. This policy, whether it is called mutual assured safety or something else, should serve as the
cornerstone of strategic stability in the future. As the U.S. moves toward this policy, the ABM Treaty
will not just become irrelevant; it will be antithetical to the new policy. This is because the purpose
of the ABM Treaty is to enshrine American vulnerability to attack.
<p>
    Some will argue that moving beyond the ABM Treaty will undermine both deterrence and the
policy behind maintaining a capable offensive nuclear force. This need not be the case. First, a policy
of deterrence need not be the exclusive province of the offensive nuclear arsenal. Defenses can make
their own unique contributions to deterrence. An obvious example of this is that effective defenses
will cause an enemy to think long and hard about launching an attack, lest it become an exercise in
self-disarmament. Second, offensive forces and defensive forces can complement each other in
fulfilling certain military requirements. An obvious example of this is in the area of targeting
requirements. Offensive forces are best suited to destroying fixed command and control centers used
to launch attacks. Defensive forces are best suited to destroying missiles deployed on mobile
platforms or bombers.5
<p>
<li>Recognize that the distinction between strategic and theater defenses is an arbitrary one.
<p>
    Since the day it came to office, the Clinton Administration has been wrestling with the
problem of distinguishing between defenses against strategic missiles and defenses against theater
missiles. The direct cause of this problem is the failure of the ABM Treaty to provide a clear
definition of the difference between the two. But the Administration needs to recognize that any
definition that distinguishes between the two will be arbitrary and, more important, not reflective of
strategic and technological realities. The entire problem arises solely because the ABM Treaty implies
there is a difference. The fact is that the U.S. faces a global threat from missile attack and it needs a
global defense. At the technological level, a system like the Brilliant Eyes sensor satellite, for
example, will support interceptors capable of destroying missiles of all ranges.
<p>
<li>Recognize that missile defense is an indispensable part of an effective counterproliferation
policy.
<p>
    The Counterproliferation Initiative undertaken by the Department of Defense already
recognizes this fact. This recognition needs to be elevated to the presidential level so that it is
reflected in arms control policy as well as defense policy. No arms control agreement, including the
ABM Treaty, should be used as an excuse for making the missile defenses the American taxpayer is
paying billions of dollars to develop and deploy less capable than the technology allows.
<p>
<li>Seek a cooperative approach with Russia and others for transcending the ABM Treaty.
<p>
    Instead of attempting to resuscitate the ABM Treaty, the Clinton Administration should be
exploring the options with Russia and others for transcending the treaty. Preferably, this will be
achieved through a cooperative approach. The window for such an approach with Russia appeared in
1992 when Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed the creation of a Global Protection System.
Unfortunately, the Bush Administration never really took advantage of this opportunity. The idea
should be explored again. In any case, the U.S. should be clear to Russia and its allies that it will
move forward with the development and deployment of the most effective global missile defense
capability possible. No offers of cooperation, which the U.S. should be willing to make, should be
allowed to be used as a veto over progress in U.S. missile defense programs.
<p>
<li>Seek genuine cooperation with Congress regarding missile defense and the future of the ABM
Treaty.
<p>
    Genuine cooperation with Congress requires the Clinton Administration to move forward on
missile defense programs on the basis of what the best technology will allow. Further, it means
seeking a solution to the ABM Treaty problem that transcends the requirements of the ABM Treaty
itself. Finally, it means acknowledging the Senate's constitutional role in treaty-making. This last
requirement should start with an unequivocal commitment on the part of the Clinton Administration
to submit future agreements regarding the ABM Treaty, including one on successorship, to the Senate
for advice and consent.
<p></ul>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
    The many inconsistencies in the Clinton Administration's approach to the ABM Treaty are
caused by a fundamental contradiction:  It wants to keep the ABM Treaty without facing up to the
consequences of doing so. It wants to claim that a new era of "mutual assured safety" has arrived, but
it wants to hold on to the ABM Treaty that enshrines the old doctrine of MAD. It wants in practice
to broaden the scope of the ABM Treaty to cover theater missile defenses, but it does not want to
admit it in principle. It wants to pretend that no successorship problem exists with the ABM Treaty,
even though a similar problem with START was not only recognized, but resolved through a protocol
that was subject to Senate advice and consent. It claims that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and
missiles is a top security threat to the United States, yet it eschews the most obvious countermeasure
to this threat -- a national missile defense system. And it professes that it wants to work with the
Congress as it negotiates with the Russians on the ABM Treaty, yet it expressly ignored -- and in fact
contradicted -- the wishes of 50 Senators in issuing the Moscow joint declaration.
<p>
    The case is clear:  This Administration wants to hold on to the old strategic worldview of
MAD, but it does not want to admit it. It wants to claim that it is striking out in new directions, while
in reality it is stuck in the past. And it wants to talk up the dangers of the nuclear threat when it suits
its arms control agenda, but play it down when missile defenses are proposed as the solution. The
weaving and bobbing of Clinton officials on the ABM Treaty are mere excuses to hold on to the
ABM Treaty, no matter what the objection, because it wants more arms control with the Russians.
That is the essence of President Clinton's strategic policy. That is, sadly, America's biggest strategic
problem.<p>

<title>The Challenge of Revolutionary Iran - Heritage</title>

<h3>THE CHALLENGE OF REVOLUTIONARY IRAN</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<sup>1</sup><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Committee Brief No. 24<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Middle Eastern travels of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan have sparked considerable controversy. Several Congressmen have called for a government investigation of the trip, including Representative Peter King, who gave a persuasive speech on this subject at The Heritage Foundation on March 6.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, I would like to focus on the foreign activities of Iran, which I believe poses the greatest threat to America and to American interests of all the countries that Minister Farrakhan visited. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. and Iran have clashed repeatedly over a wide variety of issues since Iran's 1979 revolution, which brought to power radical Islamic fundamentalists led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Bilateral tensions initially flared due to the November 4, 1979, seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian militants and the subsequent holding of American hostages for 444 days. Iran-U.S. tensions continue to simmer due to Iran's persistent efforts to export its revolution, Iranian support for international terrorism, Iran's ideological hostility to the U.S., and Iran's military buildup, which includes clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran today looms as the chief threat to American interests in the Middle East. The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the military defeat and diplomatic isolation of Iraq, Iran's traditional archrival, has given Iran the opportunity to expand its influence. Although Tehran has toned down its revolutionary rhetoric since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989, Iran remains a volatile revolutionary state. Tehran continues to denounce the U.S. as "the Global Arrogance," calls for the expulsion of American influence from the Middle East, seeks to discredit and overthrow moderate Arab governments friendly to the U.S., advocates the destruction of Israel, and adamantly opposes the U.S.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has increased its financial, political, and military support for radical Islamic fundamentalist movements throughout the Middle East and Southwest Asia. It has developed close ties with Sudan, which it uses as a training ground for Islamic militants from throughout the region. In the short run, Iran poses more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat than a military threat to America and its Middle Eastern allies. In the long run, however, Iran's military buildup, particularly its development programs for nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weaponry, will pose an increasingly grave challenge to the security of American forces and U.S. allies in the region.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S HOSTILE FOREIGN POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, Tehran has seen itself as the leader of the Muslim world. It has sought to export its revolutionary brand of Islam and to radicalize Muslims everywhere. The U.S., which Khomeini referred to as the "Great Satan," is hated for its support of the Iranian regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi; for its support of Israel, which Iranian radicals seek to destroy; and for its support of moderate Arab regimes such as those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But regardless of its policies, the U.S. is hated for its values and the powerful influence of its culture, which Iranian revolutionaries believe seduces Muslims and undermines Islam. This ideological motivation explains why Iranian-supported terrorists in Lebanon in the 1980s attacked targets affiliated with the American University of Beirut and Christian churches, in addition to the U.S. Marines serving in the multinational peacekeeping force.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1979, Iran has been more of an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to its neighbors than a military threat. Tehran has enjoyed only limited success in fomenting revolution, in part because Iran's Shiite brand of Islam is shared by only about 15 percent of all Muslims. The Sunni (orthodox) Muslims who make up more than 80 percent of the Islamic world tend to be more respectful of state authority and distrustful of Shiite radicals. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's greatest success has come in war-torn Lebanon, where it helped to create, finance, arm, and train the radical Shiite Hezbollah (Party of God) movement. Several hundred Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the militant shock troops of the Iranian revolution, work closely in support of Hezbollah in Lebanon's Bekaa valley. Tehran also supports less powerful Shiite fundamentalist groups in Iraq, Bahrain, and Afghanistan. But Shiite revolutionaries have seized power nowhere outside Iran. In fact, Shiite rebellions have been crushed in Iraq (1991) and Saudi Arabia (1979), and an Iranian-backed coup attempt was quashed in Bahrain in 1981.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported Islamic revolutions, however, now have better prospects for success. The dissolution of the Soviet Union not only has opened up Central Asia to Iranian influence, but also has deprived secular Arab nationalist regimes in Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Syria of a source of political, military, and economic support. The failure of Arab socialism in such countries as Algeria and Egypt has left them with feeble economies unable to absorb the huge number of youths who are entering the labor market. Faced with a bleak economic future, young Arabs are turning to radical fundamentalist movements to find hope and meaning in their lives. Some Arab fundamentalists, radicalized by the Islamic holy war (jihad) against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, have returned home to spearhead anti-government violence in their own countries. Iranian-supported Muslim fundamentalists are well-positioned to exploit the collapse of Soviet communism and Arab socialism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has established good working relations with several Sunni fundamentalist groups since 1990, including Hamas (the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement); Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine; the Islamic Group of Egypt; and similar groups in Algeria, Jordan, and Tunisia. The opening of Arab-Israeli peace talks at the Madrid Conference in October 1991 gave Iran and Palestinian fundamentalists a common interest in disrupting the U.S.-sponsored negotiations by escalating terrorist attacks against Israel. Iran invited a Hamas delegation to attend an October 1992 international conference held in Tehran to coordinate opposition to the peace process. Tehran subsequently agreed to help train Hamas terrorists, give Hamas $30 million over two years, and permit Hamas to open an "embassy" in Tehran. Israeli intelligence officials estimate that Iran now provides 10 to 20 percent of the roughly $70 million in donations that Hamas receives annually from its supporters around the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Tehran has welcomed the terrorist offensive which Hamas launched against Israel in the last month, killing 62 people in four suicide bombings. The state-run Iranian news service called the bombings "God's retribution."  Despite the worldwide revulsion triggered by the bombings, Iran remains one of Hamas' foremost foreign backers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's efforts to reach out to Sunni fundamentalists have been facilitated by Iran's closest ally, Sudan, which is ruled by the only radical fundamentalist regime in the Arab world. Arab officials maintain that Sudan has helped Iran establish ties with Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan, the Renaissance fundamentalist movement in Tunisia, and the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S LINKS TO SUDAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran has become the chief supporter and ally of Sudan's National Islamic Front, a Sunni fundamentalist movement that came to power following Lt. General Omar Hassan Bashir's 1989 coup. Sudan, Africa's largest state, offers Iran a strategic foothold to outflank Saudi Arabia and extend its revolutionary influence throughout North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Iranian-Sudanese cooperation escalated following President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's December 1991 visit to Sudan. Hundreds of Iranian military advisers and Revolutionary Guards were dispatched to Sudan to help train the Sudanese Army and internal security forces. Iranians also are believed to be assisting Sudan's radical regime in its long-running war against Christian and animist rebels in southern Sudan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although Iran claims that most of these personnel in Sudan are engaged in construction projects, persistent reports indicate that the Revolutionary Guards are training Islamic fundamentalist revolutionaries and terrorists, primarily from Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia. U.S. officials maintain that Iranians train terrorists in five camps around Khartoum that are equipped and financed by Iran. The Egyptian government contends that several thousand Egyptian fundamentalists have received training from Iranians in Sudanese camps. Egyptian intelligence officials claim to have evidence that Iran was responsible for training and organizing terrorists who have attacked foreign tourists in Egypt. Algeria expelled Iranian diplomats in November 1992 and broke diplomatic relations with Iran in March 1993 after accusing Tehran of supporting Islamic radicals who have waged a bloody guerrilla war against Algeria's military regime that has resulted in the deaths of over 30,000 Algerians since 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan has become in effect a "new Lebanon" where Iranian revolutionaries arm, train, and equip Arab fundamentalists for political violence while denying responsibility for their actions. Significantly, Iran's former ambassador to Sudan, Majid Kamal, helped create Hezbollah when he was the Iranian charg d'affaires in Beirut in the early 1980s. But unlike Lebanon, where Iran's freedom of action is constrained by Syria's military domination, the fundamentalist Sudanese government fully shares Iran's revolutionary goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sudan also is a valuable ally for Iran because of its key role in helping Iran to expand its contacts with Sunni fundamentalists, especially Egyptian and Palestinian groups opposed to peace negotiations with Israel. Iranian-supported Egyptian fundamentalists easily can infiltrate the porous Sudanese-Egyptian border, seeking to overthrow the Egyptian government. The Islamic Group, which considers Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman to be its spiritual leader, has launched terrorist attacks that have killed hundreds of Egyptians since early 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Egypt is one of Iran's most important targets for subversion because of its historic role as the preeminent Arab power. An Islamic revolution in Egypt would send shock waves throughout the Arab world and incite Islamic revolution elsewhere. Moreover, a radical fundamentalist Egypt would break its peace treaty with Israel and render moot the U.S.-backed Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which Iran has denounced as "treason."  As the leading Muslim power unequivocally opposed to Israel's existence, Iran stands to gain much from prolonging the Arab-Israeli conflict.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S SUPPORT OF TERRORISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran is the world's "most active state sponsor of international terrorism and continues to be directly involved in planning and executing terrorist acts," according to the State Department's most recent report on terrorism, <I>Patterns of Global Terrorism, 1994</i>, which was published in April 1995. Iranian intelligence agencies support terrorism, either directly or through extremist groups, primarily aimed against Iranian opposition movements, Israel, or moderate Arab regimes. Tehran has established over 20 ideological and military training camps in Iran, Lebanon, and Sudan staffed by Arabic-speaking Revolutionary Guards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hezbollah, Iran's most important surrogate, has become the "world's principal international terrorist organization," according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 28, 1993. The Lebanon-based organization has established groups of supporters as far away as Australia, Canada, India, Indonesia, and South America. Hezbollah's long list of terrorist atrocities includes the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks at Beirut Airport, and the kidnapping of most of the 15 American hostages held in Lebanon between 1984 and 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The last American hostages held in Lebanon were released by Hezbollah at Iran's direction in late 1991 after Tehran concluded that it could gain nothing from holding the hostages any longer. Iran's use of terrorism as an instrument of policy remains undiminished, however. In recent years, Tehran has stepped up its terrorist attacks against Iranian exile leaders and Israel. More than a dozen Iranian dissidents have been assassinated in European cities since 1987, including the August 1991 murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris and the September 1992 murders of four Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's terrorist campaign against exiled opposition activists appears to be growing in intensity in recent months. On February 20, 1996, two Iranian exiles were assassinated in Turkey. On March 2, two Sunni Iranian clerics were assassinated in Pakistan. And on March 7, another Iranian opposition activist was assassinated in Baghdad, the sixth killed inside Iraq since May 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Iran's assassins also have struck inside the United States. Iranian political activist Ali A. Tabatabai, the founder of the Iran Freedom Foundation, was murdered at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, on July 22, 1980.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although Iranians recently have not been caught launching terrorist attacks on American targets, Iran furnishes substantial financial, logistical, and training support to terrorist groups that continue to target Americans. Tehran provided financial support, at a minimum, for some of the Islamic militants arrested for the February 1993 bombing that killed six people at the World Trade Center in New York. Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the radical Egyptian cleric who inspired and guided the bombers, long has been funded by Iran's intelligence service, according to Vincent Cannistraro, former head of CIA counterterrorism operations. Sheik Omar reportedly was regularly given large sums of money by Iran's delegation to the United Nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although no direct Iranian participation has been established in the World Trade Center bombing, senior U.S. officials warned in March 1993 that Iranian-backed terrorist groups appeared to be becoming more aggressive. Iran also reportedly has begun cooperating with non-fundamentalist terrorist groups such as the Abu Nidal Organization, a renegade Palestinian terrorist group that has launched some of the bloodiest and most indiscriminate terrorist attacks, such as the December 1985 massacres at the Rome and Vienna airports. Iran also financially supports the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), a pro-Syrian group which it reportedly asked in 1988 to bomb a U.S. airliner in retaliation for the July 1988 accidental downing of an Iranian airliner by the <I>U.S.S. Vincennes</I>. The plot was disrupted by the arrest of a terrorist cell in Germany in October 1988. Libyan agents reportedly then bombed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iranian-supported terrorists have been particularly active against targets in Turkey. The Turkish Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility in 1992 for the murder of an Israeli diplomat and the bombing of an Istanbul synagogue. It also is believed to be responsible for a series of murders of Turkish journalists. Iran also supports the Marxist Kurdish Workers' Party, which has waged a long-running terrorist war against the government in eastern Turkey. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But in recent years it has been Israel that has been the prime foreign target of Iran's terror campaign. Iran was involved in the March 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, which killed 29 people. In March 1994, three Iranian agents were arrested in Thailand after an abortive attempt to detonate a truck bomb at the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. Iranian involvement is also suspected in the July 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 96 people. Iran continues to support Hezbollah's terrorist offensive against Israeli forces along the Lebanese-Israeli border, as well as the terrorist operations of Hamas inside Israel. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Under Iranian tutelage, Sudan has emerged as a leading sponsor of international terrorism. Sudan has given sanctuary to a wide spectrum of terrorist groups, including many Arab militants who participated in the fundamentalist jihad in Afghanistan. Sudan gave Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman sanctuary before he moved to New York. Two Sudanese diplomats were implicated in the aborted plot by eight of the Sheik's followers to bomb the United Nations headquarters in New York. Moreover, five of the eight suspected terrorists arrested for the plot in June 1993 were Sudanese. Sudan's escalating involvement in international terrorism led Washington in August 1993 to add Sudan to the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism, which also has included Iran since 1984. This prohibits the transfer of U.S. military equipment, militarily useful civilian technology, and foreign aid to the terrorist state, strips it of favorable trade privileges, and requires the U.S. to block loans by international financial institutions.
<p>
<b>IRAN'S MILITARY BUILDUP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran currently poses only a limited conventional military threat to its neighbors. Since the 1979 revolution, its armed forces have been weakened by political purges, huge losses of up to 60 percent of their major weapons systems in the eight-year war with Iraq, and shortages of spare parts for U.S. and Western arms supplied before 1979. But President Rafsanjani has accorded a high priority to building Iran's military strength. Shortly after coming to power in July 1989, Rafsanjani traveled to Moscow to sign a $1.9 billion arms deal that included 48 modern MiG-29 <I>Fulcrum</I> fighters and 100 T-72 tanks. His government, in January 1990, allocated $2 billion per year for five years to buy advanced arms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's ambitious military plans have sparked considerable concern that Tehran seeks to establish regional hegemony by building its military capabilities far beyond its legitimate defense needs. Iran's long-term objective reportedly is to acquire a modern air force of roughly 300 advanced combat aircraft; a modern army with 5,000 to 6,000 tanks, 2,000 self-propelled artillery pieces, and thousands of armored personnel carriers; and a navy upgraded with three advanced Russian <I>Kilo</I>-class submarines and scores of fast patrol boats armed with missiles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran also has purchased hundreds of ballistic missiles and the technology to produce them from North Korea and China. Tehran has acquired at least 300 SCUD-B surface-to-surface missiles with a range of approximately 185 miles, and an unknown number of improved SCUD-Cs, which have a range of approximately 370 miles. These missiles enable Iran to attack states across the Persian Gulf. Iran also reportedly has agreed to buy 150 North Korean Nodong 1 missiles with an estimated range of over 600 miles. These surface-to-surface missiles are capable of delivering conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads on targets as far away as Israel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Iran's missile buildup is especially worrisome given Tehran's determined efforts to build weapons of mass destruction. Iran has "the most active chemical warfare program" in the Third World, according to an anonymous U.S. government official quoted in the <I>Washington Post</I> on March 8, 1996. The CIA estimates that Iran has produced and stockpiled up to 2,000 tons of chemical warfare agents, which it used at least once during the Iran-Iraq war. Iran also has an active biological warfare program and is trying to buy biological agents from Europe that could be useful in developing such weapons, according to U.S. intelligence sources. Some U.S. experts believe that Iran already may have produced biological weapons in the form of toxins or anthrax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the West's chief worry is Iran's effort to develop nuclear weapons, which has been making steady progress under the cover of Iran's civilian nuclear power program. CIA Director John Deutch stated in November 1995 that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in as little as four years if it received extensive foreign assistance. American intelligence analysts have reported that Iranian acquisition teams have shopped for weapons-related nuclear equipment and nuclear scientists in the former Soviet Union, concentrating on Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In conclusion, although Iran now poses primarily an ideological, subversive, and terrorist threat to American interests in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in the long run Iran will pose an increasingly grave military threat to the security of the U.S., American military forces in the Middle East, and American allies in the region.

<H3><I> COMBATTING TERRORISM IN THE WAKE OF THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING </I></H3>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br> 
Executive Memorandum #410<br>

	The horrific April 19 bombing of the Alfred P.  Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City has shocked Americans and underscored the 
vulnerability of an open society to terrorism.  The death toll of 86, 
with about 100 missing and presumed dead, makes this bombing the worst 
terrorist outrage ever committed inside the United States.  The April 
19 bombing, apparently perpetrated by domestic terrorists, reinforces 
the lessons of the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, in 
which foreign terrorists, some of them recent immigrants, killed 6 
Americans and injured more than a thousand.  The U.S.  needs a 
systematic and comprehensive counterterrorism policy to defend 
against, deter, prevent, and punish terrorism.  The challenge to the 
Clinton Administration and Congress is to craft such a policy without 
eroding the constitutional rights of all Americans. 
 <P>
	President Bill Clinton has ordered the U.S.  government to study 
ways of enhancing the defenses of federal facilities against 
terrorism.  But it would be prohibitively costly, in terms of the 
federal budget and in terms of citizens' access to their government, 
to fortify all government facilities and public places against every 
terrorist threat.  Such "hardening" should be limited to the most 
likely targets, such as offices of the FBI, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, or Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
 <P>
	  A more fruitful and cost-effective policy would be to stop 
terrorist attacks before they can be carried out, through preventive 
policies such as the infiltration of terrorist groups and improved 
intelligence-gathering on their activities.  The FBI has had some 
success in preventing planned terrorist attacks, such as the aborted 
1993 bombings of New York City tunnels and buildings by the followers 
of Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman.  But the FBI's ability to monitor domestic 
terrorist groups has been undermined by restrictive guidelines that 
prevent it from gathering information on possible terrorist activity 
unless the group in question has committed, or is known to be 
plotting, a terrorist attack.  The guidelines on domestic 
intelligence-gathering need to be revised to permit federal law 
enforcement agencies to monitor the activities of organizations that 
clearly indicate their support of terrorism. 
 <P>
	The Clinton Administration unveiled legislation on February 10 to 
bolster U.S.  deterrence of terrorism and punish those who aid and 
abet terrorist activity.  The Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 
would outlaw fundraising in the United States in support of terrorist 
activities overseas, expedite the deportation of alien terrorists, and 
make international terrorism committed in the U.S.  a federal crime.  
This is a long-overdue step in the right direction, but Congress has 
an opportunity to strengthen U.S.  counterterrorism policy above and 
beyond these legislative proposals.  To do so, it should: 
 <P>
Improve the gathering and sharing of intelligence on terrorist groups.  
President Clinton has proposed the establishement of a domestic 
counterterrorism center under the aegis of the FBI to coordinate the 
U.S.  government's counter terrorism efforts.  Such a center is needed 
to collect, analyze, and disseminate timely information concerning 
domestic terrorist groups and the activities and immigration status of 
foreigners who have engaged in or supported terrorism.  This would 
help improve coordination among intelligence agencies, law enforcement 
authorities, and immigration officials.  Congress should work with the 
Administration to establish such a center and should maintain close 
oversight over counterterrorism programs to safeguard the individual 
liberties of all Americans.  However, the U.S.  government should have 
the righ to protect intelligence sources in deportation hearings 
against resident and illegal aliens who are suspected of terrorist 
activities. 
 <P>
Ensure that impending budget cuts will not undermine the war against 
terrorism.  Congressional appropriations committees must take care to 
avoid weakening America's defenses against terrorism --   particularly 
counterterrorism programs in the intelligence community, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the State Department's Office of 
Counterterrorism, the Defense Department's Special Operations Command, 
and the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control. 
 <P>
Press the Administration to make counterterrorism a top priority in 
American foreign policy.  While the Oklahoma City bombing appears to 
be the work of domestic terrorists, it also highlights the  
vulnerability of the U.S.  to foreign terrorist attack.  Congress 
therefore should force the Administration    to drop its shortsighted 
plan to downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, 
which spearheads international efforts to combat terrorism.  
Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY) has introduced H.R.  22 to 
preserve the Office on a permanent basis.  Congress also should press 
the Administration to raise the issue of terrorism in every 
appropriate bilateral and multilateral diplomatic contact, including 
the annual G-7 summits.  A series of congressional hearings on new 
trends in terrorism and the involvement of various groups and states 
in terrorist activity would highlight this threat and the high 
priority that should be assigned to fighting it.  Another vital topic 
is how to block the efforts of terrorist states such as Iran, Iraq, 
and Libya to obtain weapons of mass destruction.  A nuclear-armed Iraq 
or Iran could pose the ultimate terrorist threat. 
 <P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security.  Congress should 
pass legislation that enables the U.S.  government to deny visas to 
foreigners because of membership in terrorist groups.  Would-be    
terrorists now are denied entry only if the government can prove they 
have committed, or intend to     commit, terrorist acts.  These rules 
are too lax.  Moreover, tougher penalties should be imposed on the 
production or use of fraudulent passports and visas.  This includes 
giving the government the power to seize the assets of criminals 
convicted of creating or using false documents for terrorism or drug 
smuggling.  Nine of the original 35 indictable counts in the 1993 New 
York bombing involved visa or passport offenses. 
 <P>
Punish states that support terrorism on as many fronts as possible.  
The U.S.  should work with its   allies to raise the diplomatic, 
economic, political, and military costs of supporting international 
terrorism.  Although the Administration has singled out Iran as the 
world's most dangerous state sponsor of terrorism, it has not 
succeeded in persuading its allies, particularly Japan and Germany, to 
levy economic    sanctions against Tehran.  This is partly because, 
while imports of Iranian oil remain prohibited, the Clinton 
Administration has allowed American oil companies to become Iran's 
biggest customers, buying about $4.2 billion dollars of Iranian oil 
annually to supply their overseas markets.  This business-as-usual 
approach undermines American diplomatic efforts to isolate Iran and 
raise the cost of its continued support of terrorism.  Congress should 
step into this leadership vacuum, pass legislation banning American 
oil companies from purchasing Iranian oil, and call upon U.S.  allies 
to do the same as long as Iran supports terrorism.  Senator Alfonse 
D'Amato (R-NY) has introduced legislation (the Comprehensive Iran 
Sanctions Act of 1995) that would ban all U.S.  trade with Iran until 
the President determines that Iran has stopped supporting terrorism, 
ended its nuclear weapons program, and improved its human rights 
policies.  This proposal also would be a major step in signalling that 
the U.S.  is serious about fighting terrorism. 
 <P>
	The Oklahoma City tragedy demonstrates that domestic terrorists 
motivated by an extremist ideology can be just as dangerous as foreign 
terrorists.  The U.S.  government now must develop a comprehensive 
counterterrorism policy that effectively neutralizes both threats 
without infringing on the constitutional rights of all Americans.

<h3>NATO EXPANSION: MYTHS AND REALITIES</h3>

By  W. Bruce Weinrod<sup>1</sup>
<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>
<br>
Committee Brief No. 23
<br>
March 1, 1996<BR>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Momentum for the admission of new members into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) is increasing. NATO may well invite
new members to join the alliance before the turn of the century.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The case for admitting new members to NATO is persuasive. An expanded
NATO will reinforce peace and freedom In Europe and thus will
support important U.S. interests and objectives. However, crucial
decisions related to NATO expansion have yet to be made. Little
information is available about the specifics of NATO expansion,
and U.S. public and congressional debate on whether NATO should
expand has just begun. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Examining the details of the NATO expansion process and its implications
for U.S. interests is both inevitable and necessary. Some critics
of NATO expansion have raised objections which are spurious, misleading,
or inaccurate; others have raised legitimate concerns which deserve
consideration. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the process of NATO expansion to be successful, the American
public and Congress will have to sort through the myths and realities
of the issue. NATO enlargement raises two broad and interrelated
sets of issues: whether NATO expansion as such is a good idea
and (assuming NATO expansion occurs) how the expansion process
can best proceed.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>SHOULD NATO EXPAND?</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics suggest that there exist no real security threats justifying
an increased NATO membership. Therefore, the argument goes, there
is no reason to expand. But NATO expansion is important, not primarily
to defend against an imminent attack, but rather as a deterrent
against potential future security threats and an insurance policy
against uncertainties.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Bringing in new members would send a signal to any potential aggressor
that it would pay a substantial price for any expansionist ambitions
against nations which have become a part of the larger Western
community of nations. An expanded NATO also would reinforce the
post-World War II effort to envelop Germany in a broader European
framework and would make it highly unlikely that the region to
NATO's immediate east would emerge as an unstable geopolitical
vacuum between Germany and Russia.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As it did for many Western European nations in the early post-World
War II years, NATO can reinforce the consolidation of free political
and economic institutions in the emerging but fragile democracies
of Central Europe. The alliance can do this by providing an overarching
security umbrella and a clear symbol that such nations are being
welcomed as part of the West.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In any event, while Western Europe is indeed safer and more secure
after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the rest of Europe contains
instabilities of concern. Most important, if a resurgent extreme
nationalist leadership in Russia were to appear, it would be easier
to deter if NATO already had formalized membership for nations
between Russia and Western Europe.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>&quot;New Lines&quot; and European Stability</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A major contention of critics of NATO expansion is that adding
members to NATO inevitably will create &quot;new lines&quot; of
instability in Europe between members and non-members. The argument
is that nations not invited to join NATO (it is generally assumed
that nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary would
be admitted first) would be discouraged and alienated from NATO
and the West. As a result, these uninvited nations might join
rival alliances or take other actions which would increase geopolitical
instability.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This will not necessarily happen. But in any event, the most important
new lines in Europe already have been created as a result of the
dissolution of the Soviet empire. Adding new members to NATO would
only reflect the new geopolitical realities demonstrated in the
preferences of many nations to NATO's east for close political,
economic, cultural, and security ties to the West<sup>3</sup>. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate NATO objective should be the ending of lines and
the extension of the free society throughout Europe. However,
from a Western security perspective, if dividing lines are to
exist in the near term, it is preferable that these lines be as
far to the east as practicable. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Russia and NATO Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Concern has been expressed that admitting new members into NATO
will have a negative impact on Russia and its relationship to
the West. These critics note comments such as President Boris
Yeltsin's September 6, 1995, statement that NATO expansion &quot;would
plunge Europe into the flames of war&quot; and a remark by General
Alexander Lebed (a potential 1996 candidate for Russian President)
that it &quot;would mark the beginning of World War III.&quot;<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Overheated Russian rhetoric, however, should be kept in perspective.
Moscow has changed its position on important NATO-related issues:
After initial opposition, Russia acquiesced in NATO bombing in
Bosnia; and Russia joined the NATO Partnership for Peace (PFP)
after a lengthy period of hesitation. Further, there are forces
in Russia which view NATO expansion as a positive development
for Russia itself; and even among those opposed to NATO expansion,
there are many realists who understand, as the influential Council
for Foreign and Defense Policy puts it, that &quot;even in the
case of enlargement, the military threat is not likely to increase.&quot;<sup>5</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another argument is that NATO enlargement would undercut reform
forces in Russia and provide a catalyst for the advancement of
extreme authoritarian nationalist factions and their anti-Western
agenda. However, if authoritarian nationalists come to power again
in Russia, it will be due not to increased NATO membership, but
to more fundamental systemic factors inside Russia. For example,
the issue of NATO expansion was not even a marginal reason for
the strong showing of Communist and other anti-Western factions
in the December 1995 Russian Parliamentary elections. The reality
is that the issue of NATO expansion can have only a marginal effect
on whether democracy prevails in post-Communist Russia and on
Moscow's international role.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If authoritarian nationalists take power, their attitude towards
the West will not be shaped primarily by whether NATO expands.
For such ideologues, the West is the adversary not because of
what it does, but because of what it is and what it stands for.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some critics oppose NATO's enlargement now but suggest that expansion
could be appropriate if and when Russia posed a renewed threat
to the West. However, expanding NATO when no threat exists would
be a much smoother and more positive action because enlargement
in the context of a reassertive Russia inevitably would be criticized
as &quot;destabilizing&quot; or &quot;provocative.&quot;  Further,
it would prove more difficult for NATO members to agree on enlargement
should Russia be seen as a renewed threat.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A democratic Russia should accept NATO enlargement for two principal
reasons: first, it will encourage the consolidation of democracy
in neighboring nations, which in turn will reinforce democracy
in Russia; and second, it will make unlikely the kind of regional
instability to Russia's west which would divert attention away
from domestic reform.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The West, sensibly, is treating Russia constructively as it did
Germany after World War II, rather than vindictively as it did
after World War I. It is up to Russia to respond positively to
that wise policy. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Security Obligations and Cohesiveness</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics of NATO expansion suggest that by taking on new security
commitments, NATO may be drawn into numerous ethnic or other sub-regional
disputes. NATO need not make this a primary mission. NATO can
avoid such an outcome by constraining the ability of newly admitted
members to draw NATO into localized disputes, and by developing
clear criteria for the use of military force.<sup>6</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It has been argued that should NATO grow, its cohesion and sense
of common purpose inevitably will dissipate; that a larger NATO,
exacerbated by significant cultural and geopolitical differences,
will become unmanageable; and that reaching agreement between
new and old members on important issues will prove difficult<sup>7</sup>.
 But while increasing an organization's size may present challenges
to cohesiveness, NATO's experience with past enlargement is instructive.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, when NATO's membership was being decided in the late
1940s, the original European members initially rebuffed U.S. efforts
to include Norway, Iceland, and Portugal out of concern that these
nations were geographically too distant, and that Iceland and
Portugal's &quot;Europeanness&quot; was questionable. Later, some
European NATO members initially opposed admitting Greece and Turkey
because they were &quot;distant geographically and culturally
from the West.&quot;<sup>8</sup> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These and similar concerns have proved groundless. Despite sharp
policy differences which have arisen occasionally over the years,
NATO in fact developed a real sense of cohesiveness which has
enabled it to develop a consensus on actions ranging from the
deployment of nuclear-armed missiles in Europe during the 1980s
to active cooperation with the international response to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait to the deployment of a multinational force
in the former Yugoslavia. This cohesiveness reflects the emergence
of a common democratic security culture among NATO nations which
has enabled even traditional rivals Turkey and Greece to work
together, albeit uncomfortably at times, for common NATO objectives.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO's new structure allows for some difference of perspective
among members, since the alliance already is developing mechanisms
which would allow a sub-group of NATO members to take military
action. Nonetheless, NATO may need to consider procedural mechanisms,
at least for a transitional period, to provide assurance that
new members cannot block important NATO decisions<sup>9</sup>. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Enlargement inevitably will bring new perspectives into NATO.
But the significant benefits of expansion, including the expansion
of the common democratic security culture eastward, easily can
outweigh the inevitable disagreements which will occur.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Implications for Military Effectiveness</b> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It also has been suggested that adding members could dilute NATO's
military effectiveness. Enlarging NATO obviously would raise challenges
for NATO's military structure and capabilities. Even at NATO's
current size, assuring effective military coordination among different
military forces requires considerable effort. Issues which the
alliance will need to address include coordination of multinational
force formations, interoperability of military equipment, maintenance
of effective communications among different military forces, and
overall quality of military forces.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These challenges cannot be resolved fully in the very short term,
and there will not always be smooth interaction between current
NATO forces and those of newer members whose quality varies greatly
at this point. After all, NATO's Cold War defense structure was
developed over many years. However, such concerns can be assuaged
if NATO works with potential new members to address military requirements,
although no nation should be admitted until it satisfies specified
NATO military standards<sup>10</sup>.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A separate but related concern is that in taking on new commitments,
NATO will be overextended militarily. Again, a review of NATO's
past is helpful. For example, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff were
uncomfortable with bringing Italy into NATO because it might overextend
NATO's abilities in the Mediterranean region<sup>11</sup>.  In fact, Italy's
membership has proved to be a significant military plus for NATO.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another concern is that the presence of former or current Communists
in senior government positions in new member nations could serve
as a Trojan Horse and present security problems for NATO and its
members. Security leaks to Moscow are of particular concern. 
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Former Communists indeed are making a comeback throughout the
former Warsaw Pact nations. This is legitimate cause for worry,
although this trend may reverse itself over time. The solution
is simple: NATO should monitor this matter very carefully, and
refuse to admit a new member if there is a genuine security problem.
Of course, it also should take appropriate measures to ensure
the security of vital military information and intelligence.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Domestic Political Institutions and Practices</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some have suggested that former Warsaw Pact nations should not
be admitted to NATO because their domestic institutions are still
not fully democratic. However, in the past, NATO has not made
democracy an absolute criterion for membership. Rather, it balanced
strategic necessity with political concerns. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Portugal, Turkey, and Greece, for example, were admitted to NATO
at a time when they were not democracies. They were admitted because
of their perceived military benefit against a clear Soviet threat.
Spain, on the other hand, was not admitted for many years because
perceived military advantages were considered not sufficient to
override its non-democratic political system.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are hopeful signs of political progress in many former Communist
nations, and a return of pre-1989 communism among potential Central
European applicants for NATO membership is most unlikely. Nonetheless,
the possibility of reversion to authoritarian rule cannot be ruled
out, and it is not fully clear at what point some of the nations
interested in being considered for NATO membership will consolidate
their democratic political experiments. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Further, with no immediate direct security threat to NATO, political
standards can be made a higher priority. Indeed, as a practical
matter, it would likely prove difficult to obtain endorsement
of NATO member legislatures for new members whose governments
are not clearly democratic.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, NATO will need to balance the geopolitical benefits of expansion
with respect to a specific country against any domestic political
flaws. For example, Slovakia's location separating Poland and
Hungary argues for its admission to NATO on practical military
grounds along with those other two nations. However, its domestic
practices at present clearly do not meet democratic standards.<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The alliance should apply political criteria with some flexibility.
This is because the prospect of NATO membership, as well as the
fact of membership, may well have a positive impact on the domestic
politics of potential new entrants. NATO membership played a positive
role in stabilizing fragile European democracies after World War
II, and also helped Spain through a shaky transition period to
democracy. Admission of emerging democracies such as Poland and
Hungary could well have a similar impact.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, while NATO need not and should not admit new nations solely
in order to reinforce democracy, admission to the alliance nonetheless
has the potential to produce this important side benefit. <BR>
<BR>

<b>
<P>
Costs of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO's growth would likely have significant financial costs not
only for NATO itself, but also for member nations and any new
admittees. Most of these costs would be associated with enhancing
military capabilities.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At this early point, calculations of financial costs must be provisional
and depend greatly upon assumptions about such matters as the
threat perceptions, military strategy, and force structure of
potential new members and NATO itself. Nevertheless, approximate
costs, assuming differing levels of military forces, have been
estimated.<sup>13</sup>  These totals assume an implementation period of 10
to 15 years, although there will be continuing costs after this
period.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A least expensive option of around $20 billion would focus on
enhancing self-defense for new members by upgrading relevant military
capabilities, combined with NATO logistics and communications
support. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second approach costing around $20 billion to $30 billion would
include a buildup by new members combined with giving NATO a meaningful
capability to project air power. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An even more capable option costing around $50 billion would include
the same new member buildup, combined with in-region infrastructure
and a NATO air and ground force designed for power projection
into the region (to include a 10-ground-division, 10-air-wing
NATO regional capability); for around $35 billion, a more modest
version of this option with a less ambitious version of this military
package could be assembled.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Establishing a classic conventional military capability with NATO
air and ground forces actually deployed in the new members' region
could cost considerably more than $50 billion.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These costs are significant. Current NATO members, including the
U.S., would have to contribute equitable financial shares. But
the new members themselves would have to balance requirements
for economic development with the need for military-related expenditures,
and thus make real sacrifices during a difficult period of economic
development.<sup>15</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, financial requirements should be viewed in context.

Over a multi-year period, and broken into shares from NATO nations
and new members, the costs to all parties should be manageable.
A plausible estimate for a U.S. contribution would be an expenditure
of around $1 billion to $2 billion per year for 10 to 15 years.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If expansion is in America's and the West's interests, the costs
should be manageable and acceptable as a modest supplement to
what the U.S. already spends for its own security and that of
its allies.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Expansion and U.S. Interests</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A secure, stable Europe whose nation-states have free political
and economic systems is very much in America's national interest;
and bringing qualified and appropriate new members into NATO makes
this more likely.<sup>16</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. influence and leadership in Europe also can advance American
interests. Indeed, it is likely that admission of new members
would enhance U.S. influence in NATO. This is because the views
of those nations most likely to be offered membership parallel
those of the U.S. on most important security issues.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>THE PROCESS OF NATO EXPANSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even if NATO expansion is a good idea in principle, there are
a number of important practical issues which will have to be addressed
and resolved for the process of expansion to succeed.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Initial Invitation List</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A number of nations have indicated an interest in joining NATO.
In the short term at least, only a few will be considered seriously
for membership. These nations include the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland. Slovakia is also mentioned (these four nations together
are referred to at times as the &quot;Visegrad Group&quot;). If
Austria, Sweden or Finland &#173;&#173; all new members of the
European Union (EU) &#173;&#173; were to seek membership, they
would likely go to the top of the list.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the moment, the Czech Republic is closest to meeting likely
NATO standards for membership, while Poland and Hungary are making
progress. Slovakia is less likely to be invited at first because
of questionable domestic political practices. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Any other admissions to membership probably would be some years
away. Plausible future candidates might include Slovenia, Bulgaria,
and Romania. Baltic nations may meet eligibility criteria as well,
but concern about Russian reaction could inhibit NATO's approach.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Pace of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some who accept the principle of NATO enlargement nonetheless
would prefer a very slow pace. One rationale is that expansion
might have a negative impact on Russian policy and give anti-Western
candidates in the June 1996 Russian presidential elections a campaign
issue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, it makes no sense for Russia to be a determining factor
in the timing of NATO enlargement. Under such logic, expansion
could be delayed indefinitely because for the foreseeable future,
the possibility of a negative Russian reaction will always exist.
Indeed, it seems more likely that the longer the enlargement process
is dragged out, the more potential there is for problems with
Russia.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. leadership is important in catalyzing NATO enlargement, and
the pace of expansion should not be constrained artificially.
In addition, NATO itself can expedite the process by, for example,
appointing an Assistant Secretary General to deal with expansion-related
issues, as well as with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council
(NACC) and Partnership for Peace (PFP).<sup>17</sup> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Domestic Criteria for Membership</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is likely that, either implicitly or explicitly, NATO will
apply political and economic membership standards. Plausible domestic
political requirements for prospective members include democratic
institutions and practices; a market economy; the rule of law
along with institutional and legal protection for minority rights;
and civilian democratic control of the military, intelligence
agencies, police, and internal security forces. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Legitimate concern exists that NATO might lose its leverage for
domestic reform once a nation is admitted to membership. Thus,
pressure for continued reform must be maintained after the admission
of new members. Indeed, entry into NATO (along with pressure from
the European Union) can be a positive force for political change.
Spain's admission to NATO in 1982 very likely helped reinforce
and consolidate its nascent democratic institutions; and NATO
membership undoubtedly was a factor in the consolidation of democracy
in Portugal, Greece, and Turkey.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO in any event has the option of developing procedures for
the suspension or even expulsion of a member whose domestic or
international policies fall fundamentally short of NATO expectations.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>International Aspects of Membership</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO can ask new members to meet certain foreign policy standards.
For example, new members could be required to renounce all territorial
claims on other nations. NATO could also insist that new invitees
(for example, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary) implement
trans-regional cooperative endeavors, such as common security
planning at a sub-regional level.<sup>18</sup>  For its own part, NATO could
formalize its already implicit policy of not becoming involved
militarily in a dispute among NATO member nations. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO also might require agreement from new members to submit any
disputes with other NATO nations to international arbitration,
and new entrants could be asked to shape their militaries for
defensive missions only.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO certainly should expect commitments from prospective members
to assist anti-terrorism efforts, to participate in countering
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or their delivery
systems, and to prohibit the export of arms or militarily applicable
technology to rogue nations.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Military Criteria for New Members</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO should expect that new members will contribute to its overall
military capabilities and, conversely, will not undermine its
military effectiveness. How each new member should comply with
these standards remains to be decided. NATO could require, for
example, that new members agree to join its integrated military
structure (this is important because this structure fosters smoother
and more efficient military operations). New members also could
be required to strengthen very quickly &#173;&#173; in line with
NATO standards &#173;&#173; the military capabilities of selected
military units, and to work for operational military compatibility
with NATO forces over the longer term.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;New members could be required to make their territory and military
facilities available for NATO use, and otherwise support NATO
military requirements, without any unilateral constraints on NATO
activities. Moreover, new members could be required to keep their
military forces and planning open to view by NATO allies, and
to assure the protection of intelligence information.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The structure of the military forces of new members will be a
crucial factor in determining the effectiveness and costs of military
cooperation between new members and NATO. Also important will
be the need to determine exactly how NATO's forces would be structured
and deployed in peacetime, as well as at a time of crisis or conflict,
to fulfill NATO security commitments to new members.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Military force structure options for new members range from Swiss-type
civilian-based forces to a large standing army. Possibilities
must be weighed in the context of such factors as perceived national
interests and potential military threats, the relationship of
national armed forces to NATO's military structure, costs, and
other factors. It also would be advantageous for NATO if new members'
forces can contribute in a militarily significant way to any future
Persian Gulf-type conflicts.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At a minimum, force structure decisions by prospective members
should be taken within the context of maximizing regional (Central
or Eastern European) military cooperation and strengths, and also
within the context of extensive consultations with NATO. For example,
shared arms production and military purchases and assistance should
be pursued in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of military
capabilities and achieve military economies of scale. Defense
cooperation and co-production arrangements (arrangements by two
or more nations to join in researching, developing, or producing
a technology, system, or weapon), either among prospective new
members themselves or with other NATO members (including the U.S.),
can reinforce this approach.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In general, the military forces of likely new members will not
come close to meeting NATO's standards and requirements for many
years. Since full operational integration will not be feasible,
a realistic shorter-term objective would be to assure that the
troops of the old and new members work together as smoothly as
possible. Ways in which this might be accomplished include developing
an integrated air defense network, conducting NATO military exercises
on new members' territory, prepositioning military supplies; and
deploying aircraft to bases on new members' territory at regular
intervals (called &quot;dual basing&quot;).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, NATO's own evolving strategies and military
capabilities need to undergo further changes in order to accommodate
a larger NATO. These changes include: <BR>

<P><ul>
<li>Continuing revisions in NATO's forces and command structures and
planning processes, both to streamline NATO's military structure
and to establish command units specifically responsible for the
territory of new members; <BR>

<P>
<li>Adapting NATO's forces so that sub-groups of NATO nations, such
as the Western European Union (WEU) or ad hoc coalitions, can
utilize NATO's military resources when appropriate;<sup>19</sup> <BR>

<P>
<li>Further developing multinational formations (military units composed
of personnel from more than one nation), which will be even more
challenging when new members are involved; <BR>

<P>
<li>Reviewing the role of nuclear deterrence in post-Cold War Europe,
a continuing requirement even with NATO's current membership,
because nuclear strategy inevitably will be affected by the addition
of new members; and<BR>

<P>
<li>Assessing and implementing air and theater missile defenses which
take new members into account.<BR>
<BR>
</ul>

<P>
<b>Reassuring Uninvited Nations</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO expansion may cause at least some short-term sense of exclusion
or resentment among those not invited in the first round of admissions.
The reaction of uninvited nations could range from bruised feelings
to an interest in making alternative security arrangements, and
momentum for internal reform in such nations could be slowed.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO should seek to defuse such possibilities. For example, it
can make clear that expansion is a process and that NATO remains
open to new members even after the first new admissions. The alliance
also should increase the involvement of such nations in enhanced
Partnership for Peace and North Atlantic Cooperation Council political
programs and meetings while encouraging their interaction with
other European organizations, such as the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Union (EU),
as well as bilateral programs.<sup>20</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO can point out that the PFP framework already provides a <I>de
facto</I> equivalent of NATO's Article Four security relationship
to PFP participants. While Article Five addresses the defense
of members' territory against armed attack, Article Four calls
for consultations against more general security threats against
a member.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the alliance can also reinforce efforts to link relevant
NATO members more closely with nations that are not invited to
join initially. For example, Scandinavian members can work more
closely with Baltic nations, and southern region members can develop
closer links with Balkan and Mediterranean countries. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Sequence of Admission</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The sequencing of new admissions could have an impact on the reactions
of those nations not invited to join. NATO will still have to
decide, for example, how eligible nations should be admitted &#173;&#173;
whether individually or in groups &#173;&#173; and in what order.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Inviting nations in groups rather than individually could avoid
the tensions caused by admitting some nations before others which
also are eligible. At the same time, some suggest it would be
best not to invite all eligible members at the same time in order
to establish that admitting new members is a process rather than
a one-time event.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is too early in the expansion process to suggest which approach
is most appropriate. All that can be said at this time is that
if NATO chooses not to invite all eligible nations together, it
will need to explain clearly its rationale for implementing the
first wave of admissions in phases. NATO also needs to provide
a realistic assessment to those nations whose prospects for entry
are minimal or nil.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Expansion and Non-NATO Institutions</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The growth of NATO will occur within a context of multiple European
institutions. Most important is the Western European Union, which
is linked to the European Union. All WEU members also participate
in NATO, while the EU has several members who are not NATO members.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The WEU has defense obligations to its members and is considering
admitting new members. Further, the WEU might assume defense obligations
for all EU members. If the WEU admits new members before NATO
does, or if it assumes an obligation to defend all EU members,
then current WEU (and NATO) members will be taking on new defense
obligations to nations which are not NATO members. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This has important implications for NATO. WEU nations could become
embroiled in a conflict in order to defend a non-NATO member of
the WEU &#173;&#173; Austria, Sweden, and Finland recently have
been admitted, and other nations such as Poland, the Czech Republic,
and Hungary have applied for membership &#173;&#173; or a non-NATO
member of the EU. These WEU nations, if counterattacked, might
then seek to invoke NATO commitments for their own defense. This
would mean, in particular, that the U.S. could be called upon
to help defend NATO members in a conflict originally involving
an attack on a non-NATO WEU member even though NATO had no obligation
to defend the WEU or EU nations which were attacked. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to avoid such situations, NATO would have to coordinate
its expansion process with that of the WEU and the EU. Ideally,
nations should become members of both groups at around the same
time.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Russia and NATO</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO expansion should proceed on its own merits and terms. However,
as part of the enlargement process, NATO should hold out to Moscow
the possibility of a positive or even formal relationship if Russia
pursues responsible policies. For example, the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council, whose members include all NATO nations and
all former Warsaw Pact nations and ex-Soviet republics, could
be given an enhanced role and responsibility for considering European
political and security issues (including Russian involvement in
neighboring nations) and developing responses to security problems.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the short term, NATO should pursue a dual approach. Russian
participation in the PFP should be developed through such means
as security consultations and humanitarian relief training exercises
in order to demonstrate the positive aspects of a new relationship
with the West. At the same time, NATO should advise Moscow that
any renewed expansionism will end such activities and result in
contingency planning against such a Russian approach.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO remains, as always, a defensive and transparent alliance.
Any reasonable Russian concerns can be addressed; and a NATO-Russia
relationship can be institutionalized, up to and including a NATO-Russia
agreement defining the terms of the relationship, if Moscow accepts
the reality that NATO can expand. Of course, should Russia come
under the control of extreme nationalist and expansionist forces,
NATO will need to adopt appropriate measures in response.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Ukraine and NATO Enlargement</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ukraine is an especially important part of the European geopolitical
equation. Without control of Ukraine, it would be much more difficult
for an expansionist Russia to threaten the West directly. Although
independent, Kiev still remains sensitive to Russian concerns
and thus far has been ambivalent about NATO membership.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A fundamental Western objective should be to assure that Ukraine
is not reincorporated into a revived Russian empire. NATO, as
well as NATO nations acting bilaterally, will need to make Ukraine
a top priority for economic assistance, strengthened political
relationships, and security assistance. All this should be implemented
with a sensitivity to the challenges posed by Ukraine's balancing
act between the West and Moscow. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>Financial Costs of Expansion</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most costs incurred by NATO expansion will be to meet military
requirements. Current NATO members will have to contribute to
the costs of expansion, with the U.S. providing a reasonable financial
share. In addition, there should be significant economic assistance
from the European Union for economic development so that new members
can allocate sufficient resources to improving military capabilities.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the same time, new members will have to demonstrate a significant
financial commitment, which will be a challenge in view of their
still early stages of economic development. Creative arrangements,
including loans, grants, and even barter arrangements, need to
be explored. NATO nations also should consider the sale or lease
of excess military items to new members.<sup>21</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, NATO funding for common infrastructure facilities,
such as military bases and storage facilities, can be allocated
to new members. Costs for military items may be lowered by developing
co-production arrangements and taking advantage of economies of
scale.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The American debate over NATO enlargement, in a fundamental sense,
will be over the proper U.S. international role in the post-Cold
War world and the continuing relevance of NATO to U.S. interests.
If America wishes to protect its security interests beyond the
Western Hemisphere and help shape the international environment,
and if it is to continue as an international leader, NATO enlargement
will further those objectives. The enlargement of NATO also will
advance the consolidation of peace and freedom throughout Europe,
the expansion of NATO's common democratic security culture, and
the protection of U.S. interests in that region and elsewhere.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many of the arguments raised against NATO expansion are specious
or based on inaccurate or exaggerated concerns. At the same time,
there are reasonable questions and concerns about how NATO expansion
would work. These concerns must be addressed satisfactorily by
NATO and by candidates for membership. In particular, prospective
members, as well as NATO member nations, will have to contribute
their fair share, financially and otherwise.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The continuing importance of NATO is clear. Not only are nations
clamoring for admission, but long-standing member France has decided
to reinvigorate its participation in the alliance.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NATO has brought in several new members since its inception.<sup>22</sup> Admission of new members at this point would not be a radical
change, but rather a natural progression in NATO's steady growth
over the years. Opening the alliance to new members would ratify
the expansion of freedom's borders and the reality that new entrants
already are a part of the West.<BR>

<P>
<li>There is nothing that would prohibit NATO

<P>
<li>The NACC is an entity developed by NATO
in 1991 to provide an overall political framework for interaction
between the former Communist nations of Europe and Eurasia with
NATO. The PFP, currently with 26 members, was launched by NATO
in January 1994 as a vehicle for implementing concrete programs
(such as joint humanitarian relief exercises) and opening up military&#173;to&#173;military
contacts.
<P>
<li>The suggestion has been offered by former
Reagan Administration official Constantine Menges for the establishment
of a formal security structure for the nations of Central and
Eastern Europe. In his view, this would be in lieu of NATO membership,
at least in the near term.
<P>
<li>The WEU is composed of 10 Western European
nations who have pledged to protect each other against attack
and is envisioned as the military arm of the European Union. The
international coalition which responded to the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait is an example of an ad hoc arrangement which utilizes
NATO resources.
<P>
<li>The OSCE (formerly knows as the CSCE)
is composed of 53 nations and addresses a variety of areas, including
the development of international norms of behavior, institutional
support for democracy and human rights, and efforts at confidence&#173;building
and conflict resolution. The EU is composed of 15 European nations
and is the instrument for efforts to integrate Europe politically
and economically.
<P>
<li>Richard Kugler estimates that the new
members could use around $1 billion to $2 billion annually in
Western defense&#173;related loans and grants; <I>op. cit.</I>,
p. 198. Leases of equipment can play an important role. The U.S.,
for example, is considering the leasing of F&#173;16s to Poland.
<P>
<li>The founders of NATO clearly anticipated
expansion. Article Ten of the NATO Treaty defines the process
for admitting new members.<BR>

<h3>NATIONAL DEFENSE AND AMERICA'S ALLIANCES</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim R. Holmes</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies<br>
Delivered October 6, 1995<br>
<p>
I would like to begin with an anecdote I heard two weeks ago at an OSCE conference in Vienna. It is a story that was making the rounds in Budapest in 1989, at the time the Cold War was coming to an end.
<p>
There was this man fishing in the Danube. Eventually he caught a big fish. While he was dragging the fish on shore, the fish began to speak and asked that his life be spared. He said that he would grant the fisherman three wishes if his life could be saved. Since it is an unusual thing to hear a fish speak, the fisherman thought it was worth a try. So he said:  "I want to be a prince. I want to live in a palace. And I want a beautiful wife."  The fish promised to deliver and was released from his ordeal. The next morning the fisherman awoke in a palace. And indeed he was a prince. The door opened and a beautiful woman appeared and said:  "Get up Franz-Ferdinand. Today is our trip to Sarajevo."
<p>
Perhaps this story may be a useful reminder that we should be careful about what we wish for. All of us, of course, are very glad that the Cold War is over, but we have not yet adjusted to the immense complexities of the new era. We thought and acted like strategists during the Cold War, but that art sadly has been lost over the past few years. With the Cold War over, we have lost sight of the big picture. And because there is no big picture, we find it difficult to reach consensus on many foreign and defense policy issues.
<p>
The only way to find a new consensus is to start looking at the big picture again. We need to start looking for connections between things that seem to have no connections. The connection I would like to draw this morning is between our defense capabilities and our alliances -- between our military power and our security structures. 
<P>
I would propose that we try to reach a consensus on two points: 
<p>
1) That our alliances depend on America remaining a strong and global military power.
<p>
2) That we need to devise a new transatlantic bargain for the NATO alliance to guide us, not only through NATO expansion, but through European conflicts such as Bosnia.
<p>


<b>DEFENSE</b>
<p>
Let me begin with the first point about defense. You cannot talk intelligently about America's security structures unless you first talk about American military power. As Malcolm Wallop is fond of saying, "diplomacy without military power is but a prayer."  And a security alliance without adequate military backing is but a promise without a prayer.
<p>
My concern is that, if current trends in defense spending cuts are continued, both the U.S. and our alliances could indeed become a promise without a prayer. If defense spending continues to plummet, the U.S. will be hard-pressed to meet its future alliance commitments.
<p>
We at Heritage have long argued that the Clinton Administration has not asked the Congress for adequate funding to maintain the force envisioned in its Bottom-Up Review. You will recall that this force supposedly would be large enough to win two major regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously."
<p>
We estimated that the Administration's defense budget will fall short by some $110 billion over five years. The result will be deeper than anticipated cuts in military capabilities and combat readiness. For example, according to our estimates, the force structure of the U.S. armed forces could be reduced by roughly 20 percent below levels recommended in the Bottom-Up Review, and military personnel levels would have to shrink by roughly 15 percent below levels envisioned in the BUR.
<p>
I cannot see how our alliance commitments can be kept if, in fact, we are going to reduce our forces to levels lower than the bare minimum envisioned in the Bottom-Up Review. At these lower force levels, we would not be able to cover two major regional conflicts at the same time. If war broke out in one region -- say, in Asia -- we would be forced to move troops, weapons, and ships from another region in which we have alliance commitments -- for example, Europe. By doing this, we would have strengthened one region at the expense of the other. In effect, we would have been forced to make choices between alliances. 
<p>
This is not a choice we should be forced to make. It should be obvious that, at some point, a lack of sufficient military forces casts doubt on our alliance commitments. Our allies are masters at taking our pulse and measuring our power. They are keenly aware of the "promise without a prayer" problem of which I spoke earlier. 
<p>
If we value our alliances -- and I know there is a bipartisan consensus that we do -- then I believe we should take maintaining our military capabilities more seriously. In short, we must provide adequate funds for defense. All the diplomacy in the world will not save our alliances if America is perceived by our allies to be a waning and weakened military power. Our democratic values are keenly important to our allies. But our military power is critically important.
<p>

<b>NATO AND EUROPE</b>
<p>
Now let me turn to NATO. There is, of course, a bipartisan consensus favoring U.S. participation in NATO. There is not much doubt about that. But there has not been much discussion or debate, at the political level at least, of what needs to be done to ensure that NATO survives.
<p>
I firmly believe that the United States needs to revitalize the Atlanticism represented by the NATO alliance. Unless we define a new transatlantic bargain between the U.S. and Europe, the Atlantic Alliance may either collapse or wither away. This would be dangerous not only for Europe, but for the United States. The details of this transatlantic bargain may take a while to develop, but working them out will require Americans and Europeans to change old habits and take new risks.
<p>
The old transatlantic bargain was, to put it crudely, "If you European members of the alliance are attacked by the Soviet Union, we will risk our own annihilation to come to your defense."  Of course, the strategic rationale for this bargain has changed; the threat of hegemony has weakened, although not entirely disappeared, while other, less apocalyptic threats have emerged.
<p>
A new transatlantic bargain will be much more complicated -- and possibly even riskier in the near term. I could see a new bargain emerging that goes something like this:  "We Americans will do all the things we used to do (deter a strategic attack on Europe as a whole), but in addition to this, we will help you solve some of your purely regional problems if you help us solve some of our problems outside of Europe."
<p>
What does this mean?  It means, in principle, that if the circumstances are right and the interests and mission are clear, the United States should consider involving its military forces, including ground troops, in lesser regional contingencies and crisis management operations (peacekeeping operations) in Europe. By doing this, we would be going beyond Article Five commitment because we would be involving ourselves in actions that go beyond defending an ally from an attack.
<p>
This would not mean, however, putting U.S. troops in military operations that are bound to fail. U.S. leadership should not be defined as merely doing what the Europeans ask. Sometimes leadership will mean saying "no" to dumb ideas. And it may be that committing U.S. troops to a peace-enforcement operation in Bosnia today is a dumb idea.
<p>
While U.S. participation in so-called major regional contingencies, such as a major attack on Europe, would be more or less automatic, participation in lesser regional contingencies (at least those not involving a direct attack on an alliance member, as in Bosnia) would not be automatic. Since an agreement for participation would have to be reached by consensus, a veto by the U.S. not to send ground forces would not necessarily stop an operation if the Europeans decided to go ahead with their own troops. In any event, the Americans could support the operation in other ways, with air power, for example, as we are now doing in Bosnia. In this way, the U.S. could refuse to send ground troops without undermining a fundamental principle of the alliance. 
<P>
An important assumption here is that the dispatch of U.S. troops for lesser regional contingencies in Europe is something new -- a step up the ladder of risk, so to speak. Putting troops in actual combat is different from stationing them in peacetime for potential combat, as we did in Europe for most of the Cold War. The Europeans would have to understand that our making such a commitment would be a new chip in the bargain. In fact a lesser regional conflict not involving a direct attack on an alliance member is, by definition, an "out of area" operation. Sending U.S. forces to Europe for peacekeeping purposes would be keeping our end of the new bargain with respect to "out of area" operations. 
<p>
Another chip that we Americans could throw into the bargain could be to provide a missile defense umbrella for Europe. This would be making good on our strategic end of the bargain. By promising to defend our European allies from missile attack, we would be adding a new dimension to extended deterrence.
<p>
What would we expect from the European members of the alliance in return?  First, they would have to take up a greater burden for maintaining international peace and stability outside of Europe. And, second, they would have to do a better job of submerging their national preferences for the greater good of the alliance. 
<p>
If we Americans are asked to take on greater risks -- and sending U.S. forces into combat entails greater risk -- then the Europeans should be assisting us in "out of area" operations outside of Europe. Otherwise, it will be difficult to convince the Congress and the American people that this new transatlantic bargain is worth the risk and the money. These "out of area" operations would be like Operation Desert Storm -- i.e., arranged by consultation and determined to be in the mutual interest of the alliance and international peace and stability. 
<p>
Another part of the bargain is NATO expansion. If we expand NATO, we are bringing more countries into the bargain, so to speak; we would be giving Poland and other countries security guarantees. In return, we would expect them to come up to NATO's standards. But we get something else as well. We fill the strategic vacuum in Central Europe; we anchor these countries to the West; and we provide a geopolitical hedge against a revived Russian threat.
<p>
There are, of course, many issues involving NATO expansion which I do not have time to go into:  Who exactly should be brought in?  What happens to the countries that are left out?  What kind of defense posture should we have for new members?  And what are the time lines? 
<p>
Let me say only this:  It would be wise to expand NATO sooner rather than later. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be. The Russians will not become less resistant to NATO expansion simply because we go more slowly. In fact, if they think that we are slowing down because of them, they may increase their resistance.
<p>
A second point:  There are no easy solutions to the problem of countries falling outside the NATO defense perimeter. However, the difficulty of this problem should not be used as an argument against NATO expansion. It makes no sense to argue that NATO expansion will create new dividing lines when old ones already exist. To be sure, if NATO expands, there will be a new dividing line, but I would rather have that dividing line on the eastern border of Poland than on the western one. There will always be some European countries outside NATO, whether it expands or not.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
I have chosen to speak only about NATO. The relationship between military power and security structures is equally true for our alliances in Asia. Our allies in Asia will not for long trust our commitments to them if they perceive that our purpose is uncertain and our capabilities are weak. They will tend to measure the strength of our resolve by the commitment we make not only to our alliances, but to our own defense.
<p>
We can easily find a bipartisan consensus favoring our alliances in principle. The trouble begins when we start talking about costs and risks. Then the details begin to get troubling, and they could become deeply divisive.
<p>
I believe that a bipartisan consensus can be reached on the principle of NATO expansion. But can we maintain this consensus when the cost of expansion -- up to $35 billion over ten years, by some estimates -- comes up in defense budget debates in Congress?  I hope so, but I have my doubts unless we start thinking more strategically. We will not be able to make the proper connections unless we have a consensus on America's overall purpose and strategy in the world. 
<p>
I believe that a growing gap between our military capabilities and our alliance promises poses the greatest threat to our ability to remain engaged in the world. If we cannot remain militarily strong, we will drift off into isolationism not by intent, but by default. Ultimately, this is far more dangerous to America's position in the world than the isolationist speeches of Pat Buchanan or Ross Perot.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	With passage of the historic Telecommunications Act of 1996 earlier this year, many in Congress, the media, and the public have been led to believe that the long-awaited task of communications deregulation has been completed. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	While the new Telecommunications Act takes some important steps toward market liberalization, they are in many cases tiny steps. Furthermore, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is charged with the task of implementing the Act, already has shown itself eager to exploit the vague rhetoric and loopholes found in many sections of the Act by expanding rather than rolling back regulations. Worse still, some of the recent FCC proceedings and rule-makings undertaken supposedly to comply with this legislation are so complex, notes investment analyst Susan A. Lynner of Prudential Securities, that, "If the devil is in the details, then we must be in hell."<sup>1</sup>  In many ways, these problems can be traced to poorly worded or open-ended sections and clauses found in the original legislative language of the Telecommunications Act. <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 But the more serious problem with the Telecommunications Act is not what it includes, but what it does not include. The statute almost completely ignores the segment of the communications marketplace that is experiencing the most innovation and entrepreneurship -- the wireless sector. The legislation focuses primarily on wireline issues (local telephony and cable in particular). Wireless industries that currently use the electromagnetic wireless spectrum<sup>2</sup> (such as cellular or broadcasting), as well as other businesses that hope to enter the wireless market, do not receive comparable attention.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Realizing this, Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD) has circulated a staff discussion draft, "The Electromagnetic Spectrum Management Policy Reform and Privatization Act," as the prelude to possible legislation. Senator Pressler is Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. The proposal is sweeping in its scope and, if implemented, would force a complete overhaul of wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Among its beneficial steps, Senator Pressler's proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b> The proposal would end seven decades of spectrum mismanagement and industrial policy by allowing spectrum holders to use their spectrum for whatever purpose they wish. No longer would the FCC be allowed to "zone" the spectrum in discrete parcels and place restrictions on its use.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b> The FCC's extremely successful experiment with spectrum auctions would be expanded and made permanent for new uses of spectrum.
<p>
<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b> Although the Pressler proposal backs away from the contentious issue of auctioning off licenses already set to be given away to the broadcast television industry, it does create a favorable alternative. Broadcasters would be forced to pay a deposit for receipt of new digital licenses, and this deposit would be fully refundable when they turn in their old analog license after a 15-year transition period. Alternatively, if broadcasters did not wish to pay the deposit, they could opt to keep their current analog license forever and forgo the opportunity to obtain a new digital license. If they chose this second option, the leftover spectrum would be auctioned to other users.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b> The Pressler plan wisely mandates that the FCC could not engage in technical standard-setting because the staggering pace of technological change in this industry will likely make any standard irrelevant in the near future. Furthermore, the bill would prohibit the FCC from micromanaging construction specifications and timetables of new spectrum networks.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum:</b> In an important step, the Pressler plan demands that federal agencies reallocate large portions of inefficiently used government spectrum to private use. Furthermore, the spectrum that remains in government hands would have to be used more efficiently.
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b> The proposal also would eliminate needless spectrum management duplication by transferring all spectrum authority currently held by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to the FCC. In addition, the bill would block grant public safety spectrum back to the states so they can control locally all spectrum needed for police, fire, and other safety uses.
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report.</b> Finally, the plan would mandate a review of the effects of the bill two years after implementation and require the FCC to suggest further deregulatory initiatives that can be undertaken.</ul>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Pressler plan, if enacted into law, would represent the most important privatization effort undertaken by the federal government in recent years. This would spur job and export creation in this highly innovative American industry. Failure to implement these reforms, on the other hand, would mean that Congress's efforts to revolutionize the communications industry would remain limited and incomplete. 
<p>

<b>WHY REFORM IS NEEDED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Senator Pressler's spectrum reform and privatization plan is vital for several reasons. The current system of spectrum management is roundly criticized because:<ul>
<li><b>It is resistant to change and innovation.</b> Currently, federal spectrum regulators are allowed to decide who may use spectrum, where they may use it, how long they may use it, and most important, to what use they may put their spectrum. This is often referred to as "spectrum zoning," to borrow a real estate land management metaphor. Not surprisingly, this zoning leads to massive misallocations and misuses of spectrum. Once a certain technology is locked into place, it can take years before another use of that spectrum is allowed; thus, both innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged by this technological industrial policy. 
<p>
<li><b>It imposes large costs of delay.</b> Not surprisingly, this resistance to change and innovation results in enormous costs. These costs can be measured either in terms of the number of new products offered to consumers or in terms of the overall loss of economic activity to the economy. The costs are high. For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>3</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<li><b>It is open to special interest influence and discourages competition.</b> With such a tight hold on the spectrum reins, regulators can steer the industry in almost any direction they desire. Worse yet, because communications regulation often has resembled a "good old boy" network -- with favored industry groups working hand-in-hand with regulators to craft policy -- competition has been discouraged. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, for many years the broadcast industry worked with the FCC to restrict the rise of cable television, since it posed an obvious threat to the unchallenged hegemony of the broadcast industry. As telecommunications scholars Michael K. Kellogg, John Thorne, and Peter W. Huber note, "For many years the FCC's principal objective was to suppress the cable industry by preventing direct competition between cable and over-the-air broadcasting. It did so quite successfully.... "<sup>5</sup> This regulatory setback delayed the onset of video competition for over a decade.<sup>6</sup>  Despite no clear explanation of how this served the public, the FCC continued to implement these anti-competitive policies, even though it had received no explicit grant of congressional authority to do so.<sup>7</sup><p><li><b>There is a lack of respect for First Amendment rights.</b> Finally, the current system of spectrum management provides regulators with the ability to influence directly the content and composition of specific types of programming, and to threaten firms with discontinuation of the right to operate if they fail to comply with regulatory edicts. For example, the FCC currently uses the Children's Television Act of 1990 as a tool for blatant regulatory extortion. The FCC has gone beyond the admittedly vague statutory language of the Act to demand specific quantitative minimum numbers of hours of children's programming in exchange for allowing business other freedoms.<sup>8</sup>  For example, after CBS and Westinghouse recently announced their intention to merge, FCC regulators (who have the power to block such alliances) forced the companies to promise that certain quantitative programming requirements would be honored as a condition of merger approval. Several other firms have faced similar threats from the FCC as a condition of normal business operation. 	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Even though such regulatory blackmail would represent a clear First Amendment violation if applied in the print realm (fo
r example to newspapers or magazines), it is considered normal operating procedure in the realm of electronic communication (radio or television broadcasters).
</ul><p>


<b>WHAT THE PRESSLER PLAN WOULD DO</b>

	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the Pressler plan would correct most of these flaws within the current system. Specifically, the proposal:<ul>

<li><b>Provides spectrum flexibility.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would end seven decades of misguided and inefficient spectrum management, allowing spectrum users to use their licenses to provide any service in any way they desire as long as it does not interfere with another spectrum user or violate any U.S. treaty obligations with other nations regarding international spectrum use. It also would allow spectrum users to transfer their flexible spectrum freely to others on the open market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This would mean the death of federal spectrum industrial policies because it would prohibit any further "zoning" of spectrum. This could encourage a "spectrum renaissance," as many entrepreneurial ideas that could not be acted upon in the past due to spectrum operating restrictions could now be implemented. Countless innovations and new job opportunities would spring from a wireless marketplace freed from its regulatory shackles.
<p>
<li><b>Expands and makes permanent the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would expand and make permanent the extraordinarily successful system of spectrum auctioning that Congress originally authorized in 1993. Tens of billions of dollars have been generated for the U.S. Treasury and an enormous amount of innovation already has taken place, thanks to the auctioning process. In fact, an entirely new industry, the personal communications service sector (PCS), a more advanced system of wireless cellular communication, has been created as a result of the auction process. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, Congress limited the applicability and time of auctions in 1993. The Pressler proposal would mandate that only auctions be used in the future and any potential "mutually exclusive use" of the spectrum (when two or more parties vie for the same spectrum allocation) must be thrown open to competitive bidding at an auction. There would be four notable exemptions, however, to this general rule. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>First</b>, any spectrum request that is "non-mutually exclusive" (only one party requests the spectrum), obviously would not be open to an auction. This spectrum would simply be given to the party requesting it. The FCC could demand, however, that these users pay user fees to the government to ensure that the spectrum is not hoarded or used inefficiently.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		<b>Second</b>, public safety users of spectrum would be exempted. These spectrum uses would include such things as police and fire stations that need to communicate over the radio spectrum, as well as Department of Defense military applications. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Third</b>, spectrum required for global satellite orbital assignments would not be auctioned since this would create international difficulties with other countries that possess different spectrum assignment mechanisms. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 <b>Fourth</b>, while it is reasonable to exempt the previous three uses and users from spectrum auctions, the following exemption reflects the raw political power of an industry rather than good policy. 
<p>

<li><b>Creates a second-best broadcaster spectrum auction solution.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would exempt from auction the licenses set to be given away to broadcasters for the provision of digital television. This is unfortunate, because $10 billion to $70 billion worth of spectrum would be lost if such a giveaway to the broadcast industry were allowed to go forward. Worse yet, it would single out one segment of the industry for special treatment in a time when everyone else in the industry is being forced to spend billions bidding at competitive auctions to obtain the additional spectrum they need or desire to conduct business.<sup>9</sup>  Political pressure from the broadcast lobby has led many in Congress to abandon any hope of auctioning this spectrum.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Yet the Pressler plan would create a second-best solution, referred to as the "deposit, return and overlay approach."  Basically, every television broadcast licensee in America would be able to choose between one of the following two plans: 
<p>
	 <b>Option #1:</b> A broadcaster could obtain an additional license directly from the government instead of through a competitive auction, but pay periodic fees or deposits into an escrow account. The fees collected from broadcasters would be based on the value of similar licenses sold in "overlay" auctions. Overlay refers to the technological capability to use certain portions of the spectrum simultaneously for multiple uses. Spectrum adjoining that which would be given to broadcasters therefore could be auctioned off, and its auction price would then be used to determine the amount of the fee or deposit broadcasters would be forced to pay for exclusive use of the additional spectrum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the 15-year transition period when broadcasters each would possess two licenses (one analog, one digital), accrued interest on the spectrum deposit account would be placed in the U.S. Treasury to pay for tax cuts or deficit reduction. After the 15-year transition period ended, broadcasters could relinquish their older analog license and receive their deposit back from the government (less the accrued interest that went into the Treasury). For every year the broadcasters held their old license in excess of the 15-year cutoff date, they would lose 20 percent of their overall deposit; after five years, in other words, they would lose the full value of their deposit if they did not return the old license.

<p><b>Option #2:</b> Broadcasters could bypass the opportunity to obtain a second license directly from the government and instead opt to keep their older analog license perpetually. No spectrum fees or deposits would be owed by those who chose this option. The spectrum relinquished in this manner would then be auctioned by the FCC. Overall auctions would still take place, however. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This "deposit, return and overlay" approach is a good second-best alternative to straightforward auctions because it would provide a method of compensation for the use of spectrum and, would not allow broadcasters to keep two licenses without incurring serious costs.
<p>
<li><b>Prohibits FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would explicitly prohibit the FCC from imposing a digital television standard on the American marketplace. It simultaneously would avoid any compatibility or construction requirements that could lead to the adoption of yet another misguided industrial policy. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Unfortunately, the FCC in May did adopt a standard for digital television, largely to appease electronics manufacturers that wanted to lock in the technological system they favor. Although the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Digital Standard that was adopted allows television broadcasters flexible use of their spectrum, many other potential spectrum users, especially innovative computer companies such as Microsoft Corporation and Apple Computer, objected to the standard for various technological reasons. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 Surprisingly, the ATSC standard was adopted despite the warnings of FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who questioned whether the agency was in the best position to set such a standard during a period of rapid innovation. In a statement, Hundt asked, "Why is it in the public interest to adopt rules freezing the current state of technology?  Given the rapid pace of technological change, isn't it inevitable that there will be innovations that even the flexible ATSC Standard cannot accommodate?"<sup>10</sup>  Even more important, "Shouldn't we be concerned that erecting a regulatory barrier to the use of new technologies may discourage the research and development necessary for innovation?"  Hundt went on to ask, "How is it consistent with the deregulatory spirit of the new Telecommunications Act to codify (directly or indirectly) the 200-plus pages of technical details that constitute the ATSC Standard?"<sup>11</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	There are no easy or good answers to Chairman Hundt's questions because there is no legitimate reason for the FCC to be in the business of technological standard-setting in the first place. The FCC has a long and checkered history of experience with television standards. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation telecommunications working group report notes, "The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but the FCC took years to adopt initial standards. The FCC then froze all applications for TV licenses until 1952. In the year after the freeze was ended, the number of stations tripled. However, a 1952 FCC decision deliberately limited the number of viable stations per market, and impeded the creation of additional TV networks, at enormous costs to the American viewing public."<sup>12</sup>  With this history and a healthy respect for the pace of technological change in mind, the Pressler plan would prohibit standard-setting at the FCC.
<p>
<li><b>Demands release of more publicly held spectrum and more efficient public use of spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would mandate that, beginning next year, 25 percent of the spectrum the federal government currently owns exclusively or shares with the private sector below a certain frequency (5 GHz) shall be re-allocated for private sector auctions. Beyond this 25 percent of publicly held spectrum found under 5 GHz, the Pressler plan would require that the President appoint a seven-member "Advisory Committee on Withdrawal" to determine the amount of additional public spectrum that could be transferred to the private sector over a ten-year period.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	More important, the Pressler plan would initiate a financial incentive program to encourage government spectrum users to surrender portions of their spectrum voluntarily for private auctions. For example, if the Department of Transportation or Department of Defense realized they were stockpiling large portions of spectrum that were not being utilized, under the Pressler proposal they could turn in the spectrum for private auction and then receive a cut of the auction proceeds (which could be used for employee bonuses). This would be an important incentive for federal agencies that are hoarding spectrum inefficiently to transfer that spectrum to more efficient and profitable uses and users.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would require that, to the maximum extent possible, federal spectrum users rely on the private sector to supply them with radio communications equipment. Competitive bidding also would be required for all new federal government procurement of radio communications systems. Finally, the proposal would mandate that federal agencies work together with private sector firms to utilize more advanced and efficient digital services that would then open up more spectrum for use. Once a government agency and a private sector firm had installed the new digital technologies and created new spectrum capacity, the agency and the firm could divide the spectrum for other uses. The President would have the ability, however, to veto any FCC action related to public spectrum use that was deemed harmful to national security or public safety.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan also would place public spectrum users on equal footing with private users in terms of spectrum flexibility. Government spectrum users would be able to transfer their spectrum to any other public or private entity and receive compensation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 In addition, the plan would likely raise significant revenues for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief. 	 
<p>
<li><b>Transfers all spectrum responsibilities from the NTIA to the FCC and block grants public safety spectrum to the states.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler plan would end needless duplication of spectrum management responsibilities by consolidating all authority within the FCC. Currently, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages the publicly held spectrum, while the FCC manages all private spectrum. Upon implementation of the plan, all NTIA functions would be transferred to the FCC, and the NTIA, now part of the Department of Commerce, could be closed down.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal also would "block grant" authority over public safety spectrum back to the states. In essence, those portions of the spectrum required by state and local public safety users (police and fire stations) would be managed by the states. Any interference issues that arose would be adjudicated by the FCC. 
<p>
<li><b>Requires a spectrum report to monitor progress.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal would require that the FCC prepare a spectrum report summarizing the progress and results of this deregulatory effort. This would include both a cost-benefit analysis of the measure and additional legislative recommendations from the FCC to further the process of spectrum reform. </ul>
<p>


<b>HOW THE PRESSLER PLAN COULD BE IMPROVED</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Even though the Pressler discussion draft marks a significant and beneficial step in the right direction, it could be improved. Additional reforms that should be undertaken and policy clarifications that are needed include:<ul>

<li><b>Hold outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users.</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the Pressler proposal would create a sensible second-best solution to the broadcast spectrum dilemma, it is still preferable to apply auctions equally to all spectrum uses and users. It simply makes no sense to carve out special exemptions for certain industries while Congress is attempting to craft more pro-competitive, anti-monopolistic telecommunications policies. Many policymakers argue that the special "social compact" the public has with the broadcast industry justifies giving broadcasters special non-auction status, with government furnishing private broadcasters with free licenses in exchange for universal, high-quality informational and entertainment service.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		But by almost any measure, broadcasters have not lived up to their end of the bargain. Broadcasters, in fact have served the public poorly, primarily because they have not faced stiff competition for viewer allegiance until recent years. Hence, they have felt little pressure to improve the quality of their programming.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		Congress should end this failed social compact with broadcasters and demand that they enter the competitive age of communications on the same basis as all others in the industry. The Pressler plan could be improved markedly by making sure that such uncompetitive favoritism is ended once and for all.
<p>
<li><b>De-license the entire spectrum.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While providing complete flexibility in use is an important and long-needed step toward a free market in spectrum, the Pressler plan fails to take the final step needed to ensure that spectrum socialism is ended forever. Congress needs to eliminate all spectrum licensing requirements and provide current license holders full property rights to their spectrum allocation. This would ensure that all bureaucratic spectrum meddling ends and that a truly free market reigns in the wireless realm, as it does in real estate markets where private property rights have worked so well for centuries. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	 This does not mean anarchy would be or should be allowed to exist in wireless spectrum markets. Government would still have an important role in enforcing property rights in spectrum. For example, interference and trespass issues would still need to be adjudicated and resolved by independent third parties. This does not mean, however, that only the FCC is suited to carry out this task. In fact, enforcing property rights in spectrum should be easier than enforcing them in land since fewer "externality" concerns exist. For example, while river and air pollution present special problems in the enforcement of land property rights, no comparable externalities exist in the wireless spectrum. Private spectrum coordination organizations (which already exist), the courts, or a federal administrative body much smaller than the FCC could carry out any straightforward dispute resolution concerns that remain.
<p>
<li><b>End "public interest standard" regulation and guarantee equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	At the heart of everything that is wrong with modern communications law lies the "public interest standard."  This standard, which has governed communications policy at the FCC for almost seven decades, has never been defined. In effect, therefore, is a non-standard; it has no fixed meaning. Its vagueness has been used by federal regulators to destroy competition, to threaten the livelihood of existing businesses, and, most important, evade First Amendment restrictions -- all in the name of protecting the public.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The Pressler proposal, like the Telecommunications Act which preceded it, would do nothing to define this open-ended regulatory standard or minimize its uncompetitive effect on the wireless marketplace. Bureaucrats would continue to be able to diminish competitive opportunities and run roughshod over the First Amendment rights of spectrum users. This makes increasingly less sense as wireless electronic technologies (which are accorded only secondary First Amendment protections) subsume the more traditional print media (which are accorded strict First Amendment rights). If Congress does not define this standard clearly, the FCC conceivably could decide to regulate the content of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal merely because these and other newspapers and magazines are delivered over an electronic medium the agency is able to regulate under the public interest standard. Congress would find it difficult to explain to the public (not to mention the editors of these private and traditionally unregulated newspapers) just why regulation is needed merely because the public receives these dailies over computer screens instead of on paper.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In short, the public interest standard may serve the interests of regulators and the special interests that benefit from its uncompetitive edicts, but it does not serve the consuming public. It should be clear that policymakers can choose regulation under the public interest standard or they can choose free competition -- but they cannot choose both. Cutting the spectrum loose from its 70-year-old regulatory shackles is the best way to serve the public interest.
<p>
<li><b>End protectionist policies that restrict beneficial foreign investment in spectrum technologies and companies, and combine this with privatization of international satellite organizations.</b> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, foreign companies may not own a radio communications license and may not own more than 20 percent of the shares of a company that holds a radio communications license. This protectionist restriction has outlived its usefulness. While national security concerns may have served as a valid justification for prohibiting foreign investment in the past, this policy no longer makes sense. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 Restricting foreign investment in spectrum technologies and firms cuts off the flow of beneficial capital and expertise. Just as free trade in other sectors has benefited the American economy and improved the nation's competitiveness, openness to free trade in communications goods and services will best serve the interests of American firms and consumers.<sup>13</sup> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;		 While an effort was made during committee debate over the Telecommunications Act to include language eliminating or at least curtailing the effect of Section 310(b), such language was not included in the final conference bill. The Pressler proposal could correct this mistake by repealing Section 310(b) and all other telecommunications spectrum protectionism once and for all.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Also, to promote international trade in telecommunications, the Pressler plan could take steps to begin breaking down the global monopolies held by international satellite organizations such as Inmarsat and Intelsat. These organizations are international consortia of various signatory countries that have long held a strong grip over access to international satellite service. Comsat is the U.S. representative to Inmarsat (which provides mobile and maritime satellite services) and Intelsat (which provides global television and telephone services). Now that viable private satellite carriers exist that can provide international communications services more efficiently, these organizations should be privatized and all special privileges they receive should be revoked to encourage a more competitive marketplace.
<p></ul>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	While the Pressler spectrum privatization proposal is not perfect, it represents the boldest and most principled deregulatory initiative in the field of communications to date. In comparison to the initial drafts of the Telecommunications Act, which pre-emptively compromised on key policy issues, Senator Pressler's initial spectrum effort represents near flawless deregulatory legislation. 

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
		 If Congress fails to pursue this unique spectrum liberalization effort, it will be forgoing the most important privatization opportunity in years -- perhaps in this century. Countless new innovations would flow from the creation of a free market in spectrum. This innovation and entrepreneurship would create untold numbers of new job and export opportunities. In short, the Pressler spectrum privatization plan would revolutionize the communications industry and provide a much-needed boost to the American economy.

<title>How To Improve the Quality of Children's Television - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3>HOW TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CHILDREN'S TELEVISION</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><br>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 450<br>
May 20, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A crusade has been underway in Congress in recent years to improve the quality of broadcast television on behalf of America's children. While obviously well-intentioned, these efforts have failed because they have preserved the current uncompetitive regulatory structure instead of allowing market competition to expand the number of new educational choices available to the average American family. But Congress now has a rare opportunity to improve the quantity and quality of children's programming by inviting a host of new competitors into the marketplace through expanded auctions of broadcast spectrum.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, 104 Members of Congress recently reaffirmed their commitment to the status quo when they sent a letter to the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) asking the agency to strengthen provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990 (CTA). The problem is that the Children's Television Act actually has more to do with making work for communications industry regulators than with improving the quality of children's television. Although the Act does demand that broadcasters air more programming that "meets the educational and informational needs of children," it fails to define what that means. As a consequence, a lot of bureaucrats must spend a lot of time watching cartoons to decide what they think is "educational" and what is not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Bureaucrats decide "Fat Albert" is educational, "The Flintstones" is not.</b> For example, according to recent FCC rulemakings, both "Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids" and "The Smurfs" are deemed "educational."  "The Flintstones" and "G.I. Joe" have not been so lucky. They have been singled out as being out of compliance with the CTA. Instead of asking the FCC to watch cartoons, Congress should ask itself whether regulators should be deciding what children watch at all. Any improvements in the quality of broadcasts in recent years can be attributed to the rise of cable and other video competitors, not edicts from Washington. Efforts such as the CTA are riddled with implementation problems and do nothing to improve the long-run quality of broadcast television. The real answer, as in the world of books and magazines, is to allow more choices and let parents decide for themselves what programs or channels are truly educational.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Washington knows best?</b>  The 104 Members of Congress who wrote to the FCC want the Commission to establish a minimum number of hours of acceptable programming per week that broadcasters must air. The letter declares that the FCC should establish a quantitative federal requirement of at least three hours of federally approved "educational" programming that private broadcasters must air each week or risk having their broadcasting licenses revoked. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While license revocation is rare in practice, it is the indirect pressure of federal oversight that counts in influencing programming. In essence, the FCC uses laws like the CTA to engage in regulatory extortion: Either firms meet the Commission's demands or they forgo marketplace opportunities which the FCC has the authority to restrict, such as a merger with another communications company.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of this begs the question of why Congress does not make similar demands of companies doing business in the print media marketplace. Why is it that <I>The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times</i>, and other newspapers do not have to devote three pages of their "A" sections to issues Washington bureaucrats define as "educational and informational"?  While one could argue that it is because the print media already are more focused on such issues than the more entertainment-minded broadcast industry, in reality the answer lies in seven decades worth of misguided First Amendment jurisprudence that has accorded electronic media lesser speech protections and access to markets than print media. As a consequence, laws like the CTA continue to be applied to electronically transmitted media such as broadcasting, even though they would never pass constitutional muster if applied to the print realm. Serious questions remain as to how the CTA will be enforced once most newspapers and magazines are delivered to Americans electronically.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, such bureaucracy-enhancing efforts clearly do not complement last year's deregulatory efforts aimed at reducing federal meddling in communications markets. Instead of encouraging the FCC to expand its cultural inspections, Congress has the unique opportunity to force broadcasters to improve the quality of their programming, without infringing the spirit of the First Amendment, by launching more spectrum auctions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Auctioning spectrum will invite more competition and improve quality.</b> Policymakers could invite greater numbers of educational and informational providers into the marketplace by auctioning off more spectrum, something Congress is now considering. Unfortunately, policymakers are about to give away approximately $10 billion to $70 billion worth of spectrum to the same broadcast industry from which they are trying to demand better programming. This means countless new, innovative educational and informational services may be kept off the market because existing broadcasters will be able to hoard large portions of new spectrum. Consequently, broadcasters will be under even less pressure to offer better quality fare to children and families. Auctioning the spectrum, by contrast, not only would bring in revenue to permit tax cuts and deficit reduction, but also would force incumbent broadcasters to air better quality children's programming to keep in step with their new rivals.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Regulations like the Children's Television Act do not benefit children and should be repealed. Intense rivalry for viewer allegiance, not more federal mandates, is the only way to improve the quality and amount of children's programming. Auction off more spectrum, and America's children will be offered the kind of quality programming they deserve and Congress desires.

<a href="tp11c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Major Uses of the Electromagnetic Spectrum
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Seven decades ago, the federal government nationalized one of the most important natural resources in existence. If this resource had been oil, coal, lumber, or steel, the American people would have been outraged. Yet this resource -- the electromagnetic wireless spectrum -- was simply unknown to most Americans, so few knew or cared. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the seven decades the federal government has held and parceled out the spectrum, many important and highly innovative technologies have been derived from it: AM and FM radio, broadcast television, cellular telephony, and satellite-delivered television, to name just a few. But the grossly inefficient and highly bureaucratic system of federal spectrum management also has slowed the introduction of many of these technologies by prohibiting or discouraging competition in the use of this valuable resource. In addition, the holders of wireless spectrum licenses have been denied the freedom accorded other types of communications technologies. For example, radio and television licensees continue to be denied First Amendment protections equal to those of print technologies, such as newspapers and magazines.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A comprehensive bill deregulating much of the telecommunications industry was passed recently by Congress and signed by President Clinton this February. But this new law focuses primarily on wireline industries and issues (such as telephony and cable television) and ignores many equally important issues within the wireless sector of the industry (including cellular, satellite, and television broadcasting).<sup>1</sup>  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) did manage to force a last-minute debate over a portion of the bill that would give away large portions of the spectrum to a broadcast industry making the transition from analog to digital television. Dole argued that this giveaway would constitute "a big, big corporate welfare project"<sup>2</sup> because it sacrificed as much as $70 billion in potential revenues at a time when Americans are being asked to tighten their belts to help balance the federal budget.<sup>3</sup>  While this provision was not changed, Senator Dole's efforts did force supporters of the bill to offer to hold hearings in the future on legislation to reverse this misguided policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the defective spectrum management system left unaddressed in this round of telecommunications reform is to be remedied, Congress must do more than simply pass legislation auctioning off the spectrum now set to be given away at no cost to the broadcast industry. While auctioning the broadcast spectrum is a crucial first step, effective spectrum reform legislation will require Congress to go much further and:
<p><ol>
<li><b> Provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum.</b> Current holders of spectrum should be granted an absolute property right in their current allocation, not just licenses to use the spectrum as regulators see fit. Giving industry this flexibility would result in more efficient and innovative use of the spectrum resource.
<p>
<li><b> Expand the auction and allocation process.</b> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), the two federal agencies responsible for managing the spectrum, should be required to allocate and auction off as much of the spectrum as possible. Congress should specify that any new spectrum property for which there is a competing claim, including spectrum recently set aside for the broadcast industry, must be sold in an auction process. This will guarantee more rapid deployment of the spectrum to new users who value it most highly.
<p>
<li><b> Redefine (or define for the first time) the "public interest" standard and ensure that First Amendment protections are accorded equally to all media.</b> Electronic media and technologies that utilize the wireless spectrum traditionally have been held to different standards under the First Amendment. This must change, especially as the lines between technologies begin to blur. There is no justification for treating speech that is transmitted electronically any differently from the printed word.
<p>
<li><b> Transfer all remaining spectrum authority from the FCC and NTIA to the courts, private entities, and an independent body.</b> Once spectrum privatization is complete, there will be no need for continued oversight by either the FCC or the NTIA. Coordination problems can be handled by the courts, private industry coordination organizations, and a small administrative body if needed.
 </ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If Congress fails to improve the current telecommunications reform with comprehensive wireless reform, it will have failed to deregulate the entire industry. This means wireless technologies and industries will remain overregulated relative to wireline industry, and placed at a competitive disadvantage. The practical result of this distortion will be to blunt efficiency and entrepreneurship. The result: fewer new jobs and more costly and more limited services for the consumer.
<p>
<h4>WHAT IS "THE SPECTRUM," AND HOW IS IT MANAGED TODAY?</h4>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="tp11c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Major Uses of the Electromagnetic Spectrum<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"The spectrum," as it is generally known, is made up of "radiated electromagnetic waves (radio waves) [which] permit the transmission and reception of information over a distance -- even through empty space -- without the use of wires."<sup>4</sup>  In essence, a collection of these waves, which vary in strength and frequency, can constitute a single channel along which distinct information can be transmitted. If much information is to be sent at once, a channel requires more spectrum space -- or "bandwidth" -- to be transmitted. For example, a broadcast video signal requires more bandwidth than a cellular voice signal. However, certain channels can be used to deliver many different types of signals, and also can be used by different parties in different geographical areas. For example, a television channel in Washington, D.C., can be reused in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and many other metropolitan areas. As spectrum experts Charles L. Jackson and Dale N. Hatfield note, "[T]he radio spectrum resource can be shared by many simultaneous users by taking advantage of its frequency, time and space dimensions."<sup>5</sup>  In other words, because the transmission distance for most spectrum frequencies is limited, the same channel can be used by different carriers in different locations if they are far enough apart. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain channels may even be used within the same region to deliver multiple types of signals simultaneously through a process known as "spectrum sharing" or "overlay."  Digital compression technologies facilitate this process by squeezing more space out of the same spectrum channel so that it may be used by more than one entity. Spectrum experts often speak of the "digitalization" of spectrum as a major breakthrough because it will expand significantly the number of spectrum uses and users as bandwidth becomes more abundant.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Older and less efficient analog transmission technologies still dominate much of the spectrum, however. Analog technologies utilize wave modulations that are susceptible to interference problems. Digitized transmission, on the other hand, breaks down waves into numbers and codes that can be encoded and decoded to transmit information. As this process becomes increasingly sophisticated, signals can be sent much more clearly, rapidly, and efficiently than analog signals.

<b>A Short History of Spectrum Management in the United States </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the early decades of this century, the wireless spectrum was left unregulated. As both public and private use of the spectrum grew, however, government officials became concerned about what has been labeled "chaos in the spectrum."  In other words, policymakers feared that unregulated use of this new and important resource would cause signal quality to deteriorate to a point where no one would be able to communicate effectively. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After numerous complaints from the U.S. Navy about such interference, Congress passed the Radio Act of 1912. This granted the federal government the ability to allocate licenses among users for specific spectrum allocations. The entire process was geared to assuring military users the best parts of the spectrum, leaving private users with nearly useless channels. Things grew worse during World War I, when the Navy took control of the entire spectrum. Although the Navy was forced to relinquish control in 1919, the Department of Commerce retained licensing power.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This licensing power was limited. For example, the Department of Commerce could not charge for use of a license or restrict use once a license was granted. Not surprisingly, spectrum users began applying for as much of the spectrum as they possibly could, knowing there was no cost associated with doing so. This led to genuine interference, or "chaos," problems within the spectrum, leading to demands by policymakers and industry officials for more legislative intervention. Economist Jora R. Minasian aptly noted in 1975 that this interference "was not due to any inherently particular technological characteristics of radio emissions, but to the fact that rights to use of the frequency spectrum, rights of radiation, were ill-defined."<sup>7</sup>  Sixteen years before Minasian wrote these words, Nobel economist Ronald H. Coase pointed to the same problem in a famous 1959 article on the Federal Communications Commission. 
<blockquote><p>
	 [T]he real cause of trouble was that no property rights were created in these scarce frequencies. A private-enterprise system cannot function properly unless property rights are created in resources, and, when this is done, someone wishing to use a resource has to pay the owner to obtain it. Chaos disappears; and so does the government except that a legal system to define property rights and to arbitrate disputes is, of course, necessary. But there is certainly no need for the kind of regulation which we now find in the American radio and television industry.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, Professor Thomas Hazlett of the University of California-Davis notes that the legitimate chaos evident during the 1921-1923 period, when calls for government control were multiplying, "was, in essence, an outcome of government control: over 500 broadcasters were... bunched up all at the same point on the spectrum to which they had been directed by the Commerce Department, and operations were not always perfectly synchronized."<sup>9</sup>  Minasian agrees: "No attempts were made prior to May, 1923, to assign a separate channel to each station, or to provide geographic separation of the stations operating on the same channels, or to provide mutually exclusive times of operation. The wave lengths were assigned to all in a group.... This policy, coupled with a liberal policy for issuing licenses to amateurs, resulted in interference.... "<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Radio Act of 1912 and the administrative decisions that flowed from it had two main effects. First, it encouraged military use of the spectrum at the expense of private broadcasters, leaving them little room to operate effectively. Second, it failed to create a private marketplace in spectrum rights that could have solved the ensuing interference and chaos problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite these impediments, property rights in the spectrum were developing. Professor Hazlett explains that while federal regulators, legislators, and industry officials worked together to pre-empt the institution of a property rights regime, some judges were taking steps to establish property rights. As an illustration, Hazlett points out that in one 1926 court case, <I>Tribune Co. v. Oak Leaves Broadcasting Station</I>, "the classic interference problem was encountered, litigated, and overcome, using no more than existing common-law precedent."<sup>11</sup>  In this case, Judge Francis S. Wilson adjudicated a dispute between two broadcasters who faced an interference dilemma. Judge Wilson argued that once an entity had established a presence in a given allocation within the spectrum that user had a <I>de facto</I> property right in that allocation. By establishing this common law precedent to protect property rights in the spectrum, the decision effectively rendered the interference problem moot.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some immediately recognized the power of this precedent-setting decision and welcomed it. Others, in the industry and in government, feared that it meant they would not be guaranteed a comfortable, ologopolistic market setting (that is, a non-competitive market in which both the regulator and the regulated entities were satisfied with control of entry and comfortable market share, respectively).<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hazlett suggests this was not an accident. During Herbert Hoover's tenure as Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s, large incumbent broadcasters worked with Hoover to establish a "public interest" paradigm of federal regulation and control of the spectrum to replace the emerging common law, property rights-based paradigm. Basically, Hoover and the large broadcasters argued publicly that, despite the clear failings of past legislative efforts and the potential property rights solution developing in the courts at the time, only federal regulation of the spectrum could eliminate the chaos that existed during this period.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This pressure eventually led to the adoption of the Radio Act of 1927, giving the federal government complete operating control over and ownership of the spectrum. Under the 1927 Act, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was established and given the power to grant three-year licenses in exchange for certain public service requirements. Licenses would be granted (and revoked) in accordance with "the public interest, convenience, or necessity."  No more specific definition of what constituted "the public interest" was given.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Hazlett notes, the creation of the FRC and the public interest paradigm was the answer to broadcasters' prayers: "[I]t immediately grandfathered rights for major broadcasters, while eliminating marginal competitors and all new entry."<sup>13</sup>  Furthermore, Hazlett notes that the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> argued at the time what should have been evident to everyone: "The point seems clear that the Federal Radio Commission has interpreted the concept of public interest so as to favor in actual practice one particular group. While talking in terms of the 'public interest, convenience, and necessity' the commission actually chose to further the ends of the commercial broadcasters."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, little has changed since the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> printed these words in 1935. When the Federal Communications Commission was formed in 1934, the FRC was folded into the FCC along with its public interest powers.<sup>15</sup>  Throughout the years, the agency has developed highly haphazard, inflexible, and inefficient techniques to manage the spectrum resource.
<p><b>The Spectrum Scarcity and Interference Myths</b><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before discussing the pitfalls of the current regulatory approach, it is important to debunk the myths used to justify the disastrous spectrum management techniques employed by the FCC since its inception. These myths are (1) that the spectrum is scarce and (2) that private ownership would create interference problems. Both arguments are fatally flawed.
<p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Scarcity Myth.</b> The scarcity of the spectrum is irrelevant and cannot serve as a credible basis for federal ownership and management.<sup>16</sup>  As Coase has explained: 
<blockquote><p>
	 [I]t is a commonplace of economics that almost all resources used in the economic system (and not simply radio and television frequencies) are limited in amount and scarce, in that people would like to use more than exists. Land, labor, and capital are all scarce, but this, of itself, does not call for government regulation. It is true that some mechanism has to be employed to decide who, out of the many claimants, should be allowed to use the scarce resource. But the way this is usually done in the American economic system is to employ the price mechanism, and this allocates resources to users without the need for government regulation.<sup>17</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The scarcity rationale is even more irrelevant today as digital technologies move America into an age of "boundless bandwidth" and "spectrum surplus," as technology visionary George Gilder is fond of saying.<sup>18</sup>  "Why have... gloomy, scarcity-based forecasts proved so wrong?"  asks Gilder."  Because in each case, advances in microchip design tools, integration of more transistors on single chips, improved design of radio frequency systems and new antenna technology led to the creation of better systems at higher frequencies. "<sup>19</sup> Lawrence Gasman, president of Communications Industry Researchers and author of <I>Telecompetition</I>, agrees: "With lower-power communications, data compression, and practical communications at high frequencies, spectrum may still be scarce, but it is not as scarce as it once was, and it is becoming less scarce all the time."<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Interference Myth.</b> The interference justification for federal spectrum management is equally flawed. As Hazlett cogently points out:
<blockquote><p>
	Economists, political scientists, and lawyers generally agree that the interference rationale for licensure in "the public interest" is nonsensical. The interference problem is widely recognized as one of defining separate frequency "properties"; it is logically unconnected to the issue of who is to harvest those frequencies. To confuse the definition of spectrum rights with the assignment of spectrum rights is to believe that, to keep intruders out of (private) backyards, the government must own (or allocate) all the houses.<sup>21</sup> 
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thomas G. Krattenmaker and Lucas A. Powe, authors of <I>Regulating Broadcast Programming</I>, concur: 
<blockquote><p>
	 [I]nterference, like scarcity... is a bogeyman. All resources are subject to interference in the sense that their value will decline if everyone attempts to use them at once. This is why governments recognize property rights (which include the right to exclude others from using) in resources exchanged through the marketplace. Interference will... destroy the value of any resource, but usually the government does not choose to displace the market to prevent interference. Two people cannot comfortably sit at the same time in the same desk chair. Yet this fact has not led government to parcel out the right to sit in a chair. Rather, ownership of the chair is taken to confer authority to exclude others from sitting in it, no matter how eager they may be to do so.<sup>22</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To illustrate the absurdity of both the scarcity and interference rationales for asymmetrical regulation of the broadcast industry, the authors further note: 
<p><blockquote>
	 It was as though Congress, having realized that paper is scarce and that "interference" occurs when two or more people write simultaneously on the same sheet of paper, had declared that the government owned all the paper in the United States. A Federal Paper Commission would then be necessary to decide how much paper would be available for (say) books and how much for (say) wallpaper. The Commission would further choose who was permitted to engage in book publishing.<sup>23</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Recent court and FCC decisions support these sentiments. In the 1986 case <I>Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC</I>,<sup>24</sup> Judge Robert Bork, writing for a majority of the D.C. Circuit Court, argued that spectrum scarcity was a "universal fact" of economics and therefore could not serve as a valid basis for lesser First Amendment treatment of broadcasting. Likewise, in the FCC's 1987 <I>Syracuse Peace Council</I><sup>25</sup> decision revoking the Fairness Doctrine, the agency argued that when "analyzing the appropriate First Amendment standard to be applied to the electronic press, the concept of scarcity . .. .. is irrelevant."<sup>26</sup>  The Commission went on to note that "We believe the function of the electronic press in a free society is identical to that of the printed press and that, therefore, the constitutional analysis of government control of content should be no different."<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the scarcity rationale nor the interference rationale for federal spectrum management can be used credibly to support the continued socialization of spectrum or its special regulatory treatment.
<p>
<b>"Zoning" Delays Introduction of New Technologies </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the fact that neither scarcity nor interference can serve as legitimate justification for federal spectrum ownership, the FCC continues to employ the same outmoded spectrum management techniques it has used for the past seven decades. As use of the spectrum grew and new technologies developed, the FCC began to partition the spectrum into various blocks called allocations. Within each spectrum allocation, the FCC specifies how that particular block of spectrum may be utilized. FM radio, for example, is allocated a block of spectrum between 88 mhz and 108 mhz, and the commercial paging block is found between 931 mhz and 932 mhz. Broadcast television, satellite dish television, and cellular telephony all have similar block allocation arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within each of these block allocations, the FCC then subdivides the allocation geographically. These subdivisions, known as allotments, are important because they enable spectrum to be reused in many different geographic areas. After the agency divides the spectrum into allocations and then subdivides it into geographic allotments, it parcels out specific spectrum assignments in the form of spectrum licenses. These licenses provide a specific legal right to use the spectrum, but only for the listed use. In other words, a television broadcaster is licensed only to broadcast video programming; it cannot offer cellular, paging, or other types of communications services even though there may be a large potential market for these services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, this system has proven extraordinarily inefficient and time-consuming. As the Congressional Budget Office notes:
<blockquote><p>
	Block allocations take a long time to establish, and once established are difficult to change. Difficulty in responding to changes in technologies and consumer preferences can leave parts of the spectrum underused. In some instances, a limited allocation of spectrum gives license holders control over prices and accompanying high profits or rents. Accordingly, the radio spectrum is not distributed among different users in an economically efficient way. Under the block allocation system there is no smooth path that permits spectrum to move easily from lower to higher value services.<sup>28</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This parceling system has not changed fundamentally since the FCC began managing the spectrum in the 1920s. In essence, the FCC is "zoning" the spectrum, to borrow the terminology of real estate land management. Those firms lucky enough to receive a license must be content with a single use; innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Worse yet, the assignment and licensing process is prone to the same criticisms economists level against all government licensing schemes. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation working group recently found, "Across-the-board, the Commission's licensing process is characterized by procrastination, equivocation, and seemingly endless delay. Unnecessary delay, ultimately found to be in the public interest, imposes enormous costs on the industry and the national economy."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>30</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) by 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, such costly delays have been the norm, since licenses have been doled out to the industry through "comparative hearings" in which applicants for a license must demonstrate their worthiness to FCC bureaucrats. "Comparative hearings can be long, burdensome, and inflexible. Years can elapse as lawyers present the merits of each side," notes Citizens for a Sound Economy Vice President James Gattuso. 
<blockquote><p>
	Perhaps worse, even after this costly procedure [estimated to cost about $130,000 for the applicant and another $5,000 for the FCC<sup>32</sup>], it is often difficult or impossible for the Commission to determine which applicant will best serve the "public interest."  The Commission may find itself not only trying to decide which applicant is most sincere in its expressed desire to serve the public, and which has the financial resources to do so, but also may have to pass judgment on the applicant's entire business plan to determine it would meet the needs of consumers.<sup>33</sup> 
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the Commission must engage in <I>de facto</I> industrial policy to distribute licenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This problem was not alleviated when Congress authorized the FCC in the 1980s to begin using lotteries instead of comparative hearings to distribute licenses. Thought to be a cheaper and more rapid way to expedite licenses to the industry, lotteries simply awarded them randomly to a lucky few among the thousands of applicants. In fact, note Evan R. Kwerel and John R. Williams at the FCC's Office of Policy and Plans, "Because the cost of applying was low and the licenses were quite valuable, large numbers of applicants chose to enter the FCC lotteries. For example, there were nearly 400,000 applications for cellular licenses -- so many that the shelves broke at the FCC processing center in Gettysburg."<sup>34</sup>  Furthermore, as noted by Jonathan Blake, a partner at Covington & Burling and former President of the Federal Communications Bar Association, "because lotteries were every person's chance for a big payoff and winners routinely sold their licenses as soon as possible to real operators, it was soon observed that lotteries led to private auctions. In turn, this led to the question: why shouldn't the government conduct the auctions?"<sup>35</sup>
<p>
<b>The Auction Alternative Becomes Reality in the 1990s</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s and early 1990s, the FCC and Congress began to realize that the problems associated with comparative hearings and lotteries demanded a solution. In 1993, Congress finally gave the FCC authority to auction certain commercial uses of the spectrum, although certain types of spectrum were excluded, most notably broadcast spectrum. In general, auctions present a less costly and more efficient allocation mechanism. 
<ul><p>
<li> As the Congressional Budget Office noted in 1992, "Compared with other methods of assignment... auctions are faster, less costly to society, produce more federal revenues, and are more likely to place licenses in the hands of the applicants who value them most."<sup>36</sup> 
<p>
<li>As Peter C. Cramton of the University of Maryland notes, "Nearly every constituent benefits from auctioning the airwaves. Taxpayers, consumers, and firms are all better off with auctions. The only losers are inefficient firms, which are unsuccessful in the auctions, but have a chance in lotteries or comparative hearings."<sup>37</sup> 
<p>
<li>The superiority of auctioning over alternative allocation mechanisms is perhaps best described in the most recent <I>Economic Report of the President</I>: "When the government does not auction off but simply assigns spectrum licenses for free, it is giving away public resources worth billions of dollars. But more than revenue is at stake. Auctions can help promote economic efficiency, by ensuring that spectrum is deployed in the highest-return uses, including emerging growth industries that entail innovative technologies and services."<sup>38</sup>
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As of early February 1996, spectrum auctions have brought in over $15 billion to the U.S. Treasury. As a recent headline in <I>The New York Times</I> says, "The Sky Seems to Be the Limit."<sup>39</sup>  More important, however, hundreds of spectrum properties have been assigned much more rapidly than would have been possible using comparative hearings or lotteries.
<p>
<b>The Resistance to Auctions </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the enormous success of auctions, Congress continues to allow certain spectrum uses to escape the auction process. Specifically, due to an exemption built into the original 1993 auctioning authority, services that do not collect "compensation from subscribers," such as broadcasting, are exempted.<sup>40</sup>  The broadcast industry, which has lobbied Congress intensely to win and keep this provision, does not want auctions to be applied uniformly to all new uses of spectrum because it would force broadcasters to pay for additional spectrum licenses they are set to receive free of charge from the FCC in the near future as part of a plan put in place a few years ago by the Commission. 
<P>
<b>The Taxpayer Cost of Limits on Auctions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The value of the spectrum to be given away has been estimated by the FCC to be somewhere between $10 billion to $70 billion. Yet the recently passed Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not alter this plan by demanding auctions. Instead of making tens of billions available for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief through auction of this spectrum, Congress will force Americans to shell out more of their own money to pay down the national debt while broadcasters receive a free handout of spectrum assets. Worse yet, by giving additional spectrum away to broadcasters, Congress will not equalize the treatment of communications providers; in practice, it will create a highly uneven telecommunications playing field.<sup>41</sup>  The unfairness of this giveaway is summarized by <I>Los Angeles Times</I> columnist Michael Schrage: "Do we give farmers free farmland when they want to grow new kinds of crops?  So why should the FCC give spectrum to broadcasters who want to grow new business?"<sup>42</sup>  Schrage argues it would be "like giving the Baby Bells and the cable companies `free' fiber optics as they rewire America."<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although this blatant example of corporate welfare became an issue during the waning days of the battle over the comprehensive telecom bill early this year, it did not prevent the legislation's eventual passage, although Senate Majority Leader Dole did hold out for promises of hearings and introduction of a bill this year to rectify this situation.
<P>
<b>Why Auctions Alone Are Not Enough</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is important to note that auctions alone cannot solve the "zoning" problem discussed above. As Hazlett notes, "while auctions can distribute licenses in a relatively low-cost manner, they do nothing to distribute spectrum more efficiently. The federal government still micromanages markets, protecting the interests of incumbent licensees and doling out entry rights to new players only after years of frustration and struggle."<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, while it was wise of Congress and the FCC to move forward with auctions in 1993, Congress should not have allowed the FCC to limit the use of auctioned spectrum merely to personal communications services (PCS) uses. Instead, winning bidders should have been given the right to use purchased spectrum however they wished. Likewise, if Congress decides to reverse its current position and go forward with auctions of additional broadcast spectrum licenses, it should not require the FCC to box winning bidders into providing certain types of digital broadcast programming that may be technologically irrelevant in a few years. Achieving maximum efficient use of the spectrum resource means granting full flexibility in use to winning bidders -- in fact, to all spectrum users.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In sum, the FCC should not be selling licenses at all. It should be selling property rights. Licenses traditionally have restricted use, while property rights would define boundaries within which owners could use their allocations in any way they thought economically efficient and profitable. Moreover, a regime of auctions and property rights could encourage a number of alternative uses for many spectrum licenses, unlike the current system, which is too rigid to allow innovative alternatives to develop freely. As Coase explained in 1959:
<blockquote><P>
	Quite apart from the misallocations which are the result of political pressures, an administrative agency which attempts to perform the function normally carried out by the pricing mechanism operates under two handicaps. First of all, it lacks the precise monetary measure of benefit and cost provided by the market. Second, it cannot, by the nature of things, be in possession of all the relevant information possessed by the managers of every business which uses or might use radio frequencies, to say nothing of the preferences of consumers for the various goods and services in the production of which radio frequencies could be used.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thirty-six years later, Peter Pitsch, an adjunct fellow at the <a href="/pff">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a> and former chief of staff at the FCC, testified before Congress that this was still the case: "[T]he FCC like other central planners lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. [D]etermining efficient use is a complex task requiring vast amounts of continually updated information that is hopelessly beyond the abilities of the administrative process."<sup>46</sup>  In addition, Pitsch notes that this problem has grown worse with time since, "In the case of spectrum, the information required to make the necessary tradeoffs is greater than in most other areas of the economy, because the pace of technological development has created a raft of new uses for wireless communications and new ways in which spectrum can be efficiently deployed."<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<h4>SIDE EFFECTS OF FEDERAL SPECTRUM MISMANAGEMENT: THE "PUBLIC INTEREST" STANDARD AND CONTENT REGULATION</h4>
<hr> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic costs associated with federal spectrum mismanagement are high. Equally as damaging, however, is the degree to which federal regulators have used their authority to intrude on licensees' ability to operate freely once they have received their allocations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As mentioned earlier, when the Radio Act of 1927 became law, federal regulators were given the power to issue licenses if they found it was in the "public interest, convenience, or necessity."  This meant that regulators were given broad discretion when determining who would receive a license and how they could use that license. Unfortunately, the term "public interest" has never been clearly defined. As Coase noted over 35 years ago, "The phrase... lacks any definite meaning. Furthermore, the many inconsistencies in Commission decisions have made it impossible for the phrase to acquire a definite meaning in the process of regulation."<sup>48</sup>  More recently, critics have pointed out that regulation in the "public interest" has come to mean whatever regulators want it to mean at a given time.<sup>49</sup>  Hence, the "public interest" or "public trustee" model of regulation that sprang up around broadcasting gave regulators the ability to exert unusual influence and require that special demands be met as a condition of license renewal.<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, using the public interest rationale as a defense, in 1949 the FCC instituted the inappropriately named fairness doctrine. This doctrine required radio and television broadcasters to "afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of public importance."<sup>51</sup>  Instead of promoting the discussion of conflicting views and free speech in general, however, the fairness doctrine stifled it. In fact, over the span of its 40-year existence, it has been used as a tool of blatant political intimidation and influence backed by the threat of license revocation for failure to comply with the political whims of the day.<sup>52</sup>  The Reagan Administration FCC repealed the doctrine in 1987, citing First Amendment concerns and the fact that program diversity (informational, educational, religious, and entertainment fare) had increased steadily over time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the public trustee model has allowed the FCC both to demand that broadcasters restrict the amount of commercial airtime during children's viewing hours and to require that they air greater amounts of children's programming. Congress made this worse when it passed the Children's Television Act of 1990, which encouraged the FCC to expand regulations demanding a certain minimum number of hours of children's programming.<sup>53</sup>  Despite the noble intentions of policymakers and regulators intent on improving broadcast quality, these efforts have proven futile, even counterproductive. Because the public trustee social compact between broadcasters and regulators is kept intact by noble-minded but ineffective rules, industry competition is discouraged. If Congress continues to be content with half-hearted efforts to squeeze the most out of this regulatory arrangement, broadcast quality will never improve substantially. It is only greater competition within the field of video programming, not more restrictive social compacts and regulations, that can ensure improvement in the overall quality of broadcast fare over time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Making a Mockery of the First Amendment.</b> Even worse, such rules create an unfortunate schism within communication jurisprudence by ignoring First Amendment protections. Although most government attempts to impose prior restraints or requirements on speech constitute a <I>prima facie</I> violation of the First Amendment's mandate that "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,"<I>54</I> holders of spectrum allocations do not enjoy similar speech protections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Basically, once federal regulators rejected property rights and chose instead the public interest paradigm, they found it easier to regulate the electronic press (such as television and radio) in ways they could not regulate the print press (such as newspapers, magazines, and newsletters). As Krattenmaker and Powe argue, "by adopting public ownership of the spectrum and administrative control over its uses, Congress chose a legal regime for broadcasting that differs radically from the law that governs every other mass communications medium in the United States. Congress thus put its imprimatur on the twin myths that scarcity and interference are phenomena unique to broadcasting and that scarcity and interference necessitate administrative control of the quality of broadcasts."<sup>55</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consequently, although the print press traditionally has been accorded strict First Amendment protection from government efforts to manipulate speech and content, the electronic press has been accorded only secondary rights.<sup>56</sup>  First Amendment scholar Timothy Dyk notes that "it is reasonably clear that none of the programming rules or policies [applied to broadcasters] would be constitutional if applied to the print press."<sup>57</sup>  Timothy Dyk points to a number of cases that have invalidated legislative attempts to demand access to print media.<sup>58</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Therefore, Krattenmaker and Powe contend that content regulations such as the fairness doctrine, the Children's Television Act of 1990, and other similar rules should be repealed because "no proffered distinction for treating broadcasting differently from print justifies a different regulatory regime. Accordingly, all content regulation of broadcasting that could not be similarly applied to print or other mass communications media properly ought to be regarded as impermissible under the First Amendment."<sup>59</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regulators like to pretend they do not violate First Amendment standards. They argue that they are only operating within their statutorily defined powers to issue and renew spectrum licenses under the public interest standard they have sworn to uphold. Yet the license renewal process itself gives the government the ability to censor by threatening license revocation or fines. Although this is rare, it has occurred. It is the equivalent of regulatory extortion and flies in the face of traditional First Amendment thinking, because the government has no more right to demand certain types of speech than it has to restrict them.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A final and equally unacceptable justification for differential First Amendment treatment of broadcasters is that an individual or firm must obtain a license from the FCC before starting a broadcast station, whereas this is not the case with newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and the like. Yet, as mentioned above, licensing itself represented the first unjustifiable intervention by government into this arena and therefore cannot be used credibly to justify further mischief by federal regulators. If a property rights regime had been allowed to develop, no differential treatment would be allowed by the courts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, even if one accepts that there might be some role for the government in licensing spectrum, it does not follow that government should regulate its use as it now does. As noted legal commentator and newspaper columnist Bruce Fein says, "A lawyer needs a license to practice law, yet the government does not force a lawyer to spend equal time defending clients of opposite views. It is patently absurd to suggest that a license requirement in an industry is enough to allow the taking away of First Amendment rights."<sup>61</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hence, it is only the continuing belief in the scarcity rationale of federal spectrum management that continues to prop up this unconstitutional house of cards. If this rationale were rejected by the courts, all content regulations would likely fall as well. Although the scarcity rationale has been cited numerous times by the courts and Congress to justify content regulation of electronic media,<sup>62</sup> given the combination of its technological irrelevance and the recognition by the courts and many academics that it fails to justify broadcasting's unique treatment, it obviously no longer serves to justify content regulation.<sup>63</sup>

<h4>FOUR STEPS TO A FREE MARKET IN SPECTRUM</h4>
<hr>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If policymakers want to bring an end to this disastrous system of spectrum management, piecemeal reforms will not help. Only radical reform can succeed. The four key components of comprehensive and revolutionary spectrum reform are as follows:
<ol><p>
<li><b>Provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum.</b>
<blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Current holders of spectrum should be granted full flexibility to provide whatever type of service they want, however they want, whenever they want to consumers. There is no justification for continuing the rigid zoning restrictions on spectrum use that have evolved through seven decades of bureaucratic mismanagement. Americans are being denied access to countless innovative goods and services simply because spectrum holders have no incentive or ability to offer them. Although the opportunity costs associated with such rigid regulations are unquantifiable, it is reasonable to assume the U.S. economy is losing billions of dollars of economic activity. Providing full spectrum flexibility therefore will guarantee an increase in jobs, exports, and overall economic output. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, as long as spectrum remains a quasi-socialized public resource, it cannot be allocated efficiently or put to the best possible use. In essence, government cannot manage something as complex as the electromagnetic spectrum efficiently because bureaucratic processes are not suited to the task. What is needed, beyond flexibility in use, is a proven allocation mechanism that allows more effective utilization of the spectrum resource. A property right in the spectrum is the answer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to granting full flexibility in use, Congress could privatize the wireless spectrum by giving current holders a property right in their allocation. This means spectrum holders would no longer lease their allocation from the federal government, but instead would own it outright -- able to use it (or sell it) as they see fit. This also means that all arbitrary federal regulatory oversight of the spectrum would end. Federal regulators would be responsible only for enforcing technical trespass violations and disputes that arose between adjoining holders of spectrum.<sup>64</sup>
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Expand the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Auctions should be applied across the board to every spectrum use for which there is a mutually exclusive claim or that has not yet been allocated by the government. Congress should create the following three-step process by which spectrum can be allocated more effectively and auctioned off to move toward a property rights regime:
<p><blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 1: Efficiently assign and allocate underutilized spectrum.</b> Currently, much of the spectrum managed by the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration is undistributed or underutilized.<sup>65</sup>  Large and valuable parcels that could be deployed for private sector use by the FCC, and especially by the NTIA, are lying dormant or are hoarded by less efficient users. Congress should demand that unallocated private-sector spectrum and underutilized public spectrum be allocated immediately. In essence, any time a party files for claim to such spectrum, that party should be granted the right to use it as it sees fit. However, when competing claims for the same spectrum allocation exist, or when the public sector refuses to give up spectrum, the following two steps will be necessary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 2: Mandate that auctions be used where any competing claim for spectrum exists.</b> For all potential uses of spectrum for which there are competing claims, auctions should be utilized to allocate the spectrum. Firms would file plans of their bidding proposals with the FCC and then post bonds proving they have enough capital to bid credibly for the given allocation. The Commission also could establish competitive bidding rules (as it did in past PCS auctions) to ensure that bidding collusion does not take place. These auctions would not be limited to one-time events, but would be ongoing as spectrum claims developed and multiplied.<sup>66</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This policy should be employed for all new mutually exclusive claims for use of a particular spectrum allocation. This includes the rights to the second six-megahertz digital channel that broadcasters have requested. Although pressure from broadcaster groups will make it difficult politically to support such an auction, it would be fundamentally unfair for Congress to give such valuable property away while others are forced to compete for their desired spectrum in the open market. In addition, once broadcasters have been given complete operating flexibility, they can use their current six-megahertz allocation to convert to digital television however and whenever they feel it is appropriate. Furthermore, broadcasters and others can borrow against the value of their spectrum to raise funds to purchase any new spectrum they feel is needed to do business. Finally, the auction of this spectrum should not be restricted to any specific type of use, whether it be broadcasting or even more sophisticated digital types of transmission. Congress should make it clear to the FCC that the spectrum being auctioned can be used for whatever purpose buyers desire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 3: Provide incentives for the public sector to release additional spectrum.</b> Most important, Congress must disgorge much more spectrum from the public sector. One way to facilitate this process without demanding full knowledge of what they are doing with their spectrum is to create a simple incentive mechanism that would give agencies holding the spectrum a cut of the auction proceeds. For example, if the Department of Defense knew that it had been warehousing sizable portions of spectrum that it could afford to release, it might do so voluntarily if it knew it would receive, say, 15 to 25 percent of the auction proceeds. Beyond such incentives, Congress may find it necessary to demand that certain blocks of public spectrum be released immediately to the FCC for private auction, just as it was for previous PCS auctions.
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Redefine (or define for the first time) the "public interest" standard and ensure that First Amendment protections are provided equally to all media.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For over six decades, unconstrained spectrum regulation in the name of the "public interest" has demonstrated that what the FCC determines arbitrarily is in the public interest rarely is truly in the best interests of consumers. The reason is simple: Regulators, not consumers, are making the decision. Congress should scrap this fraudulent public interest paradigm entirely. If, however, lawmakers insist on continuing to rely on public interest FCC oversight, they should define the standard clearly in law. The new definition should focus on three specific criteria:
<p><blockquote><ul>
<li> The maximization of consumer welfare via the broadening of the general scope of individual decision-making within telecommunications markets;
<p>
<li>The utilization of market processes instead of regulatory proceedings whenever possible; and
<p>
<li> The full protection of First Amendment rights and equal First Amendment treatment of all communications media, whether print or electronic.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This "consumer welfare" standard would serve the interests of all Americans. It would guarantee that the federal bureaucracy is not in a position to manipulate and coerce spectrum holders into doing things they do not wish to. On the other hand, it would ensure that no spectrum holder is able to capture the regulatory apparatus and use it to exclude competitors.
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Transfer remaining spectrum authority from the FCC and NTIA to an independent body. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once the previous steps have been taken, the need for spectrum oversight by the FCC or the NTIA will be minimized. Because the NTIA soon may be abolished, all spectrum management should be removed from it immediately. Once property rights are established, remaining spectrum responsibilities (enforcement of technical trespass or nuisance violations) could be handled just as effectively by a smaller Spectrum Coordination Council or Board. The Board or Council would sit in the executive branch and be made up of no more than approximately 50 spectrum engineers, economists, and lawyers. The courts would play an important role in the adjudication of spectrum disputes, and private industry groups would be responsible for a large portion of self-regulation, as they are now. Finally, the Board or Council would represent American interests in international meetings or disputes over spectrum allocations so that all remaining authority over such global issues can be transferred from the Department of State.
<p></ol>
<h4>CONCLUSION</h4><hr>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Seven decades of federal spectrum ownership and management have met with predictable failure. While virtually all other resources have been left to private owners to manage in America's free enterprise system, spectrum has remained a quasi-socialized resource. The result: Other resources have been deployed and utilized far more efficiently and effectively while spectrum innovation and entrepreneurialism continue to be held captive by federal regulation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Spectrum socialism should end -- and must end -- if the United States hopes to remain on the cutting edge of wireless innovation. Policymakers must look beyond their myopic focus on older wireline industries and find new ways to encourage entrepreneurship in the wireless arena. Property rights in spectrum will guarantee such a result, since only by granting spectrum holders full flexibility and ownership in their allocation can policymakers expect to witness such a dramatic transformation. Unleashing the spectrum is the only way to ensure that this transformation is successful and the communications revolution is complete.

<li>    This should not be surprising. "Responsible for the continued provision and improvement of service, [the regulatory commission] comes increasingly and understandably to identify the interest of the public with that of the existing companies on whom it must rely to deliver goods."  Therefore, "When a commission is responsible for the performance of an industry, it is under never completely escapable pressure to protect the health of the companies it regulates, to assure a desirable performance by relying on those monopolistic chosen instruments and its own controls rather than on the unplanned and unplannable forces of competition."

<li>    Quoted in <I>ibid.</I>, pp. 157-158.<p>
<li>    Many decades later, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) assumed responsibility for the management and allocation of all spectrum utilized by the federal government.<p>
<li>    The scarcity rationale was developed primarily through a series of court cases and FCC decisions over the past six decades. Most notably in <I>NBC v. United States</I>, 319 U.S. 190 (1943), <I>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC</I>, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), and <I>CBS v. FCC</I>, 453 U.S. 367 (1981), the Supreme Court argued that scarcity made broadcasting a unique business and that this demanded special treatment to guarantee "the public interest" would be served. Yet the courts also noted similar restrictions on the print medium would be an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. See <I>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo</I>, 418 U.S. 241 (1974). Likewise, recent court cases have held that cable television must be accorded more strict First Amendment protections than broadcast, even though cable is also an electronic medium. See <I>Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC</I>, 567 F. 2d 9 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <I>Midwest Video Corp. v. FCC</I>, (8th Cir. 1978); <I>Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC</I>, 768 F. 2d 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1985). These cases all were heard by lower courts, however, as the Supreme Court has refused continually to hear such cases. This is due most likely to the fact that the Court realizes technological innovation continues to obliterate traditional media boundaries, making court decisions based on the scarcity rationale increasingly confusing and unjustifiable.<p>

<li>    This does not mean, however, that broadcasters put up a serious fight to end the public trustee paradigm. In fact, on one hand they speak of its importance to ensure that viable competitors are kept out of their market, while on the other they cite its intrusiveness as an excuse to produce mediocre programming. As Henry Geller, fellow at the Markle Foundation, notes, "A broadcaster loves to be considered a public interest figure.

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During the past year, House and Senate Republicans have been working tirelessly to enact a balanced budget plan that gives America's families much-needed tax relief.<sup>1</sup>  Simultaneously, they have devised a plan to deregulate the U.S. telecommunications industry, freeing it from over six decades of regulatory red tape.<sup>2</sup>  Unfortunately, these efforts 
have come into conflict because the telecom bill potentially would cheat American families and 
taxpayers out of tens of billions of dollars of tax relief merely to appease special interests within the 
multibillion-dollar broadcast industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Buried deep in the almost 300-page telecom bill, which stalled after a tentative conference  agreement was reached, is a clause requiring that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) carry out an ill-conceived plan giving America's broadcast industry additional licenses to use part of  the electromagnetic spectrum to broadcast digital television services. Broadcasters already possess licenses which allow them to provide the traditional analog television programming with which 
most Americans are familiar; now they have convinced Congress and the FCC to give them 
additional licenses to make the transition to superior resolution digital television free-of-charge 
until they can give back their old spectrum licenses for auctioning some time in the future. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) has intervened at the last minute and raised serious questions about the fairness of such an enormous giveaway of federal spectrum property without taxpayer compensation. As he told <i>The New York Times</i> recently, "This is a big, big corporate welfare project. Here we're cutting Medicaid and doing all the painful things while we lend [broadcasters] the spectrum for 12 years. Why shouldn't they pay for it?"<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, at a time when Congress is working to balance the federal budget while providing families 
and investors with tax relief, it is ironic that it should give away such a valuable asset to some of the 
wealthiest companies in the country. Experts at the FCC have estimated that auctioning the 
spectrum that broadcasters are demanding could raise as much as $70 billion. To put this into 
perspective, $70 billion would pay for:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Three years of the congressionally approved $500-per-child tax credit that benefits 28 million 
families raising 51 million children.
<p>
<li> The entire economic growth tax package proposed by Congress, including the capital gains tax 
cut.
<p>
<li> $70 billion in debt reduction that would save taxpayers nearly $3 billion each year in interest 
payments on the national debt.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With agreement almost reached on the House and Senate telecommunications bills (H.R. 1555 and 
S. 652), this represents what may be the last chance to alter a disastrous policy which combines the 
worst elements of corporate welfare and industrial policy at the expense of American taxpayers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>A Misguided and Costly Plan.</b> Many things are wrong with this plan. First, it represents 
arrogant industrial planning on the part of the federal government. Legislators and FCC bureaucrats 
are arguing in essence that a single digital broadcast television channel should emerge to replace the 
current analog channel Americans are used to receiving from major networks. This is the equivalent 
of industrial planning, since federal policymakers in effect are attempting to determine a specific 
outcome within the highly innovative telecommunications industry. No one knows what type of 
video services will be demanded or even viable in the future. But, instead of letting the market 
decide, policymakers are trying to pre-determine the shape of competition within the broadcast 
video marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, broadcasters have justified this giveaway by appealing to false fears and technological 
misperceptions. The truth is, broadcasting can survive without a handout. Someone always will find 
a way to deliver television video programming to consumers at affordable rates. If incumbent 
broadcasters feel they really need additional spectrum to compete with their many new rivals 
(cable, satellite television, on-line computer services, for example), they can purchase it on the open 
market in an auction like everyone else. It is difficult to sympathize with firms like the Walt Disney 
Co. (which just spent $19 billion to acquire ABC) and Westinghouse Electric Corp. (which spent 
$5 billion for CBS) when they plead impoverishment as a defense.<sup> 4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, broadcasters also argue that failure to give them a handout will mean the death of "free over 
the air television."  They apparently want legislators to believe that Americans would rather shell 
out billions more in taxes for deficit reduction than spend the small amount that may be required to 
purchase certain video services from competing providers. The idea that television service will be 
too expensive for Americans to afford without a giveaway is a straw man; competition, not 
corporate handouts, will provide more and better quality television programming at extremely 
affordable rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This leads to the fourth and most outrageous broadcast industry justification for the spectrum 
giveaway: that without it, they will not be able to continue to deliver a host of quality "public 
interest" services to the consumer. In other words, they can continue to air quality children's 
programming and other educational fare only if the government gives them additional free licenses. 
This is a questionable justification for free additional spectrum licenses, however, given that 
broadcasters have been criticized so severely in the past precisely for the mediocre quality of their 
television broadcasts. Apparently, they now expect Congress and the American people to ignore 
just how poorly they have lived up to their "public interest" obligations and instead give them just 
one more chance to prove themselves, albeit at substantial cost to the taxpayer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, other spectrum users are justifiably angry at being forced to spend billions in recent 
auctions of other spectrum licenses for non-broadcast services. Cellular firms, telephone 
companies, the cable industry, and other communications companies are asking why broadcasters 
are receiving free spectrum properties from the government when they have been forced to pay on 
the open market in recent auctions for additional spectrum. To date, these auctions have raised 
almost $10 billion for the U.S. Treasury. This is $10 billion less that American taxpayers and 
families will have to pay to help reduce the deficit. Yet the broadcasters, using specious arguments 
and blatant political influence, have convinced Congress to forgo an additional $10 billion to $70 
billion in spectrum revenues and just give this spectrum away to their industry without taxpayer 
compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Overwhelming Opposition to Multibillion Dollar "Rip-Off."</b>  Although this giveaway 
has gone largely unnoticed by the public, many critics on both the left and right have voiced their 
opposition. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> labeled it "a multi-billion dollar handout for wealthy 
TV-station owners," and warned that Republican capitulation on the issue would be "wildly at odds 
with their anti-entitlement ideology."<sup>5</sup>   The <i>Journal</i> also remarks that this giveaway is all the more remarkable since this is a Congress "desperately scrambling to balance the budget, making 
its job harder by voluntarily forgoing billions in spectrum auction revenues."<sup>6</sup>  Karen 
Kerrigan, president of the <a href="/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, also refers to 
the plan as "one of the greatest government giveaways in history," and notes that it "reflects 
wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset."<sup>7 </sup>  Liberal public-interest groups such as the 
Consumer Federation of America, People for the American Way, and the Media Access Project 
also have expressed opposition.<sup> 8</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to <i>Time</i> magazine, "The spectrum handout is a classic example of how 
government subsidies live on after their rationales have expired."<sup>9 </sup>  The editorial page 
of <i>The New York Times</i> also sides with Senator Dole in his effort to stop the "big 
giveaway," arguing that "Mr. Dole is taking the right action to protect taxpayers."<sup>10</sup>  
And <i>Times</i> columnist William Safire calls the giveaway "an outrageous taxpayer rip-
off."<sup>11</sup>  "This rip-off is on a scale vaster than dreamed of by yesteryear's robber barons. 
It's as if each American family is to be taxed $1,000 to enrich the stockholders of Disney, G.E. and 
Westinghouse."<sup>12 </sup>  That is exactly what is about to take place.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Families and Investors Will Pay the Price.</b> As mentioned above, it is unlikely that 
broadcasters will be put out of business if forced to bid on spectrum rights through competitive 
auction. However, if taxpayers are cheated out of a significant portion of the tax cuts promised 
them as an element of the balanced budget, they will be hurt significantly. <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi83.html">Economic analysis</a> 
conducted by Heritage Foundation economists shows that the tax cut element of the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1995 would add some $1,500 per household in higher GDP than the same plan 
without tax cuts. Also, household income would be increased on average by nearly 
$2,000.<sup>13</sup>  There is no justification for forcing individual families and the economy in 
general to lose these benefits while a few well-connected companies benefit from free spectrum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Answer is to Auction.</b> Even if the auctions did not pull in the full $70 billion, 
anything raised to offset the deficit and lower the burden on American taxpayers and families 
would be worth the effort. But it is very likely an auction of this taxpayer property would generate 
such revenues. The spectrum being given away is among the most valuable in the government's 
possession, since it can be used for multiple applications, not just television broadcasting. William 
Safire has even noted that these numbers may be too low, arguing that the sale of additional 
spectrum eventually could raise a staggering half-trillion dollars for the U.S. 
Treasury.<sup>14</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Equally as important will be the effect of an auction on competition within the entire 
telecommunications industry. Selling off the spectrum will ensure it is put to its most highly valued 
use and mean more competition throughout the industry. As Peter C. Cramton of the University of 
Maryland notes: "Nearly every constituent benefits from auctioning the airwaves. Taxpayers, 
consumers, and firms are all better off with auctions. The only losers are inefficient firms, which 
are unsuccessful in the auctions, but have a chance in lotteries or comparative 
hearings."<sup>15</sup>  Like lotteries and comparative hearings, which have been used by the 
FCC to distribute TV licenses in the past, this current giveaway would sacrifice market efficiency 
to special-interest influence. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clearly, however, the most important aspect of such an auction would be what it would do for 
American taxpayers and families -- lower the burden the federal deficit places upon them. Again, as 
Cramton argues, "The auction outcome is compelling to taxpayers. So long as budget deficits 
remain a problem, it is hard to imagine that Congress would be able to reverse the auction decision 
without setting off a grass-roots rebellion among taxpayers."<sup>16</sup>  Yet this is exactly 
what is about to occur. If policymakers want to do what is in the best interests of American 
taxpayers and families, they must look beyond the self-interested motivations and misperceptions 
being put forward by the multibillion-dollar broadcast industry, which has nothing to lose and 
everything to gain by taking valuable taxpayer property without compensation.

<a href="#five">FIVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL TRULY DEREGULATORY</a><br>
<a href="#conclusion">CONCLUSION</a><p>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

	Following the recent Senate passage of S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition 
and Deregulation Act of 1995, the House of Representatives is ready to act on companion 
legislation, H.R. 1555, the Communications Act of 1995. The chief sponsors of this legislation 
are Representatives Thomas Bliley (R-VA), John Dingell (D-MI), and Jack Fields (R-TX). 
Unfortunately, like the Senate bill, the House bill fails to take the many important steps needed 
to deregulate, completely and comprehensively, all aspects of this industry. Worse yet, the House 
bill actually adds new regulatory powers to an already bloated federal bureaucracy. If Congress 
hopes to produce landmark deregulatory telecommunications legislation this year, the House 
must make important changes in the bill.<p>

<a name="what's"></a><h4>WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG WITH THE BILL</h4><p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents</a> ]<p>
	Although H.R. 1555 does include some positive incremental improvements in current 
law, it needs to go much further to achieve real reform. The bill takes important steps toward 
liberalizing the telecommunications market. For example, like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1555:<p> 
<b>
<ul>
 <li>Eliminates many important barriers to industry-wide competition in both voice and 
video markets,

 <li>Provides incentives to open the traditionally uncompetitive local market to competition,

  <li>Eliminates elements of the 1992 Cable Act, and

  <li>Somewhat liberalizes broadcast ownership restrictions.
</ul>
</b>
However, the legislation also is riddled with unnecessary regulation and new mandates. For 
instance, the bill purports to establish a framework to minimize bureaucracy and regulation, yet 
contains well over 100 new rule-making provisions for the Federal Communications 
Commission alone. According to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, the agency "will need substantial 
resources" to implement the legislation. "We'll need economists, statisticians, and business 
school graduates." (1)  Testifying at a June 19 House hearing, Hundt noted the agency would need a 
substantial increase in funding next year because passage of the legislation would put the agency 
"on the verge of a prodigiously detailed undertaking." (2)<p>  
	This beefed-up activity may be the type of "deregulation" that FCC bureaucrats like, but 
it is very different from what most industry experts and consumers would view as true 
deregulation.<p>

	Among its disturbing regulatory provisions, H.R. 1555:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Establishes excessive entry tests for Baby Bell companies seeking to enter long-distance 
markets.</b> Before removing outdated restrictions on Baby Bell entrance into the long-distance 
market, H.R. 1555 requires the companies to meet a series of standards to prove their local 
market is open to competition. Yet, the bill contains a perverse incentive that makes meeting 
these standards very difficult.<p>

	Before the Bells are deregulated, they must prove they face regional "facilities-based 
competitors" that offer comparable network service to both business and residential 
customers. However, they also must prove they are providing access to their own networks at 
"economically feasible rates" to allow competitors to resale service through the Bell 
infrastructure. This would create a perverse incentive, because competitors are unlikely to 
build a competing network if they can resale off the Bells' network at low rates. Competitors 
will find it more profitable to resale instead of building the competing infrastructure that 
needs to be present for the Bells to pass the "facilities-based" test. Consequently, Bell entry 
into long distance may be delayed for some time.<p>

		Another bill passed by the House Judiciary Committee could further complicate this 
process if it is included in H.R. 1555. The Antitrust Consent Decree Reform Act of 1995 
(H.R. 1528), sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), would add a role for the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) in determining whether a Bell should be granted access to the 
long-distance market. Basically, the DOJ could deny Bells access to that market if it found 
there was a "dangerous probability" they could monopolize another market. Combined with 
the excessively bureaucratic test already contained in H.R. 1555, this would place almost 
insurmountable obstacles on the path to operating freedom. Furthermore, consumers would 
be denied access to new competitors and their services.<p>

 <li><b>Requires that a separate subsidiary be established each time a telephone company 
wants to enter a new line of business</b>. Before a Baby Bell can enter long-distance, video 
services, or electronic publishing markets, it must establish an entirely separate entity to 
deliver that service. This means unnecessary duplication of facilities and staff, higher 
operating costs, and lower overall efficiency. The Bells should be allowed to enter a new line 
of business in any manner they find efficient and profitable, just as any other business can.<p>

  <li><b>Fails to eliminate barriers to international investment.</b>  Although an amendment to H.R. 
1555 allows some opening of the American market to foreign investment, such beneficial 
activity still would be delayed while the executive branch determined whether it was 
warranted. This would give provide American firms time to delay the liberalization process 
to discourage additional competition. Outright repeal would ensure a steady increase in the 
flow of capital to the American telecommunications market and a subsequent increase in job 
opportunities, just as free trade has accomplished in such other areas as computers and 
automobiles.<p>

  <li><b>Expands telecommunications entitlements.</b>  Like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1555 expands 
uncompetitive and ineffective subsidies that flow to corporations instead of to individuals. 
The bill contains broad, open-ended mandates for the FCC and the states to design and 
deliver a more extensive package of communications services to all Americans, in part by 
manipulating the rates consumers pay for those services. <p>

		For example, subsidies generally flow from long-distance to local users, business to 
residential users, and urban to rural users. These overlapping cross-subsidies have destroyed 
industry competition by discouraging market entry, since few potential competitors have the 
capital necessary to take on the subsidized firms. (3)  By artificially elevating prices in the long-
distance market, these subsidies have cost society between $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year 
in higher prices. (4)  Because the House plan preserves and expands many of these mechanisms, 
it distorts market competition and fails to ensure access to more innovative and truly price-
competitive services. (5)<p>

  <li><b>Fails to move toward complete privatization of the radio spectrum.</b> By missing another 
chance to denationalize the government-owned national resource of radio spectrum, the bill 
fails to open the wireless world to even more vigorous competition. Although making some 
minor modifications in FCC licensing authority and relaxing some ownership restrictions, 
H.R. 1555 makes no effort to create property rights in spectrum ownership or to allow 
holders of spectrum the flexibility to use their spectrum as they choose. Spectrum holders 
now can use their allocation only for purposes defined by the FCC. For example, the holder 
of a television station spectrum license may not convert that station into a cellular telephone 
system even if it would be more efficient and profitable to do so. H.R. 1555 does nothing to 
rectify this inefficient policy.<p>

  <li><b>Makes no serious attempt to minimize bureaucracy.</b> Instead of taking the opportunity to 
eliminate entire branches and bureaus of the FCC, the bill will lead instead to an increase in 
the size and power of the federal bureaucracy overseeing the communications industry. The 
FCC will be responsible for the administration of numerous new transitional rules and 
regulations. This will prevent deregulation from proceeding rapidly, because the agency 
works against market liberalization. (6)<p>

	In addition to these many flaws, the bill fails to remove all rate and price regulation; fails 
to lift unnecessary licensing and tariffing requirements; (7)  fails to allow utilities into 
telecommunications markets they currently are prohibited from entering; fails to define what it 
means to regulate "in the public interest" even though many important decisions hinge on such a 
determination; (8)  and fails to include any mention of the First Amendment.<p>

	The legislative approach being taken by the Senate and House is most appropriately 
labeled "deregulatory industrial policy." Supporters of deregulatory industrial policy are 
convinced they can "create" competition in the telecom industry by rigging the rules of the game 
to achieve desired results. Countless safeguards, transitional rules, and continued protections for 
certain industry segments remain in the bills, supposedly to create a "fair playing field." True 
deregulation, on the other hand, would remove the many unnecessary regulations that constrain 
the industry without adding numerous new rules in the process.<p>

	Although creating a more competitive communications market is a desirable goal, it is 
unlikely the existing regulatory apparatus is up to the task. The FCC and state regulatory 
commissions have done more to destroy competitive opportunities than to create them. And it is 
these institutions that will be charged with creating "competition" under the current Senate and 
House approach. Telecommunications' sister industry --  computers  -- is a good example of how 
competition can develop without centralized direction, regulation, or subsidy. Market power is 
constrained by vigorous technological innovation and consumer choice -- not by arbitrary 
bureaucratic edict. This should be the model for telecommunications.<p>
</ul>



  	



<a name="five"></a><h4>FIVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL TRULY DEREGULATORY</h4>
<p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents </a>]<p>
Despite these weaknesses in the bill, proponents argue correctly that it represents 
an improvement over the status quo. But the House should strengthen the framework 
established in H.R. 1555 by more completely and effectively deregulating the industry. 
Five simple changes would accomplish this.
<p>
<b>Change #1: Mandatory Forbearance and the "Most Favored Regulation" Clause</b>
The addition of a mandatory forbearance clause would relieve competitive carriers 
from all regulation and open the market to unconstrained competition. A competitive 
carrier would be defined as any carrier facing either actual or impending rivalry. In 
markets where competition is less pervasive, such as the residential telephone market, 
regulatory constraints would remain in effect until a pre-determined list of requirements 
like those found in the bill is met. For example, after completing the "checklist" 
requirements, Baby Bell companies would be considered competitive and therefore 
eligible for forbearance from regulation.
<p>
The addition of mandatory forbearance should include a "most favored 
regulation" clause similar to the most favored nation (MFN) treatment accorded by global free trade agreements. Countries that are granted MFN treatment can import their goods on identical terms as other countries. In other words, MFN requires non-discriminatory legal treatment in trade. 
<p>
This same concept can be applied to ensure non-discriminatory regulatory treatment of competing providers and technologies in telecommunications markets. Once a carrier seeks to offer a new service, it can be regulated no more stringently than its least regulated competitor. Such a provision would ensure regulatory parity within 
telecommunications markets as the lines between existing technologies begin to blur.
<p>
<b>Change #2: Mandatory Sunsetting of New Rules After Two to Three Years</b>
A second important change in H.R. 1555 recognizes that while there may be a 
need for transitional rules, they should be phased out as quickly as possible. Although the bill clearly contains too many transitional rules, some will probably remain. For these, the House should include language sunsetting their applicability after a two- or three-year transition period. Any perceived need for their continued existence will have to be dealt with in subsequent legislation or the rules will become invalid.
<p>
<b>Change #3: Devolving Telecommunications Entitlements</b>
This change would create a more sensible method of subsidization by transferring full authority over the definition and delivery of universal service to the states, thereby ensuring a more geographically tailored and state-specific subsidization policy that targeted subsidies more precisely to those who need them most. Because H.R. 1555 could be scored as a tax increase by the Congressional Budget Office, this alternative would address the problems raised by the House approach.
<p>
Again, the "most favored regulation" concept would apply to the provision of 
subsidies to ensure that no company received an unfair advantage over a competitor. By requiring non-discriminatory subsidization, this amendment would discourage states from subsidizing corporations and encourage them to design a means-tested, voucher-like mechanism to deliver assistance directly to individuals instead of through companies.
<p>
<b>Change #4: First Amendment Parity for All Media</b>
All media, whether print or electronic, should be accorded the same First 
Amendment protection under the law. It makes little sense to regulate an on-line service provider of news differently than a daily newspaper. As such technologies converge, it will become difficult, if not impossible, to regulate them under different standards. H.R. 1555 makes no mention of the First Amendment or of how electronic technologies should be regulated. Congress should recognize the importance of placing all technologies on equal regulatory footing by mandating they be granted the same First Amendment protections. (9) 
<p>
<b>Change #5: Creating a Free Market for Spectrum</b>
Beyond the incremental reforms found in H.R. 1555, lawmakers should free the 
electromagnetic radio spectrum from its seven-decade-old regulatory constraints. All 
incumbent holders of spectrum should be granted irrevocable, perpetual property rights in their wireless holdings. Like all other property, spectrum could be used as the owner sees fit, subject to common law standards of trespass and interference. More important, the FCC would be directed to auction off immediately all competing claims for unused spectrum. Finally, to encourage the government to disgorge as much of its current spectrum as possible, federal agencies would be provided with a certain percentage of any <p> revenues raised from the sale of their spectrum. This would encourage government spectrum users to place some of their vast spectrum holdings on the auctioning block to be purchased for more efficient uses. This plan, originally laid out in a recent report by the <a href="http://www.pff.org">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>,  would guarantee more efficient deployment and use of wireless communications technologies. 
<p>
<a name="conclusion"></a><b>Conclusion</b><p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents</a> ]<p>
Many supporters of H.R. 1555 argue that adding more radical pro-deregulatory 
language to the bill decreases the likelihood of final passage. However, it is unlikely that a more principled bill would face any more serious opposition than the current bill. 
<p>
Proponents of the current telecommunications bill also point out that it represents 
the first of many efforts at comprehensive deregulation of the telecommunications 
industry and that additional improvements can be made in subsequent legislation. This is unlikely. On June 19, the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee held a single two-hour hearing to discuss the future of the FCC. No budget cuts were recommended and no substantial changes in the FCC's current structure were proposed -- despite earlier public calls by leaders of that committee for a radical downsizing of the agency.
<p>
Although spectrum policy could be dealt with in a separate bill, it is unclear why 
it should be broken out of the current legislation since a competitive wireless sector is 
essential to a more competitive wireline sector. If Congress waits months or even years to deregulate the wireless sector properly, a truly uneven playing field could result, further wireless technological innovation could be repressed, and local telephone competition could be delayed.
<p>
 The House must help the Senate fundamentally reform U.S. telecommunications 
policy. It can do this by removing -- immediately and unconditionally -- all barriers to 
entry, scrapping any overly regulatory language remaining in the bill, effectively 
reforming the universal service subsidy mechanisms as well as wireless spectrum policy, and  guaranteeing that First Amendment protections are enforced equally across all media.
<p>
If the House misses this final opportunity to remove the bill's excess regulatory 
baggage and strengthen its market-oriented elements, it is unlikely that Congress will 
produce a truly deregulatory bill this year.

<TITLE>How to Solve the CBO's Telecom Tax Problem  -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H3><I>HOW TO SOLVE THE CBO'S TELECOM TAX PROBLEM </I>
</H3>
<P> 
By Adam D. Thierer<BR> 
Executive Memorandum #414<br>
May 23, 1995<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
 
	The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has scored S. 
652, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act 
of 1995, as a new $7 billion tax on the telecommunications 
industry.  The reason for this is that certain provisions of 
the legislation expand federally mandated subsidy transfers 
across industries, maintaining lower prices in one segment 
of the market (local, rural, and residential) at the expense 
of another (urban, business, and long-distance).  Although 
the subsidies do not flow directly through the federal 
government, the CBO correctly concludes that they should be 
scored as taxes because "payments between companies are made 
as a result of the exercise of the sovereign power of the 
federal government, not as a normal business transaction 
between companies." 
 <P>
	S.  652, as currently drafted, will increase the use of 
these subsidy flows to deliver more advanced 
telecommunications services to some Americans.  
Traditionally, these subsidies have been used only to spread 
the delivery of basic telephone service.  The new 
legislation, however, requires an "evolving" definition of 
universal service, meaning more than basic phone service 
must be subsidized.  In addition, the bill demands that all 
Americans be provided with advanced telecommunications 
services once "a substantial majority" have access.  These 
provisions would be extremely costly to administer and, 
therefore, would require increased taxes. 
 <P>
	While these problems must be addressed, Congress should 
not permit CBO's findings to threaten the success of broader 
legislative initiatives to deregulate the telecommunications 
industry.  Fortunately, lawmakers have two options for 
addressing these findings and continuing to move forward 
with this legislation:  
 <P>
 
 OPTION #1: 	 Give states control of universal service. 
 <P>
 
	The current federal telecommunications entitlement 
program, with its overlapping and inefficient cross-
subsidies, should end.  Congress could do this by giving 
states responsibility for designing, defining, financing, 
and delivering universal service.  Roughly three-fourths of 
these subsidies already are administered at the state and 
local levels.  Congress could establish a Federal-State 
Joint Board to transfer any remaining federal authority to 
the states.  The Board also could provide guidance to the 
states on how to eliminate current cross-subsidies that flow 
to multi-billion dollar corporations.  It could replace them 
with means-tested vouchers that give individual consumers 
deemed needy the means to choose among several providers, 
instead of forcing them to rely on a single monopolistic 
provider. 
 <P>
	This is a sound policy option to address the tax 
problem created by an inefficient system of subsidies to 
large corporations.  By contrast, any plan to maintain a 
federal role in the delivery of universal service would 
require tax increases to cover subsidy costs.  Sending or 
"devolving" all responsibility to the states would eliminate 
this federal tax problem while ensuring that universal 
service is delivered more effectively. 
 <P>
OPTION #2:  Table universal service for further study while 
moving forward with other                        
deregulatory initiatives. 
 
 <P>
	Congress could move forward with its broader efforts to 
remove barriers to entry, putting off reform of 
subsidization mechanisms for a few months and dealing with 
it in separate legislation at a later date.  This would 
eliminate the federal tax problem as long as other 
legislative provisions do not create additional cross-
subsidies.  However, Congress must follow three steps to 
ensure that any bill that passes does not contain a telecom 
tax: 
 <P>
STEP 1:	Eliminate all current universal service language 
from the bill. 
 <P>
STEP 2:	Do nothing to alter the current system in the 
interim. 
 <P>
STEP 3:	Include a provision requiring the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) or a presidentially 
appointed independent panel to complete a study within six 
months after enactment that requires the FCC or the panel to 
do the following: 
 <P>
Provide a detailed description of all implicit and explicit 
subsidies (both federal and state) utilized currently to 
provide universal service. 
 <P>
Quantify the cost of each of the described subsidies and the 
economic costs and benefits associated with each subsidy.  
This also would include a description of the providers and 
recipients of such subsidies. 
 <P>
Present its findings to Congress for immediate 
consideration.  The study also should have to present 
Congress with alternative policy options for ensuring the 
delivery of universal service.  This would need to include 
the feasibility of giving states complete responsibility for 
universal service as outlined in Option #1.  If Congress 
requires the FCC or an independent panel to study the 
current universal service system and policy alternatives, it 
will have more and better information than    currently 
exists on how to reform the system.  
 <P>
	 These two options provide Congress with a solution to 
CBO's findings while continuing to pursue broader 
telecommunications reform.  Such reform is critical to 
dismantling a system that now destroys competitive  
incentives in the local telephone market while draining 
billions of dollars from American businesses and  consumers.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
       The full Senate is poised to vote on legislation to deregulate the
telecommunications industry.  Unfortunately, the leading bill, while a
modest improvement on current law, misses the opportunity to benefit
consumers by opening the industry to real competition.  If this leading U.S. 
industry is to live up to its potential, and consumers are to reap the rewards
of full competition and innovation, the Senate must make major changes in
the bill.
<P>
       Last year's telecommunications deregulation bill, S.  1822, died in
the Senate because of dissatisfaction with the overly regulatory approach
produced principally by Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC).  Very late in the
legislative session, then Minority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) began
circulating a draft deregulation bill that was a mere 30 pages long --
compared to the approximately 200-page Hollings bill.  Instead of granting
segments of the industry continued protection from competition, as the
Hollings bill did, the Dole draft legislation removed almost all barriers to
competition immediately.  For example, compared with the many pages of
regulation in S.  1822 dealing with Title VI of the Communications Act of
1934 (governing cable regulation), the Dole bill simply stated that "Title VI
of the Communications Act of 1934 is repealed."  This would have
deregulated the cable market completely upon implementation had the bill
become law.
<P>
       A choice of paradigms.  Thus, when members and key
telecommunications staffers on the Senate Commerce Committee began
meeting late last year to craft legislation for this session, they had a clear
choice of models:  S.  1822, which granted certain deregulatory freedoms
while still restraining competition in other ways, or the Dole draft
legislation to deregulate immediately and comprehensively almost all aspects
and segments of the telecommunications market.  Following the Dole model
would mean little to no intervention by bureaucrats and a more rapid
transition to complete market liberalization.
<P>
       Unfortunately, they have tried to craft a hybrid of both models.  The
result:  a bill that fails to create a clear, consistent, and unconstrained
environment for America's telecommunications industry.  During the early
weeks of this year, relatively "clean" legislation was revised many times,
with each revision moving further toward the Hollings model by adding
more regulatory baggage in an apparent effort to appease various segments
of the industry seeking to avoid new entrants into their markets.  Not
surprisingly, therefore, the first formal draft to emerge publicly from
Chairman Larry Pressler's (R-SD) office was, in many ways, already an
unsatisfactory compromise. 
<P>
        When the final bill emerged at a Senate Commerce Committee
mark-up on March 23, it was even less satisfactory than earlier drafts. 
Apparently in a last-minute effort to gain the support of several Democratic
members of the Commerce Committee, most deregulatory elements of the
bill were watered down.  Even so, many Democrats continued to express
reservations, and several pro-regulatory amendments were added to address
their concerns.  At the end of mark-up, the bill being sent to the floor
comprised close to 150 pages and contained almost 100 new rule-making
provisions for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The
capitulation to the Hollings model was complete.
<P>
       To be sure, the bill contains some important improvements over
current law.  For example, the Pressler bill would:
<P>
Eliminate many important barriers to industry-wide competition,
<P>
Provide incentives to open the traditionally uncompetitive local market to
competition,
<P>
Eliminate elements of the 1992 Cable Act,
<P>
Allow somewhat increased foreign investment, and
<P>
Devise a system to scale back FCC powers.
<P>
       
       But these benefits are largely outweighed by provisions that retain
or extend suffocating rules.  For example:
<P>
Arbitrary FCC-administered "entry tests" could cause potentially lengthy
delays before competition is allowed in certain industry segments.
<P>
Some elements of the destructive Cable Act will remain in effect, and rules
regulating the video industry remain confusing.
<P>
Foreign ownership rules are relaxed only for a portion of U.S.  industry and
could be enforced retroactively after repeal.
<P>
No serious effort is made to eliminate the FCC or specific bureaus of the
agency; other rules in the bill could increase its size and power.
<P>
There is no serious reform of the electromagnetic radio spectrum to
encourage increased wireless competition and innovation.
<P>
The bill maintains and expands telecommunications entitlements that
discourage industry competition.
<P>
       After seeing this final bill, more deregulatory-minded legislators such
as Senator John McCain (R-AZ) were left asking, "Why do we need to
make a deal if it's a bad deal?"  Indeed, it is unclear why concessions
were made to industry special interests by the committee.  It is likely that
a bill modeled on the Dole draft of last year could win passage in both
houses of Congress.  However, now that one modeled more closely on the
Hollings approach has been adopted by the Commerce Committee, the
Senate must focus on how to improve S.  652, The Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.  If this legislation becomes law
as structured today, consumers will not be able to look forward to serious
telecommunications deregulation or competition in the short term.
<P>


WHAT IS GOOD AND BAD ABOUT THE PRESSLER PLAN
<P>
       The Pressler bill essentially is the product of two diametrically
opposed models of telecommunications deregulation.  Thus, both good and
bad elements can be found juxtaposed within the bill.  It is important to
separate the unneeded regulatory elements from the more sound deregulatory
components to consider what needs to be changed in the bill to create a
sound deregulatory environment for the industry.  One way to do this is to
compare the bill with a set of criteria for what could be considered true,
free-market-oriented deregulatory reform. 
<P>       
        Seven such general principles can be used to judge the deregulatory
nature of the bill: 
<P>
Creation of sensible interconnection policy to open the local market to
competition;

<P>
CRITERION #1:  Creation of a Sensible Interconnection Policy
<P>
Grade:  A 
<P>
Good Points:  A "competitive checklist" provides right incentives to open
local market to competition; does not apply policies too broadly.
<P>
Bad Points:  None.
<P>
       The Pressler bill creates a sensible interconnection policy to ensure
the local telephone market is opened to competition as soon as possible.  A
14-point "competitive checklist" is established that allows competitors access
to the "Baby Bell's" local telephone network.  This framework is based on
an "open access" philosophy, which encourages the expansion of rivals to
incumbent monopolistic carriers while preserving the ubiquitous nature of
the American telephone network.
<P>
       In addition, these access requirements are focused narrowly on less
competitive local markets where firms have traditionally been granted
service monopolies.  The Pressler bill wisely does not apply such access and
interconnection mandates on competitive sectors such as the cellular industry
where they would be counter-productive by discouraging the expansion of
infrastructure and competition.
<P>
CRITERION #2:  Elimination of Regulation and Barriers to Entry(Telephony) 
<P>Grade:  B-
<P>
Good Points:  Opens local telephone market to competition; allows new
rivals a chance to enter market.
<P>
Bad Points:  Allows for potentially lengthy and arbitrary FCC delays on
competition in other segments of the telephone market.  
<P>
       The Pressler bill encourages greater telephone competition by
eliminating all entry barriers to local telephone markets immediately.  This
means alternative providers, such as utility companies and cable companies,
would be allowed to enter the phone market.  This will encourage
competition from entirely different sectors and also help ensure that service
to many rural areas becomes competitive, since these firms already have the
needed infrastructure in place.
<P>
       However, many impediments either remain or are established by the
bill for the first time.  For example, the Senate should have allowed the
Baby Bells to enter the long-distance and equipment manufacturing markets
on a specific date or after they had met the "checklist" criteria discussed
above.  But a last-minute compromise in Committee deliberations eliminated
the "date-certain" or "checklist-certain" approach and substituted a new
"public interest" standard.  Thus, after complying successfully with the
checklist objectives, the Bells must face an arbitrary review of the benefits
of their entry into markets from which they are currently are barred.  If, for
any reason, FCC regulators feel Bell entry into these markets is not
"consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity," they can
block it.
<P>
       This is a disturbing and inferior standard upon which to base
telephone deregulation.  Deregulatory language should establish clear,
objective criteria by which firms can understand what must be done to
assure access to new markets.  Placing a "public interest" test within the bill
is an open invitation to anti-competitive special-interest pleading and
regulatory abuse, since the standard is largely subjective.  In addition,
allowing the FCC to interpret what is in the "public interest" introduces a
perverse incentive for FCC officials to slow down deregulation:  smoothing
the way for competition would mean a corresponding decrease in their
workload and little continued need for their agency's existence.
<P>
       The inclusion of this anti-competitive "public interest" test reduces
the grade the Pressler bill receives for elimination of barriers to telephone
competition, since beneficial Bell entry into new markets will be delayed. 
According to the WEFA Group, this delay could result in approximately
$300 billion in lost economic output and 3.4 million lost jobs over the next
ten years.  With such economic costs, it makes little sense to include
language in the bill delaying entry, especially since Baby Bell power in
local markets is dwindling.
<P>
       In addition, although the Pressler bill makes a half-hearted attempt
to eliminate the constraints placed on the seven Baby Bell companies under
the Modification of Final Judgment consent decree of 1982, no attempt is
made to supersede the consent decree that continues to restrain the GTE
Corporation.  Under a 1984 decree struck with the Department of Justice,
GTE is discouraged from entering many of the same lines of businesses the
Baby Bells are via structural safeguards and specific regulatory restraints. 
Thus, the Bells could be granted operating freedoms much sooner than GTE
under the Pressler bill, resulting in an uneven playing field.
<P>
       Finally, the Pressler bill does little to remove more traditional
regulatory barriers to telephone competition.  Elements of the original
Communications Act of 1934, such as licensing, tariffing, and other
operating requirements, have always been a burden on the industry.  For
example, Section 214 gives the Commission the power to approve or deny
the extension of phone lines and services to consumers.  In addition, the
Commission requires that telephone firms file schedules of their rates, or
"tariffs," with the agency for public inspection.  Although it makes little
sense for the Commission to be determining whether a company should be
extending services and requiring firms to reveal their rates to competitors,
the Pressler bill does not eliminate these uncompetitive and costly
regulations. 
<P>
CRITERION # 3:  Elimination of Regulation and Barriers to Entry
(Cable and Video)
<P>
Grade:  B-
<P>
Good Points:  Eliminates cable-telco cross-ownership restrictions.
<P>
Bad Points:  Does not repeal Cable Act outright; maintains asymmetrical
regulatory standard for video delivery.
<P>
       Recognizing that the Cable Act of 1992 has been a failure, early
drafts of the Pressler bill contained language calling for the repeal of the
Act and prohibiting any future cable rate regulation.  Unfortunately, a series
of last-minute compromises resulted in retention of the Cable Act, albeit
with important modifications.  In essence, cable rates under the Pressler bill
will be regulated if they "substantially exceed the national rate for
comparable cable programming services."  However, if a telephone company
provides video services in a cable operator's territory, rate regulation will
not apply.
<P>
       In addition, instead of eliminating all regulations governing the
delivery of video programming, the bill mandates continuation of a
confusing twofold standard -- one for video signals carried by telephone
wires and one for video signals carried over cable systems.  In essence, this
means that an asymmetrical regulatory standard for the delivery of video
programming will continue to exist.
<P>
CRITERION #4:  Elimination of Protectionist Barriers           
<P>
Grade:  C +
<P>
Good Points:  Potentially allows increased foreign investment and
competition in the common carrier market.
<P>
Bad Points:  Retroactive protectionist provisions could be enforced; ignores
radio licenses.
<P>
       The Pressler bill undertakes a long-needed reform of rules restricting
foreign ownership of American telecommunications companies.  Since 1934,
foreign entities have been effectively prohibited from owning more than 20
percent of the shares of a company holding a radio license or more than 25
percent of the shares of a company holding a common carrier telephone
license.  Foreigners also are not allowed to sit on the board or become an
officer of a radio licensee or a common carrier licensee. 
<P>
        The Pressler bill aims to eliminate the 25 percent cap on common
carrier ownership for any country that has opened its markets to American
goods.  But it does nothing about the 20 percent radio ownership ceiling. 
Furthermore, the bill contains a potentially retroactive "snapback" provision
that allows U.S.  regulators to re-impose protectionist barriers on countries
that fail to provide continued market access to U.S.  firms.
<P>
       While the Pressler bill is superior to current law on foreign
ownership, it still falls short of compete reform.  Exempting radio licenses
from the liberalization makes little sense, and the retroactive snapback
clause will likely be used by less-efficient U.S.  firms to close the American
market when foreign competition becomes intense. 
<P>
 CRITERION #5:  Reduction of Telecommunications Bureaucracy
<P>
Grade:  D-

<P>Good Points:  Eliminates some tasks over time and devises a process to
review regulations.
<P>
Bad Points:  Requires increased telecom spending and bureaucracy in short
term; no end in sight for the FCC.
<P>
       The Pressler bill will eliminate some of the telecommunications
bureaucracy simply by eliminating the regulations it enforces.  In addition,
beginning in 1997, it requires a biennial review of regulations by the FCC
to determine which rules are no longer in the "public interest."  Likewise,
the FCC does not have to enforce any regulations it feels are not in the
public interest.
<P>
       However, the bill does not contain any serious discussion of the
future of the Federal Communications Commission.  Policymakers appear
unconcerned with the role the agency plays in the deregulatory process and
apparently do not realize it is part of the problem they hope to correct. 
Congress should follow the model established by congressional Democrats
and the Carter Administration in the late 1970s when they led the battle to
deregulate the airlines.  From the start, the future of the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB), which regulated the airline industry, was on the table.  It was
well understood by most in Congress that deregulating the airlines would
mean eliminating the CAB.  A few years later, the CAB was abolished. 
<P>
        Yet, not only does the Pressler bill fail to mention the future of the
FCC, but many provisions discussed above or found elsewhere in the bill
actually will increase the size of the telecommunications bureaucracy.  For
example, new universal service provisions, "public access" requirements,
content controls, and separate subsidiary safeguards undoubtedly will
require additional FCC enforcement and staff.  Likewise, "public interest"
tests and continued licensing and tariffing requirements probably will require
stable or increasing FCC bureaucracy.
<P>
       Although Section 3 of the Pressler bill is titled "An End to
Regulation," there is no end in sight to the telecommunications bureaucracy. 
Congress could address FCC staffing and funding issues during the
appropriations process, but it is unwise to rely on Appropriations or Budget
Committee members to carry out a task that should be handled within the
bill itself.
<P>
CRITERION #6:  Movement Toward a Free Market in Spectrum
<P>
Grade:  F
<P>
Good Points:  None.
<P>
Bad Points:  No serious reform of the radio spectrum.
<P>
       The opportunities presented by complete liberalization and
privatization of the radio spectrum are enormous.  Billions of dollars in
revenue could be raised through the expansion of spectrum auctions.  More
important, if spectrum was freed for new or alternative uses, consumers
would benefit from more competitive markets, more innovative goods and
services, and falling prices.
<P>
              Sadly, the Pressler bill does not make a serious effort to
exploit these opportunities.  It contains moderate relaxation of national
ownership restrictions on broadcasters, but this falls short of the position,
held even by the FCC, that the rule should be repealed outright. 
Furthermore, many other ownership restrictions remain in the bill which
restrict the ability of broadcasters to operate freely. 
<P>
        Worse yet, the bill makes no attempt to end the nearly seven-
decade-old socialistic spectrum management policies of the FCC.  Spectrum
remains treated as a nationalized public resource to be regulated in the
"public interest" -- meaning, in reality, as the Commission sees fit.  Hence,
spectrum holders will continue to be denied flexible use of their current
spectrum allocation, while no move is made to vest them with property
rights in their allocation.  In addition, although the Pressler bill hopes to
create more efficient spectrum use by instituting a system of fees for
particular uses, the Commerce Committee missed the chance to move to a
superior, efficiency-enhancing system of complete privatization.  This would
have ensured that spectrum was auctioned off to the highest bidder and
owned by the firm that valued it most highly.  It also would have generated
billions of dollars for the federal government.  Moreover, broadcasters will
continue to be regulated under a "public interest model" under the bill, with
only limited First Amendment protections.  Remarkably, the Pressler bill
makes no mention of the First Amendment.
<P>
       As with the scaling back of telecommunications bureaucracy,
spectrum reform technically could take place later in a separate bill.  But the
opportunity for more comprehensive and immediate spectrum deregulation
is missed in the Pressler bill.
<P>
CRITERION #7:  Elimination of Telecommunications Entitlements
<P>
Grade:  F
<P>
Good Points:  None.
<P>
Bad Points:  Expands telecom subsidies; gives FCC larger role; potentially
regulates computer industry.
<P>
       The most disastrous elements of the Pressler bill are the sections
dealing with universal telecommunications service.  Current telephone
subsidy policies redistribute wealth in a highly inefficient manner to provide
cheap local telephone service.  Subsidies generally flow from long-distance
users to local users, business users to residential users, and urban users to
rural users.  These overlapping cross-subsidies have destroyed industry
competition by discouraging market entry, since few potential competitors
have the capital necessary to take on the subsidized firms.  By artificially
elevating prices in the long-distance market, these subsidies also have cost
society between $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year in higher prices. 
<P>
        Instead of attempting to reform or eliminate this destructive subsidy
system, the Pressler bill actually expands its scope.  For example, the bill:
<P>
Maintains current price controls by requiring that services be provided at
"just, reasonable, and affordable rates," and does not define what these
highly subjective terms mean.
<P>
Continues inefficient rate averaging, which requires that rates in rural areas
be roughly the same as those in urban areas, regardless of cost.
<P>
Expands telecommunications entitlements by mandating that, "At a
minimum, universal service shall include access to telecommunications
services that the Commission determines have, through the operation of
market choices by consumers, been subscribed to by a majority of
residential consumers."
<P>
       The continuation of the failed subsidy policies of the past, combined
with the expanding definition of universal service mandated under the bill,
places at risk almost everything else the bill hopes to accomplish.  Once
personal computers, on-line services, set-top boxes, and other future
technologies become part of a package of mandated benefits to which every
American must have access, it is likely these technologies will be regulated,
and thus made less competitive.  Although the bill does not specifically
require that these goods and services be included in a package of mandated
technological benefits, the Pressler draft has provided the FCC with the
incentive to do so by requiring that universal service be considered an
"evolving level of telecommunications service."  It is likely this will
encourage the agency to adopt traditional subsidization and regulatory
measures to extend these technologies to more Americans once they are
included in the evolving definition. 
<P>
        If this occurs and these markets become less competitive, consumers
will have less choice, higher prices, and perhaps even less access to these
technologies.  As the above chart illustrates, it is significant that
unsubsidized and unregulated technologies have been made available to
American consumers much faster than subsidized and regulated
technologies, such as telephone technology. 
<P>
        In addition, it will be more difficult to make the local telephone
market competitive, as the bill aspires to do.  This is because real price
competition will not be allowed to develop freely if subsidies remain in
place.  Further, it is unclear just how expensive it will be to carry out these
new provisions.  And although these mandates may not be considered
technically a tax increase, since the subsidies flow within the industry and
not from a general revenue fund, they will have the effect of a
redistributionist tax and likely will require an increase in the size of the
FCC.
<P>
HOW TO IMPROVE THE PRESSLER BILL
<P>
       If the Senate wishes to correct the flaws in the Pressler bill, several
changes must be made before the bill is passed.  Specifically, to create real
competition in the telecommunications industry, Congress should:
Strip out all unnecessary bureaucratic impediments to immediate
deregulation, such as the "public interest" test, licensing and tariffing
requirements, delays in equipment manufacturing liberalization, separate
subsidiary requirements, and all rate regulation provisions.
<P>
       There is little need to delay the onset of complete deregulation and
competition.  For six decades, consumers and entrepreneurial firms have
been forced to sit on the sidelines and watch bureaucrats conduct a
regulatory experiment that has ended in failure.  Immediate deregulation will
ensure that telecommunications companies face a much more ruthless
regulator -- the American consumer.  Policymakers cannot create
competition with waiting periods and bureaucratic entry tests.
<P>
Strip out retroactive foreign ownership provisions and eliminate
telecommunications protectionism.
<P>
       Instead of continuing to deny American consumers the benefits of
increased rivalry, competition, and service quality, as the Pressler bill would,
Congress should repeal these protectionist provisions in current law.  It
makes little sense to continue restrictions on foreign ownership of American
firms when so many diverse media and communication outlets exist.  Some
countries like the United Kingdom and New Zealand have liberalized
completely their telecommunications markets and enjoy the benefits of
increased capital investment and entrepreneurial foreign competition.
<P>
       To help pry open foreign markets, the White House should pursue
a multilateral trade agreement in this area.  This would be less likely to fuel
the fires of protectionism and avert the chance of a trade war that would
threaten U.S.  investment abroad.  Instead, the Pressler bill attempts to keep
one foot in the protectionist camp while slowly stretching the other toward
the free market.  Unconditionally opening the American telecommunications
sector to foreign investment and competition will lower prices, produce
more innovative products, and create new jobs.  Continuing current
restrictions on foreign access to the American marketplace will hurt U.S. 
consumers more than any foreign firm conceivably might.
<P>
       
Require immediate and unconditional repeal of the Cable Act and all
video regulation.
<P>
       Policymakers must recognize that the Cable Act has done nothing to
advance the interests of consumers.  Although the cable industry has not
been cost competitive in the past, that is due more to misguided regulatory
policies than to any natural market outcome.  The Cable Act of 1992 should
have focused on opening the cable market to competition, not on applying
new price regulations.  Not only have the new regulations resulted in
smaller gains for consumers, but they have restricted the cable industry's
ability to invest in new technologies and to compete in new markets. 
Congress should repeal the Cable Act and all cable regulation and focus on
opening the market to competition from alternative video providers.  In
addition, alternative video providers should be placed on equal footing with
cable carriers to achieve deregulatory parity.  This would serve the interests
of consumers better than any current price or entry regulation.
Define the "public interest" as the best interests of consumers, to ensure that
regulators cannot use the term for other purposes.
<P>
       Throughout the Pressler bill, the FCC is given the ability to regulate
or deregulate according to what the agency believes is in "the public
interest."  Congress would be wise to eliminate any mention of this from the
bill, specifically entry tests based upon the "public interest" standard.  But
if Congress insists on maintaining this standard, it should try at least to
reduce the potential for regulatory abuse by defining the term as clearly and
objectively as possible.  Six decades of unconstrained "public interest"
regulation has demonstrated that what the FCC determines arbitrarily to be
in the "public interest," rarely is in the best interests of consumers.  The
reason is simple -- regulators, not consumers, are making the decision.
<P>
       Congress should define the public interest standard in statute if
lawmakers insist (unwisely) on keeping it in the legislation.  The definition
should focus on three specific criteria:
Maximizing consumer welfare by broadening the general scope of individual
decision-making within telecommunications markets;
Utilizing market processes instead of regulatory proceedings whenever
possible; and
<P>
Protecting property and First Amendment rights in telecommunications
regulation.
<P>
       This "consumer welfare" standard would better serve the interests of
all Americans.  But Congress also should consider defining what would
not be in the public interest.  This should include any action that constitutes
taxation by regulation, such as current universal service mechanisms. 
Other arbitrary regulatory practices could be included in this general
definition.
<P>
Include provisions granting the FCC authority to conduct auctions to
privatize the spectrum and eliminate all ownership restrictions on
spectrum allocations.
<P>
       The Pressler bill missed a rare opportunity to de-nationalize one of
America's most important and valuable natural resources -- the radio
spectrum.  Congress should give the Commission the authority to use
spectrum auctions whenever there are competing interests for a spectrum
allocation.  This will allow the FCC to sell off most if not all of the
remaining spectrum to those who value its use most highly, thereby ensuring
that it will be used much more efficiently.  Once spectrum is auctioned off,
property rights in the spectrum should be created and enforced by a small
panel or the courts.  Holders of spectrum property rights should be given
complete operating flexibility to use their allocation however they see fit. 
Incumbent holders of spectrum licenses should be given an absolute property
right in their holding.
<P>
       Creating spectrum property rights and broadening current auction
authority to include all competing uses would generate potentially hundreds
of billions of dollars in revenue and spur more innovation within wireless
markets.  In addition, it would create more competition for landline voice
and video operators.
<P>
Mandate equal First Amendment protection for all media, whether print
or electronic.
<P>
       Since the inception of electronic communications technologies (such
as radio, TV, and cable), First Amendment protections have been all but
ignored by regulators.  Congress should make it clear that the First
Amendment plays a pre-eminent role in the future of this industry.  To
accord second-class speech protections to the electronic media is a gross
violation of the rights of communications broadcasters and carriers.
<P>
       As traditional print technologies (such as newspapers and magazines)
converge with modern electronic technologies (such as the Internet), it will
become increasingly difficult to determine how to separate the different print
and electronic standards.  For example, will the New York Times be
regulated under a different interpretation of the First Amendment once it can
be delivered to most Americans via computer or cable system?  Existing
regulatory distinctions distort the true meaning and intent of the First
Amendment:  "The First Amendment, after all, does not distinguish one
'press' from another."
<P>
Include a timetable for closing down the FCC.
<P>
       A failure to reduce the size of the bureaucracy that governs the
telecommunications sector is a failure to deregulate this industry.  As long
as regulators have jobs, they will regulate.  If there is to be full deregulation
of this industry, Congress must devise a detailed and workable plan for the
eventual closure of the Federal Communications Commission. 
Unfortunately, with so many provisions in the Pressler bill expanding the
federal regulatory workload, this goal cannot be achieved unless the bill is
amended significantly. 
<P>
        Lawmakers should eliminate the bill's expansionary language and
substitute a plan to close down the FCC.  Congress should begin by
reducing current FCC appropriations and including procedural reforms in the
bill to end destructive regulatory activities.  For example, all licensing and
tariffing restrictions could be repealed immediately, resulting in substantial
cutbacks in bureaucracy.  Likewise, entire FCC bureaus, such as the Cable
Services Bureau, could be eliminated as the rules they enforce are repealed. 
<P>
 Substitute a more pro-competition alternative for the current universal
service sections of the bill.
<P>
       If policymakers fail to eliminate the language in the Pressler bill that
would expand subsidies and entitlements, telecommunications competition
could be stifled and current technologies could be made less competitive. 
Instead of adopting the failed model of the past, Congress should craft
policies in this field that fit the new thinking on entitlement reform on
Capitol Hill. 
<P>
        Just as some other entitlements are being limited and then devolved
to the states, universal telecommunications service policies can be
transferred to lower levels of government.  States and localities can
determine better what their residents need.  Ideally, state or local lawmakers
could create a voucher plan that would deliver a subsidy directly to a
qualified individual, not a company, based on perceived need.
<P>
         The subsidy would be narrowly drawn, means-tested, and more
friendly to competition -- unlike policies today that artificially price service
in rural areas below costs.  By transferring all authority for the universal
service system back to the states, Congress could eliminate the federal
bureaucracy that oversees the universal service system.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
       Although it would be unfortunate if telecommunications deregulation
legislation died this year, as it did last year, it would not be the proverbial
end of the world.  For one thing, technologies and the courts are
undermining or dismantling many of the barriers now in place.  With each
passing year, technological innovation circumvents outdated regulatory
distinctions, and court decisions are eliminating many regulatory barriers
outright.  These trends are likely to continue.  Another reason to reject
flawed legislation is that the Pressler bill actually would make some things
worse.  In particular, the universal service elements place at risk everything
else the bill hopes to accomplish by mandating the continuation and
expansion of failed subsidy policies.
<P>
              Still, supporters of the bill will argue correctly that allowing
the perfect to be the enemy of the good can destroy any chance of freeing
the industry from many statutory constraints on competition and innovation. 
They will cite the length and heavy cost of court-based deregulation and the
economic losses associated with continuing restrictions for longer than
necessary.  However, if supporters feel this passionately about the need for
immediate deregulation, they will act to eliminate the overly regulatory
baggage of the bill and insert more deregulatory, pro-competitive
alternatives in its place.  Without such changes, S.  652 as currently written
is not the landmark telecommunications deregulation bill its sponsors claim,
since it continues to rely more on regulators than consumers to decide which
firms and technologies prevail in the marketplace.

<TITLE>Senator Dole's Welcome Proposal For Telecommunication Freedom  
 -- Heritage </TITLE>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">


 <CENTER><H3><I>SENATOR DOLE'S WELCOME PROPOSAL FOR TELECOMMUNICATION FREEDOM  </I></H3>

By Adam D. Thierer<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
 Backgrounder Update #233<BR>
 8/24/94<BR>
(published at 7 pages)<BR>
(Updating Issue Bulletin No. 191, "A Guide to Telecommunications
Deregulation Legislation," June 3, 1994.)<P></CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     Facing a crowded legislative calendar before adjournment,
Congress is rushing to complete work on the most sweeping overhaul of
the nation's telecommunications system in sixty years. The pending
legislation takes important steps to deregulate the system by allowing
the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), or "Baby Bells," to
enter the long distance and equipment manufacturing markets and by
ending the ban on competition between telephone and cable companies.
Yet disagreement still exists in the Senate over the extent and pace
of deregulation.<P>
     A modified version of the original Senate proposal -- S. 1822,
The Communications Act of 1994, sponsored by Senator Ernest F.
Hollings (D-SC) -- passed the Senate Commerce Committee on August 11
by an 18-2 margin, but controversial elements of the package are
certain to create problems when the bill is debated on the floor.
Although Senators could attempt to amend S. 1822 when it reaches the
floor, they should consider substituting another alternative that may
be introduced. Senator Robert Dole (R-KS) recently has circulated a
staff discussion draft, entitled the "Telecommunications Deregulation
and Competition Act of 1994," which goes much further toward complete
deregulation than any other proposal ever considered by Congress.
Unlike the pro-regulatory proposals of the House and Senate, it would
rapidly eliminate current regulatory barriers without imposing new
requirements and would completely deregulate other sectors not
mentioned in the House and Senate legislation.<P>
     True telecommunications reform offers tremendous benefits for the
economy. If the Senate adopted the Dole proposal instead of S. 1822,
it would radically transform the heavily regulated telecommunications
industry into a much more vibrant, competitive sector of the U.S.
economy. More jobs would be created, prices for telecommunication
services would fall, and consumers would have more products and
services from which to choose. Congress should use the Dole discussion
draft as the foundation of all telecommunications reform, whether it
occurs this year or next and reject any legislation that is the
product of backroom deals whereby today's carriers divide the market
and find ways to exclude would-be competitors.
<P>
THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE'S PRO-REGULATORY COMPROMISE
<P>
     Since passage last month of the House reform package, the Senate
Commerce Committee has been struggling to craft legislation acceptable
to the diverse supporters of deregulation. Negotiations have focused
on a variety of proposals, all of which fall well short of
comprehensive telecommunications reform. The leading Senate proposal,
S. 1822, has been under attack from Senators and industry groups
seeking either to slow down or to speed up the deregulatory process.
Unfortunately, backroom negotiations between Commerce Committee
members and major industry players have produced a compromise that is
deregulation in name only. One indication of this is the growing size
of the bill, which has grown from 106 pages to approximately 200 as
adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee. If implemented, this
"deregulatory" bill would:
<P>
Require extensive waiting periods and entry tests before competition
     is allowed in certain markets. Although Senator Hollings actually
     eliminated more restrictive language from his original draft, the
     current proposal retains requirements that Baby Bells prove to
     the Department of Justice that they will not impede competition
     in the long distance market and that their entry is "consistent
     with the public interest, convenience and necessity." Likewise,
     telephone companies seeking to enter the cable market could face
     lengthy delays, and Baby Bells wishing to enter the alarm
     monitoring services industry would have to wait six years.
     Finally, almost every provider entering a new market must do so
     through a separate affiliate that keeps entirely separate
     accounts. The inevitable bureaucratic delays caused by these
     entry tests and separate affiliate requirements would deny
     consumers the benefits of immediate competition. 
<P>
Impose protectionist manufacturing requirements on the Baby Bells once
     they are allowed to enter the equipment market. The bill would
     prohibit a Baby Bell from manufacturing equipment outside the
     United States. Likewise, all manufacturing components must be
     procured domestically unless companies can prove they first made
     a good-faith effort to buy domestic parts but could not obtain
     them from an American firm; and even if the FCC allows these
     companies to purchase needed foreign components, the amount spent
     cannot exceed 40 percent of the revenue derived from the sale of
     their final product. Besides violating America's trade agreements
     with other countries, these protectionist measures actually could
     raise prices by forcing producers to buy high-cost, poor-quality
     components.
<P>
Expand universal service requirements instead of eliminating the
     massively inefficient subsidization and rate-regulation
     mechanisms that supposedly help Americans gain access to
     telephone service. The package of universal service items that
     must be provided to all consumers is expanded from basic
     telephone service to include every service to which a majority of
     residential consumers will have access. Interpreted broadly, this
     requirement would force the government and private carriers to
     spend significantly more to provide expensive new minimum package
     services. Such costly mandates not only will force up costs, but
     also will make it easier for larger existing carriers to continue
     dominating the market, since generally they will be the only ones
     able to afford the package. 
<P>
Provide public organizations generous access to networks at low rates
     or for free. Private carriers would be forced to dedicate 5
     percent of their network capacity to schools, libraries, health
     care facilities, museums, or 501(c)(3) organizations. (501(c)(3)
     organizations are nonprofit entities, such as The Heritage
     Foundation. Therefore, as currently written, S. 1822 would compel
     private carriers to grant The Heritage Foundation access to their
     networks.) This would place a costly burden on carriers, many of
     whom already are required to carry much public material over
     their networks.
<P>
Allow the Federal Communications Commission to impose arbitrary
     interconnection and other standards on the industry. Such top-
     down interconnection orders rarely are satisfactory to either
     party and often are written poorly. Voluntary contracting and
     mutual industry agreements between carriers would better
     establish workable industry-wide standards. 
<P>
Place numerous restrictions on merger, acquisition, and alliance
     activity. For example, the legislation would limit the equity
     interest of Baby Bells in electronic publishing joint ventures,
     limit their financial interest in nearby cable TV providers to 10
     percent, and prohibit joint ventures between local telephone and
     cable operators. Such arbitrary restrictions would impede the
     efficient operation of the market and deny consumers the benefits
     of such cooperative activity.
<P>
Increase the likelihood that firms will sue each other when faced with
     competition. S. 1822 would allow firms that feel they have been
     injured by new competition to sue competitors and recover damages
     for commercial losses. Firms could seek damages if they could
     prove to any federal district court that the new competitor was
     violating the terms of entry as established in S. 1822. In one
     case, the legislation would allow injured competitors to sue for
     threefold damages plus an attorney's fee. By encouraging an
     onslaught of litigation, the bill would discourage competition in
     the very markets it hopes to make competitive.
<P>
     Overall, the bill grants the Federal Communications Commission
dozens of new rule-making powers, ensuring that any deregulation that
does take place occurs many years after enactment. Not only will
little deregulation take place, but expanded FCC powers will create
new problems that Congress will have to correct in the future.
<P>
THE DOLE SOLUTION
<P>
     Like the other congressional proposals, the Dole discussion draft
addresses numerous issues involving deregulation of the industry.
Unlike the others, however, the Dole proposal could achieve
deregulation more effectively because it:
<P>
Eliminates the Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) two years after
     enactment. The MFJ, the decree that broke up the telephone system
     in 1982, remains the primary obstacle to telecommunications
     competition because it prohibits the Regional Bell Operating
     Companies, the "Baby Bells," from entering long-distance and
     resale markets and from manufacturing equipment. By scrapping the
     MFJ unconditionally, the Dole proposal would ensure more
     competition in these markets, thereby lowering prices while
     encouraging an increase in jobs and exports. (Four of the Baby
     Bells recently entered a motion with the United States District
     Court for the District of Columbia to vacate the MFJ. In
     accompanying affidavits, the motion received the support of over
     50 respected academics and regulators, including four recipients
     of the Nobel Prize in Economics. The overwhelming conclusion of
     these experts was that the MFJ line-of-business restrictions
     discouraged competition, harming consumer welfare through
     increased prices and lost job opportunities. United States of
     America v. Western Electric Co., and the American Telephone and
     Telegraph Company, Motion of Bell Atlantic Corporation, Bell
     South Corporation, NYNEX Corporation, and Southwestern Bell
     Corporation to Vacate the Decree, United States District Court
     for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 82-0192 (HHG).)
<P>
Immediately removes many of the artificial government entry barriers
     to telephone competition and prohibits the erection of any new
     barriers against potential new entrants. The discussion draft
     states clearly that "no Federal, State or local requirement,
     shall prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of
     any entity to provide interstate or intrastate telecommunications
     services." Although S. 1822 also would take this step, the Dole
     proposal goes further by requiring the FCC to repeal a host of
     specific regulations if carriers are subject to competition.
     Regulations that might be repealed include:
<P>
<UL>          the requirement that carriers file rate schedules, or
          "tariffs," with the FCC;

          the regulation of the terms and conditions of service in any
          area;

          the requirement that carriers obtain permission before
          constructing new facilities or expanding others;

          requirements that carriers assign costs from uncompetitive
          services to competitive services.
</UL><P>
          The draft would give the FCC 120 days to determine whether
     or not a carrier which applied for permission to free itself from
     these regulations was subject to competition. A carrier would be
     considered subject to competition "if an entity not affiliated
     with the provider offers at least the same level of service in
     the area to at least the same extent and at least the same rates
     as the provider." If the FCC does not act within 120 days, the
     provider is considered automatically subject to competition, and
     all restrictions are eliminated. In addition, federal loan
     assistance from the Rural Electrification Administration would be
     eliminated for competitive providers. Finally, the draft proposal
     virtually abolishes rate-of-return regulation, which establishes
     the maximum profit a telco is allowed to earn.
<P>
Repeals the Cable Act of 1992, which, by discouraging the expansion of
     cable firms into new markets, also has discouraged greater
     competition between cable and telephone firms. The draft also
     would eliminate the "cable-telco cross-ownership ban," which
     restricts ownership of a cable firm by a telephone company and
     vice-versa and prohibits competition between the two most likely
     rivals in most markets. Therefore, its immediate repeal will
     increase the likelihood of local telephone competition. Finally,
     the states would not be allowed to re-regulate the industry once
     it is deregulated. 
<P>
Begins serious spectrum reform by allowing holders of an
     electromagnetic spectrum license to use their slice of spectrum
     to provided alternative services. Cellular, Personal
     Communication Services (PCS), and other wireless technologies
     currently are adding to consumer options in the wireless market,
     providing increased competition for traditional wireline
     providers. This move toward more flexibility in using the
     spectrum would encourage greater competition from the wireless
     sector as current licensees use leftover spectrum to enter new
     markets such as PCS. The draft also requires the FCC to examine
     further spectrum reform with a view to moving closer to a market-
     based system of spectrum operation.
<P>
Allows other public utility companies to enter the telecommunications
     industry, which they have been restricted from doing under the
     Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935. This will encourage
     competition from an entirely different sector and also help
     ensure service to many rural areas, since these firms already
     have the needed infrastructure in place. Simple technological
     modifications can turn these old utilities into new competitors
     within the telephone industry. S. 1822 also would allow utility
     entry into telecom, but not without numerous restrictions on
     their activities that the Dole proposal does not require. (For
     example, S. 1822 would require that any utility entering the
     telecommunications industry do so through a separate affiliate
     and would prohibit any sharing of profits between that telecom
     affiliate and the utility. The bill would require strict rate
     regulations to prohibit such profit sharing. The Dole proposal
     would not require that any new regulations be enforced once
     utilities entered the telecommunications market.)
<P>
Radically reforms the provision of universal service. The Dole
     proposal offers a unique approach to achieve the goal of
     universal service. Instead of requiring the continued
     masquerading of subsidies as rate regulation mechanisms, the
     draft would require that all universal service subsidies be
     explicit to minimize their inefficient or anti-competitive
     effects. Currently, universal service subsidies are arranged to
     siphon off revenues from high-revenue sectors and channel them to
     high-cost areas of service. This arrangement is highly
     inefficient and hides the true cost of service from telephone
     consumers. (For example, subsidies flow from long-distance
     providers to local providers through substantial "access
     charges." Likewise, subsidies flow from urban business users to
     rural residential customers. Therefore, the price of
     long-distance and business service in general is greatly inflated
     through rate regulation to ensure that excess profits can be
     channeled to rural residential areas, which cost more to
     service.) 
<P>
          To eliminate this problem, the proposal creates a single
     Universal Service Fund to which all providers would contribute
     equally. Subsidies then would be taken directly from the fund and
     given to "carriers of last resort" to pay for the difference
     between the low prices charged for rural service and the actual
     cost of providing that service. In addition, states would be
     prohibited from creating new subsidization schemes that might
     favor one provider over another. Most beneficially, all universal
     service subsidization of a carrier of last resort would be
     terminated once that carrier was subject to competition from
     other providers. This new procedure would streamline the
     subsidization process and decrease the likelihood that one
     carrier would be given a substantial advantage over another.
<P>
Creates a sensible interconnection policy for the entire industry by
     requiring carriers to enter good faith negotiations with each
     other. Interconnection will be important in the future as rivals
     seek access to each others' networks. For example, a cable
     provider and telephone provider within a given locality will need
     to agree on a plan to provide one another with access to their
     customers. 
<P>
          Under the Dole proposal, any interconnection problems that
     arise, such as concerns over technical interoperability, will be
     handled through a private dispute resolution mechanism rather
     than through FCC intervention. Because it encourages private
     resolution of technical issues, this approach will prove superior
     to arbitrary FCC rulings, which often are unsatisfactory to both
     parties. (For example, in 1992 the FCC mandated that dominant
     providers physically "co-locate" competitors' equipment on their
     premises to ensure that interconnection was achieved. Yet not
     only was the arrangement unsatisfactory for many within the
     industry, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
     Columbia recently found that such a mandate went beyond the FCC's
     authority and, therefore, could not be enforced. See Bell
     Atlantic Telephone Co. v. FCC, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
     District of Columbia, No. 92-1619, June 10, 1994, and "FCC Lacks
     Power to Order Phone Companies to Set Aside Space for Their
     Competitors," Daily Report for Executives, Bureau of National
     Affairs, Inc., DER 112 d20, June 14, 1994.) 
<P>
Requires the FCC to conduct annual regulatory reviews of all
     telecommunications regulation to ensure that useless or
     uncompetitive rules are scrapped as soon as possible. The review
     would focus on remaining telephone regulations while forcing the
     FCC also to examine the usefulness of restrictions on the
     ownership of radio and broadcast stations. For example, the FCC
     could review uncompetitive foreign ownership restrictions, which
     unwisely restrict ownership of domestic carriers by foreign-owned
     firms, as well as agency rules that arbitrarily limit the number
     of TV or radio stations a single firm can own. 
<P>
 BENEFITS OF THE DOLE APPROACH
<P>
     Compared with the alternatives currently being considered in
Congress, the Dole discussion draft is superior for several reasons.
<P>
The Dole draft does not impose burdensome entry tests upon providers
     hoping to enter new markets. Both the legislation adopted by the
     House and the bill reported by the Senate Commerce Committee
     contain numerous restrictions governing how providers will be
     allowed to enter new sectors. For example, Baby Bells would not
     be allowed to enter long-distance markets unless they prove to
     the Department of Justice that they will not impede competition
     in those markets and that their entry is "consistent with the
     public interest, convenience and necessity." The Dole approach
     wisely rejects such an approach, allowing open competition in all
     segments of the industry once current regulations are repealed.
     This would eliminate bureaucratic obstacles that would delay
     increased telephone competition for years. 
<P>
The Dole draft does not require telecom firms to establish separate
     affiliates for each new service they want to provide or to obey
     exclusive purchasing or domestic production requirements. The
     Dole plan also wisely rejects requirements found in the House and
     Senate bills that would force firms entering new sectors to do so
     through separate affiliates. Such duplication of facilities to
     provide new services is inefficient and unneeded. Instead of
     worrying that cross-subsidization will lead to monopoly, the Dole
     draft encourages increased competition that would discourage
     monopolization of a market. 
<P>
          Likewise, the Dole plan also rejects the crude
     protectionism, found in both these bills, which mandates that any
     equipment manufacturing by Baby Bells be done in America using
     only domestic parts. The Clinton Administration wisely opposes
     such requirements because they betray U.S. trade agreements with
     other countries and encourage other nations to close, rather than
     open, their borders to American goods.
<P>
The Dole draft covers important issues ignored by other proposals,
     ensuring that consumers will benefit from deregulation much
     sooner than under any alternative approach. The Dole discussion
     draft is the only telecommunications reform proposal that can be
     labeled truly comprehensive. Going beyond simple telephone
     deregulation, it eliminates all cable regulation, allows
     utilities freely into the industry, pushes for serious spectrum
     reform, radically reforms rate and subsidy regulation, and
     implements a regulatory review mechanism that will remove
     remaining rules in future years. 
<P>
          With its comprehensive deregulatory approach, the proposal
     will ensure that the benefits of telecommunications competition
     are captured by consumers much sooner than would be the case with
     any other approach. The WEFA Group, a Burlington, Massachusetts,
     economic forecasting firm, found recently that if all
     telecommunications regulations were removed, some 3.6 million
     more jobs would be created by 2003 than would have been expected
     without deregulation. Likewise, the economy would grow, on
     average, some 3.3 percent per year with telecommunications
     deregulation, but only 2.9 percent annually without. (The WEFA
     Group, Economic Impact of Eliminating the Line-of-Business
     Restrictions on the Bell Companies, July 1993.) Consumers would
     also benefit from the increase in services available to them.
     Again, the WEFA study finds that consumers could expect savings
     of approximately $63 billion a year with deregulation. (Ibid.)
     Exports of high-tech telecom products, in which America currently
     has an advantage, also could increase greatly if more companies
     are allowed to manufacture equipment. The Dole approach is
     superior to alternative proposals because it would bring about
     these gains far more rapidly.
<P>
HOW TO IMPROVE THE DOLE PLAN
<P>
     Although the Dole discussion draft is the boldest telecom
deregulation plan now pending, three changes would strengthen it even
more.
<P>
Improving Universal Service Reform. While the Dole proposal improves
     the existing universal service system, it still retains some of
     the current system's structure. For example, the proposal would
     retain a regulatory requirement that rates for rural telephone
     customers be no higher than those for urban customers. While
     "rate averaging," as it is known in the industry, might appeal to
     legislators and regulators in theory, in practice it discourages
     competition in rural areas by artificially lowering the price of
     servicing those regions. Consequently, new providers prefer to
     seek entry into urban markets where prices are kept artificially
     high to subsidize rural areas. Therefore, new entrants are
     discouraged from extending service to rural areas, and this makes
     it difficult to inject competition which could then result in
     lower, more affordable rates. 
<P>
          Any system which attempts artificially to control costs and
     prices will always distort the proper functioning of the market.
     One recent study found that the telephone industry loses from
     $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year by attempting to provide
     universal service in this manner. (David L. Kaserman and John W.
     Mayo, "Cross-Subsidies in Telecommunications: Roadblocks on the
     Road to More Intelligent Telephone Pricing," Yale Journal on
     Regulation, Vol. 11 (Winter 1994), p. 121. Kaserman and Mayo
     argue that these estimates are likely to be too low since "they
     do not consider the incalculable losses resulting from the
     distortion of dynamic market incentives to create and adopt
     technological advances that make more efficient use of the
     long-distance network.") Just as television programming has been
     extended to nearly every American home without government
     mandates -- including 91 percent of poor households (U.S.
     Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Housing
     Characteristics 1990, May 1992, p. 115.) -- telephone service
     would be provided even in the absence of federal requirements and
     subsidies.
<P>
Eliminating license fees for alternative users of the spectrum.
     Although the draft would allow holders of spectrum slices to use
     their portions to provide alternative services, in exchange they
     would be forced to pay the federal government a compensation fee.
     The practical effect of such a fee could be to discourage
     spectrum licensees from providing alternative services that
     encourage greater competition. In addition, while the draft
     rightly allows more flexible use of existing spectrum licenses,
     more comprehensive reform is needed. The FCC should be required
     to establish a spectrum privatization plan that would place the
     frequencies in private hands. Once the government's role is
     limited to enforcing property rights in the spectrum, wireless
     technologies would have a much better chance to mount serious
     competition to traditional wireline providers.
<P>
Making deregulation unconditional. The draft would eliminate many
     useless and inefficient regulations, such as requirements to file
     rates or to receive permission before expanding networks or
     constructing new facilities. To gain exemption from these and
     other regulations, however, the FCC would be required within 120
     days to find that a provider faced competition. Although this
     test is less restrictive than similar tests found in other bills,
     it is still unneeded. For example, if the FCC did not find
     competition, it would still require rate or tariff filings, which
     encourages cartel-like activity within the industry by allowing
     firms to price service in tandem. Many economists have suggested
     that this is what is fueling the unified rate increases currently
     seen within the long-distance industry. (See Affidavit of Jerry
     A. Hausman and Affidavit of Paul W. MacAvoy in United States of
     America v. Western Electric Co., and the American Telephone and
     Telegraph Company, Motion of Bell Atlantic Corporation, Bell
     South Corporation, NYNEX Corporation, and Southwestern Bell
     Corporation to Vacate the Decree, United States District Court
     for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 82-0192 (HHG).)
     Instead of waiting for the FCC to determine arbitrarily when to
     eliminate regulations, such rules should be scrapped immediately.
     <P>
          Deregulatory legislation also should eliminate foreign
     ownership barriers that restrict foreign investment in the
     American industry, immediately repeal any station ownership laws
     governing how many radio or TV stations a company may own, and
     ensure that merger and acquisition activity within the industry
     is not blocked arbitrarily by regulators or judges. (See Adam D.
     Thierer, "A Guide to Telecommunications Deregulation
     Legislation," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 191, June 3,
     1994, pp. 20-22.)
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     Senator Dole's bold draft proposal to deregulate
telecommunications would end over six decades of industry micro-
management by the federal government. While the other proposals before
Congress would allow bureaucrats to continue to exercise considerable
power over the industry, the Dole discussion draft would unleash the
competitive forces within the industry and allow consumers the right
to choose freely which telecommunication services are best for them.
Just as the computer industry has prospered without the continuous
intervention of regulators and legislators, so can the
telecommunications industry. The Dole discussion draft represents a
substantial step in that direction.

<TITLE>WHY THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE IS ANYTHING BUT FAIR -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H3><I>WHY THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE IS ANYTHING BUT FAIR</I></H3>
<P>
By Adam Thierer<br>
Executive Memorandum #368<BR>
10/29/93<BR>
(published at 2 pages)<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     Legislation currently is before Congress that would reinstate a
federal communications policy known as the "fairness doctrine." The
legislation, entitled the "Fairness in Broadcasting Act of 1993," is
sponsored in the Senate (S. 333) by Ernest Hollings, the South
Carolina Democrat, and in the House (H.R. 1985) by Bill Hefner, the
North Carolina Democrat. It would codify a 1949 Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) regulation that once required broadcasters to "afford
reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of
public importance." The fairness doctrine was overturned by the FCC in
1987. The FCC discarded the rule because, contrary to its purpose, it
failed to encourage the discussion of more controversial issues. There
were also concerns that it was in violation of First Amendment free
speech principles. The legislation now before Congress would enshrine
the fairness doctrine into law. 
<P>
     The doctrine's supporters seem not to appreciate just how much
the broadcast world has changed since 1949. With the proliferation of
informational resources and technology, the number of broadcast
outlets available to the public has increased steadily. In such an
environment, it is hard to understand why the federal government must
police the airwaves to ensure that differing views are heard. The
result of a reinstituted fairness doctrine would not be fair at all.
In practice, much controversial speech heard today would be stifled as
the threat of random investigations and warnings discouraged
broadcasters from airing what FCC bureaucrats might refer to as
"unbalanced" views.
<P>
     Tested in Court. The fairness doctrine's constitutionality was
tested and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark 1969 case,
Red Lion Broadcasting v. FCC (395 U.S. 367). Although the Court then
ruled that it did not violate a broadcaster's First Amendment rights,
the Court cautioned that if the doctrine ever began to restrain
speech, then the rule's constitutionality should be reconsidered. Just
five years later, without ruling the doctrine unconstitutional, the
Court concluded in another case that the doctrine "inescapably dampens
the vigor and limits the variety of public debate" (Miami Herald
Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241). In 1984, the Court
concluded that the scarcity rationale underlying the doctrine was
flawed and that the doctrine was limiting the breadth of public debate
(FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364). This ruling set the
stage for the FCC's action in 1987. An attempt by Congress to
reinstate the rule by statute was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan in
1987, and later attempts failed even to pass Congress. 
<P>
     As an independent regulatory agency, the FCC has the power to
reimpose the doctrine without congressional or executive action. So
far, the Commission has taken no position on the Hollings-Hefner
legislation or expressed an interest in reregulating on its own.
Current FCC Chairman James Quello, though, has stated that, "The
fairness doctrine doesn't belong in a country that's dedicated to
freedom of the press and freedom of speech." (Doug Halonen, "Twelve to
Watch in 1993," Electronic Media, January 25, 1993, p. 66.) The
Clinton Administration has not taken an official position on the
legislation.
<P>
     Supporters of reviving the fairness doctrine base their argument
on the very same three faulty premises that the FCC and most judicial
rulings have rejected.
<P>
Faulty Premise #1: The "scarce" amount of spectrum space requires
oversight by federal regulators.
<P>
Reality: Although the spectrum is limited, the number of broadcasters
in America has continuously increased.
<P>
     Supporters of the fairness doctrine argue that because the
airwaves are a scarce resource, they should be policed by federal
bureaucrats to ensure that all viewpoints are heard. Yet, just because
the spectrum within which broadcast frequencies are found has
boundaries, it does not mean that there is a practical shortage of
views being heard over the airwaves. When the fairness doctrine was
first conceived, only 2,881 radio and 98 television stations existed.
By 1960, there were 4,309 radio and 569 television stations. By 1989,
these numbers grew to over 10,000 radio stations and close to 1,400
television stations. Likewise, the number of radios in use jumped from
85.2 million in 1950 to 527.4 million by 1988, and televisions in use
went from 4 million to 175.5 million during that period. ("The
Fairness Doctrine," National Association of Broadcasters, Backgrounder
(1989).) 
<P>
     Even if it may once have been possible to monopolize the
airwaves, and to deny access to certain viewpoints, that is impossible
today. A wide variety of opinions is available to the public through
radios, cable channels, and even computers. With America on the verge
of information superhighways and 500-channel televisions, there is
little prospect of speech being stifled.
<P>
Faulty Premise #2: "Fairness" or "fair access" is best determined by
FCC authorities.
<P>
Reality: FCC bureaucrats can neither determine what is "fair" nor
enforce it.
<P>
     The second fallacy upon which the doctrine rests concerns the
idea of "fairness" itself. As defined by proponents of the doctrine,
"fairness" apparently means that each broadcaster must offer air time
to anyone with a controversial view. Since it is impossible for every
station to be monitored constantly, FCC regulators would arbitrarily
determine what "fair access" is, and who is entitled to it, through
selective enforcement. This, of course, puts immense power into the
hands of federal regulators. And in fact, the fairness doctrine was
used by both the Kennedy and Nixon Administrations to limit political
opposition. Telecommunications scholar Thomas W. Hazlett notes that
under the Nixon Administration, "License harassment of stations
considered unfriendly to the Administration became a regular item on
the agenda at White House policy meetings." (Thomas W. Hazlett, "The
Fairness Doctrine and the First Amendment," The Public Interest,
Summer 1989, p. 105.) As one former Kennedy Administration official,
Bill Ruder, has said, "We had a massive strategy to use the fairness
doctrine to challenge and harass the right-wing broadcasters, and hope
the challenge would be so costly to them that they would be inhibited
and decide it was too expensive to continue." (Tony Snow, "Return of
the Fairness Demon," The Washington Times, September 5, 1993, p. B3.) 
<P>
Faulty Premise #3: The fairness doctrine guarantees that more opinions
will be aired.
<P>
Reality: Arbitrary enforcement of the fairness doctrine will diminish
vigorous debate.
<P>
     Of all arguments for the reinstitution of the fairness doctrine,
the most inaccurate and insidious is that it will permit a greater
diversity of opinion to be heard. By requiring, under threat of
arbitrary legal penalty, that broadcasters "fairly" represent both
sides of a given issue, advocates of the doctrine believe that more
views will be aired while the editorial content of the station can
remain unaltered. But with the threat of potential FCC retaliation for
perceived lack of compliance, most broadcasters would be more
reluctant to air their own opinions because it might require them to
air alternative perspectives that their audience does not want to
hear. 
<P>
     Thus, the result of the fairness doctrine in many cases would be
to stifle the growth of disseminating views and, in effect, make free
speech less free. This is exactly what led the FCC to repeal the rule
in 1987. FCC officials found that the doctrine "had the net effect of
reducing, rather than enhancing, the discussion of controversial
issues of public importance," and therefore was in violation of
constitutional principles. ("FCC Ends Enforcement of Fairness
Doctrine," Federal Communications Commission News, Report No. MM-263,
August 4, 1987.) Even liberal New York Governor Mario Cuomo has argued
that, "Precisely because radio and TV have become our principal
sources of news and information, we should accord broadcasters the
utmost freedom in order to insure a truly free press." (Mario Cuomo,
"The Unfairness Doctrine," The New York Times, September 20, 1993, p.
A19.)
<P>
     Simple Solution. If the fairness standard is reinstituted, the
result will not be easier access for controversial views. It will
instead be self-censorship, as stations seek to avoid requirements
that they broadcast specific opposing views. With the wide diversity
of views available today in the expanding broadcast system, there is a
simple solution for any family seeking an alternative viewpoint or for
any lawmaker irritated by a pugnacious talk-show host. Turn the dial.

<TITLE>HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTES TO POOR QUALITY TV PROGRAMS
 -- Heritage </TITLE>


<CENTER><H3><I>HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTES TO POOR QUALITY TV PROGRAMS</I></H3>
<P>

Executive Memorandum #297<BR>
3/4/91<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     American TV viewers often complain about the poor quality of
programs on the three major broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC.
Much of the blame for this lies in part with rules imposed in 1970 by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Financial Interest
and Syndication Rules, widely known as "Fin-Syn," prohibit the
broadcast networks from acquiring even a share of the programs that
they broadcast, and from sharing in the profits generated by a
program's re-runs or "syndication." Cable TV networks, by contrast,
are free from the Fin-Syn restrictions. The two-decade old rules have
been a bonanza for the large studios that make most of the programs,
yet have penalized American TV viewers. Under these rules, the
networks have little incentive to finance production of high quality
programs that may make money in re-runs but are almost certain to lose
money initially. The Fin-Syn rules have become an anachronism that
prevents the healthy competition which would improve the quality of
TV. The FCC is reviewing these rules, and will make a decision soon.
In a recent letter to Congress on the Fin-Syn rules, White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu reiterated the Administration's "aversion to
unnecessary government interference with private markets" and its
long-standing "opposition to the government's picking winners and
losers." The FCC would do well to be guided by these principles. The
only course of action that will benefit the television-viewing public
and restore competition to the industry is the complete repeal of Fin-
Syn.
<P>
     Good Intentions Backfire. The development of television
programming is expensive and risky. It is very difficult to predict
whether a show will be a hit or a flop, and thus whether it will
generate enough advertising revenue to cover production costs, much
less make a profit. Even many popular TV programs show no profit until
after they have gone into syndication, that is, are re-run off-
network. An independent producer with an idea for a new television
program usually will need to obtain outside financing, either from a
network or from one of the major Hollywood studios.
<P>

     Before 1970, the networks customarily received a percentage of
the syndication profits in return for the funding they provided for
producing a TV program. This seemed fair. After all, the networks in
large part create the syndication market anyway: without first-run
showings, there would be no demand for second-run showings. The FCC,
however, began viewing this practice as inefficient and a lopsided
arrangement which allowed the networks to exploit producers,
especially the small, independent operators. Therefore, in 1970, the
FCC prohibited the networks from acquiring any interest in the
programs whose development they finance.
<P>
     As it has turned out, Fin-Syn does not benefit the small,
independent producers of television programming. By making it
unattractive for the networks to finance productions at small firms,
since the networks cannot earn anything from syndication, Fin-Syn
restrictions force these smaller enterprises to sell the syndication
rights of their programs to major studios. And because the networks
are prevented from competing with the major studios, independent
programming producers have fewer potential sources of finance. The
result: independent producers are at a bargaining disadvantage, and
hence they must give up to the studios an even larger share of future
program profits to obtain studio funding.
<P>
     Protecting Goliath against David. When the Fin-Syn restrictions
were adopted, the networks had about 90 percent of the prime-time
television market. With the emergence of competing technologies, such
as cable TV, satellites, and video rentals, however, the clout of the
networks has eroded. Today the networks' share of prime-time viewing
is only about 60 percent or so, with no one network having more than
about 20 percent. At the same time, the share of prime-time
programming provided by the eight largest Hollywood studios has soared
from 39 percent in 1970 to over 70 percent today. Thus, while the FCC
may have thought it was protecting David against Goliath when it sided
with the studios against the networks, just the opposite turned out to
be the case.
<P>
     Another major beneficiary of the Fin-Syn restrictions is the
large independent producers. Because the rules make it hard for new
producers to enter the market, existing producers face less
competition and hence enjoy greater profits and power. Before the Fin-
Syn restrictions were adopted, there were 52 independent production
companies supplying series to the networks; in 1980 there were 26.
Today there are nine. Many small producers are employed by big
studios. It comes as no surprise that this handful of remaining
producers support Fin-Syn, for the FCC rule keeps potential upstart
competitors out of the market.
<P>
     The Fin-Syn restrictions do not apply to cable TV. Thus, cable
networks can purchase and own programs and movies, and afford to pay
more for a new program because their ability to recoup their
investment and eventually make a profit is not restricted. This means
they can obtain the programs while the three broadcast networks have
their hands tied. 
<P>
      The ultimate victim of the Fin-Syn restrictions is the viewing
public. Because the networks find it unprofitable or too risky to
finance high-quality programs that might not make money before they
run in syndication, the supply of such programs is artificially
restricted. The result: reduced quality and diversity of programs for
viewers to choose from. 
<P>
      Restoring Networks' Freedom. The 1970 Fin-Syn rules have not
served the public interest. They have reduced competition rather than
expanded it, and have helped large firms rather than small. For these
reasons, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the
Federal Trade Commission, the two federal agencies responsible for
protecting competition and consumers, both strongly oppose keeping
Fin-Syn restrictions in any form. As the Department of Justice stated
in comments it filed with the FCC, "the major effect of the Fin-Syn
rules today is to hinder the efficient operation of the free market."
The Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and the White
House are right. Consumers of TV programs would be better off if the
FCC would revoke the harmful and failed Financial Interest and
Syndication rules and restore the TV networks' freedom to contract for
programs on any terms acceptable to them and the programs' producers.

<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
<a href="/heritage/p_review/sept96/toc.html">September-October 1996, Number 79</a></i>
<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Judy Hooper has two passions in life: doughnuts and the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA).Hooper loves doughnuts. That's one of the reasons she opened a bakery in Evanston, Illinois. It's a small shop, bringing in about $50,000 in profits annually. That's not enough to make her rich, but the challenge of running a small business and her talent for baking keep this 35-year-old Chicago native busy.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Ask Hooper about OSHA, however, and her face glazes over with disdain. A 1994 inspection of her 30-person bakery by OSHA officials left Hooper with $13,000 in frivolous fines. Her infractions included a failure to warn employees of the hazards of household dishwashing liquid. To recoup the cost of the fines, she would have to sell 260,000 doughnuts, or 10,400 cakes, or 1,040,000 cookies.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The national news media picked up her story, but OSHA refused to back down. So has Hooper. Though she paid the fine, she hopes to file a class-action suit against the federal agency, and is trying to enlist other OSHA victims to help her cause. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
She will find plenty of recruits. The bakery owner joins millions of women entrepreneurs across the country who are finding out just how intrusive Big Government can be. Indeed, one of the most overlooked issues in this campaign season is how the rising number of women business owners -- a third of all U.S. firms -- are being beaten down by Washington's overbearing laws, inflexible regulations, and arcane tax policies.<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If they mobilized, these women could be a potent force. The National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) reports that the number of women-owned businesses in the United States will reach 8 million this year, employing more than 18.5 million people and generating more than $2.28 trillion in gross sales. Over the last nine years, NFWBO estimates, the number of women-owned firms has increased 78 percent. "The growth in the number of women-owned businesses continues to be dramatic across the nation," says Julie R. Weeks, NFWBO's director of research. But <a href="http://www.house.gov/myrick/">Sue Myrick</a>, a first-term Republican congresswoman from North Carolina and a former small-business owner, knows first-hand how Big Government threatens this growth: "Most government-imposed regulations are duplicative, expensive, and time-consuming," she says. "If not checked, regulations can cripple a small-business owner's ability to compete in the marketplace."

</td></tr></table>
<p><b>Attack on Nurses</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Consider Arlene Kaplan's Heart to Home, Inc., a New York company that provides skilled nurses for patients needing home health care. To accommodate their unpredictable hours, Heart to Home hires nurses as independent contractors. That means the nurses pay their own state, federal, and Social Security taxes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For the 70 nurses working for Kaplan -- and the thousands of others who labor as independent contractors in health care -- their employment status buys them flexibility. They are free to schedule their work around their families and other commitments, working anywhere from 5-hour to 60-hour weeks as needed. For the home health-care industry, independent contractors deliver affordable, quality care on demand.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But to the <a href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS</a>, the independent contractors who find jobs through Kaplan's company aren't independent enough. Based on a 20-point litmus test, IRS officials determined in a 1990 audit that Heart to Home's nurses legally were not independent contractors, but employees. Kaplan's business was assessed $250,000 in back taxes and fines for misrepresenting her workers to the IRS.
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>In the last seven years, the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to Sandra Abalos, a CPA, the test is "so vague and so subjective" that even tax law practitioners cannot determine who is an employee and who is an independent contractor. Heart to Home's lawyer Barry Frank believes the IRS is "targeting small businesses" by frequently auditing those who hire independent contractors. In the last seven years, the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines.
</td></tr></table><p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	So far Kaplan's business has accrued $20,000 in legal fees and expects another $40,000 in court costs when she goes up against the IRS later this year. Unlike most people engaged in legal jousting with this federal agency, however, Kaplan is the plaintiff: Through a complicated financial maneuver, she managed to sue the IRS.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If the government wins, they put me out of business," Kaplan says. "I don't own enough things in this entire world to pay off what they want from me." Even if Kaplan is successful, there is little hope she'll be reimbursed by the IRS for her legal fees. But forcing the agency to retreat would be a moral victory for her, and might make IRS agents a little less eager the next time around. Says Kaplan, "Maybe they will get off someone else's back in this business."<p><b>Tripping up Toddlers</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The IRS, of course, retains no monopoly on crippling regulation. A few years ago, Virginia resident Tanya Wallace started a small business called Toddlin' Time, a playgroup for stay-at-home moms and their kids. When she decided to franchise her idea, however, she ran up against <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) regulations intended for larger companies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The FTC's "franchise rule" requires all companies, regardless of their size, to meet the same franchising requirements. So Toddlin' Time, which simply brings mothers and children together at dance studios and karate centers to play games, must meet the same auditing requirements as McDonald's, a company with billions of dollars in sales and operating costs, expensive equipment, and trained staff. 
<p>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>It's just easier to walk away from the business, says Tanya Wallace, than to deal with all the government regulations</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	With just a few hours a week in administrative work, Toddlin' Time franchise owners can earn around $14,000 per year by enrolling 50 kids for six-week sessions at $36 per child. Wallace sees her idea as an excellent opportunity to combine family and business in a way that "feels comfortable to home-based women." The business gives kids a regular time and place to play together while stay-at-home moms get to know each other. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It's an easy concept to market. But FTC franchising rules have stopped Wallace cold. To comply, she had to expend $15,000 in auditing and lawyers' fees just to become a licensed franchiser. But Wallace couldn't pass these high start-up costs along to the moms interested in Toddlin' Time, so she marketed her franchise below cost. That meant selling four franchising chains just to break even. Yet the fees did not end when her start-up was complete. The FTC requires franchise operators to update their financial statements every year and demands yearly audits to verify the changes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"We're not a big company," Wallace explains. "We can't afford the two or three or four thousand dollars each year to [prepare] FTC financial statements."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	After six years and 10 successful Toddlin' Time franchises, Wallace is putting the brakes on further expansion. She says she simply can't afford the fees and regulations. Despite these setbacks, Wallace has not totally given up on the idea of Toddlin' Time. She is pursuing a consulting practice to spread her idea, though not her logo, to moms around the nation.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"There is little that you can do when you're up against Big Government and government regulations," she says. "It's easier to walk away, unfortunately, than to deal with all the regulations and expectations they have for you."<p><b>The Disablers</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	When it comes to federal regulations like the Americans with Disabilities Act, however, walking away is not an option. Ask Karla Hauk. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	She and her husband and business partner, Richard Hauk, opened a 32-room Days Inn franchise in Wall, South Dakota. That was on July 1, 1993, about six months after the ADA went into effect. They thought they were ready: Following their franchiser-approved plans, they made two of their 32 rooms accessible to handicapped patrons and made the entrance of their motel accessible to wheelchairs. When they opened their doors, they became the first motel in Wall to provide rooms with accommodations for the handicapped.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Their reward? Karla, Richard, their architect, their contractor, and their franchiser all are being sued by the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">U.S. Justice Department</a> for failure to comply with ADA regulations. They are charged with "unlawful discrimination" toward individuals with disabilities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It all started with a whirlpool. According to the Justice Department's suit, the Hauks' two-story motel became a three-story facility when they installed a whirlpool in the basement. ADA regulations require that their motel have an elevator so that handicapped customers can reach every floor, as well as a ramp leading to the whirlpool. According to Karla Hauk, installing the elevator alone would cost more than $100,000, not including the increase in property taxes. Even if the owners removed the whirlpool and left the basement empty, they would still be required to build an elevator for handicapped access, because the Justice Department has declared the basement "occupiable space."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	In addition to the elevator, the ADA requires the Hauks to widen all of the bathroom doors in the nonhandicapped rooms. "If someone who uses a wheelchair . . . visits another guest in a non-accessible guest room, he or she will not be able even to enter the bathroom in that room," according to the suit.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Changing the building's design after the fact looks nearly impossible. "Structurally we don't know how you can do it," says Hauks' lawyer Kim Ruckdaschel-Haley. "What do you do, just knock the place down and start over?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Karla Hauk says she believes there should be provisions for the handicapped, but that "a lot of this is unreasonable." She says if they had known then what they know now, they never would have built the motel. "We wish to God we never had. They will bankrupt us."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Because the Hauks' business is dependent upon the seasonal tourist traffic at nearby Badlands National Park, they bring in profits of only $20,000 to $25,000 a year. "If Karla and Richard have to fight this, they'll have to go out of business," says their lawyer. In addition to substantial costs to comply with the ADA regulations, the co-owners could each be fined $50,000 by the Justice Department. When the ADA went into effect, it was unclear how the law would be implemented, says Ruckdaschel-Haley. "Karla and Richard in good faith thought they were doing everything they could."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For ADA bureaucrats, it seems, everything is not enough. So says Debbie Shaffer, owner of an interior design firm in Walla Walla, Washington. Shaffer wanted to move her eight-year-old company, DGS Interiors, out of her home and into a downtown storefront to expand her business. The proposed Main Street site consisted of a 1,500 square-foot main floor for retail sales, with a raised mezzanine to serve as both a design studio and an administrative office.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The problem? Contractors familiar with ADA regulations informed Shaffer that she had two options in bringing the bi-level facility up to code: either build an elevator to make the second floor accessible to the handicapped, or illogically and wastefully duplicate the design studio on the showroom floor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If a handicapped client wanted a design consultation, Shaffer says, she could easily accommodate their needs by bringing her portable decorating samples down to the lower level. But this was not good enough: According to the ADA, this special treatment would unfairly discriminate against the handicapped.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	To comply with the ADA codes, Shaffer would have to spend $150,000 to install an elevator, build handicapped bathrooms, and widen all of the building entrances and doorways. These costs were in addition to her other remodeling expenses. "I have a great amount of support for people with any kind of disability," she says, having grown up with a sister who is deaf. "But the government steps in and takes it too far."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The results? "As a small business owner, it was black and white," Shaffer explains. "I couldn't afford it." Shaffer believes the downtown location could have increased her business by 50 percent, but because the regulations were "too overwhelming, with too many hoops to jump through," she was forced to scrap her plans to expand.<p><b>Doughnut Holes</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If the ADA's regulatory reach can be breathtakingly broad and intrusive, its rival in the universe of federal agencies is <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a>. Over the last two fiscal years, OSHA has recorded 234,409 violations and assessed over $158 million in fines.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Responding to complaints by a disgruntled employee, OSHA held a three-hour inspection of Judy's Bakery, the Illinois mom-and-pop operation cited above. Nothing could have prepared Judy Hooper for OSHA's report, which cited her for, among other things:<ol>	<p><li>Failing to have a written "Material Safety Data Sheet" for "hazardous" chemicals used at the bakery. The only chemicals used at Judy's Bakery are household bleach and the sort of pink dishwashing liquid used in many homes. Both "chemicals" have clearly marked warning labels. OSHA was unmoved. Fine: $2,500.	<p><li>Failing to have a written plan for emergencies such as a fire. Hooper's shop, which is on the first floor and has four clearly marked exits, is inspected twice a year by the Evanston fire department. Local fire officials had never found any potential safety problems. Fine: $2,500.	<p><li>Failing to have an accident log on the shop's wall. At the time, her company had never had an accident requiring a workmen's compensation claim. The officials said this was irrelevant and argued that even if the log contained all zeroes (one for each day without accidents), it must still be hung on the wall. Fine: $500.	</ol><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
At her informal settlement hearing with OSHA officials, Hooper was able to negotiate the fines down from $13,000 to $5,450. The catch was that Hooper was required to spend the balance of the fines due--approximately $7,500--on safety and health programs for her employees and to present proof that she had complied. Ironically, none of the citations was related to the employee's complaints, which were found to be baseless.<p><b>The Gentle Scrub Jay</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It was not the safety of employees that concerned the government officials who intruded into Anita Cragg's business, but the safety of the Florida scrub jay.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	 Cragg, the owner and president of Space Coast Management Services, Inc., bought an existing subdivision in Country Cove, Florida, in 1992, with plans to expand and build new homes adjacent the previously developed site. Cragg's permits were in order and some buyers were waiting to build and settle in.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Enter the scrub jay. While surveying for waterline extensions in 1993, officials from the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS) noted two jays flying onto Cragg's lots. Under the Endangered Species Act, the scrub jay, a 12-inch-long, blue and gray crested jay, is listed as threatened. The officials claimed that Cragg's planned development posed a potential hazard to land "suitable for occupation by scrub jays" and suspended construction on the site.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	According to Cragg, neither the USFWS, nor an independent environmental engineer hired by Cragg, could locate any scrub jay nests on her property. Her four-person company fought with officials from the USFWS for 18 months. Construction was frozen in the meantime, while Cragg's buyers had to continue paying real-estate taxes on the land.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Fish and Wildlife Service pushed Cragg into a corner. The agency forced her firm to purchase four acres off-site for every one on-site to compensate for the loss of potential scrub jay habitat. That little bargain cost her more than $100,000. It "didn't really help the scrub jay," she says, "because we really weren't hurting it in the first place."<p><b>An Irresistible Offer</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	From 1964 until 1979, most of the commercial garbage in Seattle was hauled to one landfill located on the Tulalip Indian reservation. The site was closed and cleaned up in 1979, getting a clean bill of health from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. For the next 16 years, there wasn't a whiff of trouble from Seattle's former commercial dump.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	And then the EPA started talkin' trash: In 1995, the agency placed the Tulalip Landfill on the Superfund's National Priority List, a list reserved for the country's most serious hazardous waste sites. EPA Project Manager Cindy Colgate admitted that "sometimes we think a problem is taken care of when it's not."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Apparently, this was one of those times. Superfund legislation allows the EPA to retroactively assess liability for environmental clean-ups. So the agency is asking Seattle's commercial businesses for approximately $40 million to clean up the landfill a second time.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The EPA has made what it calls "settlement offers" to 208 Seattle companies, each of which hauled more than 200 tons of waste to the site. These offers allow companies the chance to "resolve their liability" by making payments of $11,070 to $185,497 to the EPA, according to Colgate. The official insists this "is not a fine," but instead an "agreement between the EPA and the parties which says we won't sue them regarding the site." It also protects the firms from third-party suits. Many attorneys are advising firms to pay the EPA and move on. So far, 187 parties have decided to settle rather than face EPA lawsuits.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For some women-owned firms, the experience has been a primer on the power of federal agencies to impose their will. One such firm in Seattle, an import-export company whose owners asked not to be identified, agreed to pay their  $11,070 fine. In total, Seattle's business owners are forking over $8,130,610 to the EPA--at least $30 million short of its goal. Suzanne Burke, the president of the Fremont Dock Co., which was not named in the settlement, says she believes the 208 letters are "just the beginning," and fears her company may be next on the list. She says the $40 million Superfund cleanup is "an absolute horror for small businesses."

<p><b>Fighting Back</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	There may be some legislative help on the way for business owners. Congress is seeking to clarify the ambiguity over the tax status of independent contractors versus employees, which bedeviled business owner Arlene Kaplan. Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/christensen/welcome.html">Jon Christensen</a>, a Nebraska Republican, is sponsoring a bill to simplify IRS rules for independent contractors. A spokesman for Christensen says the bipartisan bill could pass this year. Oklahoma Republican <a href="http://www.senate.gov/member/ok/nickles/general/">Don Nickles</a> has introduced similar legislation in the Senate because, according to his spokesman, "hassle from the IRS" is the principal complaint from his constituents. 	<p>

	But as more women start their own businesses, they are becoming more cynical about government's helping hand. Forty-seven percent of the women business owners surveyed in 1995 by the United States Trust Company believed that government policies had made things "a little worse or much worse" for their businesses. When asked to rate specific government policies, almost all of the female respondents (91 percent) said they feel most threatened by government-required paperwork, while 90 percent feel threatened by taxes on businesses, raw materials, final products, or services.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The bureaucrats contend they're changing the system. Several officials separately claimed OSHA's new and improved agency has purged archaic enforcement procedures, yet all cited the same case to prove their reform: "Instead of fining someone for not hanging one of our posters about workers' rights," they say, "we offer them a poster to hang." While this may be a first step in dismantling the adversarial relationship between employers and OSHA, it demonstrates how federal agencies are not getting the message from business owners across the country. What happens, one might ask, if they don't hang the poster?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Women business owners are bumping against a ceiling all right. But it isn't made of glass -- it's made of red tape.<p><i>Sheila A.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since the early 1930s, no sector of the American economy has been more heavily regulated than the financial services industry, and particularly commercial banks. Addressing an industry conference, Jerry L. Jordan, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, summed up the extent of banking regulations by noting that 
<blockquote>

For more than 60 years, the Glass-Steagall Act has defined what a banking organization has been allowed to do; the Douglas and other bank holding company acts have defined the corporate form required to do it; the national or state banking authorities, deposit insurance agencies, and Federal Reserve have defined how to do it; and their supervisors and examiners have made sure it was done that way. It's a tribute to the perennial optimism of human beings that a conference on the future of banking might talk about anything other than <I>regulation</I>.<sup>1</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, it is difficult to speak of banking or any other financial service without also mentioning the overwhelming amount of federal regulation that affects the industry. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of this regulatory web is the Banking Act of 1933, commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall established barriers between commercial banks and their investment counterparts. It also established barriers between banks and other commercial businesses so that today, a bank that offers loans and checking accounts cannot also directly underwrite securities for its business customers or offer life insurance policies to its consumers. This theory of "separation banking" continued to drive federal regulation for 60 years. Each time the market established a legal connection between banking and another financial or commercial sector, the government stepped in with new regulations preventing such a relationship. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As a result of legal restrictions, banks have seen their share of the financial services sector slip away to less-regulated competitors. In fact, between 1952 and 1994, banks, thrifts, and credit unions saw their share of the financial sector fall from 67.4 percent to 35.5 percent,<sup>2</sup> largely because banks are prohibited from taking advantage of innovative investment opportunities and offering modern financial options to their customers. In essence, banks are asked to compete in the technologically advanced 1990s using only 1930s investment techniques. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Consumers suffer substantial harm from the forced separation of financial services. Every producer and consumer in the United States is connected in some way to the financial services industry, be it through a simple $100 checking account or by means of a complex, multibillion-dollar corporate merger. Nearly every economic transaction -- millions of them each day -- involves the exchange of money or the promise of a future exchange of money, so every producer and consumer in the country feels the weight of financial service regulations daily. And every day, producers and consumers pay an unnecessary premium for this burdensome system of regulation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the federal financial regulatory system.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress and the President should allow financial services to be provided within a free market by eliminating the many regulations that currently interfere with efficient transactions and savings. The first step in this process is elimination of the artificial barriers that have been created between commercial and investment banking and all other commercial and financial activities.<sup>3</sup>  Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ul><p><li>

Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella bank holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses;

<p><li>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services;

<p><li>Eliminate all federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and

<p><li>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Enacting these recommendations is the first step in ending more than 60 years of harmful financial regulation and allowing the American financial system to take advantage of modern technology. As a guide to policymakers, this <I>Talking Points</I> reviews the history of federal laws that have prohibited integrated financial services, offers recommendations based on a conclusion that these laws are antiquated, discusses the benefits of financial services reform, and reviews current reform efforts.
<p>
<b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general framework of modern financial service regulation was set by the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), passed by Congress in reaction to the more than 10,000 bank failures or forced mergers between 1929 and 1933. In general, Glass-Steagall prohibits banks from offering a full range of banking services. According to Jonathan Macey and Geoffrey Miller, authors of <I>Banking Law and Regulation:</I> "Responding to political charges that the Depression had been caused by bank speculation in securities, the Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial banking from investment banking. Securities firms were not to accept deposits or affiliate with deposit-taking institutions; and commercial bank members of the Federal Reserve System were barred from participating, either directly or indirectly, in many aspects of the securities business."<sup>4</sup>  This separation evolved from a fear by politicians that commercial banks were commonly engaged in risky investments using the deposits of individuals and small businesses. From their perspective, banks were gambling with the life savings of an unsuspecting public.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortly before final passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, Senator Carter Glass expressed the depth of this fear: "The main purpose of the bill as passed by the Senate last spring, as Senators will recall, was to prevent, under penalty, the use of Federal Reserve banking facilities for stock-gambling purposes. I use that term in its harshest sense, realizing that it touches the sensibilities of a great many people who persist in calling it 'stock-investment purposes.'"<sup>5</sup>  These comments by one of the Act's principal sponsors epitomize the heated rhetoric that surrounded banking regulation in the early years of the Depression. It is ironic that these words are still used by legislators to justify expansion of strict banking regulations.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The driving fear behind passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 has continued to guide banking regulation ever since. Every time the banking industry found a legal way to link commercial banking with investment services or other commercial activities, federal regulators blocked the path. For example, after the passage of Glass-Steagall, many bankers created bank holding companies or umbrella organizations that owned a share of several different companies. A holding company might have owned a commercial bank, an investment bank, and an insurance company. Because these holdings were separate entities, such an arrangement was legal. And although such an arrangement was not very efficient, it did offer bank holding companies many of the advantages of integrated banking.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, however, was passed to prevent these bank holding companies from simultaneously owning such diverse financial entities. Specifically, the Act "was intended to make bank holding companies subject to federal regulation and, more specifically, to get all of them out of commerce."<sup>6</sup>  Moreover, the same fears about bigness and the safety of individual savings that led to passage of Glass-Steagall also led to passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The principal sponsor of the 1956 Act, Senator Willis Robertson of Virginia, did not hesitate to invoke the shade of his fellow Virginian and predecessor, Carter Glass, recalling that "as early as 1938 Glass realized that the restrictions provided were not adequate to protect independent bankers from possible monopolistic situations and he sought to have them strengthened.... My own efforts to pick up and carry on the attempts of my predecessor to regulate bank holding companies more effectively began in 1949."<sup>7</sup>  As John Kareken notes, "Revealing its fear of bigness, a fear linking it to Congresses past and future, the Eighty-fifth Congress responded with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956."<sup>8</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This fear of bigness and belief that integrated banks were too risky with individual deposits were evident throughout the 1960s and 1970s as federal courts and regulators continued to separate commercial and investment banking. In a 1981 decision, the Supreme Court declared: "Congress was persuaded that speculative activities, partially attributable to the connection between commercial banking and investment banking, had contributed to the rash of bank failures [leading up to the Great Depression]."<sup>9</sup>  As recently as March 1995, these fears continued to influence congressional action (or in this case, inaction). Testifying before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, James L. Bothwell, Director of Financial Institutions and Markets Issues for the General Accounting Office, asked: "How would the public respond if a major company that owned a bank got into trouble?  How would regulators be able to maintain adequate supervision of the company as a whole?"<sup>10</sup>  Because lawmakers evidently found this possibility disconcerting, federal law has continued to prevent banks and bank holding companies from engaging in any other commercial or financial activity, in hopes of preventing bank failures and the loss of depositor money.
<p>
<b>THE CASE FOR REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Two main fears have guided the mandatory separation of commercial banking and investment banking: risk of loss and conflict of interest. These fears have guided federal policy at least since the Depression. However, studies undertaken over the past 35 years have demonstrated that these fears are groundless. This research has demonstrated that integrated banking, a free market in which financial companies are free to engage in any activity they wish, leads to banks that are both safer and less prone to failure. Moreover, most banks carefully avoid a possible conflict of interest because to do so is in the best interest of the company and its investors. The natural conclusion is that laws and regulations which prohibit integrated banking should be eliminated and that commercial banks, bank holding companies, insurance providers, investment banks, and other commercial firms should be allowed to enter a full range of financial and commercial activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk of Loss.</b> Perhaps the greatest fear lawmakers have expressed concerning the relationship between commercial banking and investment or other financial activities is that the inherent risk of such endeavors places deposited money in jeopardy. A loss could destroy the financial security of people who have deposited their life savings in the bank.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor has the bank holding company structure been viewed as any safer with respect to investment money. It is feared, for example, that a bank might simply transfer capital to an affiliated investment bank or insurance company. Considered equally dangerous, "a bank might purchase securities from its affiliate at greater-than-market prices or sell securities and make loans to facilitate securities purchases from the affiliate at less-than-market prices."<sup>11</sup>  In any case, the concern is that bankers would worry first about their own financial interest and only then about the security of bank depositors' money.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If these risks indeed were a threat, or if bankers really were concerned only about their own financial security, banks that engaged in stock market investment before passage of Glass-Steagall would have failed at a greater rate than those which did not involve themselves in such activities. However, this was not the case. In fact, studies have shown that banks involved in securities activities were less likely to fail than those not involved in investing. Eugene White investigated and found that "while 26.3 percent of all national banks failed in this period [from 1930-1933], only 6.5 percent of the 62 banks which had [investment] affiliates in 1929 and 7.6 percent of the 145 banks which conducted large operations through their bond departments closed their doors (see Chart 2)."<sup>12</sup>  On average, banks that engaged in investment activities failed less frequently than those that did not.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason for the relative stability among integrated banks, as White notes, was their ability to diversify financial activities during a period of slow commercial banking. "This diversification allowed banks to gain new business as their more traditional activities stagnated and to take advantage of significant complementarities in the production of financial services."<sup>13</sup>  Also, integrated banks, primarily from necessity, tended to have larger asset bases which allowed them greater economies of scale during difficult economic times. Ironically, one of the regulators' greatest fears -- bigness -- was actually an asset to banks during the early years of the Depression.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Conflict of Interest.</b> Another important concern of bank regulators is that integrated banks would represent a clear conflict of interest that could lead bank owners and managers to put their own financial interest before that of depositors. For example, many fear that a bank underwriting equity in a company faces a perverse incentive to influence its depositors to invest in that company, even if such an investment is unsound. Banks would have an easy time persuading investors, often considered na<ve, to make risky investments. Senator Robert Bulkley summed up this belief in 1932: "The banker ought to be regarded as the financial confidant and mentor of his depositors. Obviously, the banker who has nothing to sell to his depositors is much better qualified to advise disinterestedly and to regard diligently the safety of depositors than the banker who uses the list of depositors in his savings department to distribute circulars concerning the advantages of this, that or the other investment."<sup>14</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Securities issued by commercial banks or affiliates would have underperformed when compared to securities issued by investment banks if the fear expressed by Senator Bulkley and others were well-grounded. However, evidence from the period before passage of Glass-Steagall indicates otherwise. Randall Krozner and Raghurm Rajan, professors at the University of Chicago, have found that between 1924 and 1940, "investment bank underwritten issues experienced roughly 40 percent more defaults than [did] affiliate underwritten issues."<sup>15</sup>  Additionally, they found that commercial banks and their affiliates tended to underwrite "higher-quality issues" of larger companies that were inherently safer.<sup>16</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated banks tended to underwrite safer securities because the market corrected for the exact fear that legislators wished to regulate away: a risk of individual savings. Most depositors at integrated banks looked very closely at the investment portfolio of their bank to ensure a desirable level of security. Contrary to Senator Bulkley's fears, depositors made informed, sound investment decisions. Investors who were concerned not with safety, but with the potential for a greater return generally went to investment banks. Krozner and Rajan conclude:<blockquote>

Indeed, our results suggest that the public markets and rating agencies were aware of the potential for conflicts (or weak reputations) of the affiliates. The affiliates appear to have responded to the market's concerns by  underwriting primarily more senior securities and securities of older, larger, and better-known firms than did the investment banks.<sup>17</sup></blockquote>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, the market during the 1920s -- before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act -- was acting efficiently, with integrated commercial banks serving small investors concerned with safety and investment banks serving larger investors seeking a substantial but openly risky return.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of this evidence leads to a conclusion far different from the one historically driving federal banking regulation: Integrated banks tend to be safer and less averse to conflicts of interest than a combined system of purely investment banks and purely commercial banks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advancing Technology</b>. The historic evidence by itself is enough to warrant a change in federal financial regulations. However, there is an additional impetus to action. Modern technology has allowed expansion of the financial services sector to the point where banks as traditionally defined are rapidly becoming obsolete. Yet institutions unfortunate enough to be classified as banks are unable to capitalize on new financial opportunities because federal regulations are still guided by laws and principles derived in the 1930s. Not only are banks hurt, but consumers are unable to take advantage of more profitable opportunities made possible by technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the following:<ul>
<p><li>An average money market mutual fund earns a 4.76 percent annual rate of return,<sup>18</sup> and many offer free checking services. The average commercial bank checking account earns less than 4.0 percent interest annually, and consumers often must pay a service charge for each check or transfer. Although mutual funds are growing in popularity, many consumers do not take advantage of these financial instruments because, with rare exceptions, commercial banks are prohibited from offering them. In many cases, these consumers simply are unaware of the mutual fund option.

<p><li>Many small businesses cannot expand (or even start) because equity capital is difficult and expensive to secure. Such companies are limited in their expansion potential because they cannot incur additional debt. Moreover, these difficulties place small businesses at a disadvantage in comparison to larger corporations that enjoy ready access to investment services and are more able to afford the overhead costs of obtaining equity. Integrated financial service provision would allow local banks and providers to underwrite small local businesses and finance entrepreneurs.

<p><li>Many commercial companies have created financial service departments or affiliates. Banks, on the other hand, are prohibited from entering other commercial sectors. Therefore, they cannot take full advantage of the technology that has made it possible for companies such as General Electric, Ford, and Sears to offer various financially related services such as commercial loans, credit cards, and personal insurance.

<p><li>Technology renders many of the services to which commercial banks are limited obsolete. Today, even small investors can take advantage of large potential earnings by pooling their funds. Additionally, computers and the Internet make financial services more accessible -- but not nearly as accessible as they might be in a world without federal regulations against integrated banking. Commercial banks have the infrastructure to provide an efficient retail market. There are banks in every town in America, often on every corner in larger cities. And while the percentage of the population owning a personal computer with access to the Internet is increasing, nearly 100 percent of the population currently has easy access to a bank. If these banks were allowed to offer a full range of financial services, millions of consumers could take advantage of increased earnings. The economy as a whole also would benefit from a more efficient allocation of financial resources.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The rate at which technology is capable of changing also makes deregulation necessary. As mentioned above, for each federal regulation that aims to prevent integrated banking, the private sector devises a legal bypass. This process is like a perpetual motion machine: As the pace of technological advance quickens, federal regulations become obsolete all the more rapidly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider just two facts:
<ol><p><li>The pace of technological change over the past ten years has tended to follow Moore's Law. Named for Intel founder Gordon Moore, this law dictates that the power of advanced technology will double roughly every 18 months. In other words, the life cycle of most modern technology is less than two years.

<p><li>The average regulation takes more than two years to conceive, develop, and implement. And this does not include the time needed to legislate changes in major regulations and the time consumed by court proceedings to interpret those regulations.
</ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taken together, these facts lead to one overriding question: How can government possibly keep pace with such rapidly changing technology?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the best example of the change technology will bring to the financial services sector is the creation of digital money, often referred to as "e-cash."  E-cash, in its purest form, represents an on-line account that can be used in a manner similar to a debit card. Often called stored-value cards, e-cash accounts are being developed by many non-bank entities. Should non-bank providers be subject to the same reserve requirements and regulations as banks, and will e-cash accounts be covered under federal deposit insurance?<sup>19</sup>  These questions will have to be answered as electronic commerce becomes increasingly popular. But the first question that needs to be addressed is: Will a government-run regulatory structure that takes years to promulgate even a simple rule be able to respond to a technology that has the potential to emerge and change within months?  The answer is that it will not.
<p>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate goal of financial modernization must be to eliminate all barriers that exist between commercial banking, investment banking, and all other commercial and financial activities. It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the current federal financial regulatory system. The only sensible course is to sweep away 60 years of government intervention in financial services and begin anew with a free and open financial market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first logical step in financial modernization is to allow diverse firms to affiliate under a single umbrella company. Currently, any company that owns a commercial bank is prohibited from owning any other financial service company such as an insurance firm or investment bank. The intent of this restriction is to prevent companies from using the commercial bank's deposits to subsidize risky investments. In reality, however, the Bank Holding Company Act has increased savings and investment costs by preventing an efficient delivery of financial services.

<p><li><b>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;True free-market reform would not stop at allowing only affiliations between diverse companies. Individual financial service firms should be permitted to provide a whole range of services, financial and otherwise. This can be accomplished only by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is unclear whether financial service companies, if given the opportunity would choose to structure themselves as individual firms or as financial service holding companies.<sup>20</sup>  However, a single corporate structure should not be imposed by federal fiat. Instead, companies should be free to chose the structure that best suits their customers and shareholders.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are several reasons why financial modernization legislation should include repeal of both the Glass-Steagall Act of 1993 and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956: <b>First</b>, smaller financial institutions would benefit. These small companies, many serving rural communities, would find it difficult to affiliate with other financial service companies. In order to take advantage of the opportunities flowing from deregulation, small companies might have to "go it alone" and provide insurance, underwriting, and other services within the structure of an individual company.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Second</b>, economic efficiency might require an individual firm to offer a full complement of financial services. A firm with an extensive retail network could find it more advantageous to offer expanded services within its existing structure. For example, a commercial bank with an extensive branch system in place might not want to purchase an insurance company with an entirely separate network of branches. Instead, the bank might find it more efficient to expand services available at existing branches. This would benefit customers by increasing convenience and decreasing transaction costs. The most important goal of modernization should be to ensure that choices about diversification are left to individual firms and not mandated by the federal government.

<p><li><b>Eliminate federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is not enough simply to remove statutory restrictions against integrated banking. Sixty years of federal regulations, rules, and tedious oversight also must be rolled back. And while statutes such as the Banking Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 have set the general framework for federal involvement in financial services, it has been the daily actions of federal regulatory agencies that have tightened the grip on America's financial system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with all government agencies, the federal financial regulatory agencies are slow to change. Beginning in the mid-1980s, federal regulators did begin to allow some "well-capitalized" banks to provide limited investment and commercial services. These are steps in the right direction, but because they are exceptions to the rules and are applied somewhat arbitrarily, they create distortions in the financial services market. These exclusions also complicate the regulatory structure so that similar banks with identical characteristics often are treated differently. Moreover, banks without political clout are denied the opportunity to diversify their operations and subsequently are placed at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, it is increasingly difficult for federal regulators to keep pace with changes in technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rolling back the regulatory powers of the various federal financial agencies is every bit as essential as repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Only when financial service companies are free from both statutory restraints and regulatory burdens will they be able to take full advantage of the free market.
<p>
<li><b>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once existing regulations are eliminated, there will be no restrictions on the financial or investment opportunities available to commercial firms. Any future regulation or federal government action should be concerned only with securing a minimum safety net for individual depositors. Every other transaction and financial service company should be left to the free market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been much talk recently of creating a two-way street between insurance companies and commercial banks. True free-market financial modernization would go well beyond this to create a virtual autobahn of activity. Financial service companies should be allowed to offer any service they wish and to choose for themselves the companies with which they want to be affiliated. Likewise, commercial firms should be allowed to enter the financial market at any point that seems most advantageous for them. This integration and free entry will breed entrepreneurship, which in turn will produce lower costs and make available more consumer services.</ol>

<p>
<b>Benefits of These Recommendations</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Increase the safety and soundness of all banks.</b> First-year economics students learn that diversity helps increase stability. Likewise, any investor who desires a safe portfolio diversifies his investments. The past 60 years of financial regulation have ignored this basic economic understanding, and banks have continued to fail as a result. Integrated financial service provision will increase the safety and soundness of all financial companies by allowing them to diversify their operations just as individual investors and other commercial companies do.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History proves that banks with diverse operations are less likely to fail than those restricted to specific activities. Research by Eugene White, for example, has demonstrated that in the 1920s, before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, banks engaged in investment activities were less likely to fail than banks engaged solely in consumer activities (see Chart 2).<sup>21</sup>  In fact, the majority of banks that failed during the late 1920s were small banks with limited investments and activities. No witnesses testifying in 1931, including the Comptroller of the Currency, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and numerous bank executives, mentioned securities-related activity as the cause of any bank failures.<sup>22</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second example is provided by the failure of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. As early as 1982, analysts were predicting a bleak outlook for S&Ls. Brookings Institution economist Andrew Carron wrote that "As a result of this decline in net worth and asset values, between 15 and 27 percent of the federally insured firms in the [savings and loan] industry would find themselves in an untenable position: without drastic cost cutting, good fortune, or a cash infusion from the government, they would be unable to return to break-even operations. Ultimately, they would fail."<sup>23</sup>  Indeed, between August 1989 and the end of 1992, 642 savings and loans failed. The primary reason, again predicted by Carron, was that "[t]ax laws and regulatory practice have forced savings and loans and mutual savings banks to hold fixed-rate long-term residential mortgages as their principal assets and to accept the short-term deposits of households as their major source of funds."<sup>24</sup>  Looking back on the crisis, Alan Gart wrote that the number one reason so many S&Ls failed was "a combination of mismatched maturities of fixed-rate mortgages and variable-rate short term deposits during a period of rising interest rates."<sup>25</sup>  In other words, savings and loans were not allowed to diversify their services or their assets. As long as mortgage rates and consumer interest rates were compatible, this was not a problem. But as soon as the housing market turned sour, many S&Ls failed because they had no offsetting profitable activities.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated financial service provision would allow financial service companies to diversify their investment portfolios so that downturns in one sector could be offset by upturns in others. In economics, this is known as vertical integration. Integrated financial service provision also would allow diversification of services, permitting financial service companies to move resources from inactive services to those that are active and profitable. For example, when the real estate market is in a downturn, companies could move resources from the mortgage industry to a more profitable sector, such as life insurance.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow regional banks a more diverse operating arena to serve their clients better.</b> Many analysts believe that financial service deregulation would drive small local banks out of business and that would be the end of personal banking. On the contrary, integrated financial service provision would allow local financial companies to expand the arena in which they operate, thereby increasing the number of services they can offer their local community. Local financial companies are best able to understand the unique needs of the communities in which they operate, and expanding the opportunities of these companies will allow them to meet their community needs more effectively.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Also, integrated financial service provision would allow many small, regional financial service companies to diversify their activities, which is inherently more stable. The evidence cited above shows that banks with diverse portfolios are less likely to fail. The reason for increased stability with diversification is simple. Diversity allows a financial service provider to offset slow times in one market area with growth in another. Diversity is the key to any stable investment strategy and should be allowed in the banking industry.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This would be particularly important in rural areas for two reasons. First, it is accepted increasingly that the future success of the American agriculture industry will depend on exports. Farmers and the agriculture community will need to take advantage of efficient foreign exchange markets, financial futures trading, and other mechanisms to increase export opportunities for their commodities. This is possible only if regional financial service companies are allowed increased access to these financial activities through integrated financial service provision. Second, regional rural banks historically have been subject to economic swings in the agriculture industry. Because current law limits banks to narrow fields of operation, such natural events as a drought or freeze can cause the failure of a rural bank limited to agriculture lending, and this failure can exacerbate the problems faced by a rural community. The ability to provide integrated financial services would allow rural financial service companies to diversify their activities, thus decreasing their susceptibility to swings in the agricultural industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow small businesses and entrepreneurs to secure capital more easily.</b> One of the primary benefits of integrated financial service provision would be the ability of commercial banks to underwrite equity for businesses. This would allow small businesses to go directly to local banks to secure equity rather than being forced to go to a separate investment bank, thus incurring higher transaction costs. Also, many investment banks today do not concentrate on reaching small businesses because of the high costs involved. Capital markets would become more accessible to all businesses, especially small or regional companies, once all financial service providers were given the option of underwriting securities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow greater access to capital markets for individual investors.</b> Eugene White has noted that many commercial banks entered investment banking in the 1920s because they "had established extensive retailing networks among their depositors during [World War I]. Unlike investment bankers who generally had a small clientele of the well-to-do, commercial banks had large numbers of potential customers, each of whom could invest a small amount in securities."<sup>26</sup>  These banks saw an underdeveloped market in small investors and reacted in a typical market-oriented manner until Congress prevented such a move by passing the Glass-Steagall Act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same opportunity exists for commercial banks today. Integrated banks would be able to take advantage of their extensive network of local branches and affiliates. Gerald O'Driscoll, Vice President and Director of Policy Analysis for Citicorp, recently wrote that "The homework banks do to process a loan application frequently duplicates that needed to write an insurance policy. Further, the distribution system is already present in every bank lobby."<sup>27</sup>  Likewise, insurance agents and other networked financial service providers would be able to offer their customers more services at lower cost. This all means that consumers who have access to a local bank or insurance agency, but not to the Internet or an investment bank, will be provided with more options when investing their savings.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Require fewer transaction costs for customers.</b> Not only would integrated financial service provision provide greater access to financial markets for all investors and businesses, but it would do so more efficiently in many instances. As mentioned above, commercial banks have an extensive network of local offices, affiliates, automated teller machines (ATMs), and branches. Accompanying this structure is a communications and managerial infrastructure that must be duplicated by a separate investment bank and a separate insurance agency. By combining these services, consumers would be able to take advantage of economies of scale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the administrative duties required by banks also duplicate those required by insurance agents or investment companies. For example, a loan mortgage application contains much the same information as a homeowner's insurance contract. Likewise, a business loan application requires much the same financial information as a request for securities underwriting. If a single financial institution could offer all of these services, many of these duplicated efforts would be eliminated and costs reduced. Reduced costs allow individuals and businesses to make more valuable purchases and more investors and entrepreneurs to enter the financial markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, integrated financial service provision would lead more financial service institutions to offer discount brokerage service, mutual funds, and other similar opportunities. Many individuals unable to reach these markets in the past because of high transaction costs were forced to settle for a single savings vehicle, even if that vehicle was not ideally suited to their needs. These investors, often of the lower working class, would be able to access a greater selection of investments and would soon realize a higher rate of return on their savings. Additionally, the market in general would perform more efficiently because a larger part of aggregate savings would be invested in more efficient and profitable avenues.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow capital to flow through the American economy more efficiently.</b> Many economists believe that prohibiting integrated financial service provision is a drag on the American economy because savings are not allocated efficiently. As Michael Porter has written, "The United States possesses an enormous pool of investment capital. The problem lies in how this capital is allocated -- at what rates and into what kinds of investments."<sup>28</sup>  For example, restrictions on the activities of commercial banks prevent them from informing investors about the full range of opportunities available to them. Also, the transaction costs of dealing with two separate banks (one commercial and the other investment) prevent many investors from moving their capital from a less profitable investment to a more profitable one because it is simply too inconvenient. The result is that investment is not directed toward its most efficient end.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Demand and supply of capital investment would be met better if financial service companies were allowed to offer a full range of investment opportunities and commercial businesses were able to offer financial services. More investors would have access to a broader range of investment vehicles. Increased consumer selection would lead more individuals to make better choices in the investment methods they employ. And the increased competition would force financial service providers to improve the quality of their products and increase the efficiency with which they deliver those products to the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Decrease the cost of capital faced by American companies.</b> A more efficient allocation of investment would lead to a lower cost of capital. First, transaction costs would decrease. Transaction costs constitute a significant component of the cost of capital faced by companies in the American financial market. An integrated financial services system would enable a company to complete more financial transactions through a single broker-dealer, eliminating the need for duplicate paperwork and other such administrative expenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closely related to a decrease in transaction costs is a more efficient allocation of economic resources. Current financial regulations, by definition, obstruct the natural market flow of capital, thus creating an inefficient distribution system. Capital would be allocated more efficiently if unhindered by artificial government barriers. A more efficient delivery system would produce less expensive capital for American businesses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, a closer relationship between banks and commercial interests would form because banks would be both lenders and owners of companies. A financial service provider that owns stock in a company through the underwriting process has a stake in the success of that company and is more likely to work closely with the other owners to avoid bankruptcy. Large companies also would be able to carry a greater amount of debt (in relation to equity), which would lower the cost of capital because debt is usually less expensive than equities. The lower cost of debt would lead to a lower cost of capital.<sup>29</sup>  This, and the decreased risk of bankruptcy, would produce more stable companies and lower prices.
<p>

<b>THE MYTHS AND REALITY OF REFORM</b>
<p>
<b>MYTH: Independent insurance agents will be driven out of business.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: The future is not bright for independent insurance agents, even without significant financial modernization.</b> Technology has made it possible for insurance companies to sell policies directly to consumers without relying on distribution by agents. For example, some insurance companies are offering their services on the Internet. This technological bridge between producer and consumer makes the independent agent an expensive -- if not unnecessary -- intermediate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
True integrated financial service legislation would allow a single company to offer any financial or commercial service or, optionally, to affiliate with any financial or commercial entity. A "two-way street" would be created whereby commercial banks could begin to offer insurance products and insurance agents could provide banking services. Thus, insurance agents and bankers would be equally free to engage in a full range of financial services. Insurance agents, for this reason, and with the impetus of an otherwise bleak future, should support full deregulation so they can diversify their operations and increase their customer base.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Small local banks will be eliminated as large national financial service providers become more powerful.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Local banks will always have a place in the financial services industry.</b> The personal service and unique products they can provide will allow small banks to fill a market niche. A recent <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article highlighted the story of Catawba Valley Bank, a new local bank opened on November 1, 1995, in Hickory, North Carolina.<sup>30</sup>  The bank, which prides itself on individual attention and local investments, was launched by Steve Aaron, who left his job as an executive officer of a large statewide bank. The story of Catawba Valley is not unique: New U.S. bank charters rose to nearly 150 in 1995, almost 300 percent more than during the previous year.<sup>31</sup>  Clearly, there is a demand for local banks that can deal with customers in a personal manner. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, integrated financial service provision would give local banks the ability to offer more services to their customers, thus increasing their ability to survive. Just as General Motors and Ford are able to offset slow sales of luxury sedans with increased sales of all-purpose trucks or gas-efficient compacts, so would financial service providers be able to offset slow mortgage loan sales with increased mutual fund investments. The increased stability of integrated financial service provision benefits not only the financial institution itself, but also the consumers. A stable financial institution precludes the cost and inconvenience of changing financial vendors and opening new accounts.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Integrated banks will make risky investments with deposited money.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Economic theory and historic evidence both indicate that integrated financial service companies would make safe investments with deposited money or else pay a premium for risky activity.</b> Many investors are interested in earning a high rate of return on their deposits, and willing to accept the risk that accompanies the possibility of such a payoff. On the other hand, many investors seek a safe harbor for their funds (or at least a minimal portion of them) and prefer financial service providers that make only secure investments. And while safety-seeking investors cannot expect as high a rate of return on their deposits, they can be sure of the safety of their investments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This system is essentially a pricing system for financial services. It would operate just as the pricing of automobiles does. Buyers who want a safe car that gets good gas mileage are willing to pay more than somebody looking for the economy of a used motorcycle. The important point is that the market will deliver the services (in this case, financial investment tools) that consumers demand. And because many investors seek a secure harbor for at least part of their savings, the market will deliver financial service providers that make such secure investments possible. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The work of Kroszner and Rajan indicates that before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, commercial banks engaged in equity underwriting made more secure investments in larger businesses than did pure investment banks.<sup>32</sup>  Thus, banks free to invest in any manner they wished realized that their customers expected a degree of safety and therefore made relatively secure investments.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<b>RECENT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two major reform proposals were advanced during the first session of the 104th Congress. These bills represent the third time in the past five Congresses that repeal of financial service separation laws has been attempted. Compromise legislation failed in 1988 and 1991. Both of last year's proposals would amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 by allowing bank holding companies to affiliate with other financial service providers, although neither bill would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Jim Leach (R-IA), Chairman of the House Banking Committee, introduced H.R. 1062, the Financial Services Competitiveness Act of 1995, on February 27. Chairman Leach's bill would allow a "financial services holding company" to own both banking and investment affiliates. This would lead to a greater integration of commercial banking and investment banking. Chairman Leach's original bill would not have allowed a financial services holding company to own an insurance affiliate, however. Also, any holding company that currently has an insurance affiliate would be required to disassociate from that firm if it wanted to acquire a commercial bank. There would be no "two-way street" and no full integration of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second bill was introduced by Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY), Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Richard Baker (R-LA), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Depository Institution Affiliation Act (H.R. 814 as introduced by Representative Baker) would allow a commercial bank to affiliate with any other financial services company or commercial entity, including an insurance provider or an investment bank. The D'Amato-Baker proposal, because it would allow a greater range of affiliation, would lead to greater and more efficient integration of financial services than Representative Leach's bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The D'Amato-Baker bill presents a much purer approach to financial service integration by allowing affiliation among all financial and non-financial companies. It also would allow greater flexibility of affiliate interaction by creating fewer "firewalls" between a holding company's affiliates. For example, under Chairman Leach's bill, senior officers of one affiliate would be prohibited from simultaneously serving as senior officers of another. The D'Amato-Baker bill would extend no such restrictions. Also, and perhaps most important, the Leach bill would require holding companies themselves to be "adequately capitalized."  The D'Amato-Baker bill would place such capitalization restrictions only on insured depository affiliates.<sup>34</sup>  The overall greater freedoms allowed in the D'Amato-Baker proposal are vital first steps toward a free-market approach to integrated financial service provision. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Neither the Leach nor the Baker bill moved beyond the full Banking Committee in the House during 1995. The progress of both bills was stalled as representatives of the banking industry and the insurance industry failed to reach agreement on the integration of their services. This disagreement ultimately stalled all banking reform legislation. Senator D'Amato's bill was never marked up in committee as the Senate awaited action by the House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Supreme Court ruling in <I>Barnett Bank v. Nelson</I><sup>35</sup> clears the way for federal banks to sell insurance in small towns. The decision held that federal laws allowing such transactions pre-empt state laws preventing insurance sales by banks. The decision has given Chairman Leach the opportunity to push for significant reform again this year. Leach also has modified his bill to allow affiliation of banks and insurance companies, thus creating a more complete integration of financial services. However, the bill still has a number of weaknesses, including burdensome firewalls and the exclusion of non-financial commercial companies from the integration process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the new Leach bill (H.R. 2520) nor the D'Amato-Baker bill is perfect. Neither one would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial service provisions. Affiliations would allow greater efficiency but not complete freedom for financial service companies. True reform would use the D'Amato-Baker proposal as a transition to elimination of all restrictions on financial integration. 
<p>
 <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The financial service sector is the most ubiquitous sector of the modern American economy. Commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, securities trading markets, credit card providers, and other financial services are both the backbone of the commercial market and the fuel in the American economic engine. Every day, every American depends on the financial services sector to pay bills, purchase goods, pay for education, prepare for retirement, or create a business. For this reason, it is imperative that America secure an efficient and modern financial service system.

It is impossible to create such a system within the confines of the current statutory and regulatory structure, the guiding principles of which have not changed since the early 1930s. The impetus for change is made even stronger by the rapid pace of technological change. The current regulatory structure depends on being able clearly to define a bank, an insurance agent, and a security issue. But should a shopping mall-based ATM that can process loan applications be considered a bank?<sup>36</sup>  If so, how can a machine be accused of racial bias in its decisions?  Should an Internet World Wide Web site, through which anybody can apply for an insurance policy, be considered an agent?  And if so, how can one state regulate that web page, which is globally accessible?  Even if these questions are answered within the context of the current regulatory regime, they will be replaced by others. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The only solution is to sweep away the past 60 years of financial regulation and begin the process of market-oriented modernization. Current financial service regulations and the thinking they embody were misguided at their creation and are certainly misguided and outdated today. A free-market approach to financial deregulation also would benefit American consumers and businesses. More profitable investments would be available; capital would be easier to obtain, and its cost would be reduced; and the financial services sector would enjoy more stability and security. These advantages would resound through the economy every day as individual investors and companies took advantage of this more efficient and secure financial sector.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><p><ol><li>

<h3> THE ENTERPRISE RESOURCE BANK ACT: MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><br> 
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 451<br>
May 30, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Richard Baker (R-LA) recently introduced legislation to reform the Federal Home Loan Banking System. One day after Congressman Baker and 13 co-sponsors introduced the Enterprise Resource Bank Act of 1996 (H.R. 3167), the measure was approved unanimously by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The full House Banking Committee mark-up is expected soon. But although the problems of the Federal Home Loan Banking System need to be addressed, H.R. 3167 is a serious step in the wrong direction.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The structure of the Federal Home Loan Banking System, created in 1932, is similar to that of the Federal Reserve System. The 12 regional home loan banks (FHL Banks) provide long-term loans (known as "advances") to member savings institutions, which are required to collateralize the advances with residential mortgages. The purpose of the Federal Home Loan Bank System has been to provide a ready source of long-term mortgages to home buyers. While privately owned and operated, the FHL Banks are considered government-sponsored enterprises because of their federal origin and public responsibilities, and because their obligations are considered implicitly guaranteed by the federal government.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
While this system made sense many years ago, the creation and subsequent growth of a secondary mortgage market, along with the emergence of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), has made the mission of the FHL Banks obsolete. As a result, the FHL Banks increasingly have begun to move into new activities, including the purchase of securitized mortgages (often from the other government-sponsored enterprises).

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
H.R. 3167 would give the FHL Banks a new and questionable mission. They would be renamed Enterprise Resource Banks, but would continue to operate largely within the same regulatory structure as the one within which the FHL Banks now operate. However, the new banks would enjoy a greatly expanded scope of operation. The newly constituted Enterprise Resource Banks would not be limited to mortgage-collateralized advances. They also could provide advances for small business loans, economic development project loans, and rural development project loans.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Although well-intentioned, H.R. 3167 is the wrong way to reform the FHLB System. Among the problems:<ul>

<p><li>Enterprise Resource Banks would enjoy an unfair advantage over their private counterparts. It is widely held that bonds issued by FHL Banks are insured by the federal government. This is because the FHL Banks serve a perceived public interest, and taxpayers likely would be required to foot the bill were the banks to default on their loan obligations. This implicit guarantee allows FHL Banks to raise funds in the capital markets at a lower cost than private companies. Currently, this advantage is limited to the mortgage lending market. However, H.R. 3167 would expand the FHL Banks' advantage into other markets. In fact, some analysts believe the only market prohibited by the bill to Enterprise Resource Banks would be large commercial loans to suburban businesses.<sup>1</sup>  Private financial service companies in every other market would be faced with increased competition from advantaged, publicly supported Enterprise Resource Bank members.

<p><li>H.R. 3167 would create an increasingly powerful and deleterious government presence in the capital markets. The FHL Banks already are the third-largest borrowers in the nation, trailing only the Department of the Treasury and Fannie Mae. By enlarging the theater of FHL Bank operations, H.R. 3167 would increase the share of the capital market effectively controlled by the federal government. As Enterprise Resource Banks moved into new markets, they might be able to dominate those markets easily because of their advantageous position, granted by implicit federal guarantee against default. They would quickly become the "800 pound gorilla" of the capital markets. Thus, federal statutes and regulations, rather than the free market, increasingly would determine the allocation of credit.

<p><li>Federal Home Loan Banks are not experienced in the proposed new areas of responsibility. FHL Banks have been limited to mortgage-collateralized advances for the past 60 years. Moreover, until 1989 FHL Banks were limited to serving savings and loans. It was only with passage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 that other financial institutions were able to apply for FHLB advances. H.R. 3167 would expand the nature of advances that Enterprise Resource Banks could make, as well as the structure of financial institutions that could apply for these advances. But such a broad step is like allowing an airline pilot to navigate a cruise ship. FHL Banks simply do not have the experience to advance broadly collateralized funds to various financial service providers, and H.R. 3167 does not give them specific guidance in these matters. Moreover, many of the new responsibilities, such as providing small business and community development loans, already are carried out by other federal programs. The new responsibilities of the Enterprise Resource Banks would duplicate these programs, most of which are themselves in need of serious reform.

<p><li>Taxpayers would incur increased risk. These problems would increase taxpayer exposure to risk if the new Enterprise Resource system were to fail. Because the system would remain a government-sponsored enterprise providing some public services, it is unlikely that the federal government would allow the Enterprise Resource Banks to fail. Taxpayers would be forced to pay the bill in the event of such a failure. Increasing the scope of the system's operations increases not only the potential size of such a bailout, but also its likelihood.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of finding new and duplicative responsibilities for the FHL Banks, Congress and the President should privatize the banks and allow them to restructure as necessary, outside the umbrella of taxpayer protection. Privatization of the FHL Banks has broad support from experts, the banking industry, and the Administration. Indeed, in a letter to Representative Jim Leach (R-IA), chairman of the House Banking Committee, the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, John D. Hawke, states that privatization is a better answer to the problems of the FHL Banks than increasing their theater of operations.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
If Congress truly wants to help distressed areas and increase the availability of credit, it should act to modernize the financial services sector by deregulating it. Representative Baker already has introduced legislation (H.R. 814) that would begin to do this. Allowing commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks and other commercial and financial companies would increase the availability of credit for consumers and the investment opportunities for all businesses, including those in distressed areas. On the other hand, H.R. 3167 would raise the level of government involvement in the credit markets. Rather than help distressed areas, this would place taxpayers of all income levels at a greater risk.

<h2>Taking a Byte out of Disability</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While cleaning up the hard disk on my computer recently, I came 
across an accessory that I had never noticed before called "Text to Speech." Intrigued, I opened it and 
discovered that my relatively low-end computer could convert standard text files into speech. It can read 
aloud whatever I wish, from a brief newspaper column to a massive document.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The voice sounds very much like the one you hear throughout A Brief 
History of Time, a movie based on the book by scientist Stephen Hawking. Struck down by a debilitating 
illness that robbed him of speech and most of his mobility, Hawking has nevertheless become the world's 
most celebrated physicist and cosmologist. His extraordinary accomplishments were made possible by 
technologies that allow him to operate a computer -- and even, through it, to speak to movie audiences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's amazing to me is not that such technologies exist, but that they 
are so commonplace as to be installed in a run-of-the-mill personal computer like mine. In fact, 
inexpensive programs and devices have dramatically expanded the economic opportunities of disabled 
Americans, not only improving their own lives but allowing all of us to benefit from previously untapped 
talents and resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mark Beckwith of Greenville, Maine, is a quadriplegic. But he is also a 
draftsman for the Log Home Co., thanks to innovative products from a Massachusetts firm called Dragon 
Systems. For less than a thousand dollars, you can purchase DragonDictate and run sophisticated computer 
programs by voice. The system converts each word it hears into text by piecing together the word's 
components and then comparing the combination with acoustic models in its built-in vocabulary list. By 
speaking key commands such as "Shift-Alt-F4," the user can operate spreadsheets, word processors, and 
even the drafting programs that Beckwith uses to design house-building plans.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other low-cost computer devices that aid disabled users include screen-
magnification software ($200 to $600), Braille-output printers and translators ($2,100 to $4,000), and 
head-pointer or Morse-code systems that allow severely disabled people to issue computer commands 
($500 to $1,400).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Toward the opposite end of the cost scale is another product that helps 
quadriplegics accomplish tasks, called EyeGaze. Developed by LC Technologies in Fairfax, Virginia, it 
allows users to turn on appliances, run machinery, type letters, and play video games with eye movements. 
The device uses beams of light to translate movements into computer commands. Even at a price of 
$25,000, EyeGaze offers many seriously disabled people opportunities they never thought they had.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The market for products to enable physically handicapped workers -- 
ranging from speech synthesis and voice-input systems to robotics, deaf relays, Braille text displays, text 
telephones, monitoring devices, and environmental controls -- includes such major players as IBM, AT&T, 
Xerox, Nynex, Digital Equipment, and Apple. Thought of more broadly, products ranging from 
pharmaceuticals to ergonomic office furniture are also part of this effort to empower the disabled. Prozac 
and other antidepressants have helped many workers keep their jobs and improve their performance. Pain 
relievers allow employees with arthritis and similar ailments to perform work without enduring 
excruciating pain. Redesigned desks, chairs, and other equipment have done the same for those with 
chronic back problems, who make up about 15 percent of all people considered "disabled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many observers who have taken notice of American businesses' 
interest in this market have attributed it to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), enacted in 1990 and 
fully implemented in 1994. The ADA, among other things, requires businesses with 15 or more employees 
to give "equal access" to all disabled workers and consumers. Portrayed as a civil-rights measure no less 
important than the 1960s legislation against racial discrimination, the ADA may have attracted the 
attention of some firms that otherwise wouldn't have entered the market for disabled-enabling products. 
But its overall effect on the employability of the disabled is a great deal more complicated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For one thing, the ADA has mainly affected not hiring but firing. In its 
first two years, about half of all ADA claims involved alleged wrongful discharges, while only 12 percent 
charged discrimination in hiring disabled workers. In one case, a senior executive with terminal brain 
cancer who had been fired was awarded $222,000 because his employer could not prove in court that he 
was unable to perform the essential functions of his job. In all too many cases, it appears, workers 
discharged for a variety of reasons have added the ADA to their other legal means of obtaining large 
severance payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Second, the targeted beneficiaries of the ADA include very few of the 
seriously disabled Americans that both proponents and opponents of the law tend to talk about. About half 
a million Americans are wheelchair bound, but almost 50 million Americans are considered "disabled" for 
the purposes of the ADA. They include those with relatively minor physical or mental infirmities. And they 
make up the vast majority of plaintiffs in ADA lawsuits alleging wrongful termination.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Third, the ADA may actually hinder rather than advance opportunities 
for disabled workers. It's harder to prove discrimination in hiring than wrongful termination -- that's why 
lawsuits alleging the latter are so much more common. Rather than face the potential legal consequences of 
letting a disabled worker go, even for perfectly appropriate reasons, some employers may well want to 
limit their exposure to such suits by not hiring the disabled in the first place, accepting the risk of 
noncompliance on the hiring side in order to avoid the much greater risk of wrongful termination suits. 
And their caution may be vindicated by the rash of spurious ADA claims by people claiming to be disabled 
by obesity, kleptomania, sex addiction, severe body odor, and "multiple chemical sensitivity." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is that efforts to expand opportunities for disabled people far 
predates the ADA. The term "disabled" is itself relative, meaningful only according to the tasks one wants 
to perform and the technology available to help one do so. We now have more people living with physical 
and mental infirmities than ever before. In the past, those born with birth defects often didn't make it past 
infancy. Injuries that today lead to loss of limbs or motor control used to be deadly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On the other hand, the number of people who are functionally disabled, 
especially as it relates to employment, is surely lower. For most of human history, persons lacking nimble 
fingers or strong backs had little prospect of making a living. The advent of farm implements and simple 
devices such as looms increased the number of people who could perform work quickly and easily, thus 
increasing the standard-of-living for all. Similarly, until the invention of eyeglasses, an enormous number 
of human beings became virtually unemployable at an early age.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thanks to modern machinery and appliances, many jobs no longer 
require great physical strength and endurance. Now, the Information Age promises to expand the 
boundaries of human potential even further, as the mind -- not the body -- becomes the most valuable asset 
a worker or entrepreneur can bring to the marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is true even for the hardest cases. Researchers at Rutgers and 
Princeton universities have found that computers have significantly enhanced job opportunities and 
boosted earnings for many people with spinal-cord injuries. The researchers found that, all else held equal, 
people who have computer skills at the time of their injuries generally return to work more quickly than 
those without such skills. They also discovered that disabled workers with computer skills suffer no 
disparity in pay versus their counterparts without disabilities, while those without such skills do get paid 
less.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Modern computer technologies are mostly the product of competitive 
private markets, not government programs or regulations. By decisively shifting the source of economic 
value to ideas and away from physical exertion, computers and other information technologies have helped 
Americans with serious disabilities far more than has the ADA. Indeed, while the percentage of the 
disabled who are employed rose, especially among women, in the 20 years preceding the passage of the 
law, it has since leveled off. The National Organization on Disabilities studied the issue in 1986 and again 
in 1994, finding that the percentage of working disabled stayed roughly the same, given the margin of 
sampling error: 33 percent in 1986 versus 31 percent in 1994. Of course, there could be many explanations 
for this, but as Brian Doherty of Reason magazine concluded, "there is certainly no evidence, despite all 
the costs, that the ADA has helped" the disabled gain employment.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Private firms have incentives to develop, manufacture, and market 
products to empower disabled workers regardless of government regulation. There is already significant 
consumer demand for these items. The disabled want them to improve their own prospects and quality of 
life. And their potential employers have an incentive to create jobs for the most talented and hard-working 
individuals. Long before the advent of the ADA, companies such as Du Pont and Marriott discovered that 
efficiently accommodating the needs of disabled workers can boost performance and employee morale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Many employees with disabilities have really overcome many 
obstacles to being successfully employed and have shown lots of perseverance and creativity in showing 
how a job can be done," says Lana Smart of the National Center for Disability Services.
Indeed, there is an important qualitative difference between the way regulators approach workplace 
disability and the way private firms and individuals do. For regulators, the disabled represent a cost that 
must be imposed on unwilling businesses. In the private market for labor, however, finding ways to 
unleash the creative talents of the disabled can yield significant returns for firms, workers, and consumers. 
The disabled are viewed as potentially valuable assets, rather than potentially costly liabilities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It may be true that some severely disabled individuals cannot be 
profitably employed today, because the costs of doing so exceed the value of the work they can do. But 
they used to think that about the nearsighted, the slender-bodied, and the club-footed. It must not be 
forgotten that people have always found ways to eliminate those barriers to employment, without the 
prodding of government regulators.

<h2>Charlotte, the Queen of Southern Banking</h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/staff/hood.htm">John Hood</a></b>
</CENTER>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, the Texas banking industry seemed like a sure winner. The oil industry 
was booming. The state's population was growing rapidly as workers came in search of Sun-Belt 
prosperity. Major Texas-based manufacturing and retail enterprises burgeoned. Not surprisingly, 
some of the fastest-growing U.S. banks were located in bustling Houston and Dallas.
<p>
	But then the bottom fell out of gas prices -- and the banking industry. By 1990, the state's 
largest banks no longer existed, resulting in billions of dollars in bad loans and leaving bank 
customers confused and angry. Suddenly, the dominant players in the state's banking industry 
were those that hailed from faraway places like North Carolina and Ohio.
<p>
	It was not pleasant to be a bank customer in Texas back then. If you were a depositor in a 
bank that collapsed, you may have gotten all or part of your money back from the FDIC -- but 
you lost other things, such as convenience and a sense of security. If you owned a small business 
and badly needed a loan to expand, the picture looked even bleaker. Failing banks aren't likely to 
lend you money or cut you slack when you need it most.
<p>
	Other states have seen downturns in their dominant industries without suffering the double-
whammy of bank failures. The difference is government regulation. Until recently, Texas 
imposed strict geographical and size restrictions on its banks. Statewide branching was 
prohibited. These regulatory barriers kept Texas banks tethered to particular cities or regions, 
protecting them from competition and giving them little incentive to embrace innovation and 
serve consumers better. Lacking the diversification necessary to weather the oil glut of the 1980s, 
the state's banks either went under, saw the value of their equity drop, or were bought by 
stronger banks from more competitive, less regulated markets.
<p>
	One such market was Charlotte, North Carolina, home to NationsBank and First Union, two 
of the nation's 10 largest banks. At first glance, the idea that Charlotte would be one of 
America's leading financial centers seems absurd. With one-fifth the population of Houston, 
Charlotte has no obvious advantages in commercial influence or financial acumen. Yet Charlotte 
has become the banking capital of the Southeast. And NationsBank has become the largest bank 
in Texas.

<P>
	A major reason for the ascension of North Carolina banks to the upper tier of the industry is, 
once again, regulation. The state has some of the least restrictive bank regulations in the country. 
The state legislature authorized statewide branching in 1814; at the beginning of this century, the 
state began to charter banks and allowed them to sell insurance and other financial services. In 
the following decades, banks in the largest cities established branches across the state and began 
selling such products as annuities, commercial insurance, and securities.
<p>
	By the 1980s, a bank customer in North Carolina enjoyed many benefits unavailable to his 
peers in Texas. He could transact business with the same bank virtually anywhere in the state, 
which accelerated routine tasks such as clearing checks, depositing funds, and seeking balance 
information. He could purchase more services at lower cost than in Texas, because statewide 
banks can spread fixed administrative expenses over more branches and customers and can hire 
more experienced bankers. He was much more likely to have access to national ATM networks 
and bank credit cards with low interest rates. Most importantly, he had security. With a 
diversified loan portfolio and depositor base, his bank was less dependent on the economic health 
of dominant local industries.
<p>
	The benefits of competition in banking have become increasingly clear. In 1960, the year that 
NCNB (NationsBank's predecessor) was created from the merger of two small banks, North 
Carolina was one of 16 states with statewide branching. Over the next 20 years, there were only 
17 bank failures in those states, compared with 45 failures in the states that allowed limited 
regional branching and 66 failures in the states that prohibited branching altogether. 
<p>
	During the 1980s, a combination of economic turmoil and bad policy decisions created even 
more banking risk. In the first four years of the decade, more than 500 savings-and-loans and 
almost 200 commercial banks failed. Then things got worse. In 1988 alone, 200 banks and 233 
savings-and-loans closed or were liquidated. Most failures occurred in highly regulated states.
<p>
	By 1990, most states had figured out what North Carolina already knew: Competition is better 
than protection. Only three states continued to prohibit branching, while 33 allowed it statewide. 
Furthermore, Texas and other states dropped their longtime aversion to interstate banking and 
allowed banks in nearby states to acquire failing institutions.
<p>
	For banks in North Carolina (as well as in Ohio, New York, and California) that were bred in 
fiercely competitive statewide markets, even this limited form of interstate banking represented a 
golden opportunity. NCNB went into Florida in 1981, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland in 
1986, and Texas in 1988. A subsequent merger with C&S/Sovran in Virginia created 
NationsBank, which continued to enter new markets in the Southeast, most recently 
consolidating its position in Georgia by acquiring Bank South.
<p>	
Charlotte's other big bank, First Union, has also pursued numerous acquisitions in the new era of 
interstate banking. Most recently, it purchased First Fidelity Bancorp, making it the largest bank 
in New Jersey and sixth largest in the U.S.
<p>
	The First Fidelity deal illustrates why competition and interstate banking have much to offer 
consumers. As with statewide branching, interstate banking makes it easier for customers to do 
routine things. Travelers to another state can often bank at their own institution, which is usually 
cheaper and easier. Checks clear faster and are accepted at more businesses. Firms with 
operations in various states can work with a familiar institution rather than learning new rules 
and developing new relationships every time they expand. And according to economist Steven 
Horwitz of St. Lawrence University, both business and residential borrowers find it easier to get 
credit. "Banks in states with more liberal branching laws use a greater proportion of their 
resources for loans than do banks in states that limit branching," he says.
<p>
	For Garden State customers, the differences will be immediately noticeable, say banking 
analysts. "First Union, Nationsbank, and Wachovia [another major N.C. bank] offer customer 
service that is clearly superior" to the New Jersey norm, says Anthony Davis of Dean Witter 
Reynolds. Many New Jersey banks still close at 3 p.m., and few offer customers automated 
systems for checking balances or conducting transactions by telephone. With the arrival of First 
Union, New Jersey's mutual-fund investors can also enjoy one-stop shopping at their local bank.
<p>
	Of course, bigger is not necessarily better. It is competition, not size per se, that has allowed 
banks in less regulated markets to serve their customers better. Although North Carolina has 
fewer separate banking institutions per capita than most states, its competitive climate allows 
plenty of mid-sized and small banks to continue to battle successfully with large banks for 
market share across the state. 
<p>
	"I think community banking will always have a future because a number of people want to be 
known by name," says Bill Graham, the former banking commissioner of North Carolina. By 
identifying niche markets and improving customer service, home-grown banks in such states as 
Texas and Florida have thrived even as out-of-state banks have moved in. Post Oak Bank in 
Houston, for example, specializes in private banking and trust services for middle- and upper-
income professionals. "We felt the five big banks would be very dominant in the mass retail 
market," says chairman Kent Anderson, "but we felt opportunities existed to work the personal-
services business."
<p>
	Actually, the best way to keep community banking healthy may well be to push for even more 
deregulation. Sidney Bostian, former chairman and CEO of Investors Savings Bank, the   
second-largest thrift in Virginia, says that community banks are hurt most  by costly state and 
federal regulatory burdens and by high taxes and fees, because larger competitors can spread 
such costs over a greater number of workers and customers. "While consolidation is a desirable 
outcome in our banking system," Bostian says, "policymakers should take care not to create 
artificial incentives for bank mergers."
<p>
	In 1994, Congress extended interstate banking across the U.S. to speed the development of 
interstate branching, which means even more convenience for consumers. Paul Calem, senior 
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, argues that interstate branching would 
also "enhance competition in banking, benefiting consumers through more favorable interest 
rates and fees."
<p>
	But some people never learn. Despite the benefits of banking freedom, Texas and a few other 
states may opt out of interstate branching, as the federal law allows. For the most part, though, 
bank customers everywhere are starting to enjoy the benefits of competition that states like North 
Carolina have long produced. And improbable Charlotte, not Dallas or Houston, is likely to 
remain the financial powerhouse of the South.

<p>
It was a horrible tragedy, as much for the mental images it generated as for the death toll. On September 3, 1991, at around 8 a.m., a fire broke out at a chicken plant in Hamlet, North Carolina.  As the grease fire started on a chicken fryer and spread quickly inside the Imperial Foods Products building, workers tried desperately to escape the smoke and flames, clawing at locked exit doors in panic. Twenty-five Imperial employees didn't make it. Fifty-six more were injured in the blaze. The event made national headlines and attracted everyone from network news reporters to Jesse Jackson, who visited in an attempt to link the chicken-plant tragedy to the national civil-rights movement. "I see the same faces here that I saw in Memphis, Tennessee, with Dr. [Martin Luther] King," he said. "Just basic, humble people who want to work and get a fair day's wages for a fair day's work."<p>
Furious voices denounced state and federal safety inspectors, as well as the state's business community. During 1992 and 1993, the Hamlet fire became the cause clbre of politicians and activists seeking tougher workplace-safety laws in Congress, including a greatly expanded Occupational Safety and Health Administration and new mandates on businesses. As Hamlet became a national symbol for corporate irresponsibility in workplace safety, one small but significant detail escaped the notice of many in Congress and the media. Those exit doors that sealed the deathtrap had been ordered closed and locked by the federal government.<p>
The problem with the Imperial plant, a U.S. Department of Agriculture poultry inspector had said the previous June, was flies. "Both doors at the [trash] compactor was [sic] open when I arrived at 8:45 p.m.," the inspector wrote in a deficiency report. "Several flies [were] observed in all areas of the plant." Imperial's response, also written into the deficiency report, was to promise that the outside doors "will be kept locked." The inspector verified that corrective action had taken place.<p>
Imperial Foods was hardly blameless in the tragedyvarious safety problems existed at the time of the firebut heavy-handed government regulation was also partly responsible. The chicken plant was one of the few employers in a poor, rural community. It ran on a very thin margin, using an old building and struggling every week to keep production going. Installing state-of-the-art alarm doors at the side and rear of the plant was an expensive proposition. When forced by federal edict to make a tradeoff between food quality and worker safety, plant managers chose the former, with disastrous results.<p>
Fast forward to 1995. A new Republican majority in Congress, intent on balancing the federal budget, has targeted the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for cuts. In an attempt to defend OSHA, the Clinton administration announced a plan in May to make compliance less onerous to business and to judge safety inspectors on the basis of safety records for companies they oversee, not on the number of citations they write. "This is the new face of OSHA," said Elaine Kamarck, senior policy advisor for Vice President Gore and director of his "reinventing government" initiative.<p>
But a Congress committed not only to budget savings but also to sound policymaking should go far beyond redesigning OSHA's inspection program or, as some GOP lawmakers have suggested, simply cutting its budget in half. There is no need for the federal government to inspect American workplaces, issue regulations, and fine employers for violating federal safety rules, and the attempt to do so has accomplished virtually nothing for American workers except burden their employers with regulations.<p>
A 1991 study by Wayne B. Gray of the National Bureau of Economic Research found that OSHA regulations have "significantly reduced productivity growth in the U.S.," even more than those from the Environmental Protection Agency. Some OSHA standards have put a search for completely risk-free workplaces above common sense. Benzene standards, for example, have cost firms and consumers $23 million per life saved; arsenic standards, $24 million. Standards for asbestos, EDB, and formaldehyde have also cost many millions of dollars per life saved. These huge sums might better be spent publicly or privately on other measures that save lives at dramatically lower costs. Screening programs for cervical and colon cancer, for example, cost about $50,000 per life saved, while measures to increase highway safetysuch as improving lighting, upgrading guard rails, installing median barriers, and improving bridgescost between $100,000 and $200,000 per life saved.<p>
OSHA has required employers to label machines and substances at the workplace with little regard for reason or significant risk. Dr. Michael Segal, of Harvard Medical School, reports that OSHA regulators have ordered suppliers of many of his laboratories' chemicals to label them as workplace hazards, including sodium chloride (table salt): "WARNING: CAUSES IRRITATION. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, or clothing. Avoid breathing dust. Wash thoroughly after handling." Similarly, another chemical's label provides a "Waste Disposal Method: Dissolve or mix the material with a combustible solvent and burn in a chemical incinerator equipped with an afterburner and scrubber. Observe all federal, state, and local environmental regulations." The hazardous material in question, Dr. Segal says, is candle wax.<p>
This year, OSHA will spend about $300 million and send out some 2,000 inspectors across the country. As large as this effort is, its main task is even larger: to inspect 6 million workplaces with 93 million employees. On average, a company can expect to see an OSHA inspector once every 10 years. Even doubling or tripling the number of inspectors, in other words, wouldn't accomplish very much if the means of ensuring worker safety is to be workplace inspection. No doubt when OSHA was created in 1970, with the strong backing of labor unions, the impossibility of its task wasn't yet evident.<p>
In a smaller, performance-oriented, "reengineered"  federal government, OSHA would survive only as an advisory agency, or perhaps wouldn't survive at all. Its role in promoting worker safety has been and will always be dwarfed by private-sector incentives. Companies make bad decisions on occasion, of course, sometimes endangering the safety of their workers. But as the Hamlet case shows, so do regulators. The difference is that companies pay an economic price for their mistakes.<p><center><b>The Workplace Safety Record</b></center><p>
The Hamlet fire, and a few other workplace disasters, are tragic and make good copy or news footage, but they tell us virtually nothing about worker safety in the United States. And the reality is that worker safety has been improving for decades. Companies have undertaken massive campaigns of training, coordination, technological investment, and management innovation to realize tremendous safety gains. Businesses have huge incentives to promote safety, such as lost productivity and workers' compensation or liability insurance costs, that swamp the prospect of regulatory violations. They have found that safe workers are happy workers, and happy workers are productive ones.<p>
Northern Indiana Public Service Company's Dean H. Mitchell Generating Station is far more typical of corporate America's record on safety than Imperial Foods. Each year, all employees must attend two safety-education classes. In addition, the plant holds weekly "safety tailgate sessions" with all its workers to discuss specific safety topics. Accidents and "near-misses" prompt an intensive incident review, whose results are discussed at weekly safety sessions. Workers and managers alike think of safety not as a program but as a process. The plant's motto typifies everyone's commitment: "Safety, Pride, Teamwork." "We were able to make significant strides by having our employees buy into our cause," says J.N. Kocsis, personnel and safety supervisor at the Mitchell station. In just 10 years, from 1982 to 1992, the rate of accidents at the plant fell by 57 percent.<p>
Nationally, the number of people injured annually, at work and home combined, fell by 15 percent from 1970 to 1990, with most of the decrease occurring during the 1980s. Accidental deaths show an even steeper decline; both the rate and the actual number of deaths have been falling for more than 60 years. The number of workplace accidental deaths fell from about 20,000 in the 1930s to less than 10,000 in 1993. Factoring in population growth, the National Safety Council reports that accidental-death rates at work fell from 15.8 to 3.5 per 100,000 peoplea 78 percent drop. Measures of specific hazards also show a steady downward trend. In just the 10 years from 1983 to 1992, the number of firefighters and civilians killed by smoke and flames fell by 34 percent and 20 percent respectively. <p>
Accidental-death rates may well be a better overall guide of safety trends than reports of all injuries and illnesses. There is good reason to believe that the latter may understate safety gains because companies, workers, and individuals have become more likely to report accidents and injuries over time. <p>
These safety gains can't be attributed to regulatory efforts on the part of federal, state, and local governments. Accidental deaths at work adjusted by population, declined at roughly the same rate before and after the passage of the 1970 Occupational Health and Safety Act.<p>
One way to think about the relative efforts of government and business in the safety arena is this: On any given day in America, thousands of local, state, and national safety regulators are inspecting businesses, studying test data, issuing regulations, and adjudicating violations. <p>
But on that same day, millions of American workers, managers, designers, and engineers are working to make their workplaces safer, to maximize sales and revenues, minimize losses, and maintain good, long-term relationships with productive employees. The magnitude of private-sector safety efforts, both in time and money spent, far exceeds that of even today's bloated regulatory bureaucracy.<p>
Safety gains have occurred across the economy, from highway fatalities to child poisonings, but it is at the workplace, over which businesses have greater direct control, where safety gains have been the largest. While accidents still happen and some jobs remain more dangerous than others, there have been very few years in the past six decades in which workplace accidental deaths have risen rather than fallen. To understand why firms might spend a great deal of time and money improving worker safety, you must first get a clear picture of how costly it is to have a serious accident in a workplace.<p>
There are two main private-sector "regulators" of occupational safety. The first is the labor market itself. In the market for workers, perceptions of risk have a significant impact on the wages employees demand. If a profession or individual business is known to be unsafe, potential workers will want more salary or benefits to compensate for the higher risk. Even if workers don't know going in how dangerous a particular workplace is, their subsequent discovery can cost firms a bundle. For example, when a business loses a proficient worker in an accident, even for a relatively short time, that worker must be replaced with a new one, often needing training. The injured employees' coworkers also reappraise their own job risks, sometimes resulting in higher wage demands. The firm's hiring and training costs rise again if disaffected workers quit. The resulting turmoil can wreak havoc on production, costing the firm sales.<p>
The safety risks posed by businesses differ dramatically, but studies have estimated that the labor market adds an average risk premium of about $1,000 to each worker's salarymeaning that, on average, workers demand $1,000 more in salary than they otherwise would to compensate them for the workplace risks they perceive. Finding ways to reduce that cost is clearly a desirable goal for any business, large or smalland keep in mind that this $1,000 is only the mean. Some firms face very high risk premiums and save a lot of money from even modest safety improvements. Occupations such as logging, meat-packing, mining, and construction continue to pose a higher-than-average risk of injury. For these occupations, says Duke University economist Kip Viscusi, "the marketplace generates enormous wage premiums for risk on the order of $80 billion a year in terms of higher wagesthat's where firms get their financial incentive for safety."<p>
In the search for safety gains, employers have a strong ally: the insurance industry. By law, most employers must have workers' compensation insurance for their employees, but can purchase their coverage from the private insurer of their choice. The workers' comp system is at least partially "experience rated"; that is, the premiums bear some relationship to a business's rate of accidents. Firms that find ways to cut their accident rates pay lower insurance premiums. Insurers who help their subscribers cut accident rates and costs are more likely to keep their customers in the future. So both business managers and insurance underwriters have huge financial incentives to improve workplace safety (although unwise state regulation still keeps the system less efficient and safety-promoting than it could be). "If you're a good company with a good safety record, insurance companies are knocking on your door for your business," says Steve Reynolds, safety supervisor at Crowder Construction Company in Charlotte, North Carolina. Many workers' comp insurers employ armies of consultants, engineers, and designers to help their subscribers reduce accident rates and cut the costs of claims.<p>
The cost of mandated workers' compensation coverage on American business skyrocketed during the latter half of the 1980s, not so much because of an actual increase in danger at the workplace, but because of federal court decisions liberalizing eligibility requirements. Workers found it easier to file claims, while state governments made mandatory benefit levels more generous. The result was a surge in workers' claims, pushing the total bill for workers' compensation insurance to $70 billion a year. While this development had many negative consequences for economic growth, particularly for states with higher benefit levels, it also meant that the insurance market became more competitive than ever, as American companies sought ways to cut down of one of their most explosive labor costs.<p>
Compared with the risk premium imposed on firms by the labor market and workers' comp premiums imposed by insurers, the prospect of being fined by OSHA is almost laughably tiny in dollar value. Average OSHA fines per U.S. worker were about 50 cents in the early 1990sup from 35 cents in 1983 but below the peak of 65 cents in 1978, according to Duke's Viscusi. Considering that the likelihood of being inspected, much less found in violation, is low in a given year, these fines obviously play little to no role in business decisions about safety. Increasing OSHA inspection or increasing fines aren't likely to change that underlying economic calculation very much. <p>	<b><center>Gains Through Innovation</b></center>
<p>
Innovative and responsible companies and insurers have spent years learning how to reduce safety-related costs by reengineering workplaces, training employees, and using new technologies. Even small changes can reap big rewards. Take Rosendin Electric, Inc., a San Jose, California-based electrical contractor. Linda Johnson, Rosendin's benefits administrator, says that when she first came to the company in 1991, it wasn't tracking workers' compensation costs in an efficient manner. Rates of accident frequency and severity were soaring to worrisome levels.<p>
Teaming up with the firm's safety director and risk manager, Johnson employed a new computer software package to track the type and total number of injuries, as well as dollars being spent in premiums. She found that approximately 50 percent of total claim costs were for back- and eye-related injuries. Back injuries alone were costing the company an average of $15,000 to $20,000 for each instance. "Many of the injuries could have been prevented if they'd been tracked effectively," Johnson says.<p>
Supplied with up-to-date reports on how and where accidents were happening, Rosendin managers were able to find their biggest risks and address them. The company started a program to train workers about the importance of back-support belts (providing them to the workers for free) and how to work with the least amount of stress on the back. Rosendin managers also found that a major cause of eye injuries was that workers weren't wearing their safety glasses when they needed to. Much of the company's work was done on high ladders, but safety glasses were needed only some of the time. Workers ended up leaving the glasses at the bottom of the ladder rather than balance them precariously at the top, but then didn't bother to climb all the way down to retrieve the glasses when their use was warranted. "Employees needed something to keep their glasses around their necks when they weren't wearing them," Johnson explains. A simple solution followed: Each pair of glasses was equipped with a cord to go around a worker's neck. That one seemingly minor action reduced eye injuries by 20 percent. Between October 1992 and October 1993, Rosendin workers' comp claims decreased in frequency by 35 percent. The severity rate fell by 10 percent, and the company saved 27 percent in claims.<p>
Subaru-Isuzu Automotive found another simple way to achieve safety gains at its Lafayette, Indiana, plant. Twice a day for five minutes, all employees are encouraged to participate in group exercise workouts. Twisting to workout standards like the theme from Rocky, employees stretch their arms, legs, necks, and backs before beginning work assembling cars, moving materials, or even typing on computers. New employees also learn about exercise and physical exertion during their two-week orientations. Of 80 hours of orientation, 45 hours are devoted to physical training. Employees participate in various exercises depending upon their upcoming responsibilities in the plant. In-house physical therapists coordinate these programs, and more than pay for themselves in reduced workers' compensation costs, say Subaru-Isuzu officials. "Our goal is to prevent injuries," says Mark Siwiec, manager of safety and environmental compliance. "If injuries do occur, however, they should be less severe."<p>
Other companies have found similar results from modest changes in operation or training. When too many AT&T workers were getting injured working on telephone poles, the company started a "pole-climbing school" to teach the three-point contact methodmeaning that workers should keep three limbs touching the pole at all times. Once AT&T workers mastered the method, accident rates fell. Similarly, Coca-Cola Bottling Group cut accident rates among its truck operators by instituting warm-up exercises, improving interior lighting in company trailers, adding more trailer hand grips, and lowering the trailers two inches to make it easier for workers to pull out the cases of drinks.<p>
LSG/Sky Chefs, an in-flight caterer based in Arlington, Texas, has realized significant safety gains by experimenting with financial incentives. In the late 1980s, the firm was logging 1,000 injuries a year and losing more than 18,000 workdaysthis at a company with 8,000 employees. Sky Chefs kitchen workers were constantly straining their backs lifting heavy objects, an injury that costs $25,000 in workers' comp claims on average. <p>
New president Michael Kay introduced a safety program in 1991 to address the problem. Employees were taught how to lift objects without back strain. Kitchen workers got a weekly five-minute "safety short" taught by one of their coworkers. And the firm began offering financial rewards to workers with good safety habits. Supervisors passed out $20 Sears gift certificates to employees who lifted or cut in an exemplary way or who took the initiative to clean up a spill. Supervisors, in turn, saw their own compensation change to make safety a priority. A quarter of their bonus was tied to their unit's safety record. These and other changes helped reduce lost workdays at Sky Chefs to 8,500 in 1993 and about 5,000 in 1994. Focusing on rewards rather than punishments was the key to the new program's success, says Kay. "Our old approach was called the Stop program. It was designed to catch employees doing something wrong. This one's had a remarkably better effect."<p>	<b><center>Insurers Play Role</b></center>
<p>
Some of the most sizable gains in workplace safety have take place in recent years under the tutelage of insurance companies. Insurance broker Johnson & Higgins, for example, helped one of its clients, a book publisher, set up a worker safety program that included routine monitoring, goal setting, active involvement by management, strategic planning, and bonuses tied to safety performance. The publisher had seen its accident rate rise and its workers' comp costs shoot up by 41 percent from 1987 to 1990. After Johnson & Higgins helped the company install its new safety program, workers' comp claims dropped by 35 percent and dollar losses by 63 percent the first year. Georgia-Pacific Corp., the forest-products company, worked with insurers in Georgia to reduce accidents by 31 percent in 1991 and 1992, with Georgia-Pacific's sawmills experiencing only one half of the industry's average number of incidents.<p>
Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Insurance Company in Connecticut has made a $562 million business out of reducing workplace accidents. The firm is now the leading provider of boiler and machinery insurance in the United States. "Our interests and our customers' interests are aligned," says Wilson Wilde, president of Hartford Steam Boiler. "Both of us are going to be hurt financially if an accident occurs, so we can justify investing time and money in loss prevention." Most of the company's 4,000 employees are  scientists, engineers, and technicians, who work with electric utilities, chemical plants, and paper manufacturers. They have developed an array of devices, processes, and designs to enhance safety, including a device introduced in 1990 to examine hard-to-reach boiler tubes for corrosion. The company has worked with utilities to detect problems with steam-turbine rotors to head off high replacement costs. It used new sensor technology to diagnose a turbine's vibrations and signal when to weld cracks shut. Fixing rather than replacing rotors saved millions for the insurer's utility subscribers while reducing the danger of faulty rotors coming apart in generators.<p>
Reengineering workplaces using principles of ergonomics has become a common strategy for businesses and insurers to reduce worker injuries, particularly cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) such as wrist strain, elbow strain, or the more serious carpal tunnel syndrome. CTDs are a fast-growing category of both occupational illnesses and workers' comp claims, but the severity of the injuries has been exaggerated significantly by the media. (Carpal tunnel syndrome is the seriously debilitating illness so often mentioned, but it accounts for only 1.4 percent of all work injury or illness cases, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) Nevertheless, muscle strains caused by repetitive motions or poor posture do cause discomfort and pain, limit mobility, and reduce worker productivity. To address the problem, companies consult ergonomics experts and buy redesigned office furniture and machinery from manufacturers such as Michigan's Haworth Inc., which makes motorized tables that adjust height during the course of a working day, and Nova Office Furniture of Effingham, Illinois, which sells desks with computer monitors built into them so workers peer down at them like newspapers rather than up at them like televisions.<p>
OshKosh B'Gosh, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer of children's clothing, used several strategies to reduce CTDs at its main plant in Oshkosh. The company's employees were performing numerous tasks involving small, awkward motions that require force. Inspectors checked the snap crotch of each pair of pants, pinching 600 snaps per hour. Machine operators developed back trauma from twisting and turning heavy garments, and sustained shoulder and hand problems from bending over to reach different-sized clothing.<p>
The company's safety team decided to purchase 7,000 padded, adjustable chairs at $100 each and redesign many of its own machines. Company engineers devised an air-driven, automatic "crotch-snapper." Mechanical "feed dogs" were installed to dig their metal "teeth" into fabric and pull it through sewing machines. Plant workers were encouraged to report minor pain or discomfort so company engineers could address the problems. They were also rotated through several different jobs within plants, to reduce constant stress on one part of the body. After an initial surge in reported injuriesworkers were being told, after all, to report even minor problems more oftenworkers' comp claims fell as did the severity of reported injuries. From 1992 to 1993, workers' comp costs at OshKosh B'Gosh fell by a third, more than paying for the company's safety innovations.<p>
In the search for workplace safety, even industries considered to be "dangerous" have made great strides. Consider the mining industry, which has posted the most dramatic decline in injury rates during the past 20 years. In 1976, mining had the third-highest rate of total injury cases and the highest rate of any industry for injuries with lost workdays. By 1992, its rate of all injuries and of injuries involving lost workdays had dropped below the rates not only for all the other goods-producing industries but also for parts of the service sector. The efforts of enterprises like Kerr McGee Coal Corp.'s Jacob's Ranch Mine in Gillette, Wyoming, have contributed to this impressive record. The mine's incentive program for zero accidents is a quarterly award of $100 in gift certificates from local merchants. For every accident, each of the mine's 400 workers loses $10 from their awards. "Everyone gets penalized so there's a real incentive to wear safety glasses and do the right things," says safety supervisor Lenny Altenburg. The company spends $205,000 a year on the gift certificates, but the investment is paying off: The firm had no lost-time accidents at all from 1991 to 1994. Other mining firms have introduced new technologies, begun safety training programs, and used similar financial-incentive systems to minimize accidents. Compare the mining industry's typical death toll today (97 in 1992, for example) to the 3,500 annual deaths typical in the first part of the century, and you have some idea of the progress that's been made.<p>
Rail safety is another area where the incentives of the private-sector marketplace dwarf those of the public sector. The E.H. Harriman Memorial Awards, given for railroad safety since 1913, helped to illustrate this point in 1994, as privately owned railroads took prizes and publicly owned or publicly subsidized railroads posted mediocre or poor safety records. Among the largest railroads in the country, Norfolk Southern took first place while Amtrak, the federally subsidized national passenger rail system, came in last. Similarly, among nine medium-sized railroads, the three publicly owned lines ranked 5th, 7th, and 9th. Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., which operates lines in New England, won its category (small railroads) despite allegations of safety problems over the past few years by labor unions and federal regulators (whose ranks are dominated by union veterans). Colin Pease, executive vice president at Guilford, explains that while many publicly owned or subsidized railroads rely on "feel-good programs" to promote safety, private lines must operate safely or go out of business. Insurance costs, replacement costs, and disruption of freight deliveries all skyrocket when lines are unsafe. "There is a major economic impact to whether your workers perform their jobs the right way or not," he says. "But the motive breaks down in the public sector." Pease believes that when workers are working safely, they're working productivelyand naturally, in a competitive enterprise like transportation, productivity gains are the only way to stay ahead of competing rail or trucking firms. Guilford supervisors provide daily safety instruction and perform "test and observation" procedures 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<p>
The efforts of these and many other American companies to reduce accidents and injuries are ongoing and massive. But conscious decisions by corporate managers and workers to address safety aren't the only cause of safety gains. Larger trends in the economy, reflecting innovation and productivity gains linked to goals other than safety, have also contributed to lower rates of accidental deaths and safer workplaces. For example, it now takes fewer employees to manufacture goods in Americaand that means fewer chances for injuries and accidental deaths. Also, the quality of medical care provided both at the workplace itself and in hospitals and urgent-care centers has steadily improved, reducing the severity of injuries and the risk of death from accidents. Furthermore, a great deal of recent job growth has occurred among the smallest businesses in the country, which also have tended to post the best safety records (large businesses post the second-best safety records, while medium-sized firms have traditionally reported the most accidents).<p>
While interpreting safety data and identifying causes and effects of particular trends can sometimes be challenging, the overall message about corporate responsibility in this area shouldn't be obscured. Driven by the pressures of the market to lower costs, keep skilled workers, minimize legal and insurance costs, and avoid bad publicity, American businesses have toiled endlessly to make their workplaces safer. <p>
To a large extent, they've done so. In a real sense, the tremendous reduction in accidental deaths accomplished in the past 60 years represents an advance in the quality of life of workers and consumers no less significant than pay raises or price reductions. Horrible accidents such as the Hamlet chicken-plant fire are human tragedies, but in the context of corporate decisionmaking in a market economy they are also economic disasters. That's why responsible firms today are investing so much time and money trying to avoid them.<p>
OSHA, whether upsized or downsized, reengineered or left alone, has little value to add to the worker safety picture. But its costs, measured in lower productivity and wages as well as higher prices and taxes, are significant. This is one more area where Congress needs to rethink the need for federal government involvement.

Clinton's Regulatory Reform is Not Likely to Cut Red Tape
</h2>
By Susan M. Eckerly<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #367<BR>
October 8, 1993<BR>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     President Bill Clinton last week signed an executive order
outlining the process by which his Administration will oversee rule-
making by federal agencies. The President claims the new procedure
will "lighten the load for regulated industries and make government
regulations that are needed more efficient." Unfortunately, that is
unlikely to be the result.
<P>
     The new executive order does retain much of the White House
review system set up by Presidents Carter, Reagan, and Bush -- which
did rein in excessive rule-making to some degree. But the Clinton
order also creates loopholes which will allow regulatory activists to
pursue their agenda, making it unlikely that the flow of red tape will
diminish. Federal regulation is conservatively estimated to have cost
the economy between $595 billion and $667 billion in 1992.
<P>
     One such loophole is that the order gives more power to the
federal agencies and a reduced role to the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) located within the Office of Management and
Budget. During the Reagan years, the function of OIRA was extended
beyond minimizing the agencies' paperwork requirements to making sure
that agencies conducted cost-benefit analyses on proposed regulations.
The office was overshadowed during the Bush Administration by Vice
President Dan Quayle's Competitiveness Council, which acted as a
referee between federal agencies and tried to reduce the burden of new
regulations. OIRA still retains a role in the regulatory process in
the new order. But the order declares that a purpose of the new
procedure is "to reaffirm the primacy of Federal agencies in the
regulatory decision-making process" -- essentially ending OIRA's
critical role as a restraint on excessive regulation by agencies. 
<P>
     Under the order, OIRA will review only those regulations that it
or the agencies consider "significant," or will cost the economy more
than $100 million annually. This is not crucially different from the
procedure under the Reagan Administration, when OIRA played a key role
in overturning costly regulations. But there is now to be a subtle but
significant change. If OIRA and the agency cannot agree on what is a
"significant" regulation, the dispute is to be resolved by Vice
President Gore, who has shown an inclination to side with proponents
of regulation. Moreover, OIRA must now review agency submissions under
very strict timetables. OIRA Administrator Sally Katzen has said that
this could cut by one-third the number of regulations OIRA has time to
review.
<P>
     New Age Cost-Benefit Analysis. To its credit, the executive order
retains the cost-benefit basis for regulatory review set up under
Reagan. And the order recommends that agencies consider the "degree
and nature" of risks in setting regulatory priorities and identify
alternatives to regulation such as "marketable permits." The problem
is that the executive order also contains language that potentially
could undermine the cost-benefit test. For instance, it expands the
definition of costs and benefits to include not only "quantifiable
measures" but also "qualitative measures... that are difficult to
quantify," such as "the enhancement of health and safety, the
protection of the natural environment, and the elimination or
reduction of discrimination or bias." Because these types of benefits
are impossible to quantify, it will be much easier for an agency to
claim that the benefits of a proposed regulation outweigh the costs. 
<P>
     For the first time, the Vice President is explicitly named as
"the principal advisor to the President" on regulatory policy. Al
Gore, who is an outspoken environmentalist and was a strident critic
of the now defunct Competitiveness Council, is given responsibility
for coordinating "the development and presentation of recommendations
concerning regulatory policy, planning, and review, as set forth in
this executive order." A review of the first nine months of the
Clinton Administration suggests that the Vice President is unlikely to
stand in the way of aggressive regulatory agencies.
Example: As of this October 1, the number of pages in the Federal
Register (51,563), in which all new regulations are published,
exceeded the pages from last year (45,558) by roughly 10 percent.
<P>
Example: The Clinton Administration already is using executive orders,
thereby circumventing the public notice and comment provisions of the
Administrative Procedures Act, to enact environmental policies with
significant implications for industry.
Benchmarks for Success. The next few months will tell Americans just
how serious the Clinton Administration is when it pledges to reduce
the burden of red tape, and it will show whether the executive order
does indeed open the door to regulatory mischief. And while the
Clinton Administration could hardly be expected to lead a crusade
against regulation, there are a number of actions the White House
should take to show it is serious about regulatory relief. For
example, it should: 
<P>

     <UL>Conduct a thorough review of existing regulation. To Clinton's
     credit, the executive order calls on federal agencies to submit
     to OIRA within ninety days a policy under which the agency
     periodically will review "existing significant" regulations to
     determine whether any of these can be eliminated. Vice President
     Gore and the OIRA administrator must prove to the American people
     that this is not a meaningless exercise. 
<P>
     Adopt the Airline Commission's recommendation to implement a
     regulatory budget. The National Commission to Ensure A Strong
     Competitive Airline Industry report recommends that the Federal
     Aviation Administration subject regulations, except for emergency
     safety regulations, to an annual regulatory cost budget. Such a
     budgetary frame of reference would compel regulators to consider
     the overall cost picture as they look at individual regulatory
     issues. The Clinton Administration should adopt and expand upon
     this, recommending that other agencies experiment with this idea.
     <P>
     Insist that all federal mandates be fully funded by Congress and
     administered by the federal government. At the very least, the
     Clinton Administration should adhere to its National Performance
     Review report recommendation that "The President should issue a
     directive limiting the use of unfunded mandates by the
     Administration." OIRA should also make sure that the agencies
     adhere to the executive order's requirement that they assess the
     ability of state and local governments to carry out federally
     regulated mandates.
<P>
     Fulfill Gore's pledge to strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility
     Act and support the proposed Paperwork Reduction Act Amendments.
     Although neither of these legislative measures would by
     themselves roll back the regulatory tide, they enjoy bipartisan
     support in Congress. Moreover, legislation has been introduced to
     implement the National Performance Review recommendation that
     there be judicial review of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
     thereby putting teeth in a statute meant to ensure that agencies
     consider the impact of proposed regulations on small business. In
     addition, the Administration should work for passage of the Nunn-
     Danforth-Bumpers Paperwork Reduction Act, which would, among
     other things, overturn the 1990 Dole v. United Steelworkers of
     America decision that currently exempts over a third of agency
     rule-making from OIRA paperwork review</UL>. 
<P>
     In a perfect world, the language of President Clinton's executive
order might achieve his goals of easing the regulatory load on
business and creating a more streamlined regulatory system. But in the
world within the Washington Beltway, and judging from the early record
of the Administration, the new executive order creates a review
process that will in practice be exploited by regulatory activists
inside and outside the government. The American economy is not likely
to experience any significant reduction in the mountain of red tape
created by Washington.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
      During the 1980s, America's ability to create jobs was the envy
of the world. No longer. The American job-generating machine has
ground to a halt, and regulation deserves much of the blame. The
regulatory burden on U.S. firms relaxed through most of the 1980s, and
private-sector employment grew by 19 million jobs. Most of these new
jobs were created by small businesses, which are most sensitive to
regulatory costs. Over the last four years, however, the regulatory
burden has grown substantially (especially for small and medium-sized
businesses), and the private sector has lost nearly two million jobs
since early 1990.
<P>
      While government red tape is a costly frustration to American
business, few business owners -- or even government policy makers --
appreciate the full impact of regulation. Among the little-known
facts:
<P>
      Government regulation costs at least $8,000 per household, and
      may reduce national output by as much as $1.1 trillion per year.
<P>
           Unnecessary and inefficient regulation at the federal,
      state, and local levels is now costing the American people
      somewhere between $810 billion and $1.7 trillion per year --
      even after taking account of the benefits of regulation -- or
      between $8,400 and $17,100 per year per household. (Nancy A. 
      Bord and William G.  Laffer III, "George Bush's Hidden Tax:  The
      Explosion in Regulation," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 
      905, July 10, 1992, p.  19.  Regulations may be treated as
      "unnecessary" if (1) the costs they impose exceed the benefits
      they produce, or (2) even though they produce benefits that may
      exceed costs, they do so in an unnecessarily costly manner
      because of an inefficient method or approach.  The basis for the
      distinction between necessary and unnecessary regulations is
      discussed further in footnote 15 below. ) A major portion of
      this cost consists of the additional goods and services that the
      American economy could have been producing today but is not
      because of over two decades of slower growth due to excessive
      and inefficient regulation. The value of this foregone output is
      somewhere between $450 billion and $1.1 trillion per year.
      (Ibid.)
<P>
      Regulation reduces total U.S. employment by at least three
      million jobs.
<P>
           Another heavy cost of regulation is reduced employment
      opportunities for Americans. This toll is not usually apparent,
      because in most instances regulation merely leads to a slower
      growth in employment rather than to visible loss in existing
      jobs. Nonetheless, even by a fairly conservative estimate, there
      are at least three million fewer jobs in the American economy
      today than would have existed if the growth of regulation over
      the last twenty years had been slower and regulations more
      efficiently designed. (Footnote 17 below explains how this
      figure was calculated.)
<P>
           Many regulations directly increase the cost of employing
      workers and thereby act like a hidden tax on job creation and
      employment. Among such regulations are minimum wage laws and
      federal labor laws. These regulations place especially heavy
      burdens on small businesses, the primary engines of job
      creation. And exempting smaller businesses from regulations
      generally does not solve the problem. Instead it simply creates
      a "Catch 22" situation in which growing small firms are
      penalized by an increase in the number of regulations they
      became subject to.
<P>
           Officials currently face no explicit requirement to
      consider employment effects as they develop new rules. Nor do
      lawmakers. Even when the agencies or congressional committees do
      consider the employment effects of proposed rules or regulatory
      legislation, policy makers often do so in ways that are
      simplistic or that rely on faulty assumptions and models. The
      methodologies used vary from agency to agency, and from
      regulation to regulation even within agencies. Moreover, nowhere
      in the entire federal regulatory process does anyone consider
      the cumulative effects of existing regulations, or the possible
      combined effects of new and existing regulations.
<P>
      To deal with the mounting employment costs of regulation,
Congress and the Clinton Administration should institute several
urgent reforms. Among the most important: <P>
Reform #1:      President Clinton should issue an executive order
                requiring explicit consideration of the employment
                effects of all new regulations.
<P>
Reform #2:      Congress should extend the same requirement to all
                "independent" regulatory agencies that are outside the
                executive branch. 
<P>
Reform #3:      Congress should establish a federal regulatory budget.
                Such a budget means that a maximum total regulatory
                burden that government could impose on the economy --
                or regulatory budget -- would be established. Whenever
                an agency planned to add a new regulation that would
                exceed the budget, it would be required to repeal or
                modify some other regulation so that the total burden
                imposed on the economy by federal regulation would not
                be increased. Alternatively, the government would have
                to arrange an offsetting reduction from another
                agency. 
<P>
Reform #4:      Congress should require the expected employment
                effects of all proposed regulations to be published in
                the Federal Register; even before such a requirement
                is imposed, executive and independent agencies should
                voluntarily publish the expected employment effects of
                proposed regulations. This would permit the American
                people to know the expected magnitude of any job
                losses due to a new rule before it takes effect.
                Americans then could let officials and lawmakers know
                if they felt the benefits of the proposed rule were
                worth the job losses.
<P>
      Enactment of these four reforms would reduce substantially the
cost that federal regulations impose on the economy, while preserving
or even increasing the benefits that regulations sometimes can
provide. In particular, they would reduce the toll on employment and
wages that the well-meaning pursuit of worthy ends often takes. A
clean environment and safe and discrimination-free workplaces can be
achieved without depriving three million or more Americans of jobs.

<P>
HOW REGULATION KILLS JOBS
<P>
      Between January 1, 1983, and March 31, 1990, private-sector
employment in the U.S. economy grew by some 19 million jobs, rising
from 72.8 million jobs in December 1982, to 91.8 million jobs in March
1990. However, over the next two years the private sector lost nearly
2.2 million jobs, reaching a low of just over 89.6 million jobs in
January 1992. The number of private-sector jobs has recovered only
slightly since then, rising to 90.1 million jobs as of January 1993.
(Source:  U.S.  Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
("establishment data," based on a monthly survey of employers,
seasonally adjusted).  These figures do not include agricultural
employment or employment by federal, state, or local governments. 
Using BLS's figures for total civilian employment ("household data,"
based on household interviews conducted monthly by the Bureau of the
Census, seasonally adjusted), including agricultural employment and
non-military government employment, the relevant employment figures
are 99 million jobs in December 1982, 118.3 million jobs in May 1990,
116.5 million jobs in August 1991, and 118 million jobs as of January
1993.)
<P>
      What accounts for the difference between the two periods? In
particular, what caused employment to start rising in January 1983,
and what caused it to begin to fall in April 1990? To be sure, there
are many factors that affect employment levels, including taxation.
Tax rates were reduced significantly in 1983, but increased somewhat
in 1990.  (See Daniel J.  Mitchell, "An Action Plan to Create Jobs,"
Heritage Foundation Memo to President-Elect Clinton No.  1, December
14, 1992, pp.  4-5.  The tax cuts that were enacted in 1981 did not
take full effect until January 1983.  Although the 1990 tax increases
were not signed into law until November 1990, President Bush renounced
his "no new taxes" pledge and indicated his willingness to agree to a
tax increase in June 1990.)But there is considerable evidence to
suggest that changes in the total cost of federal and state regulation
also played a major role, especially in the downturn that occurred in
1990.
<P>
      As the graph on the following page indicates, regulatory costs
generally were declining during the period of private-sector
employment growth. The period of decline and stagnation, by contrast,
started shortly after regulatory costs started to rise again.
Moreover, as the graph on page 5 shows, there was a very close
negative correlation between the number of federal regulators and
private-sector employment. Fewer regulators coincided with an increase
in job growth; an increase in regulators with a decline in job growth
and even a decline in jobs.
<P>
      Policy makers concerned about job creation need to understand
the basic factors that determine the level of wages and employment.
Explains economist Arthur B. Laffer: 
<P>
       <UL>Firms base their decisions to employ workers . .. .. in
      part, on the total cost to the firm of employing workers. .
      .. .. All else equal, the greater the cost to the firm of
      employing each worker, the less workers the firm will
      employ. Conversely, the lower the cost per worker, the more
      workers the firm will hire. (Arthur B.  Laffer,
      "Supply-Side Economics," Financial Analysts Journal,
      September/October 1981, pp.  32-33.)</UL>
<P>
      In a world without taxes or regulations, the cost to employers
of hiring an additional hour of labor services and the benefit to a
worker of working an additional hour would be the same. Taxes and
regulations raise the cost to employers above the reward received by
the employee. These government-mandated costs include such items as
unemployment and disability insurance, government paperwork
requirements, and the cost of lawyers to advise firms on how to comply
with the rules. While some of these government-imposed costs do
provide a benefit to the employee, many of them do not.
<P>
      The difference between what it costs a firm to employ a worker
and the net benefit the worker receives is commonly referred to by
economists as the "regulation and tax wedge." Any increase in the
wedge, whether caused by regulations or by taxes, will tend to raise
the cost to employers of hiring an additional employee, thereby
reducing the demand for labor, and reduce the net wages and benefits
workers receive, thereby reducing the supply of labor as well. Thus,
the basic laws of economics indicate that if regulatory burdens rise
(and tax burdens do not fall by an equal or greater amount),
employment and wages will fall.

<P>
THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF REGULATION 
<P>
      Some regulations have a direct and immediate impact on wages or
employment. The minimum wage law and federal labor laws, for example,
tend to increase the cost of employing workers and thereby decrease
wages or employment, and sometimes both. Other regulations affect
wages and employment indirectly, but just as significantly. Banking
and environmental regulations, for example, have a considerable
negative effect on the overall level of economic activity. And when
output slows, employment usually slows with it.
<P>
      More often than not, the effects of regulation on employment are
hidden by other factors, such as tax policy or general economic
changes. But in other instances, the impact on jobs is very clear. 
 Example: The federal government's efforts to protect the northern
spotted owl, under the Endangered Species Act and other related laws,
means millions of acres of land in Washington, Oregon, and northern
California have been closed to logging operations. Tens of thousands
of loggers have lost or will lose their jobs because of these
regulations, and thousands more jobs have been lost in communities
dependent on logging as the principal industry.
<P>
Example:        California has increased regulation sharply over the
last two years, driving businesses and jobs from the state. California
has lost approximately 700,000 jobs since May 1990. (George F.  Will,
"Can California Compete?" The Washington Post, September 27, 1992, p. 
C7.) Indeed, for the first time in nearly twenty years, more people
are leaving California than arriving. ("Californians leaving state in
record numbers," The Washington Times, September 4, 1992, p.  A2.)
While California's job exodus of course is due to many factors,
including higher taxes, several studies and surveys have concluded
that regulations -- especially onerous new environmental regulations
-- are the principal factor driving businesses' decisions to leave the
state. (The most important of these studies is California's Jobs and
Future (April 23, 1992), a detailed report prepared by the Council on
California Competitiveness, led by Peter Ueberroth, the former
baseball commissioner and organizer of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los
Angeles.  Another is Mark Baldassare and Associates, "Department of
Commerce Survey of California Manufacturers" (Sacramento:  California
Department of Commerce, Office of Business Development, December 13,
1989).  Two additional surveys are cited in Philip K.  Verleger Jr.,
"Clean Air Regulation and the L.A.  Riots," The Wall Street Journal,
May 19, 1992, p.  A14.)
<P>


Why the Regulatory Cost is Usually Hidden     
<P>
      Still, cases in which regulation can be clearly identified as
the culprit for specific job losses are the exception rather than the
rule. There are several reasons why there is rarely a smoking gun:
Businesses usually base their decisions on such matters as whether or
where to build a new plant, and how many people they will hire, on a
variety of considerations. It is rarely clear which consideration was
decisive.
<P>
      The<UL> result of regulation often is not a cut in wages or
      employment levels, but simply slower growth over time. Jobs not
      created are much less visible than layoffs.
<P>
      Regulation in one part of the economy can have an impact in
      other areas. For example, a recent study by economists Michael
      Hazilla of American University and Raymond Kopp of Resources for
      the Future, a Washington, D.C.-based research group specializing
      in environmental issues, found that environmental regulations
      had reduced employment in the finance, insurance, and real
      estate industries by 2.64 percent as of 1990. (Michael Hazilla
      and Raymond J.  Kopp, "Social Cost of Environmental Quality
      Regulations:  A General Equilibrium Analysis," Journal of
      Political Economy, Vol.  98, No.  4 (1990), p.  869.) This
      occurred despite the fact that these industries produce no
      pollution themselves and thus did not incur the direct cost of
      pollution abatement equipment. Hazilla and Kopp found that all
      sectors of the economy are affected by environmental
      regulations, because such regulations cause the cost of inputs
      to the production process such as labor, raw materials, and
      electricity to rise, and cause savings, investment and capital
      formation to fall.</UL>
<P>
      Unfortunately for workers, the indirect causal links whose
effects Hazilla and Kopp attempted to measure are invisible to most
observers. Nonetheless, Hazilla and Kopp found the employment effects
of environmental regulation for the economy as a whole to be
substantial. By their estimates, environmental regulations alone had
by 1990 reduced the overall employment level by 1.18 percent. (Ibid.,
p.  867.) This would mean between 1.1 million and 1.4 million fewer
jobs than would have existed without environmental regulation. (The
average number of Americans employed in 1990 was between 91.5 million
and 117.9 million, depending on which BLS data series one uses.  91.5
million x 1.18% = 1.1 million.  117.9 million x 1.18% = 1.4 million. 
Of course, the number of jobs eliminated by environmental regulation
might be smaller if some of the 1.18 percent reduction in labor supply
were simply due to people working fewer hours in existing jobs.) 
Moreover, environmental regulation significantly altered the
distribution of labor employment across the economy. Although a few
sectors, such as the natural gas industry and the wholesale and retail
trade sectors, experienced modest increases in employment, most
sectors experienced reductions. 
<P>

THE TOTAL COST TO THE ECONOMY
<P>
      Most studies analyzing the cost of regulation examine only
direct compliance expenditures. They do not consider the indirect
effects of regulation on output and employment. But some other
studies, such as that by Hazilla and Kopp, suggest that the indirect
effects may be as large as or even significantly larger than the
direct compliance costs, at least in the case of environmental
regulations. (Another such study, with similar results, was done by
economists Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University and Peter Wilcoxen of
the University of Texas.  See Dale W.  Jorgenson and Peter J. 
Wilcoxen, "Environmental Regulation and U.S.  Economic Growth," RAND
Journal of Economics, Vol.  21, No.  2 (Summer 1990), pp.  314-40.)
The reason for this is that reductions in investment due to regulation
have cumulative effects over time on output and employment.
<P>
      The most widely cited estimates of the combined cost of all
federal regulations put the figure between $595 billion and $667
billion per year for 1992, measured in 1991 dollars. (Thomas D. 
Hopkins, Cost of Regulation, Rochester Institute of Technology Public
Policy Working Paper (December 1991); Robert W.  Hahn and John A. 
Hird, "The Costs and Benefits of Regulation:  Review and Synthesis,"
Yale Journal on Regulation, Vol.  8, No.  1 (Winter 1991), pp. 
233-278.  The figures in the text are arrived at by taking Hopkins's
estimate of the total cost of regulation as of 1992, substituting
Hahn's and Hird's original estimate of the gross cost of economic
regulation for the figure Hopkins used (which was a modified version
of Hahn's and Hird's estimate), substituting Hopkins's updated but as
yet unpublished figure for the federal paperwork burden, and
converting the new total from 1988 to 1991 dollars.) However, these
estimates do not take any account of the indirect effects of
regulation on output and employment. A recent study by Nancy Bord and
William Laffer, of The Heritage Foundation, attempted to estimate the
indirect effects of all regulations -- state as well as federal -- by
extrapolating from the results of other studies, such as that of
Hazilla and Kopp. Bord and Laffer calculate that, in the absence of
all unnecessary regulatory costs, (Insofar as some types of regulation
-- environmental regulation in particular -- produce benefits as well
as costs, one may not simply assume that all of the costs of
regulation can be eliminated.  However, even where existing
regulations may produce benefits that exceed costs, it often appears
that the same or even greater benefits could be obtained at a
significantly lower cost by using better-designed, more efficient
forms of regulation.  Consequently, in calculating the foregoing
figures, wherever a regulation appeared to produce net benefits, no
cost was counted except the difference (if any) between the actual
cost imposed by the regulation in question and the lower cost that
would be incurred under a more efficient regulatory scheme.) annual
gross domestic product (GDP) would exceed its current level of $5.672
trillion as of 1991 by at least some $450 billion, and possibly by as
much as $1.1 trillion. (Bord and Laffer, op.  cit., p.  19.  Bord and
Laffer used a very wide range of estimates of the ratio of indirect
costs to direct costs because of the inherent uncertainty involved in
estimating how much output is not produced.  That is why their lower
and upper bounds are so far apart. )This additional output would mean
the existence of several million additional jobs. Even a conservative
estimate would put the figure at well over three million jobs. (Based
on the ratio of 1991 GDP to average private-sector employment in 1991,
the production of an additional $450 billion to $1.1 trillion in
annual GDP would mean the creation of an additional 7.2 million to
19.2 million jobs, depending on which figure is used for
private-sector employment.  However, because much of the additional
GDP would have come from increased productivity, rather than increased
employment, the actual job growth figures would likely be much
smaller.  Assuming that half of any increase in annual GDP came from
increased employment, the additional jobs that would have been created
in the absence of all unnecessary regulatory costs would number
between 3.6 million and 9.6 million.)
<P>
EXAMPLES OF JOB-DESTROYING REGULATIONS
<P>
      As noted earlier, some regulations directly increase the cost of
employing workers and thereby act like a tax on job creation and
employment. Three examples show in practical terms how this happens.
<P>
Example #1: Minimum Wage Legislation
<P>
      It is now almost universally accepted that minimum wage laws
reduce the employment of low-skilled workers whose productivity simply
is not worth what the employers are required by law to pay. (See,
e.g., Simon Rottenberg, ed., The Economics of Legal Minimum Wages
(Washington, D.C.:  American Enterprise Institute, 1981).) The only
major disagreement today is over the degree of employment reductions
caused by the minimum wage requirement. (Some studies note, for
example, that while the minimum wage law reduces employment of
low-skilled workers, it may increase employment of medium-skilled
workers who, to some extent, can be used in lieu of the low-skilled
workers whose labor the minimum wage renders too expensive.  However,
the increase in employment of medium-skilled workers is never enough
to fully offset the decrease in employment of low-skilled workers.)
<P>
      For the nine years running from January 1981 through March 1990,
the federal minimum wage remained fixed at $3.35 per hour. Because of
inflation, however, the real value of the minimum wage -- and
therefore the real cost to businesses of employing less-skilled
workers -- declined. Not surprisingly, the percentage of teenagers
with jobs climbed from 41 percent to over 48 percent over the same
period. (Alan Reynolds, "Cruel Costs of the 1991 Minimum Wage," The
Wall Street Journal, July 7, 1992, p.  A14.) 
<P>
      Congress decided in 1989 to increase the federal minimum wage to
$3.80 per hour as of April 1, 1990, and to $4.25 per hour as of April
1, 1991. Again, not surprisingly, teenage employment fell immediately
after each of these increases. Just four months after the 1990
increase, for instance, the percentage of teenagers with jobs had
fallen from over 48 percent to less than 43 percent, undoing most of
the previous nine years' improvement. (Ibid.) 
<P>
      In total, the federal minimum wage rose by 27 percent, and
teenage employment fell by 11 percent.  (Ibid.)The 1990 and 1991
minimum wage increases made it harder for teenage workers to get
summer and Christmas vacation jobs. The hikes made it harder for young
adults with little education, skill, or experience to obtain their
first full-time entry-level jobs. These are the jobs where they would
acquire the training, experience, and work habits that eventually
would make their labor worth more than the legal minimum. And the
increases in the minimum wage made it harder for unskilled housewives
trying to supplement their family's income while their children are in
school to obtain part-time work.
<P>
      Calculations by economists Lowell Gallaway and Richard Vedder of
Ohio University show that the total cost to a business for each worker
hired and for each hour worked rose sharply after each of these
increases in the minimum wage, but especially after the first -- which
was the larger of the two increases in percentage terms. (Lowell
Gallaway and Richard Vedder, "Why Johnny Can't Work:  The Causes of
Unemployment," Policy Review, Fall 1992, p.  29.)  Furthermore,
calculations by Gallaway and economist Gary Anderson of the Joint
Economic Committee (JEC) of Congress suggest that the total cost per
worker hired and per hour worked rose particularly sharply for smaller
businesses. (Gary Anderson and Lowell Gallaway, "Derailing the Small
Business Job Express" (Washington, D.C.:  Joint Economic Committee,
November 7, 1992), pp.  25-28.) Larger corporations tend to be less
affected (at least directly) by increases in the minimum wage, since
they already pay most if not all of their workers wages well above the
legal minimum. By contrast, the overwhelming majority of businesses
that employ people at the minimum wage are small and medium-sized.
Consequently, increases in the minimum wage -- like most other
increases in the regulatory burden -- tend to have a greater impact on
smaller firms, and to exacerbate the disparity that already exists
between small and large firms. (For a discussion of the disparate
impact of regulation on small business, and of the importance of this
disparity from the standpoint of job creation, see pages 10-12 below.)
<P>
      Private-sector employment peaked in March 1990, and started
declining sharply in April 1990. It appears likely, therefore, that
the legally mandated explosion in the cost of employing relatively
unskilled workers was a significant factor contributing to the 1990-
1991 recession and the stagnation of the past year. (See chart below.)
<P>
Example #2: Federal Labor Laws
<P>
      Federal labor laws regulate employers' dealings with their
employees and with organized labor unions. Under these laws, the
flexibility of companies to hire and fire workers is restric-ted, and
often they are required to engage in costly negotiations with labor
unions. Far from being balanced, federal labor laws deliberately tilt
the scales in favor of unions and against employers, as well as
against employees who do not wish to join a union. (See, e.g., Richard
A.  Epstein, "A Common Law for Labor Relations:  A Critique of the New
Deal Labor Legislation," Yale Law Journal, Vol.  92 (1983), p.  1357;
Daniel J.  Mitchell, "Government Intervention in Labor Markets:  A
Property Rights Perspective," Villanova Law Review, Vol.  33, No.  6
(1988), pp.  1043-1057.)
<P>
      There is, however, no free lunch. Restrictions imposed on
employers (and employees) by federal labor laws inevitably increase
the cost of employing workers, resulting in fewer jobs and lower
wages, or at least in slower growth in employment and wages over time.
(See, e.g., John T.  Addison and Barry T.  Hirsch, "Union Effects on
Productivity, Profits, and Growth:  Has the Long Run Arrived?" Journal
of Labor Economics, Vol.  7 (January 1989), pp.  72-106.  In addition,
compulsory union dues reduce the net benefits workers receive for
working, thereby reducing the supply of labor as well as demand.)
<P>
Example #3: Mandated Benefits
<P>
      Regulations that require employers to provide various benefits
to their employees, such as health insurance, unemployment insurance,
workers' compensation, retirement benefits, or child care, all tend to
reduce wages and employment. They increase the cost of employing
workers, which can lead to a slowdown in the creation of new jobs or
even to layoffs. 
<P>
      In the long run, employers will seek to offset their increased
costs, either by reducing wage and salary payments or by cutting back
on other benefits that the employer previously might have provided
voluntarily as a means of attracting workers. As a result, the total
value of the employees' compensation eventually may be no higher than
it would have been in the absence of the regulation. In fact, the
value to the employee may even end up being less than it would have
been, while the cost to the employer may still be greater. In this
case, the regulation will end up reducing the supply of labor as well
as demand. Thus, one way or another, much of the cost of the
regulation will end up being borne by the workers, whether in the form
of fewer jobs, fewer fringe benefits, a reduction in the growth of
wages over time, or some combination of the three. (See, e.g., Richard
B.  McKenzie, The American Job Machine (New York:  Universe Books,
1988), pp.  218-31; Don Bellante and Philip K.  Porter, "A
Subjectivist Economic Analysis of Government-Mandated Employee
Benefits," Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, Vol.  13, No.  2
(Spring 1990), pp.  657-687.)
<P>

REGULATION AND SMALL BUSINESS
<P>
      The U.S. economy created some 19 million net new private-sector
jobs during the 1980s. Most of these new jobs were created by new
businesses, and most of the remainder were created by existing small
businesses. (Lawrence A.  Kudlow, "Small Business Is Big Business,"
Global Spectator, February 28, 1992, reprinted in Congressional
Record, March 10, 1992, p.  S3153.) By contrast, large U.S.
multinational corporations contributed less than one-tenth of one
percent of the employment growth that occurred between 1982 and 1989.
(Ibid.) Indeed, employment by Fortune 500 corporations actually fell
by about 4 million jobs during the 1980s. (George F.  Will, "A
refresher course on what ails us," The Providence Journal-Bulletin,
September 14, 1992, p.  A6.) Thus, taken as a separate sector,
employment in small and medium-sized businesses actually grew by an
astounding 23 million jobs.
<P>
      Small businesses have always been the engine of job creation in
the U.S. economy. Some 57.2 percent of all net new jobs created
between 1976 and 1986 were created by firms with fewer than 500
employees, 43.7 percent were created by firms with fewer than 100
employees, and 26.2 percent were created by firms with fewer than 20
employees. (U.S.  Small Business Administration, The State of Small
Business:  A Report of the President (Washington, D.C.:  U.S. 
Government Printing Office, 1989), p.  48.) Today, two out of every
three new jobs in the United States are created by small and medium-
sized businesses. (Kudlow, op.  cit.) The vast majority of American
businesses are small, and the majority of American workers are
employed by small firms. In the U.S., 93.3 percent of all business
establishments employ fewer than 100 employees, and 83.4 percent
employ fewer than 20 employees. Only 3.4 percent of all firms employ
500 or more employees, and only 1.5 percent of all firms employ 5,000
or more employees. (David L.  Birch, Job Creation in America:  How Our
Smallest Companies Put the Most People to Work (New York:  The Free
Press, 1987), p.  9.)

<P>
How Regulation Hurts Small Business
<P>
      Regulation does not affect all businesses equally. It imposes
the heaviest burdens on small and medium-sized businesses. The reason
is that small and medium-sized firms find it harder to spread the high
overhead costs of processing paperwork, attorney and accountant fees,
and the staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
Direct labor regulations, such as increases in the minimum wage, also
represent a comparatively larger burden for small firms. Consequently,
increasing levels of regulation tend to put small and medium-sized
businesses at a competitive cost disadvantage compared with larger
firms. (See, e.g., Ann P.  Bartel and Lacy Glenn Thomas, "Direct and
Indirect Effects of Regulation:  A New Look at OSHA's Impact," Journal
of Law and Economics, Vol.  28, No.  1 (April 1985), pp.  1-25; Ann P. 
Bartel and Lacy Glenn Thomas, "Predation Through Regulation:  The Wage
and Profit Effects of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency," Journal of
Law and Economics, Vol.  30, No.  2 (October 1987), pp.  239-264; B. 
Peter Pashigian, "The Effects of Regulation on Optimal Plant Size and
Factor Shares," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol.  27, No.  1 (April
1984), pp.  1-28; B.  Peter Pashigian, "Environmental Regulation: 
Whose Self Interests Are Being Protected?" Economic Inquiry, Vol.  23,
No.  4 (October 1985), pp.  551-584.) 
<P>
      Future regulation will compound this problem. For example,
although President Clinton has yet to finalize his health care
proposals, he has indicated tentative support for proposals to require
firms to shoulder much of the cost of universal coverage for workers
and their families. This would significantly increase the cost of
hiring workers in the small business sector, where many firms
currently do not provide coverage. While 98 percent of all firms with
100 or more employees already provide health benefits, only 27 percent
of firms with fewer than 10 employees offer health benefits at
present. (Health Insurance Association of America, Source Book of
Health Insurance Data 1991 (Washington, D.C.:  Health Insurance
Association of America, 1991), p.  27 (Table 2.5).) In other words,
while 73 percent of firms with fewer than 10 employees would see their
cost of employing workers rise under either of these proposals, only 2
percent of firms with 100 or more employees would be significantly
affected.
<P>
      Out of the Frying Pan and into the Fire. To its credit, Congress
generally has tried to compensate for the disproportionate burden of
regulation on smaller firms by exempting firms below a certain size --
measured by the number of employees -- from various regulations. For
example, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988, which requires employers to give employees and local government
officials advance notice before closing a plant or laying off workers,
only applies to firms with 100 or more employees. Likewise, the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 currently applies only
to firms with 25 or more employees. After July 26, 1994, however, the
ADA will apply to firms with 15 or more employees.
<P>
      Unfortunately, this well-intentioned approach does not really
solve the problem; it merely changes the form of the problem. In some
respects it may even make the problem worse, for it gives businesses
an incentive not to grow beyond a certain size. If a firm stays small
enough, it remains exempt from regulations. However, if it hires "too
many" workers, it becomes subject to various costly regulations. Thus,
instead of punishing firms merely for being small, federal regulations
also punish small firms for growing and creating more jobs.
<P>
      As a result, firms nearing the relevant threshold for a rule
have a powerful incentive to avoid hiring additional employees. For
example, in a letter to The Washington Times, the president of
Schonstedt Instrument Company of Reston, Virginia, tells how he has
deliberately kept his company below 50 employees in order to avoid
having to file certain forms with the federal government, because of
the cost and time involved. (E.O.  Schonstedt, letter to the editors,
The Washington Times, February 16, 1992, p.  B5.)
<P>
      Worse still, the prospect of an exemption from a regulation can
make it profitable for firms actually to reduce their workforces in
order to fall below the relevant threshold. For example, the Family
and Medical Leave Act of 1993, recently signed into law by President
Clinton, will apply to firms with 50 or more employees. Calculations
by the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) of Congress suggest that under
this law, a firm whose optimal size before the regulation was 60
employees might actually find it profitable to cut back to 49
employees. (Anderson and Gallaway, op.  cit., pp.  21-24.) As the JEC
report puts it, "Exemption from government regulations and mandates on
the basis of the size of a company is a guaranteed recipe for making
small businesses smaller." (Ibid., p.  24.)
<P>

THE MYTH THAT REGULATION CREATES JOBS
<P>
      Defenders of regulation sometimes argue that while regulation
may cut jobs in some firms, in general it is good for the economy and
creates jobs. A number of writers recently have made this argument in
connection with environmental regulation. (E.g., Timothy E.  Wirth,
"Easy Being Green...  Lighten Up, Loggers -- Environmentalism Actually
Creates Jobs," The Washington Post, October 4, 1992, p.  C3; Michael
Silverstein, "Bush's Polluter Protectionism Isn't Pro-Business," The
Wall Street Journal, May 28, 1992, p.  A21; Curtis Moore, "Bush's
Nonsense on Jobs and the Environment," The New York Times, September
25, 1992, p.  A33.) For example, it is pointed out that environmental
regulations stimulate employment in industries that manufacture
special devices required by government, such as scrubbers for
smokestacks, and create jobs in environmental clean-up firms.
Similarly, it is argued that securities regulations and the Treasury's
regulations interpreting the Internal Revenue Code create employment
for lawyers and accountants. 
<P>
      These arguments almost always rest on a basic economic fallacy:
they confuse the creation of jobs in a particular industry with the
creation of jobs for the economy as a whole. Thus while jobs are
indeed created in firms that assist in helping companies comply with
rules, these rules also cost jobs in the regulated industry. The
fallacy that adding costs to firms actually creates jobs in the
economy is a persistent fallacy that was refuted decades ago. Rather
than creating jobs, regulation simply diverts employment from
productive to unproductive activities, with a net loss in efficiency
and jobs. (See Frederic Bastiat, "What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen,"
in Frederic Bastiat, Selected Essays on Political Econ- omy, trans. 
Seymour Cain, ed.  George B.  de Huszar (Irvington-on-Hudson, New
York:  Foundation for Economic Education, 1964); Henry Hazlitt,
Economics in One Lesson (Westport, Connecticut:  Arlington House,
1979).) .In particular instances, the jobs created may be more or less
numerous than those destroyed. For example, if a new Medicare
regulation increases the cost of doing brain surgery, a hospital may
lay off one $300,000-per-year brain surgeon and hire three $30,000-
per-year administrators to fill in the relevant Medicare forms. In
other instances, however, a firm may lay off three blue-collar workers
and replace them with one higher-paid engineer. There is no reason to
expect the jobs that are created because of regulation to
systematically outnumber -- or pay more than -- the jobs that are
destroyed.

<P>
HOW TO AVOID UNNECESSARY JOB LOSSES
<P>
      Jobs are lost unnecessarily though regulation because currently
there is no explicit requirement that the employment effects of
regulation be considered, either by Congress when it legislates or by
federal regulatory agencies in the rule-making and enforcement
process. 
<P>
      Executive Order (EO) 12291, issued by President Reagan in
February 1981, does require executive branch agencies to inquire into
the overall costs and benefits of proposed regulations. However, EO
12291 does not explicitly require any particular kind of costs or
benefits to be counted. Thus, while the negative effects of a proposed
regulation on wages or employment levels can be counted as costs, they
do not have to be. Likewise, the employment-enhancing effects (if any)
of a proposed regulation can be counted as benefits, but need not be.
An agency thus may compute benefits and costs in dollars without ever
counting how many jobs would be gained or lost. Moreover, EO 12291
applies only to new regulations, not regulations that are already on
the books. And EO 12291 does not apply to any of the "independent"
regulatory agencies that lie outside the executive branch, such as the
Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Communications
Commission.
<P>
      This is not merely a problem in theory. A recent study by the
National Commission for Employment Policy examined the regulatory
review practices of seven federal agencies with major responsibility
for preparing and enforcing regulation. The study found that "federal
regulatory agencies . . . do not explicitly or systematically take
potential employment effects into consideration during the review
process, or in enforcement decisions." (Nancy A.  Bord, "Addressing
Employment Effects in the Regulatory Review Process," draft final
report prepared for the National Commission for Employment Policy,
September 9, 1992, p.  33.) Even when employment effects are
considered by the agencies, they are considered either in a simplistic
way, or on the basis of faulty assumptions and models. The
methodologies used vary from agency to agency, and even from
regulation to regulation within agencies. The study also found that
federal regulatory agencies generally fail to consider the cumulative
effects of existing regulations and the possible effects of new
regulations on existing rules. 
<P>
      Because regulation of one part of the economy can affect other
parts, and because regulations often interact with each other in
significant ways, no regulation can properly be judged or measured in
isolation. (An analogous point applies in the area of taxation: 
Because different taxes often interact with each other in important
ways, no individual tax can properly be evaluated in isolation.  In
fact, strictly speaking, taxes and regulations can only be analyzed in
conjunction with each other.  Each specific tax must be analyzed in
light of every other tax and every regulation, and each specific
regulation must be analyzed in light of every other regulation and
every tax.  See generally John R.  Hicks, Value and Capital, 2nd ed. 
(Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1946); Arnold C.  Harberger,
Taxation and Welfare (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 1974).)
In fact, this interaction means the adoption of a new regulation can
increase the cost imposed by existing regulations. Therefore,
computing the total costs and benefits of any new regulation would
require determination of the net impact of all regulations taken
together. Generally speaking, the greater the volume of regulation
that already exists when a new regulation is introduced, the greater
will be the incremental, overall cost of adding the new regulation.
Failure to take account of this is one of the most important factors
contributing to the enormous growth in the overall regulatory burden.
It also helps explain the decline in U.S. labor productivity and wage
growth over the past two decades (see chart on following page), and
the decline in employment during the last two years.
<P>
      In light of the severe burden imposed by regulation on
employment, President Clinton and Congress should reform the
regulatory review process. Among the necessary reforms: 
<P>
Reform #1:      President Clinton should issue an executive order
                requiring explicit consideration of the employment
                effects of all new regulations. 
<P>
Reform #2:      Congress should extend the same requirements to all of
                the "independent" regulatory agencies that lie outside
                the executive branch.
<P>
Reform #3:      The President and Congress should establish a federal
                regulatory budget. 
<P>
      Under a regulatory budget, a limit would be placed on the total
estimated cost imposed on the economy each year by all federal
regulations. This limit would apply to new and existing regulations
taken together. Thus, if the budget had been reached, an agency
wishing to add a new regulation would have to repeal or modify an
existing regulation. If an agency could not find a large enough
offsetting reduction among the other regulations for which it was
responsible, the government would have to agree to an offsetting
reduction by another agency.
<P>
      The introduction of a regulatory budget would have several
virtues. First, it would place a limit on the total cost that can be
imposed on the economy by federal regulation. This total burden would
have to be a political decision, with ordinary Americans able to take
part in the national discussion. 
<P>
      Second, it would force agencies to debate each other to justify
the merits of proposed regulations, with the Office of Management and
Budget (or any other body designated by the President, such as the
newly created National Economic Council) making the final call. This
in turn would compel the agencies, as they are not compelled at
present, to think seriously about which regulations are most important
to them and yield the greatest benefits. 
<P>
      And third, it would give agencies the incentive to review their
existing regulations and find those which are not really worth
retaining -- or are causing greater job losses than expected -- in
order to make room for new regulations with a higher priority.
<P>
Reform #4:      Congress should require the expected employment
                effects of all proposed regulations to be published in
                the Federal Register before the regulations take
                effect. <P>
      Present law allows but does not require publication of expected
employment effects in the Federal Register. Congress should make such
disclosure mandatory. In the meantime, executive and independent
agencies should disclose expected job losses or wage reductions
voluntarily.This would permit the public to know the expected
magnitude of any job losses or net wage reductions. Thus Americans
could comment on this aspect of proposed regulations before they take
effect. This also would enable the public to compare actual job losses
with what was predicted at the time each regulation was issued. 

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
      The President and Congress must do something to get the problem
of growing federal regulation under control. Regulation at the
federal, state, and local levels is now costing the American people
somewhere between $810 billion and $1.7 trillion per year, even after
taking account of benefits, or between $8,400 and $17,100 per year per
household. A major portion of this cost consists of the output that
the American economy could have been producing today but is not
because of over twenty years of excessive and inefficient regulation
-- somewhere between $450 billion and $1.1 trillion per year. 
<P>
      Another important cost of regulation is the failure to create
more employment opportunities for Americans who would like to work.
Many regulations directly increase the cost of employing workers and
therefore act just like a hidden tax on job creation and employment.
Unfortunately, regulation places especially heavy burdens on smaller
and medium-sized businesses, which are the primary engines of job
creation. As a consequence, there probably are at least three million
fewer private-sector jobs in the American economy than could have
existed today if the growth of regulation had been controlled and
regulations had been more sensibly and efficiently designed.
<P>
      While regulation has been taking a toll on employment throughout
the last two decades, the toll has risen sharply in just the last four
years. Moreover, two of the most significant and costly new
regulations of the last four years -- the 1990 Clean Air Act
Amendments and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) -- only started
to take effect a few months ago; some of their provisions will not
take effect until the middle of 1994. So the impact of these
regulations on employment still lies in the future -- the heavy job
losses due to regulation in the last three years have been caused by
existing rules. In other words, the employment loss due to regulation
is almost certain to get worse if the President and Congress do not
take action. 
<P>
      Many specific federal regulatory programs deserve a drastic
overhaul. Even though repeal of such new regulatory programs as the
Clean Air Act Amendments and the ADA is politically unlikely, the
President and Congress could act to lighten the overall regulatory
burden in other areas. Reform of deposit insurance and federal banking
laws, for example, could help the entire economy and would do much to
alleviate the credit crunch that has restrained job creation by small
and medium-sized businesses over the past three years. (See William G. 
Laffer III, "How to Reform America's Banking System," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No.  810, February 26, 1991; Victor A.  Canto,
"The Credit Crunch" (La Jolla, California:  A.B.  Laffer, V.A.  Canto
& Associates, April 20, 1990); Victor A.  Canto, "The Credit Crunch
Revisited" (La Jolla, California:  A.B.  Laffer, V.A.  Canto &
Associates, November 16, 1990); William C.  Dunkelberg and William J. 
Dennis, Jr., "The Small Business Credit Crunch" (Washington, D.C.: 
NFIB Foundation, December 1992); Paul Craig Roberts, "Economic
Dominoes," National Review, November 30, 1992, pp.  37-42.  As
predicted by Canto and confirmed by Dunkelberg and Dennis, the credit
crunch has mainly affected medium-sized businesses and larger small
businesses (that is, those small businesses with at least 40
employees).) 
<P>
      But besides dealing with specific regulations, the regulatory
process itself is badly in need of reform. What is needed is for the
President and Congress to force agencies to inform Americans of the
likely employment effects of proposed rules and to set priorities in
rule-making. If these reforms are instituted, the federal government's
regulation of the economy could be conducted with the fewest pink
slips for American workers.

INTRODUCTION
<P>

      He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither
      swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their
      substance. 
<P>
      
                      Thomas Jefferson, <BR>
                      The Declaration of Independence<P>



      What Thomas Jefferson wrote of King George III might just as
well have been written of the federal government under President
George Bush. The reason: America has experienced an enormous growth in
regulation over the last three years, due almost entirely to
legislation signed by Bush, and to the decisions of officials he has
appointed. This burgeoning red tape hinders the economy's recovery and
jeopardizes future economic progress. President Bush belatedly
recognized the explosion of re-regulation on January 28, when he
declared a ninety-day moratorium on new regulations and instructed
federal agencies to review the efficiency of old regulations. In light
of the findings that various government agencies indeed could
streamline regulations, the President extended the moratorium for an
additional 120 days.
<P>
      A slowdown in regulation is desperately needed. Under George
Bush: 
<P>
    <UL> <LI> The total annual length of the Federal Register, in which all
      new regulations are published, has grown from 53,376 pages in
      1988, President Ronald Reagan's last year, to 67,716 in 1991 --
      the third highest total ever.
<P>
     <LI>The number of federal employees devoted to issuing and
      enforcing regulations has risen from 104,360 in Reagan's last
      year to a new all-time high of 124,994, surpassing the previous
      record of 121,706 under President Jimmy Carter.
<P>
      <LI>The amount of money that the federal government spends each
       year administering its regulatory programs has increased by 18
       percent under Bush, from $9.558 billion in 1988 to $11.276
       billion in 1992, measured in constant 1987 dollars.</UL>
<P>
      As a result, regulation now is costing Americans somewhere
between $881 billion and $1.656 trillion annually, or between $8,388
and $17,134 per household. By way of comparison, Americans will pay an
estimated $1.053 trillion in federal taxes in 1992, or about $10,897
per household. Thus, it is possible that the total cost of regulation
now exceeds the total cost of taxation. 
<P>
      This surge in red tape did not happen in the face of
Administration opposition. In fact, the White House is directly
responsible for a good deal of it. For one thing, much of the growth
in regulation stems from new laws that were supported and signed by
the President, including the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Civil Rights Act of 1991,
and the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. For another,
many of Bush's appointees have been far more enthusiastic about
creating and enforcing rules than their predecessors in the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
Example: Just days after George Bush was sworn in as President, the
Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
significantly expanded the scope of federal regulation of wetlands. As
a result, thousands of landowners were told that they could not use
their own land because federal regulators now considered it to be a
wetland protected under the Clean Water Act. 
<P>
Example: While receiving considerably less attention than the EPA,
officials in the civil rights and antitrust divisions of the
Department of Justice, and antitrust officials at the Federal Trade
Commission, have been expanding the scope of their enforcement
activities well beyond that of their predecessors in the Reagan
Administration. 
<P>
Example: The Department of Justice under Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh, and the Department of Transportation under Secretary
Samuel Skinner, seemed to go out of their way to make their
regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act as onerous as
possible. 
<P>
      This new regulatory build-up is taking an increasing toll on the
economy. It is like a hidden tax. And just like a tax, regulation:
raises the prices paid by consumers;
<P>
      <UL><LI>lowers wages and increases unemployment;
<P>
      <LI>hurts the country's international competitiveness;
<P>
      <LI>increases uncertainty for businesses and reduces investment;   
      and
<P>
      <LI>impairs innovation.

</UL>
<P>      In large measure, the growth in regulation and its burden has
been due to a failure on the part of the President, Congress, and the
regulatory agencies to view regulation properly. In their desire to
"do good" in a particular area, they often fail to take sufficient
account of the broader consequences of their actions. Even when they
consider the costs of regulation, they generally fail to focus on the
burdens caused by regulation taken as a whole. In other words, they
fail to recognize that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.
To remedy this, government officials must avoid focusing simply on the
benefits and costs (let alone on the benefits alone) of each
particular regulation viewed in isolation; instead they must weigh the
expected benefits of each regulation against its added contribution to
the overall burden of all regulation.

<P>
THE PURPOSE OF REGULATION
<P>
      Government regulations ostensibly are intended to protect the
public. (Economists normally distinguish between "economic regulation"
and "social regulation." Economic regulation is the regulation of the
prices or quantities of the goods or services provided in a particular
industry, or of other economic factors such as the number of firms in
an industry or the freedom of firms to enter or leave an industry. The
term social regulation normally refers to regulation affecting health,
safety, or the environment, but generally can be used to describe any
regulation that is not economic. Whereas most forms of economic
regulation are industry-specific, social regulation usually applies to
many different industries.) Proponents of new regulation might claim
that they wish, for example, to protect workers from avoidable
injuries on the job, or to shield the public from pollution that could
endanger their health, or to prevent harm to consumers from defective
products. While these goals are admirable, policy makers often fail to
ask whether a new regulation will in fact accomplish its goals in the
most cost-effective manner. In particular, they may overlook less
costly ways to achieve the same result, enabling the public to gain
more protection for each dollar spent. They fail to ask whether the
costs in lost jobs or slower economic growth that result from
regulations are worth the amount of protection that accrues to the
public. And they do not fully consider market solutions that will
serve the public interest without imposing on the private sector the
heavy costs associated with traditional "command-and-control"
regulation. When examining regulations, policy makers must take
account of their full costs and impact if they are to determine
whether the regulations help or harm the public.
<P>
      The beneficial effects of much regulation are hard to find.
Economists Robert Hahn of the American Enterprise Institute and John
Hird of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst recently conducted
a survey of all existing studies on the benefits and costs of
regulation, and found only two major areas in which regulation
produces total benefits that probably exceed total costs --
environmental regulation and highway safety regulation. (Robert W.
Hahn and John A. Hird, "The Costs and Benefits of Regulation: Review
and Synthesis," Yale Journal on Regulation, Vol. 8, No. 1 (Winter
1991), p. 256.) Even in these two areas, there is strong evidence to
suggest that equal or greater benefits could be obtained at a
substantially lower cost to society.
<P>
      Uniformly Ineffective. Outside these two areas, regulation has
been found to be uniformly ineffective. For example, numerous studies
of the regulation of workplace safety by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration have found no significant effect on accident
rates, worker injuries, or illnesses. (W. Kip Viscusi, "The Impact of
Occupational Safety and Health Regulation, 1973-83," Rand Journal of
Economics, Winter 1986, pp. 567-580; Daniel P. McCaffrey, "An
Assessment of OSHA's Recent Effects on Injury Rates," Journal of Human
Resources, Winter 1983, pp. 131-146; W. Kip Viscusi, "The Impact of
Occupational Safety and Health Regulation," Bell Journal of Economics,
1979, pp. 117-140; Robert S. Smith, "The Impact of OSHA Inspections on
Manufacturing Injury Rates," Journal of Human Resources, Spring 1979,
pp. 145-170; John Mendeloff, Regulating Safety: An Economic and
Political Analysis of Occupational Safety and Health Policy
(Cambridge, Massachusetts: M.I.T. Press, 1979).) Likewise, a 1973
study of the Food and Drug Admin-istration's drug approval process,
undertaken by University of Chicago economist Sam Peltzman, found no
reduction in the proportion of unsafe or ineffective drugs reaching
consumers. (Sam Peltzman, "An Evaluation of Consumer Protection
Legislation: The 1962 Drug Amendments," Journal of Political Economy,
September 1973, pp. 1049-1091.) Similarly, numerous studies have found
that the Consumer Product Safety Commission has had no significant
impact on product safety. (See, e.g., W. Kip Viscusi, "Consumer
Behavior and the Safety Effects of Product Safety Regulation," Journal
of Law and Economics, Vol. 28, No. 3 (October 1985), pp. 527-553; Paul
H. Rubin, R. Dennis Murphy, and Greg Jarrell, "Risky Products, Risky
Stocks," Regulation, No. 1 (1988), pp. 35-39.) The evidence indicates
that the ban on cigarette advertisements on radio and television
imposed in 1970 reduced competition between brands -- especially by
eliminating ads containing health information -- and thereby slowed
the introduction of new brands lower in tar or nicotine. (John E.
Calfee, "The Ghost of Cigarette Advertising Past," Regulation,
November/December 1986, pp. 35-45; Lynne Schneider, Benjamin Klein,
and Kevin Murphy, "Government Regulation of Cigarette Health
Information," Journal of Law and Economics, December 1981, pp.
572-612.) Similarly, there is no evidence that civil rights
legislation has increased employment opportunities for minorities or
women. With the increase in employment-related litigation and record-
keeping costs that has resulted from the legislation, it is quite
possible that civil rights laws now actually reduce employment
opportunities for all people, including minorities.

<P>
REGULATION FROM NIXON TO REAGAN
<P>
      The great explosion in federal regulation began when President
Richard Nixon created a host of new regulatory agencies, including the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA), the Consumer Product Safety Commission,
and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Nixon also
signed a number of major pieces of regulatory legislation, including
the 1970 Clean Air Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act, and
imposed specific controls on areas ranging from to noise pollution, to
pension programs, to general wages and prices. (The core of what later
became the Clean Water Act -- the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972 -- also became law while Nixon was President, but
over his veto.) The brief Presidency of Gerald Ford continued and
expanded the red tape of the Nixon years, although Ford did remove
most of Nixon's wage and price controls.
<P>
      Jimmy Carter's record was a mixed one. Carter tightened
environmental regulations, created the Department of Energy, and tried
to impose race and sex quotas on businesses through civil rights
enforcement. Yet Carter also championed significant deregulation of
air travel, railroads, and trucking. Further, he removed restrictions
on the rate of interest that banks and other depository institutions
could pay to their depositors, and took the first important steps
toward the eventual decontrol of oil prices. 
<P>
      Ronald Reagan proposed relatively little deregulatory
legislation. His main legislative strategy was to try to block --
usually successfully, through the use or threat of his veto --
legislation that would have increased red tape and slowed economic
growth. More important, Reagan took steps to reduce the volume of
administrative rules issued by government officials. Among the most
important actions, Reagan:<P>
 <UL> Issued Executive Order No. 12291, requiring all Executive 
      Branch agencies to estimate the benefits and costs of any 
      new regulations they wished to issue;
<P>
      Designated the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
      (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
      as a central office for conducting all cost-benefit review 
      of regulations; (OIRA was created under Carter; Reagan 
      expanded its mission.) 
<P>
      Established a Task Force on Regulatory Relief, headed by 
      then Vice President George Bush; and
<P>
      Appointed to most cabinet departments and independent 
      agencies individuals who favored a reduction in regulation, 
      and significantly reduced the staffing of most regulatory
      agencies.</UL>
<P>

RE-REGULATION UNDER BUSH
<P>
      Although George Bush projects himself as an avid foe of
regulation, his Presidency has seen an enormous resurgence of
regulation.
<P>

Example: The total annual length of the Federal Register, in which all
new regulations are published, declined during the eight-year tenure
of Ronald Reagan by 33,636 pages, from an all-time high of 87,012 in
Jimmy Carter's last year, 1980, down to 53,376 in 1988. (All figures
reported in this study for the number of pages in the Federal Register
either were obtained from, or else calculated on the basis of data
provided by, the Office of the Federal Register.) In less than four
years, the annual number of pages under the Bush Administration has
risen by 14,340 pages. Last year's total of 67,716 pages was the third
highest ever, surpassed by only two of Carter's four years.

<P>
Example: The staffing level of federal regulatory agencies has
increased sharply. The number of federal employees devoted to issuing
and enforcing regulations fell by 17,346 under Reagan, from a then
record 121,706 in Carter's last year down to 104,360 in 1988. Under
Bush, however, 20,634 new bureaucrats have been added, for a new all-
time high of 124,994 regulatory employees. 
<P>

Example: The amount of money that the federal government spends each
year administering its regulatory programs also has soared. Measured
in constant 1987 dollars, federal regulatory spending grew by only
$778 million over the entire course of Reagan's two terms in office,
rising from $8.780 billion in Carter's last year to $9.558 billion in
Reagan's last year. Bush, however, has increased federal regulatory
spending more than twice as much as Reagan, and in only half as much
time. In constant dollars, regulatory spending has risen by $1.718
billion under Bush, from $9.558 billion to $11.276 billion. (All
figures reported in this study for federal regulatory staffing and
spending either were obtained from, or else calculated on the basis of
data provided by, the Center for the Study of American Business,
Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.) 
<P>
      Some of the blame for the growth in regulation under Bush lies
with the individuals Bush has appointed. With only a handful of
exceptions, these appointees are far more prone to issue regulations
and support regulatory legislation that their Reagan predecessors. For
example, although EPA Administrator William Reilly maintains he tries
not to impose undue regulatory burdens on businesses and households,
he and his agency have been at the forefront of the regulatory build-
up during the last three years. A case in point: Just days after
George Bush had been sworn in as President, the EPA and the Army Corps
of Engineers significantly expanded the scope of federal wetlands
regulations. Land that had standing water for as little as seven days
per year could be subject to federal control as a "wetland," as could
land that was dry at the surface but moist within eighteen inches of
the surface. In some cases this meant prohibiting farmers from
planting crops on their own land and stopping home gardeners from
planting flowers. In one case a man was jailed for clearing away old
tires and putting fill dirt on his own land as a base for a garage.
(See William G. Laffer III, "Protecting Ecologically Valuable Wetlands
without Destroying Property Rights," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
No. 840, July 15, 1991.) Likewise, officials in charge of civil rights
and antitrust at the Department of Justice, and antitrust officials at
the Federal Trade Commission, have been quietly expanding the scope of
their enforcement activities well beyond that of their predecessors in
the Reagan Administration. (See, e.g., Charles F. Rule, "Back to the
Dark Ages of Antitrust," The Wall Street Journal, June 17, 1992, p.
A17. Rule was Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust
Division at the Department of Justice from 1986 to 1989.) 
<P>
      However, the principal driving force behind the growth in
regulation over the last three years has been legislation --
legislation which in every major instance has been signed and usually
supported by President Bush. Several laws in particular have meant a
surge in new regulation.
<P>

The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments 
<P>
      Environmental regulation accounts for the largest share of the
recent explosion of regulations. Bush promised during the 1988
campaign to support a new clean air bill, and he was instrumental in
securing its passage. Estimates of the cost of the legislation vary,
but all are huge. Murray Weidenbaum, former chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisors under Reagan and now Director of the Center for the
Study of American Business at Washington University in Saint Louis,
estimates that the law "will cost an added $25-35 billion a year, over
and above the more than $100 billion [already] spent annually on all
pollution controls." (Murray Weidenbaum, The New Wave of Business
Regulation, Contemporary Issues Series No. 40 (St. Louis, Missouri:
Center for the Study of American Business, December 1990), pp. 3-4.)
Economist Paul Portney of Resources for the Future, a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank specializing in environmental issues, estimates
that the new law will cost between $29 billion and $36 billion a year
while providing only about $14 billion a year in benefits. (Paul R.
Portney, "Economics and the Clean Air Act," Journal of Economic
Perspectives, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Fall 1990), pp. 173-181.) A spokesman for
the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents
about a half-million small firms, describes the Act as "probably one
of the most complex pieces of regulation... ever passed" and has
predicted that the legislation "is going to be a nightmare for small-
business people." (Quoted in Jonathan Rauch, "The Regulatory
President," National Journal, November 30, 1991, p. 2905.)

<P>
The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
<P>
      Although described as a "civil rights" bill by its supporters,
including President Bush, the ADA does much more than simply prohibit
discrimination against the disabled. It also requires owners of
private businesses, apartment buildings, restaurants, and stores to
make -- at their own expense -- various physical modifications to
their premises, such as widening doorways and installing wheelchair
ramps, in order to accommodate the disabilities of current and
potential employees, tenants, and customers. Likewise, hotels and auto
rental companies must go to the extra expense of including wheelchair
lifts on all their new pick-up vans. And similarly, public transit
systems are required to install wheelchair lifts on all new buses. 
<P>
      While discrimination against the disabled is contemptible, the
ADA has little to do with the prevention of discrimination. As the
President's Council of Economic Advisors has acknowledged, the ADA
actually is a mandated benefit program. (Economic Report of the
President (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, February
1992), pp. 272-273.) Rather than providing these benefits openly by
spending tax dollars, the government taxes Americans implicitly by
commanding private parties to spend their own money.
<P>
      As with many government regulations, it is questionable whether
the benefits that accrue to the disabled from the ADA will be worth
the cost. In the case of many enterprises or places of employment in
many parts of the country, there might be few or no disabled customers
or workers currently facing significant obstacles. In these cases,
forcing each business to spend thousands or even hundreds of thousands
of dollars to comply with the letter of the law makes little economic
sense, and in some cases may endanger the survival of the business
(See Robert P. O'Quinn, "The Americans with Disabilities Act: Time for
Amendments," Cato Institute Policy Analysis No. 158, August 9, 1991.)
Moreover, Bush Administration officials have made the ADA even more
costly than it had to be. In many instances, the implementing
regulations require particular methods of compliance even though other
methods might be far less expensive yet of greater benefit to the
disabled.
<P>
Example: Airlines will be required to modify all aisle seats on one
side or another of their planes so that people in wheelchairs will
have an easier time getting in and out of the seats -- even though, on
average, only one passenger out of every 25 flights uses a wheelchair.
Since the required modifications are expected to cost the airlines
somewhere in the neighborhood of $40 million, it would have been less
expensive for the airlines if the government simply had required them
to let passengers in wheelchairs fly free-of-charge in the first class
section, whose seats already can accommodate a person with a
wheelchair.
<P>
Example: The Act requires all new buses purchased by public transit
systems to be equipped with wheelchair lifts. Thus will raise the
price of a new bus by about $15,000, and will raise the cost of
operating and maintaining each bus in a transit system's fleet by
about $5,000 per year. Since the vast majority of riders do not use
wheelchairs, it probably would be cheaper for public transit systems
to serve disabled passengers with a special fleet of mini-vans
equipped with the necessary lifts, which could then give the disabled
passengers door-to-door service. (See Nancy Traver, "Opening Doors for
the Disabled," Time, June 4, 1990, p. 54.)
<P>
      While difficult to calculate, the cost of the ADA may even
approach that of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Whether or not the ADA ends
up surpassing the Clean Air Act in cost will depend entirely on how it
is enforced, and the statute gives the regulators enormous leeway.
(See O'Quinn, op. cit., for a good discussion -- with many specific
examples -- of how open-ended the ADA is.) According to Chicago-based
economic consultant Robert Genetski, the required physical
modifications of office buildings and hospitals alone may cost some
$65 billion. And that figure does not take into account other huge
costs, such as the costs of equipping trains, buses, rental cars,
restaurants, hotels, or other public facilities. (Robert Genetski,
"The True Cost of Government," The Wall Street Journal, February 19,
1992, p. A18.) In addition to the direct cost of all these
modifications, the Act is certain to foster an enormous amount of
costly litigation.

<P>
The 1991 Civil Rights Act 
<P>
      Ostensibly an attempt merely to restore civil rights law to
where it stood before a series of Supreme Court decisions in 1988,
this legislation radically changed federal employment discrimination
law. It made it easier for employees to sue employers, harder for
employers to defend themselves successfully -- even when they are
innocent of any actual discrimination -- and more expensive for
employers when they lose cases. The new law allows the proportion of
workers of various races in an employer's work force to be used as
prima facie evidence of discrimination, and the employer must prove
that he is innocent rather than the plaintiffs proving that he is
guilty. (See William G. Laffer III, "Why Kennedy-Hawkins Will Mean
Quotas," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 159, July 2, 1990;
William G. Laffer III, "Why the So-Called 'Civil Rights' Bill Would
Still Mean Quotas," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 302,
June 3, 1991; William G. Laffer III, "The Danforth 'Compromise':
Another Quota Civil Rights Bill," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
Update No. 168, October 7, 1991.)
<P>
      The additional costs due to litigation and fines will act like a
tax on employment. With each new job an employer creates, his record-
keeping burdens and chances of being sued will increase. (In order to
be able to defend themselves in the event that they are sued, most
employers now keep detailed records on the race and sex of all job
applicants. Such records became even more important for an employer to
have after Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1990, yet
employers would not have to keep them at all were it not for the civil
rights laws.) Even if an employer tries to avoid litigation by using
quotas for minorities and women, he can never completely eliminate the
risk of being sued over the racial composition of his work force.
Moreover, an employer who uses quotas risks being sued for deliberate
discrimination by those whom the quota excludes. And even if the
employer is lucky enough not to be sued, his work force will be less
productive because he was forced to hire by race and sex instead of
merit. Thus, no matter which way an employer turns, the cost of
creating jobs and employing people will have risen. The end result of
the new "civil rights" law is unambiguous: It will cost the economy
jobs, lower wages, and make American firms less competitive. 

<P>
Other Regulatory Burdens
<P>
      Other legislative initiatives signed by Bush include the 1989
increase in the federal minimum wage, the Nutrition Labeling and
Education Act of 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, and
increased authority for the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). When
all of Bush's regulatory initiatives are added together, and combined
with the increased staffing and budgets at the various federal
regulatory agencies and the new, more vigorous and far-reaching
enforcement policies that have been adopted by so many of Bush's key
appointees, it becomes clear that Bush is responsible for an enormous
increase in federal regulation. Indeed, according to a National
Journal article entitled "The Regulatory President," American business
under George Bush has experienced "the most imposing over-all
extension of regulatory authority since Nixon." (Rauch, op. cit., p.
2905.)

<P>
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE
<P>
      There have been several bright spots in the battle against
regulation during Bush's term. Shortly after he was inaugurated, for
example, Bush created the Council on Competitiveness, headed by Vice
President Dan Quayle. The Council's task is to review major new
regulations with a view toward reducing the burden of regulation where
possible, and to act as a referee when different Executive Branch
agencies disagree. 
<P>
      The Council's staff, however, is quite small. Thus it is able to
review only a handful of the annual flood of regulations that the
Executive Branch issues. Last year, for example, the Council was
actively involved in drafting only some fifty to sixty regulations,
whereas the total number of regulations issued by agencies within the
Executive Branch was on the order of 2,000 to 3,000. (Rauch, op. cit.,
p. 2902. In addition, many regulations are issued each year by
independent agencies which are not part of the Executive Branch and
hence are not directly answerable to the President or the Council on
Competitiveness.) Moreover, even when the Council does review an
issue, it often must deal with agency personnel who resent having
their power to manage the economy questioned or curtailed. Lack of
cooperation and sometimes outright resistance on the part of agencies
make the Council's task even more difficult and limit its
effectiveness.
<P>
      Bad Advice. Another source of dashed expectations is OMB's
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), the agency
responsible for ensuring that new regulations do not cost more than
the benefits they provide. Despite the urging of his most loyal
advisors, including Vice President Quayle, White House Counsel C.
Boyden Gray, and Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors Michael
Boskin, President Bush has failed to give OIRA the support it needs to
assure that regulations impose the least burden on the economy.
Instead, Bush listened to OMB Director Richard Darman, the same
advisor who persuaded the President to break his solemn "no new taxes"
promise to the American people, and has refused to appoint a permanent
head of OIRA. Because Bush has not given OIRA the support it needs,
OIRA has been preoccupied with defending itself against congressional
attacks instead of taking the offensive against onerous regulation.
(William G. Laffer III, "Muzzling OIRA: An Attempt to Thwart Bush's
War on Regulations," Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum No. 304,
July 15, 1991.)
<P>
      Some Constructive Reforms. Recognizing the burden that
regulation places on the economy, George Bush announced this January
28 a ninety-day moratorium on most new regulations that could hamper
economic growth. As part of the moratorium, regulatory agencies were
instructed to evaluate their existing regulations and to devise
initiatives that would streamline regulation and create jobs and
economic growth. A few agencies announced constructive reforms during
that period. The Food and Drug Administration, for example, proposed
to expedite somewhat its procedures for approving new drugs, and the
Securities and Exchange Commission has taken steps to make it easier
for smaller businesses to raise capital by selling stock. But as the
magnitude of the regulatory crisis became apparent, the original
ninety-day moratorium was extended an additional 120 days, through the
end of August. 
<P>
      There is only so much that a moratorium of this sort -- focused
mainly on new regulations -- can accomplish. While less new red tape
is, of course, a relief for business, the regulations put into place
during the last three years continue to burden the economy.
Unfortunately, since most of these new regulations have been mandated
by legislation, which the President signed, they cannot now be
repealed except with the unlikely cooperation of Congress.

<P>
THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF GROWING REGULATION
<P>
      Although the amount of money that the federal government spends
each year to administer its regulatory programs -- nearly $13.6
billion for 1992 -- is one of the costs of regulation, it is trivial
in comparison with the costs imposed on businesses, private citizens,
and state and local governments. For example, a ban on a particular
product may cost very little to enforce, and may even entail very
little in the way of direct compliance costs for the private sector,
such as paperwork requirements or litigation. Yet the full economic
cost of the ban might be very heavy in terms of higher prices and
reduced choices for consumers.
<P>
      In order to gauge the true cost of regulation, as well as any
increases or decreases in that cost over time, policy makers must look
at the full range of effects each regulation has, not just at the
direct enforcement and compliance costs. No regulation can be
evaluated properly in isolation. Like two harmless chemicals that when
mixed create a dangerous explosive, two moderately harmful regulations
can result in serious economic damage. The existence of other
regulations can make any new regulation more costly than it otherwise
would have been. Likewise, adoption of additional regulations can make
previously existing regulations more costly than they were before.
Thus, the true cost to be considered and weighed against any potential
benefits is not the cost that a new regulation would impose in
isolation, but the addition that it would make to the burden caused by
all regulations taken together. 
<P>
      When regulations are viewed as a whole rather than in isolation,
they are seen to act as a hidden tax. This tax takes the form of such
things as compliance expenditures, time lost due to paperwork
requirements, delays in the processing and issuance of permits
required by government, and attorney fees incurred in regulation-
related litigation. 
<P>
      Just like any other tax, moreover, regulation imposes broad
economic costs on Americans. Among the most important economic
consequences:
<P>
 <UL> Regulation raises prices paid by consumers and thereby 
      lowers living standards.</UL>
<P>
      Regulations impose substantial compliance costs which must be
borne by someone. These costs are borne in part by businesses'
employees and stockholders. To some extent, however, businesses pass
these costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices.
Regulatory costs can account for a substantial portion of the total
price consumers pay for a product or service -- for example,
regulation adds up to one-third of the price of a single-engine
airplane and over 95 percent of the price of vaccines for children.
(Peter W. Huber, Liability: The Legal Revolution and Its Consequences
(New York: Basic Books, 1988), p. 3.) 
<P>
      Regulation lowers wages and increases unemployment.
<P>
      Some regulations have a direct and immediate impact on wages and
employment. The minimum wage law, federal labor laws, and federal
civil rights laws, for example, all tend to increase the cost of
employing workers and thereby decrease the levels of wages or
employment, and sometimes both. Other regulations affect wages and
employment indirectly, but just as significantly. Banking and
environmental regulations, for example, both reduce the overall level
of economic activity. Each has contributed to the current recession
and helped to cause the private sector's loss of some 1.5 million jobs
since January 1990. (David Littmann, "The Cost of Regulation, Counted
in Jobs," The Wall Street Journal, April 21, 1992, p. A16.) 
<P>
      In some instances, job losses can be attributed directly to some
regulation. Example: Many studies have proven that the federal minimum
wage law increases unemployment rates significantly, especially among
minorities and teenagers who do not yet have the skills to command a
wage higher than the legal minimum. (See, for example, Peter Linneman,
"The Economic Impacts of Minimum Wage Laws: A New Look at an Old
Question," Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 90, No. 3 (June 1982),
pp. 443-469; Daniel S. Hamermesh, "Minimum Wages and the Demand for
Labor," Economic Inquiry, Vol. 20 (July 1982), pp. 365-380; James F.
Ragan, Jr., "Mini- mum Wage Legislation: Goals and Realities,"
Nebraska Journal of Economics and Business, Vol. 17 (Autumn 1978), pp.
21-28; Robert T. Falconer, "The Minimum Wage: A Perspective," Federal
Reserve Bank of New York Quarterly Review, Autumn 1978, pp. 3-6.)
Another example: Efforts to protect the spotted owl under the
Endangered Species Act have cost thousands of jobs in the logging
industry and many additional jobs in communities where logging is the
principal industry.
<P>
      In most instances, however, it will not be apparent that
regulation is responsible. This is because regulation of one part of
the economy can affect all other parts as well. For example, a recent
study in the prestigious Journal of Political Economy by economists
Michael Hazilla of American University and Raymond Kopp of Resources
for the Future found that environmental regulations reduce output and
productivity in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries
even though these industries produce no pollution themselves and
require no direct investment in pollution abatement equipment. Hazilla
and Kopp found that all sectors of the economy are affected by
environmental regulations. These regulations cause the costs of such
inputs to the production process as labor, raw materials, and
electricity to rise, and cause savings, investment and capital
formation to fall. (Michael Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp, "Social Costs
of Environmental Quality Regulations: A General Equilibrium Analysis,"
Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 98, No. 4 (1990), pp. 853-873.)
<P>
 <UL> Regulation increases uncertainty for business and 
      reduces investment.</UL>
<P>
      Regulations reduce the rate of return on investments made in the
United States and encourage firms to move overseas. Moreover, the
threat of future regulation adds to the economic uncertainty that
businesses must face, and hence discourages long-term investment. By
changing or reinterpreting the fine print of regulations, for example,
government bureaucrats, the courts, or Congress itself can destroy the
value of existing investments. Rather than risk making large
investments that regulators might make worthless in the future,
therefore, businesses have an incentive to shy away from large, long-
term investments, and to seek instead shorter-term profits.
<P>
      The steel industry, for example, is especially sensitive to
uncertainty because it requires substantial investments in physical
assets that are expected to last for fifty years or longer. But since
environmental and workplace safety regulations can have a decisive
impact on a steel plant's profitability, it is not surprising that
investment in modern equipment by American steel producers faltered in
the 1970s relative to that undertaken by their foreign competitors.
(See, for example, Arthur B. Laffer and Marc A. Miles, International
Economics in an Integrated World (Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresman
and Company, 1982), pp. 126-127.) 
<P>
      An additional hidden cost associated with this uncertainty is
the "political investment" many U.S. industries make in trying to
influence the certainty, scale, and share of regulation and other
government activity. Estimates of the size of this political
investment vary considerably, with most ranging between 3 percent and
12 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or around $170 billion to
$680 billion per year. (Jonathan Rauch, "The Parasite Economy,"
National Journal, April 25, 1992, pp. 983-984.) Whatever the true
figure is, only part of it is due to regulation, and it is impossible
to tell how much; the rest consists of efforts to obtain special
favors in the tax code or a share of government spending. However, all
of this political investment represents pure waste -- nothing of value
is created by it.<P>
Regulation impairs innovation.<P>
      Regulation discourages investment in the development of new
technologies, manufacturing processes, and product designs. While this
is true to some extent of all regulations and all kinds of innovation,
certain particular regulations are especially destructive of
particular kinds of innovation. For example, the 1962 amendments to
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act significantly complicated the
FDA drug approval process. According to several studies, this doubled
the cost of developing drugs in the United States. (See, e.g., Martin
Neil Baily, "Research and Development Cost and Returns: The U.S.
Pharmaceutical Industry," Journal of Political Economy
(January/February 1972), pp. 70-85; Henry G. Grabowski, Drug
Regulation and Innovation (Washington, D.C.: American Enterprise
Institute, 1976); William Wardell, "More Regulation or Better
Therapies?" Regulation (September/October 1979), pp. 25-33.) The
amendments reduced the number of new drugs approved each year by
nearly two-thirds, from an average of 46 new drugs per year before the
amendments to an average of only sixteen new drugs per year after the
amendments. (Steve H. Hanke and Stephen J.K. Walters, "Social
Regulation: A Report Card," Journal of Regulation and Social Costs,
Vol. 1, No. 1 (September 1990), p. 17. Although one might suppose that
the 1962 amendments merely prevented the introduction of unsafe or
ineffective drugs that previously were slipping past the FDA, the
evidence does not support this view. University of Chicago economist
Sam Peltzman has found the proportion of ineffective drugs to be the
same after the amendments as before. Peltzman, op. cit. Under the
auspices of the Council on Competitiveness, the Bush Administration
recently proposed several measures that would streamline the FDA drug
approval process. See Paul H. Rubin, "Regulatory Relief or Power Grab:
Should Congress Expand FDA's Enforcement Authority?" Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 900, June 11, 1992.) Judicial regulation
through tort law also has hampered innovation and competitiveness in a
variety of industries, including the pharmaceutical industry and the
emerging biotechnology industry. (See, e.g., Peter W. Huber,
"Biotechnology and the Regulation Hydra," Technology Review, Vol. 90,
No. 8 (November/December 1987), pp. 57-65.)
<P>
 <UL> Regulation imposes especially heavy burdens on small 
      and medium-sized businesses.</UL>
<P>
      Large firms generally can absorb the cost of complying with
regulatory programs more easily than smaller firms. Small and medium-
sized firms find it more difficult to afford the high overhead costs
of processing paperwork, paying attorney and accountant fees, and
committing staff time to negotiating the federal regulatory maze.
Indeed, some well-established large corporations sometimes support
regulation because, although a new rule may raise costs for all
businesses, small competitors will be harder hit or even put out of
business. (See Ann P. Bartel and Lacy Glenn Thomas, "Direct and
Indirect Effects of Regulation: A New Look at OSHA's Impact," Journal
of Law and Economics, Vol. 28, No. 1 (April 1985), pp. 1-25; Ann P.
Bartel and Lacy Glenn Thomas, "Predation Through Regulation: The Wage
and Profit Effects of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency," Journal of
Law and Economics, Vol. 30, No. 2 (October 1987), pp. 239-264; B.
Peter Pashigian, "The Effects of Regulation on Optimal Plant Size and
Factor Shares," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. 27, No. 1 (April
1984), pp. 1-28; B. Peter Pashigian, "Environmental Regulation: Whose
Self Interests Are Being Protected?" Economic Inquiry, Vol. 23, No. 4
(October 1985), pp. 551-584.) Since smaller firms tend to be more
innovative and create more new jobs than large firms, the regulation-
induced bias in favor of large firms over small firms has the effect
of reducing the rate of innovation and new employment.
Regulation increases federal and state budget deficits.
    <P>  By reducing overall economic growth, regulation shrinks the tax
base and reduces the amount collected by every specific tax. Although
the amounts involved can be estimated only roughly, as explained
below, the federal and state governments would raise more in taxes
each year if the burden imposed on the economy by regulation were
lower and the economy expanding faster.
<P>

HOW REGULATION CAN REDUCE HEALTH AND SAFETY
<P>
      Although much if not most social regulation is designed to
promote health and safety, many regulations actually do just the
opposite. This is by far the most important non-economic cost of
regulation.
<P>
      Regulation can reduce health and safety and increase mortality
in a variety of ways:
<P>
Example: Federal drug-approval laws and state tort laws reduce the
availability and increase the prices of life-saving drugs and medical
treatments. (See, for example, Peltzman, op. cit.; Rubin, op. cit.,
pp. 8-9; Sam Kazman, "Deadly Overcaution: FDA's Drug Approval
Process," Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 1, No. 1
(September 1990), pp. 35-54; Louis Lasagna, "The Chilling Effect of
Product Liability on New Drug Development," in Peter W. Huber and
Robert E. Litan, eds., The Liability Maze (Washington, D.C., The
Brookings Institution, 1991), pp. 334-359.)
<P>
Example: In order to comply with federal fuel economy standards,
automobile manufacturers have been forced to reduce the weight of
their cars. But lighter cars tend to be less safe than heavier ones.
Further, manufacturers are penalized for introducing safety features
that might add to the weight of a car. With the fuel economy standard
for automobiles at its current level of 27.5 miles per gallon, Robert
Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham of the Harvard
School of Public Health calculate that between 2,200 and 3,900 more
highway deaths and some 11,000 to 19,500 more serious injuries occur
over the lifetime of each model year's cars than would have occurred
without the standards. (Robert W. Crandall and John D. Graham, "The
Effect of Fuel Economy Standards on Automobile Safety," Journal of Law
and Economics, Vol. XXXII (April 1989), pp. 111-116. A federal appeals
court recently ordered the Department of Transportation to reconsider
its 1989 decision not to lower the standard from its current level of
27.5 miles per gallon to 26.5 miles per gallon, but the current
standard will still remain in effect until the Department sets a new
standard. Competitive Enterprise Institute v. National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, 956 F.2d 321 (D.C. Cir. 1992).)
<P>
Example: A proposed law requiring a parent traveling by airline with
an infant to purchase a separate seat for the child would make air
travel prohibitively expensive for many families and induce families
to drive instead of fly. Since flying is far safer than driving, the
result would be more infant travel deaths, not fewer.
<P>
      In these, as in many other cases of well-meaning regulation that
imposes costs on a family, it is mainly the poor who suffer the
unintended side effects, because poorer families cannot afford to pay
the extra money for such things as larger, heavier cars or another
airline seat. 
<P>
      Regulation can also reduce health and safety indirectly. Many
studies have documented that mortality rates decline in wealthier
societies, because these societies have more to spend on healthier and
safer products, and on better medical care. Since regulation slows
economic growth, it tends to reduce such lifestyle improvements. In
the early 1970s, for instance, when the U.S. economy slowed and
unemployment rates rose, mortality rates rose as well. While the
relationship between regulatory costs and increased mortality is
difficult to quantify precisely, two office of Management and Budget
(OMB) economists recently surveyed the relevant literature and
estimated that one additional premature death occurs for every $1.8
million to $7.25 million of additional regulatory costs imposed on the
economy. (The existing literature on this point has been summarized in
the Federal Register, Vol. 57, No. 114 (June 12, 1992), pp.
26005-26009. See also Aaron Wildavsky, Searching for Safety (New
Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Books, 1988) (especially Chapter 3,
"Richer Is Sicker v. Richer Is Safer"); Daniel J. Mitchell, "The
Deadly Impact of Federal Regulations," Journal of Regulation and
Social Costs, Vol. 2, No. 2 (June 1992) (forthcoming), pp. 45-56.)
Wealthier truly is healthier. 

<P>
THE TOTAL COST OF REGULATION
<P>
      The overall cost of social regulation, which purports to protect
health and safety, has risen since the Nixon years. Limited
deregulation that took place between 1978 and 1988 in the areas of
transportation, energy, telecommunications, and banking, (Although
banks by and large have not been deregulated, the federal government
did remove its restrictions on the interest rates that banks pay to
their depositors.) did cause the cost of economic regulation to fall
for about a decade. Because the decline in the cost of economic
regulation outweighed the growth in the cost of social regulation
during this period, estimates by Thomas D. Hopkins, former Deputy
Administrator of the Office of Management and Budget's Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, and now a professor of economics
at the Rochester Institute of Technology, suggest that the total cost
of federal regulation fell by between 15 and 22 percent from 1977 to
1988. (These percentages were calculated based on figures provided by
Thomas D. Hopkins in "Cost of Regulation," Rochester Institute of
Technology Working Paper, December 1991, Tables 5A and 5B. An abridged
version of this paper, which does not contain the various tables,
appears in the Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 2, No. 1
(March 1992), pp. 5-31.)
<P>
      However, because there was almost no major deregulation after
1988, the cost of economic regulation no longer is falling. Meanwhile,
the cost of social regulation, particularly in the area of the
environment, has continued rising, especially since Bush took office.
Taking economic and social regulation together, the total cost of
federal regulation has climbed by some 10 percent to 12 percent since
1988, according to Hopkins's numbers. (Ibid.) Moreover, if current
trends continue, the total cost of federal regulation can be expected
to rise by at least another 24 percent by the year 2000. (Percentages
for the year 2000 were calculated based on the figures provided by
Hopkins, ibid., supplemented by Murray Weidenbaum's estimate of the
cost of implementing the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, provided in
Weidenbaum, op. cit., p. 3.) In fact, the total cost of federal
regulation will have returned to its 1977 level by 1997 at the latest.
It may even reach this level by the end of this year, depending mainly
on how soon and how severely the regulatory costs of the Clean Air Act
Amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act are felt.
<P>
      Enormous Cost. To be sure, the precise cost of regulation is
extremely difficult to determine. Nonetheless, combining the estimates
of different scholars suggests that the direct costs of regulation on
the economy currently amount to at least some $635 billion to $857
billion per year, or between $6,565 and $8,869 annually per household.
Even after subtracting the applicable benefits of regulation, using
the most generous estimates available, the net direct cost of
regulation is some $364 billion to $538 billion per year, or between
$3,762 and $5,561 annually per household. These figures include the
costs to businesses and consumers of complying with environmental and
other social regulations, the total cost to consumers in the form of
higher prices and reduced choices due to economic regulations, the
costs imposed by government paperwork requirements, administrative
costs due to federal regulation of health care, and the direct costs
imposed by state tort law. These figures even include cost estimates
for two types of economic regulation which past studies have omitted
due to a lack of data -- banking regulation, and regulation of
electric utilities, although the estimates for banking regulation
still omit some important kinds of banking regulation. (In particular,
the cost estimates for banking regulation still do not account for the
costs of geographic restrictions, restrictions on banks' products,
services and investments, or minimum capital requirements.)
<P>
      These figures also include a range of estimates for the cost of
the Clean Air Act Amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
They do not, however, take account of the 1989 increase in the federal
minimum wage, the 1991 Civil Rights Act, the 1990 Nutrition Labeling
and Education Act, the 1990 Pollution Prevention Act, or the increase
in antitrust enforcement activity by the Justice Department and the
Federal Trade Commission. (In fact, these figures do not include any
estimate at all of the costs or benefits of antitrust or civil rights
laws, even aside from recent statutory or enforcement policy changes.)
Nor do they include the cost of federal government mandates on state
and local governments, or of most forms of state or local regulation.
<P>
      Most important, the cost estimates given do not include any of
the indirect, dynamic effects of regulation. In particular, the
figures do not include any estimate of the reduction in productivity
and output caused by the direct costs, or of the impact of regulation
on technological innovation. While the productivity effects are
difficult to quantify and the effect on innovation is impossible to
quantify, a number of studies suggest that, taken together, the
indirect costs due to reduced productivity and innovation probably are
greater than the direct costs counted above. (See, e.g., Hazilla and
Kopp, op. cit.; Dale W. Jorgenson and Peter J. Wilcoxen,
"Environmental Regulation and U.S. Economic Growth," Rand Journal of
Economics, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Summer 1990), pp. 314-340. Both studies
show that reductions in labor supply, savings and investment, growth
in the capital stock, and output tend to accumulate over time. As a
result, under each study the total costs imposed by environmental
regulation end up being more than twice as large as the direct
compliance costs alone. Indirect support for the notion that total
costs are probably at least twice as large as direct costs,
conventionally measured, is also provided by a number of studies cited
by Hahn and Hird, op. cit., pp. 255-258, dealing with economic
regulation in the transportation sector. As the comparison shows,
estimates of the costs of transportation regulation made before the
partial deregulation that occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s
were consistently and substantially below the levels of benefits that
were observed in the aftermath of deregulation.)
<P>
      Assuming instead that the indirect costs only amount to
somewhere between 50 percent and 100 percent of the direct costs, it
appears that the total cost of regulation, excluding those categories
already noted, and net of all benefits, could be anywhere between $811
billion and $1.656 trillion per year, or between $8,388 and $17,134
annually per household. (Although a regulatory cost estimate ranging
between 14.3 percent and 29.2 percent of total Gross Domestic Product
may seem high at first blush, it is actually quite plausible. Between
one-half and two-thirds of whatever figure one uses represents an
estimate of the amount by which GDP would have been greater, in the
absence of all unnecessary costs of regulation, than it actually will
be, and a considerable portion of the remainder represents losses that
are not currently counted in GDP because they do not involve market
transactions, such as the time spent preparing one's own tax return,
or in an airplane waiting to take off or land because federal
regulations do not allow airports to charge market-based takeoff and
landing fees. Thus, the percentage of currently recorded GDP that is
attributable to regulatory costs is much smaller than these estimates
might at first appear to suggest.)
<P>
      The additional cost of between $447 billion and $1.118 trillion
per year represents the amount by which Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
would exceed its current level ($5.672 trillion in 1991) in the
absence of all unnecessary costs due to state and federal regulation.
(Insofar as some types of regulation -- environmental regulation in
particular -- produce benefits as well as costs, one may not simply
assume that all of the costs of regulation can be eliminated. However,
even where existing regulations may produce benefits that exceed
costs, it often appears that the same or even greater benefits could
be obtained at a significantly lower cost by using better-designed,
more efficient forms of regulation. Consequently, in calculating the
foregoing figures, wherever a regulation appeared to produce net
benefits, no cost was counted except the difference (if any) between
the actual cost imposed by the regulation in question and the lower
cost that would be incurred under a more efficient regulatory scheme.
Because the necessary costs of benefit-justified regulation were
omitted in calculating net costs, so were the benefits. By definition,
the benefits of the regulations in question could have been obtained
without incurring the costs that were counted here. Under this
approach, the only benefits that need to be subtracted from costs are
the benefits of regulations whose benefits are less than costs.) Some
20 percent of this additional GDP, or approximately $83 billion to
$216 billion, would go to the federal government as increased tax
revenue, thus reducing the federal budget deficit.
<P>
      As noted previously, the cost figures just presented were net of
all applicable benefits. It is important to realize that economists
count transfers from one group to another as benefits as well as
costs. Thus, for example, if import restrictions on sugar cost
consumers $10 billion per year but enrich American sugar growers by $8
billion per year, economists treat the $8 billion as a benefit and
subtract it from the $10 billion gross cost to obtain a net cost of $2
billion. If transfers are not subtracted as benefits, then the total
cost of regulation works out to somewhere between $1.056 trillion and
$1.969 trillion per year, or between $10,922 and $20,376 per
household. By way of comparison, Americans will pay an estimated
$1.053 trillion in federal taxes in 1992, (This figure represents
total estimated federal tax receipts for 1992, net of refunds, income
from trust funds, earnings of the Federal Reserve System, and other
miscellaneous receipts. See Budget of the United States Government:
Fiscal Year 1993 , Supplement (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government
Printing Office, February 1992), Part Five, Tables 2.1 and 2.5.)or
about $10,897 per household. Although these estimates are subject to
considerable uncertainty, it is quite possible that the total cost of
regulation now exceeds the total cost of taxation. (Even if one
subtracts transfers and only compares efficiency losses, counting the
burden of tax-related paperwork under taxation rather than regulation,
it still turns out that regulation may now be more costly than
taxation.)

<P>
CONCLUSION<P>

      The U.S. economy is being strangled by new regulation, much of
which has come into being during George Bush's term of office. As a
result, the total cost to the economy of state and federal regulation
actually may now exceed the total cost of taxation. 
<P>
      In large measure, the growth in regulation and its burden has
been due to a failure on the part of the President, Congress, and the
regulatory agencies to consider the full cost of regulation. In their
desire to do good in a particular area, policy makers often fail to
take sufficient account of the broader consequences. Even when they
consider the costs of regulation, generally they fail to focus on the
burdens caused by regulation taken as a whole. 
<P>
      Much More Needed. Although President Bush often complains about
the burden placed on the economy by excessive regulation, only Richard
Nixon in the last two decades has done more to add to this burden.
Bush, however, is to be congratulated on his moratorium on new
Executive Branch regulations. This is a necessary first step in coming
to grips with the regulatory crisis. But much more needs to be done.
Bush should seek more resources for Vice President Quayle's
Competitiveness Council. And he should appoint a dynamic, activist
deregulator to head the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
Finally, he should highlight the many ways that the public health and
safety can be protected without the heavy hand of government.
<P>
      As the world becomes more economically integrated, and as
countries in Latin America and in the former communist bloc join the
ranks of the world's free market economies, American businesses will
face ever increasing competition. The U.S. no longer can afford to
cripple its enterprises with costly and unnecessary regulations.

INTRODUCTION<p>
<P>  Legislation now in Congress would add another layer of
regulation and significantly expand the enforcement authority of the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the federal agency that approves
drugs for safety and effectiveness. This legislation would slow down
the pace of approvals, increase consumer costs, and add reams of
unnecessary paperwork. Yet it would provide little or no benefit to
Americans. Meanwhile the Bush Administration, through the Council on
Competitiveness, has been taking administrative action to attempt to
streamline the regulatory process and speed up approval of new drugs
to treat such deadly diseases as AIDS, cancer, and cystic fibrosis. 

<P>The FDA is a division of the Public Health Service, itself an
agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It
is the largest consumer protection agency in the world, with
regulatory authority over food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices.
In fact, the FDA's vast authority covers approximately one-third of
all items consumed in the United States. Some 25 cents out of every
dollar spent in America is spent on products regulated by the FDA.

<P>The FDA is also a law enforcement agency. It is responsible for
enforcing the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and several other
statutes regarding foods, drugs, and medical devices. These include
the Biologics Act, the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, the Fair
Packaging and Labeling Act, and parts of many other statutes. (Peter
Barton Hutt and Richard A. Merrill, Food and Drug Law (Westbury, New
York: The Foundation Press, 1991), Appendix B.) One of the FDA's key
responsibilities is certifying prescription drugs as safe and
effective. 

<P>This April, Vice President Dan Quayle and HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan announced reforms in the FDA regulatory process to speed up
the availability of new drugs, especially to patients who are
desperately ill. The reforms were generated by the President's Council
on Competitiveness, chaired by Quayle, and are part of the
Administration's strategy to ease burdensome regulation. The FDA
reforms include "accelerated approval" of new "breakthrough drugs" for
patients with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's
disease, and cystic fibrosis. Under the new rules, for instance, AIDS
patients have the freedom to use experimental drugs outside of the
normal process of controlled clinical studies used to test a drug's
safety and effectiveness. The Bush Administration also has ordered the
FDA to rely upon outside experts, under contract, to review
applications for new drug approvals. It has ordered the agency to use
scientific data validating the safety of drugs from Japan and member
nations of the European Community as a basis for drug approval in the
United States. According to HHS Secretary Sullivan, these initiatives
are designed to save lives, cut the time required to bring new drugs
into the market, and enhance the competitiveness of American
pharmaceutical companies while retaining "rigorous" FDA oversight.
(HHS News, April 9, 1992.) While these reforms are well intentioned,
they must be administered by the FDA bureaucracy, and therefore their
impact is likely to be limited.

<P>While the Bush Administration is going ahead with regulatory
relief, Congress is considering the "Food, Drug, Cosmetic and Device
Enforcement Amendments of 1991" (H.R. 3642). (A word regarding
notation. A bill with the same title and with only slight
modifications was previously considered as H.R. 2597. Much of the
published analysis of the bill refers to "H.R. 2597." For consistency,
I will generally use H.R. 3642 in discussing this bill. Whenever a
direct quotation refers to "H.R. 2597," I will refer to [H.R. 3642].)
This would give the FDA sweeping new regulatory powers. The
legislation is sponsored by Representative Henry Waxman, the
California Democrat, and cosponsored by John Dingell, the Michigan
Democrat and Chairman of the powerful House Committee on Energy and
Commerce. 

<P>Some of the powers the bill confers on the agency are to:
administratively recall products with no court hearing; seize or
embargo products if an officer or employee of the FDA believes that a
product is in violation of the Act, with no requirement that the
violation be safety related, and no requirement of proof; subpoena
company records, including trade secrets and names of individuals in
medical files; and levy large fines. The Bush Administration is
opposed to the bill in its current form, but still might agree to some
form of the legislation. If some version of this bill becomes law,
costs of prescription drugs would rise and consumer health might well
suffer. 

<P>While the proposed increased enforcement authority will add to
manufacturers' costs, there is no reason to believe that the agency's
enhanced powers will have any beneficial effect in improving health.
For example, the FDA recently raised concerns about the safety of
silicone breast implants. But the FDA already has sufficient
administrative discretion to essentially ban breast implants under
current law without any new powers. Indeed, in the wake of the breast
implant episode, FDA is increasing regulation of all medical devices,
and is able to do so under current law. (Philip J. Hilts, "U.S. Cracks
Down on Health Devices Made Before 1976," The New York Times, February
24, 1992, p. 1; Bruce Ingersoll, "Changes Vowed for Reviewing Medical
Devices," The Wall Street Journal, March 26, 1992, p. A3.) Thus, even
if breast implants are determined to be unsafe, current law provides
adequate remedies. 

<P>There is no good case for the strengthened FDA enforcement
powers included in H.R.3642. Among the reasons:


<P>The FDA already has substantial enforcement authority. The agency has
a wide variety of powerful legal tools at its disposal, including
injunctions against food and drug firms, and recalls and seizures of
food and drug products. It also has powerful criminal sanctions. And
since the FDA regulates virtually all aspects of many food and drug
firms' business, it can use these powers to influence a firm's
commercial activities. 

<P>There is no evidence that current FDA enforcement policies are
harming consumers through ill-considered approvals or lax enforcement
of the law. Supporters of the bill have not presented convincing
evidence that consumers are harmed by lax enforcement. Advocates of
stronger enforcement authority focus on narrow bureaucratic
justifications for the proposed statute, such as consistency of
enforcement powers across all products the agency regulates.

<P>Congress already is concerned that FDA is not using its current
regulatory authority in a responsible fashion. For example,
Congressman Dingell, a strong supporter and co-sponsor of H.R. 3642,
has also recently criticized the FDA for abuse of the powers it
already possesses. The FDA is threatening to close Barr Laboratories,
a maker of generic drugs, which was the "whistleblower" regarding
misconduct at the FDA. Chairman Dingell is obviously aware that the
agency already has awesome power and that an abuse of that power is a
real danger. (Milt Freudenheim, "FDA Moves to Shut Drug Maker
Queried," The New York Times, November 7, 1991, p. C6.)

<P>Provisions of proposed legislation could be harmful to consumers.
H.R.3642, for example, increases FDA's powers to issue subpoenas,
demand record-keeping and inspections, issue recalls and embargoes,
and levy fines. All of these powers would lead to increased costs of
doing business for firms regulated by the FDA, which would be passed
on to consumers. But even more important, the threat of FDA
intervention and the increased risk of loss of trade-secret protection
would discourage firms from developing and marketing new products,
denying these to American consumers who could be helped by them.


<P>While strengthening FDA's enforcement authority may be
unnecessary, Congress should support genuine reforms that benefit
consumers, such as the Bush Administration's initiative to assure more
rapid drug approval procedures, allowing new drugs to become available
much more quickly to Americans who can benefit from them. Taking swift
action to approve a drug may mean that some drugs will reach the
market that pose some risks to patients. But painstaking certification
procedures also may pose risks, because a drug that may cure a
patient's illness is held back until every conceivable risk or side-
effect is checked out. Wisely, the Bush Administration realizes that
these risks should be weighed against potential consumer benefits.
Abundant statistical analysis, moreover, indicates that traditionally
the FDA has placed much more weight on the risk of action than of
inaction. By streamlining drug approval, rather than making the
process more lengthy and cumbersome, consumers will benefit. 

<P>The FDA now spends about one-half of its resources on
enforcement. (Alan L. Hoeting, "The FDA's Philosophy of Enforcement,"
Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal, Vol. 46, No. 2 (1991), p. 269.) But
the health of Americans has been suffering from delays in the approval
of new drugs, not from the inadequate inspection of foods and drugs.
For example, 204 new drugs were introduced in the U.S. from 1977 to
1987; of these, 114 were first available in Great Britain, and had
been available for an average of five years. Only 41 drugs approved in
Britain during this period were available in the U.S. first, and then
only for an average of two-and-a-half years, not five. (Sam Kazman,
"Deadly Overcaution: FDA's Drug Approval Process," Journal of
Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 1, No. 1 (September 1990), p. 40.)
The health of Americans will be improved by shifting FDA resources to
drug approval procedures, thus speeding up the approval of new drugs.
Instead of focussing on greater enforcement authority, Congress also
can amend the laws to make it even easier for the FDA to spend more on
drug approvals. (The argument is as follows: As of now, no consumer is
harmed from inadequate inspection but many consumers are harmed from
delays in drug approval. If the amount spent on inspection is
marginally reduced, some harm might begin to occur, but for small
shifts this harm would be small. On the other hand, shifting resources
towards faster drug approval would definitely provide large benefits
to consumers. Resources should be incrementally moved from enforcement
to approval until, at the margin, benefits to consumers from each
activity are equal.) Rather than simply adding another layer of
regulations, Congress could re-evaluate current FDA authorities and
clarify FDA's authority to protect commerce.  

<P>According to one source, "FDA lacks the resources to implement
all of the missions delegated to it by Congress." (Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, pp. 1240.) The agency openly admits that it does
not enforce "economic" provisions of its statute. (Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, p. 1056.) In effect, FDA already chooses to enforce
some laws but not others, and to enforce some laws more stringently
than others. In the meantime, it clearly has the power to shift
resources to drug approval from enforcement if it so desires. Such a
shift would greatly benefit the public health. 

<P>Congress appears to be going in another direction. By giving the
FDA greater regulatory power, proponents of H.R. 3642 would encourage
the agency to spend more resources on enforcement and therefore less
on drug approval. Thus, the incentives in this bill would move the
agency further away from efficiency, and would inadvertently lead to
greater health risks. 

<P>Congressional supporters of increased FDA enforcement powers
seem mainly concerned with bureaucratic consistency and avoiding bad
publicity for the agency if it fails to stop the marketing of a
product which carries minor risks -- even if that product could bring
benefits to millions. In fact, consistency could as easily be obtained
by streamlining the regulatory powers associated with some products as
by making the overview of less-regulated products more stringent. In
any case, bureaucratic consistency is a weak reed on which to hang a
major policy revision, particularly one which will impose substantial
costs and seems unlikely to provide any benefits other than
bureaucratic consistency.
<P>

THE FDA'S MASSIVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY<P>
Proponents of increased FDA enforcement authority argue that the
agency now has insufficient regulatory authority. Yet nothing is
further from the truth. The agency has enormous regulatory authority.
According to Alan L. Hoeting, the Director of the FDA's Office of
Enforcement, the FDA already has at its disposal 26 possible
enforcement tools. ( Hoeting, op. cit., p. 269.) The agency can, for
instance:

<P> Inspect pharmaceutical factories without warrant;
<BR>Seize batches of a product if the batch is adulterated 
or mislabeled;
<BR> Carry out multiple seizures, effectively eliminating a
product (or a company) from the market;
<BR> Avoid paying compensation if perishable products are
ruined pursuant to a seizure, even if the seizure turns
out to be groundless. 

<P>Indeed, says Hoeting, the agency is "vulnerable to criticisms of
untimely action" because it "has many internal discussions on the
selection of the proper regulatory tool." ( Ibid. Apparently
representatives of at least four types of offices (field office,
Center, General Counsel, Enforcement) must decide on which of the 26
available tools to use in a given instance.) Thus the FDA,
paradoxically, may be too slow in some instances in taking action,
precisely because it already has so many enforcement tools that it
cannot easily decide which to use. Such an agency does not need
additional regulatory powers.

<P>The agency can also inspect all food handling establishments.
FDA agents, for instance, can enter these businesses without notice
and spend as much time as they wish monitoring compliance with the
Food and Drug Act. (Statement of Peter Barton Hutt on behalf of the
Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc., regarding [H.R. 3642], June
27, 1991, p. 5.) In 1990, the FDA conducted approximately 20,000 such
inspections and analyzed about 29,500 samples. On a typical day, about
6,000 import entries into the U.S. are subject to review, and an
average of 100 entries, worth in total an average of $4,500,000, are
detained. (Hoeting, p. 268.)

<P>The FDA in addition has the authority to send warning letters to
companies. If these firms fail to convince FDA that its assessment of
the firm's products is incorrect, or fail to comply with its
directives, these companies may be subject to criminal prosecution.
(Hutt statement, pp. 8-9.) The FDA is clearly quite prepared to use
this power. (Steven M. Kowal, "Defending Food and Drug Criminal Cases
in a New Era of Criminal Enforcement," Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal,
Vol. 46, No. 2, pp. 273-309.) In fact, over 10 percent of cases
referred by the FDA to the Department of Justice have been criminal.
(Kowal, p. 274.) In most cases the FDA alleges crimes in addition to
violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. These include false
statements, mail and wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and
conspiracy. (Kowal, p. 276.) Under the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act,
which since 1987 has set sentencing guidelines for federal judges, the
size of a fine the FDA can levy has greatly increased. (Kowal, pp.
304-308.) Fines are now some multiple of the actual harm caused by the
offense, and can in principle be open-ended. It is now more likely
that officers of a firm who run afoul of the FDA will serve time in
prison. (Kowal, p. 273.)

<P>The FDA has perhaps the most sweeping powers of any regulatory
agency to impose criminal penalties on American citizens. Americans
can even be made subject to criminal sanctions without having known of
or participated in the conduct deemed illegal by the FDA. (Kowal, at
291.) According to Peter Barton Hutt, a former General Counsel of the
FDA, "It is easier for FDA to convict a food company or its officials
of a violation of the FD&C [the Food, Drug and Cosmetic] Act than it
is for the Drug Enforcement Agency to convict a cocaine dealer of a
violation of the Controlled Substances Act." (Hutt statement, pp.
7-8.)
<P>

The FDA's Informal Powers<P>
<P>Beyond its formal, legal authority, the FDA has substantial
informal coercive powers. One major power is simply publicity.
Official press releases containing negative information can discourage
consumers and impose tremendous costs on a firm. While the financial
impact of a FDA press statement can be devastating, the FDA makes
clear it will use the power of the press when it feels that this is
appropriate. (Hoeting, p. 270.)

<P>Publicity alone is a powerful tool. Adverse publicity can result
in substantial loss of reputation for a firm accused of making an
unsafe product. Johnson and Johnson, for example, lost an estimated $1
billion in the value of its reputation from the Tylenol poisonings,
even though the company was in no way culpable. (Mark Mitchell, "The
Impact of External Parties on Brand-Name Capital: The 1982 Tylenol
Poisonings and Subsequent Cases," Economic Inquiry, Vol. 27 (October
1989), pp. 601-618.)

<P>There are similar losses from government-mandated recalls.
Studies examining safety-related product recalls show that for
products recalled by the FDA and the Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), there is a substantial impact on the stock value of
the firms involved, even though many of the risks that trigger the
recalls are
 quite small. (Sam Peltzman and Gregg Jarrell "The Impact of Product
Recalls on the Wealth of Sellers," Journal of Political Economy, Vol.
93 (June 1985), pp. 512-536; Paul H. Rubin, R. Dennis Murphy, and
Gregg Jarrell, "Risky Products, Risky Stocks," Regulation, No.1
(19880, pp. 35-39.) There are of course direct costs of recalls, but
the loss in firm value caused by FDA-mandated recalls is much greater
than this direct cost, and larger than any potential product liability
exposure as well. The additional loss in firm value is the loss in the
value of the reputation of the firm. For both FDA and CPSC recalls,
the average loss in value as a result of a recall is about 6 percent
of the value of the firm, as measured by stock value. (Peltzman and
Jarrell; Rubin et al.) Thus, adverse FDA publicity can impose
substantial costs on firms.
<P>Beyond recalls, any publicized concern relating to safety can
inflict large costs on a firm. Charges of product tampering, for
example, can seriously damage a firm's reputation, even though there
may be no realistic way in which a firm could have prevented the
tampering, and even if the potential risk due to tampering is
minuscule. (Mitchell, op. cit.) News stories on product-liability
suits, which indicate safety problems with products, can also lead to
significant losses in the value of a firm. (W. Kip Viscusi and Joni
Hersch, "The Market Response to Product Safety Litigation," Journal of
Regulatory Economics, Vol. 2 (1990), pp. 215-230.) And if the FDA
should indicate that it is concerned with the safety of some product,
this can have a similar impact on the firm. 

<P>The FDA can informally affect the food and drug producers in
other ways, sometimes to the detriment of consumers. For example, a
1988 study indicated the beneficial effects of aspirin in preventing
heart attacks. This study found that the risk for male physicians over
fifty was reduced by almost 50 percent. (Steering Committee of the
Physician's Health Study Research Group, "Preliminary Report: Findings
From the Aspirin Component of the Ongoing Physician's Health Study,
New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 318, No. 4 (January 28, 1988),
pp. 262-264.) Some manufacturers of aspirin understandably began
advertising the results of the research. One producer even began
selling aspirin in a "one-a-day" package, presumably for this use. But
the FDA in July 1989 told manufacturers that they must not advertise
the benefits of aspirin in reducing the chances of a heart attack. 

<P>The FDA had the power to do this in part because aspirin is not
labeled as a preventative for heart attacks, so any advertising of
this property would be contrary to the previously approved label, a
practice which the FDA has the power to forbid. Apparently Frank
Young, Commissioner of the FDA during the Reagan Administration,
believed that consumers should obtain this information only from
physicians. Manufacturers of aspirin were unwilling to contest the
issue with the FDA because of the agency's general power. (This
meeting and the rationale behind the FDA's decision are discussed in
Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer, The Aspirin Wars New York: Alfred
A. Knopf, 1991), pp. 3-10.) This decision was an administrative ruling
by the FDA: there were no hearings and no litigation. The FDA simply
used its informal powers, and the threat of further actions was enough
to block the efforts of firms to publicize the aspirin study's
findings.

<P>With this arsenal of legal enforcement devices, the FDA already
has an enormous impact on the behavior of firms. It is hard to see
what case there could be for increasing the enforcement authority of
the agency.
<P>
THE LOST GOAL OF CONSUMER BENEFIT<P>
<P>If FDA enforcement regulations without question benefitted
consumers, then even draconian regulatory power might in principle be
justified. But this is not the case. The FDA is an inefficient
regulator, and in many instances actually causes harm to consumers
rather than helping them. One example, of course, has been FDA's
notorious delays in approving new drugs. The FDA has also denied
consumers valuable information about drugs and about the health
properties of foods.
<P>

New Drug Approvals
<P>There is always risk associated with introducing a new drug.
This presents the FDA with a problem. It can approve the drug swiftly,
or it can withhold approval, pending further testing and information.
Either decision might be erroneous. (There will always be such
uncertainty; it is never possible to have enough information to be
absolutely certain about the costs and benefits of a drug. Indeed, one
potential costly error is to delay approval while seeking new
information because some will suffer and even die while awaiting new
information.) If the agency approves a drug which later turns out to
be harmful, officials will be attacked for their lack of thoroughness.
On the other hand, if the agency demands exhaustive evidence that a
drug is safe and effective, some Americans might suffer or die while
FDA is gathering and evaluating information about the drug.

<P>In fact, the FDA has been sufficiently cautious that there are
no examples of major disasters from excessively lenient approval of a
new drug. Thalidomide is the classic example of a harmful drug which
was approved for sale -- but never in the U.S. The laws on the books
in 1960 were sufficiently stringent so that this drug was never sold
here. What is surprising is that as a result of the thalidomide
episode, U.S. laws were strengthened and a proof of efficacy was
required for new drugs to be sold in the U.S., even though thalidomide
was never sold in America and even though the problem with thalidomide
was safety, not efficacy. In any case, a thalidomide-like event would
be the worst possible occurrence if the FDA were to err and be too lax
in drug approval. Sam Peltzman, the first scholar to point out the
problems of drug approval, has indicated, based on the thalidomide
episode, that the strongest possible argument in favor of the FDA's
current powers would be that it could prevent "... something like
10,000 deaths or serious disabilities and an economic loss of
something like $300 million perhaps once per decade.... " (Sam
Peltzman, "Statement Before the Subcommittee on Monopoly of the Senate
Small Business Committee," 1973, quoted in Hutt and Merrill, Food and
Drug Law, p. 582.)

<P>Note that this statement was made in 1973. Since that time,
there has never been a major problem with too-easy drug approval
anywhere in the world, even though the U.S. has much more stringent
standards than any other country. In twenty years there has nowhere
been a thalidomide-like episode, so it is clear that Peltzman was
overly pessimistic in estimating the potential harm from reduced
enforcement. If traditional FDA policies have had any beneficial
impact, it has been smaller than Peltzman predicted in his worst-case
estimate. 

<P>Against this hypothetical loss must be counted the real and
measurable costs of the injuries which FDA-delayed drug approvals have
caused. A major example is the class of drugs known as beta-blockers,
which are aimed at reducing heart attack risks. These drugs were
unavailable in the U.S. from 1967 to 1976 as a result of FDA policies.
It is estimated that this delay cost 10,000 lives per year, or a total
of 100,000 needless deaths. (Kazman, op. cit.) This is but one example
of a real cost of FDA delay in drug approval, and for this one drug
alone, costs are greater than any possible estimate of the benefits of
reduced harm from prematurely approved drugs. 

<P>The public interest is best served if the FDA strikes a
reasonable balance between these risks. Traditionally, the agency has
not balanced these risks. In practice, it has placed a much greater
weight on the risk of approving a drug which will ultimately be
harmful than on denying approval of a beneficial drug. (The original
research demonstrating this point was by Sam Peltzman, "An Evaluation
of Consumer Protection Legislation: The 1962 Drug Amendments," Journal
of Political Economy, Vol. 81 (September 1973), pp. 1049-1091. A
summary of the literature appears in William S. Comanor, "The
Political Economy of the Pharmaceutical Industry," Journal of Economic
Literature, Vol. 24 (1986), pp. 1178-1217. For a recent discussion,
see Kazman, op. cit. The issue is also discussed in Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, pp. 580-583.) The result has been that far more
Americans have died from a lack of drugs to treat their disease than
would have died from drug reactions if the FDA had approved drugs more
easily.

<P>It is not surprising that the FDA has erred on the side of
excessive caution. Public outrage is swift when the FDA is deemed to
be responsible for allowing a dangerous drug to reach the market. By
contrast, consumers suffering from a disease which would be treatable
if some new drug were approved often are unaware that FDA delays are
the cause of their suffering. Congress has behaved in a similar way.
Officials at the FDA have rarely been accused at congressional
hearings of excessive delays in approving new drugs. But officials
have on many occasions been accused of wrongly approving drugs which
subsequently turned out to be harmful. (According to a former
Commissioner of Foods and Drugs: "In all of our history, we are unable
to find one instance where a Congressional hearing investigated the
failure of FDA to approve a new drug. The occasions on which hearings
have been held to criticize approval of a new drug have been so
frequent in the past ten years that we have not even attempted to
count them." Statement of Alexander M. Schmidt in Senate Hearings,
1974, quoted in Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, p. 1318.)

<P>When potential beneficiaries of drugs have identified themselves
in advance, the situation changed radically. For example, AIDS
sufferers could identify themselves, and thus knew that the FDA failed
to approve a new drug which would prolong their lives. Therefore it
has not been surprising that the FDA made special efforts to rapidly
approve AIDS drugs. Because victims of AIDS were articulate and were
able to organize themselves into a powerful lobbying group, the FDA
accelerated approval of drugs to fight this disease, and relaxed
normal standards for proofs of safety and efficacy. (This is discussed
in Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, pp. 552-566.) 

  <P>The Bush Administration's recent regulatory initiatives would
speed up the approval of "breakthrough" drugs for Americans suffering
from deadly diseases such as cancer. The Administration action could
save lives and improve the health of millions of Americans. But,
although such reforms are desirable, the bureaucrats at the FDA are
opposed (For example, 81 percent of FDA officials "disagreed" or
"strongly disagreed" with proposals to privatize new drug application
reviews. See Sidney M. Wolfe, "FDA Physicians Oppose White House Plan
Which Will Endanger Millions of Americans By Weakening the Drug
Approval Process," Public Citizen Health Research Group, Washington,
December 19, 1991.) and likely will do all they can to sabotage them.

<P>The Administration's reforms would, among other things: 


<P>Accelerate approvals. In approving new "breakthrough" drugs for
patients with life-threatening or serious illness, such as cancer or
Alzheimer's disease the FDA will use "surrogate endpoints," a
technical term meaning to rely upon earlier indicators of improved
health, such as changes in blood cholesterol, rather than more
comprehensive testing and analysis as a condition for expeditious
approval. In the meantime, FDA may require additional and more
comprehensive testing of the drug for its effectiveness after
expedited approval, plus provisions for quick withdrawal of the drug
if the FDA conditions are not met.

<P>Adopt parallel track rules for use. Under new FDA guidelines,
"investigational" drugs, or drugs not yet finally approved by FDA for
safety and effectiveness, can be made more readily available to AIDS
patients. The idea is to allow AIDS patients to use such experimental
drugs even if these patients are not participating in the "ongoing
controlled clinical studies" required by FDA. Sponsors of experimental
drugs can submit alternative testing proposals to the FDA or the
Public Health Service to test drugs' safety and effectiveness. Through
these alternative programs, more patients can receive promising
therapies more quickly. While this "parallel track" regulatory reform
is directed toward speeding up drug availability for AIDS patients,
the Bush Administration is also considering this approach for other
serious diseases such as cancer.

<P>Use overseas safety data. Safety data for drugs developed from
animal testing in European countries and Japan can be used in the
United States. FDA will establish standards for expediting the use of
such foreign studies in the drug approval process. By using this data,
drug sponsors will not be required to repeat animal studies and thus
will reduce the time for drug development by as much as six months,
according to FDA authorities.

<P>Use outside experts. The FDA is also beginning to contract with
qualified outside experts, seeking competitive bids to review
applications for new drugs. This measure is designed to reduce the
backlog of applications for new drugs, particularly anti-infective,
anti-inflammatory, and analgesic drugs. While FDA will supervise
contractors and retain final authority on drug approval, contacting
out is also expected to expedite the drug approval process. 

<P>

Consumer Information
<P>The FDA also harms consumers by denying them useful information.
For example, it sharply limits advertising by manufacturers of
prescription drugs. (Paul H. Rubin, "The FDA's Prescription for
Consumer Ignorance," Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, November
1991, pp. 5-25; Alison Masson and Paul H. Rubin, "Matching
Prescription Drugs and Consumers," The New England Journal of
Medicine, August 22, 1985, p. 513; Alison Masson, "Direct To Consumer
Advertising," in Robert N. Mayer, ed., Enhancing Consumer Choice,
American Council on Consumer Interests, Columbia, Missouri, 1991 (in
press); Paul H. Rubin, "Economics of Prescription Drug Advertising,"
Journal of Research In Pharmaceutical Economics, Vol. 3, No. 4 (1991),
pp. 29-40.) In most cases, advertising to consumers is burdened by
requiring companies to include what the FDA terms a brief summary of
side effects and contraindications. (A "contraindication" is a
condition which makes use of some drug undesirable. For example, some
pharmaceuticals should not be taken by a pregnant woman, so that for
these products, pregnancy is a contraindication.) This brief summary,
however, typically is a full page of small print. This requirement
increases the cost of print advertisements and makes television
advertising of prescription drugs virtually impossible. Advertising
could better convey vital health information if it were less heavily
restricted. Moreover, increased advertising is likely to lead to price
reductions for drugs. (Lee Benham, "The Effect of Advertising on the
Price of Eyeglasses," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. 15 (1972), p.
337; Robert Steiner, "Does Advertising Lower Consumer Prices?,"
Journal of Marketing, Vol. 37 (1973), p. 19; Howard Marvel, "The
Economics of Information and Retail Gasoline Price Behavior," Journal
of Political Economy, Vol. 84 (October 1976), p. 1033; John Kwoka,
"Advertising and the Price and Quality of Optometric Services,"
American Economic Review, Vol. 74 (1984), p. 211; Deborah Haas-Wilson,
"The Effect of Commercial Practice Restrictions: The Case of
Optometry," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. 29 (April 1986), p.
165; Paul Farris and Mark Albion, "The Impact of Advertising on the
Price of Consumer Products," Journal of Marketing, Vol. 44 (Summer
1980), p. 17; Mark Albion and Paul W. Farris, The Advertising
Controversy: Evidence on the Economic Effects of Advertising (Boston:
Auburn House, 1981).) Since prescription drugs cannot be purchased
without the help of an informed intermediary -- a physician -- there
is less chance for deception and confusion in this market than in
almost any other. Nonetheless, the FDA continues to restrict
advertising of the beneficial effects of prescription drugs. The FDA
ban on advertising the benefits of aspirin in preventing heart attacks
is one example. 

<P>More recently, the FDA has begun to restrict excessively
advertising of pharmaceuticals even to physicians. (John E. Calfee,
"The FDA: Moving Toward a Black Market in Information," The American
Enterprise, March/April 1992, pp. 34-41.) Many drugs are approved and
labeled for one use, but turn out to be useful for other conditions.
This is particularly true of drugs useful for cancer treatment. A
common pattern is for a drug to be approved for one cancer's treatment
and then tested for additional forms of cancer. If the tests are
successful, an article is published in a medical journal. The
manufacturer of the product will then publicize this new use by
sending copies of the medical journal article to interested physicians
and by sponsoring seminars and symposia where physicians can learn of
the drug's new use. The FDA is now stopping companies from publicizing
results showing that drugs are useful in unapproved applications. 

<P>Even if a drug is approved for one use, it must additionally be
approved for any new uses if these uses are to be put on the drug
label; physicians, however, are free to prescribe an approved drug for
any purpose, even if the purpose is not mentioned on the label.
Approval for additional uses can take longer than the original
approval, since new supplemental approvals have lower priority than
original approvals. (Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, p. 535.)
Moreover, since these drugs already are on the market when a
supplemental approval is requested, future patent life is shorter, and
new approvals are less valuable to a manufacturer. The new FDA policy
limiting promotion of drugs for unapproved uses, therefore, often will
mean that drugs will not be used for these purposes, and the result
will again be reduced health of consumers. 

<P>The FDA similarly places restrictions on advertising the health
benefits of foods. Again, this policy harms consumers. (Richard M.
Cooper, Richard L. Frank and Michael J. O'Flaherty, "History of Health
Claims Regulations," Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal, Vol. 45, No. 6
(1990), pp. 655-691. Note that this finding of excessive regulation
was before Dr. Kessler began his current crusade to increase such
regulation.) Such advertising would be beneficial. For example,
advertising of higher fiber content in cereals has been shown to have
caused greatly increased level of fiber. (Pauline M. Ippolito and Alan
D. Mathios, "Information, Advertising and Health Choices: A Study of
the Cereal Market," The Rand Journal of Economics Vol. 21, No. 3
(Autumn 1990), pp. 459-480.) This kind of advertising is generally
against FDA policy, and was allowed only because the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) intervened and suggested that the FDA allow the
advertising. By excessively restricting such advertising, the FDA
denies valuable health information to consumers.

<P>Dr. David Kessler, the Commissioner of the FDA, appointed in
1991 by President Bush, seems to be even more restrictive than his
predecessors in his attitude to such advertising. (See remarks by Dr.
David Kessler at the 20th Anniversary Conference, Center for Science
in the Public Interest, Washington, D.C., June 6, 1991.) While no
evidence of any harmful health effect of current advertising and
promotion policies has been shown, Kessler nevertheless is increasing
the staff devoted to enforcing regulations limiting advertising. These
resources could better be devoted to ensuring the success of the
Administration's effort to secure more rapid drug approval.

<P>While the Administration's political leadership, including Vice
President Quayle and Secretary Sullivan, are committed to cutting red
tape and streamlining FDA's regulatory processes to make it easier for
companies to develop and market life-saving drugs, within the FDA
bureaucracy the institutional philosophy is quite different. 



<P>The institutional regulatory spirit at FDA has perhaps best been
expressed by Kenneth Feather, head of the Drug Surveillance Branch of
the FDA, and a regulator of advertising for prescription drugs:
<P>
   <UL> The old way is over. We used to say that if a company 
    made certain changes, then we would probably not take 
    any action. Now, we won't. Now, even if they make the
    changes, they might end up in court. We want to say to 
    these companies that you don't know when or how we'll
    strike. We want to eliminate predictability. (Quoted in 
    The Washington Times, September 12, 1991.)</UL>

<P>FDA staff, in short, favor adding to the financial risk firms
face in introducing new drugs by adding a stiff dose of regulatory
uncertainty and arbitrary retribution for actions that anger FDA
bureaucrats. The result: Fewer therapeutic drugs and less information
about them for Americans. Reversing the agency's current institutional
biases in favor of excessive regulation is a genuine management
challenge for the Bush Administration.
<P>
H.R. 3642: A PRESCRIPTION FOR MORE POWER (The exact terms of the bill
are apparently changing as various amendments and redraftings occur. I
am relying on the October 7, 1991 "Section-By-Section Analysis"; on
the comments of various parties from the July 17, 1991 Hearings; and
on the October 24, 1991 draft of H.R. 3642. (There are slight changes
from 2597 to 3642.) In general, I attempt to discuss the broad nature
of the provisions, rather than the particular details, so that these
comments will apply even if the bill is modified further.)


<P>Although the FDA already has more than adequate enforcement
powers, some members of Congress want to increase the agency's
enforcement authority. H.R.3642, the Food, Drug, Cosmetic and Device
Enforcement Amendments of 1991, is the leading measure to do this. The
bill does this in two basic ways.

 <P>  First, it gives the FDA authority to take many actions
administratively, without obtaining judicial review. Although the FDA
can now undertake some actions without any judicial review, for others
a court order is needed. H.R. 3642 would expand the number of
regulatory activities for which a review is not needed. This gives
agency employees even wider discretion than they now have. (See the
Testimony of Edward Dunkelberger, General Counsel for the National
Food Processors Association, on [H.R. 3642], July 17, 1991.)

<P>In most cases, firms voluntarily comply with FDA requests. But
the FDA itself is tempered in what it asks of firms because it
realizes that a firm does have the option of going to court and
seeking judicial review if it believes that an order is unreasonable,
or that the terms of an order are excessively onerous. Under the
proposed legislation, the FDA would no longer be subject to the
discipline of a potential court review, and the result would be
increased bureaucratic arbitrariness. As indicated earlier, for
example, FDA officials are now attempting to put Barr Laboratories out
of business because this firm has been a whistleblower with respect to
FDA misconduct in approving generic drugs. If H.R. 3642 were now law,
the FDA could administratively eliminate this company by, for example,
indiscriminately seizing or recalling products of the company. 

<P>Second, the bill would impose new costs on manufacturers, which
would increase prices to the consumer. The bill would lead to such
increased regulation and costs primarily because of changes in the law
affecting recalls, subpoenas, and new civil penalties.
More Costly Recalls. H.R. 3642 would strengthen the FDA's power to
order recalls. Today most recalls technically are voluntary. But few
if any firms resist FDA recall requests. If a firm does resist, the
agency has various tools for enforcing recalls; it can seek an
injunction from a court against a firm, or permission from a court to
order a seizure. Criminal prosecution is also possible. The FDA also
can publicize the refusal of a firm to recall its products. Such
publicity can be very damaging financially to a firm. In 1989, for
example, there were 2,183 recalls by the FDA, (Hutt and Merrill, Food
and Drug Law, p. 1205.) so the agency is apparently not now hampered
in its ability to convince firms to undertake recalls which it feels
are justified. In 1937, even before the advent of modern
communications technology, a recall of a truly toxic drug, elixir
sulfanilamide, which caused 100 deaths, accounted for 99.2 percent of
the product. (Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, p. 1178.) So there
is no reason to believe that any product which truly presents a hazard
would be a problem with respect to a recall. 

<P>Although firms generally comply with FDA recall requests, there
is still room for negotiation. For example, firms may negotiate over
the "depth" of the recall, the level of product distribution to which
a recall will apply. Recalls may be at the consumer level, the retail
level, or the wholesale level. (Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law,
p. 1185.) Empirical evidence indicates that recalls at the consumer
level are generally ineffective, (R. Dennis Murphy and Paul H. Rubin,
"Determinants of Recall Success Rates," Journal of Products Liability
Vol. 11 (1988), pp. 17-28, show that for recalls ordered by the
Consumer Product Safety Commission, for products in the hands of
consumers, only about 7 percent are returned even if the recall occurs
immediately after sale. Since FDA products are more perishable than
CPSC products, one would expect the return rate to be even lower.) but
these recalls impose substantial losses in reputation capital. (Rubin,
Jarrell and Murphy; Peltzman and Jarrell.) Thus, a firm might
rationally suggest a recall only at the wholesale or wholesale and
retail level if the danger from the product is not substantial. Today,
the FDA would be likely to comply with this request because the firm
could threaten litigation if the FDA went farther. But if H.R. 3642
were passed into law the FDA could simply order a recall at the
consumer level, even if this were unlikely to provide any additional
benefits. 

<P>Greater Subpoena and Records Inspection Powers. Current law
allows the FDA to inspect "'records, files, papers, processes,
controls, and facilities' except for 'financial data, sales data other
than shipment data, pricing data, personnel data... and research data'
for prescription drugs and restricted devices." (Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, p. 1111.) The bill would grant subpoena powers to
the FDA for all documents, including those classes of documents not
now subject to examination.

<P>The FDA can already examine records related to health or safety,
and it can examine all products directly. This is adequate to detect
any safety concerns with the product. Economic data, such as sales
data, are not needed for determining the safety of a product, and is
valuable competitive information. In this area then, current law
strikes a balance between safety requirements and competitive
protection. The subpoena authority in H.R. 3642 would destroy that
balance and place competitively valuable materials at risk. (The bill
attempts to protect such information by requiring that the
Commissioner himself must make a finding about information regarding
trade secrets and names of individual research subjects, and
forbidding the Commissioner from delegating this authority. In
practice, this will simply mean that the Commissioner will be required
to sign such orders, not a particularly onerous restriction.)

<P>The bill also authorizes the taking of photographs during plant
inspections. Under current law, inspectors generally have the right to
take photographs, and will sometimes obtain court orders for this
purpose. (Hutt and Merrill, Food and Drug Law, p. 1117.) Thus, the
bill will have a relatively small effect on this practice.
Nonetheless, it will make it somewhat easier for inspectors to take
photographs, and in some cases could lead to additional photographs.
Photographs are particularly likely to show trade secrets, because
competitors can learn about secret manufacturing processes and
techniques from such photographs. Currently, if a photograph would be
particularly harmful to a firm for competitive reasons and if it is of
relatively little value to the FDA, the inspector might choose not to
take the photo. Under the new law, he is much more likely to ignore
the firm's requests for secrecy. 

<P>Giving the FDA greater access to business records increases the
risk that a firm's confidential business data or commercial secrets
will be revealed to its competitors. While the FDA no doubt would
attempt to protect such documents, there is no guarantee that it could
do so successfully. Corporate attorney Marvin Frank complains that
"While the majority of the (record) requests are benign, every time
the FDA takes a piece of information from company files, it should be
assumed that the documents will eventually be available to competitors
and adversaries." (Marvin R. Frank, Assistant General Counsel,
Assistant Secretary, Pfizer, Inc. "FDA Inspections: A Practical
Corporate Response," Food Drug Cosmetic Law Journal, Vol. 46, No. 1
(January 1991), p. 73. Note that this analysis was prepared in
connection with existing FDA authority; it was not written with H.R.
3642 in mind.)

<P>Document requests also can be quite costly for a firm, simply in
the time it takes to comply. One heavy cost is the internal corporate
review necessary before the release of a document. As Frank explains,
"No document of this type should be provided without prior review by a
company's own attorney." (Frank, p. 76.) The FDA is aware of the costs
of document requests, and Alan Hoeting of FDA's Office of Enforcement
admits that "some of the congressional requests for information
[Congress' equivalent of a document subpoena] may best be described as
onerous." (Hoeting, p. 268.)

<P>Another legitimate concern of firms is that greater FDA power to
obtain internal documents can mean unfair accusations of corporate
malfeasance. Low-level company employees may write innocent statements
which do not in any way reflect the company position, or which may be
based on misinformation. Nonetheless, if quoted out of context, such
statements may cause the company great embarrassment. Example: A
safety issue may be raised in writing but answered orally; in such a
case, a subpoena would show only the written question. The lack of a
written answer might imply that a reasonable employee concern had been
ignored or covered up. That, in turn, could be used against the
company in regulatory proceedings or in litigation. Example: In the
breast implant matter, it appears that certain memos written by
salesmen have been interpreted as indicating that the company had
safety concerns with the product, even though the memos were not
written by technical experts. A law making such memos easily
accessible to the FDA would lead to additional litigation and would
ultimately lead companies to greatly restrict the information
employees were allowed to put in writing. 

<P>If additional classes of documents are made subject to subpoena
or inspection, one rational corporate response would be simply to
create fewer documents. For example, according to court
interpretations, any contaminant found in a food is a violation of the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. (Statement of Jerome J. Kozak, Vice
President, International Dairy Foods Association, regarding [H.R.
3642], July 17, 1991, p. 5.) If a company conducts thorough quality
control, and its records indicate some contamination, the firm has
technically created a record of a law violation. This means that the
firms with the best quality control records run the greatest risk of
self-incrimination. Thus, one counterproductive incentive created
under H.R. 3642 would be for companies to reduce their quality control
record keeping. (It might appear that this could be prohibited by
requiring the company to retain such records. However, it is difficult
to see how all companies which now undertake quality control
inspections could be ordered to continue, and difficult to see how
companies could be ordered to keep "high quality" records. Moreover,
there is no such requirement in H.R. 3642.) From the standpoint of
protecting the public, this outcome clearly is absurd.

<P>Civil Penalties. H.R. 3642 gives the FDA power to levy civil
penalties of up to $5,000,000. Under current law, there are only a
small number of instances in which the agency can levy civil
penalties, and amounts are limited. (Discussed in Hutt and Merrill,
Food and Drug Law, pp. 1171-1175.) This bill would greatly expand this
authority. 

<P>The Congressional Staff Analysis of [H.R. 3642] notes that "...
it is expected that in its prosecutorial discretion the FDA would not
impose civil penalties for insignificant or minor violations, just as
today it does not pursue criminal penalties for such types of
violations of the Act." (Section-By-Section Analysis of Substitute
Amendment to H.R. 2597, October 7, 1991, p. 7.) It is unusual,
however, for a prosecutorial body to be given authority to assess
fines of up to $5,000,000 with no limits except its own "prosecutorial
discretion." Moreover, the agency would be more likely to use this
discretion in criminal cases, where it knows that it must be able to
prove allegations "beyond a reasonable doubt," than in civil
proceedings, where it is more likely to win because of the lower
standard of proof -- a "preponderance of the evidence" -- required in
civil actions. It also appears that FDA Commissioner Kessler views his
job as enforcing the law independently of any measure of costs or
benefits. He is conspicuously not using, or is misusing, prosecutorial
discretion in his enforcement of advertising restrictions in cases
where no consumer harm has been demonstrated or even alleged, as
discussed previously.

<P>But even if the FDA does not misuse its civil penalty authority,
firms will be wary of this power and will react accordingly if the
bill becomes law. Because penalties will be possible for even minor
technical violations of the law, companies will greatly increase the
amount they spend to avoid such violations. The results will be higher
costs and higher prices to consumers. The threat of seeking civil
penalties will also serve as a weapon to force individuals -- who can
be fined up to $250,000 -- and firms to accede to other FDA requests,
even if these are unjustified. 


<P>
THE WEAK CASE FOR STRONGER FDA ENFORCEMENT
<P>The FDA's job is to protect the health and safety of Americans.
To make the case that the FDA should have increased enforcement powers
to discharge its responsibility, it is logically necessary for
proponents to show that current FDA powers are insufficient. Advocates
must link laxity or weakness in FDA enforcement to reduced health and
higher risks for consumers. And if such a link can indeed be shown,
they must show that the proposed enforcement strategy would correct
these problems and lead to improved health among consumers.

 <P>But advocates of H.R. 3642 have forged neither link: They have
not shown that the FDA's current powers are insufficient to protect
the health of Americans, nor have they shown that the bill will
improve the health status of Americans. Most of the arguments advanced
for increasing FDA enforcement authority center instead on the alleged
virtues of bureaucratic consistency.

<P>The bill was introduced by Representative Henry Waxman, who is
Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. In
his opening statement introducing the bill, Congressman Waxman nowhere
mentions health. His main argument is that "... the [existing] statute
is inconsistent," adding that "Other comparable agencies also have
these authorities." (Opening Statement of Representative Henry A.
Waxman, at the Hearing on H. R. 2597, The Food, Drug, Cosmetic and
Device Enforcement Amendments of 1991, July 17, 1991.) Representative
John Dingell, who is a cosponsor of the bill, seems to agree: "As
matters now stand, the Agency is operating under enforcement tools and
procedures enacted 50 years ago. Its regulatory authority differs from
one product category to the next." (Statement by Representative John
Dingell on H.R. 2597, July 17, 1991, p.2.) Neither of these arguments,
however, indicate any national health problems stemming from current
FDA enforcement.

<P>The staff of the House Subcommittee on Health and the
Environment, in an analysis supporting an earlier version of the bill,
refers at one point to health, pointing out that "... between 6.5
million and 33 million people become sick from microbiological
contamination of food, 9,000 of whom die." (Section-By-Section
Analysis of Substitute Amendment to H.R.2597, October 7, 1991.) These
data were derived from a U.S. Department of Agriculture study. (Tanya
Roberts and Eileen van Ravenswaay, "The Economics of Safeguarding the
U.S. Food Supply," United States Department of Agriculture, Economic
Research Service, Agriculture Information Bulletin No. 566, July
1989.) However, the analysis on which this study is based, (Tanya
Roberts, "Human Illness Costs of Foodborne Bacteria," American Journal
of Agricultural Economics, Vol. 71, No. 2 (May 1989), pp. 468-474.)
and discussions with the author, indicate that the analysis applies to
contamination from foods which are subject to Department of
Agriculture but not FDA inspection. This would not be changed by the
bill. Thus, the original congressional staff analysis does not provide
any evidence for adverse health outcomes due to current FDA
enforcement efforts. It does not even claim that the proposed
legislation would affect the illnesses that it asserts occur from
microbiological contamination. 


<P>The only other reference to health is on page 8 of the
congressional staff analysis in connection with recalls, which states:

<P>
   <UL> Ordinarily, where the FDA discovers a serious defect 
    with respect to one of the products it regulates, the
    responsible company voluntarily recalls the product.
    Unfortunately, there have been a significant number of
    instances where the responsible company has refused to
    cooperate, which has led to serious risks to the public
    health. </UL>

<P>No data are given, so it is impossible to determine how
significant this problem is, if it indeed exists. In today's world of
product-liability litigation, it is unlikely that many companies would
resist recalls if the relevant products truly represented safety
risks. Moreover, if a firm does resist, the FDA has the power to seize
the product, enjoin its sale, or institute criminal prosecution. 

<P>The other justifications in this document are remarkably
bureaucratic, rather than substantive. For example, the staff report
states, "The main thrust of [H.R. 3642] is to give the FDA the same
enforcement tools for all the products that it regulates" and
"Although the FDA does not currently have subpoena authority... there
are more than 200 federal statutes giving subpoena authority to other
federal agencies." (Section-By-Section Analysis, p. 2.)

<P>Another source of support for H.R. 3642 is the Final Report of
the Advisory Committee on the Food and Drug Administration, which
spent some time studying the FDA. This committee, appointed by HHS
Secretary Louis Sullivan, refers in its final report to problems with
generic drug approval, and with bribes accepted by some FDA employees
for rapid approval of certain generic drugs. (Final Report, pp. 25 and
30-31.) It does not, however, refer to any adverse health outcomes
from the alleged deficiencies in the generic drug approval or
inspection process. It is not at all clear from the final report that
the relevant generic drugs themselves were inferior or caused adverse
health outcomes, although some of the data used in their approval
apparently were fraudulent. While bribery of FDA employees is and
should be a genuine concern, H.R. 3642's combination of greater FDA
authority to levy fines and increased discretion for FDA employees
could exacerbate this problem. 

<P>The authors of the final report do not provide any basis for the
argument that the FDA's current enforcement powers are inadequate. In
fact, the report actually bolsters the arguments of the critics of
increased FDA powers, who maintain that the agency has more than
enough authority, but is not using it carefully or rationally. Notes
the report, it is "... difficult to speak confidently about the extent
to which FDA's current enforcement efforts are adequate in magnitude
or appropriately targeted." ( Final Report, p. 26.) This is a
disturbing conclusion about the powers of a major regulatory agency
whose decisions affect 25 percent of all expenditures in the U.S.
economy. Yet despite the absence of evidence of effectiveness, the
final report argues that "The Agency should be armed with the same
tools for all the products that it regulates." ( Final Report, p. 29.)
So the public gets another bureaucratic plea for bureaucratic
consistency.

<P>
RECOMMENDATIONS
<P>Since the FDA has tended consistently to err on the side of
withholding approval of new drugs rather than making them available to
patients, and since the agency's sweeping powers in many instances
have counterproductive results, the best way to enhance the health of
Americans would be to streamline the FDA's regulatory process, not add
to its powers. The Bush Administration has greatly advanced this goal
by issuing new regulatory guidelines designed to speed up drug
approval. 

<P>Beyond the Bush Administration's reforms, the FDA's service to
consumers could be further enhanced. Four reforms in particular would
improve consumer health. Of these, the first two could be implemented
relatively easily; the last two would require major legislative
changes, although they would provide substantial benefits. 
<P>

Reform #1: Shift resources from enforcement to drug approval. 
<P>While the Bush Administration initiatives rightly emphasize
expeditious drug approval, this shift would give budgetary substance
to the Administration's reforms. Good intentions and good policy
should be backed up with staff and dollar shifts.

<P>
Reform #2: Base current and future FDA enforcement efforts on likely
health impact.
<P>The FDA should attempt to measure the health impact of its
policies and to allocate its resources so as to maximize the health
benefits of its actions. As mentioned above, one major study of the
FDA found that it is difficult to tell if the agency now appropriately
allocates its enforcement resources. To do so, it should use
quantitative measures and economic analysis, such as cost-benefit or
risk-benefit analysis, on a much more formal basis than it does today.
<P>
Reform #3: Repeal the efficacy requirement for prescription drug
approval.
<P>Before 1962, drugs were approved on the basis of safety. But in
that year, the law was amended to require proof of efficacy as well as
safety. The result: Fewer new drugs are approved; approvals involve
long delays and drugs often are approved for use in other countries
long before they are available in the U.S. This can mean thousands of
Americans die unnecessarily because new drugs are unavailable. For
example, as already discussed, as many as 100,000 Americans needlessly
may have died of heart disease as a result of the ten-year delay in
approving beta-blockers for use in the U.S. ( Discussed in Kazman, op.
cit., pp. 42-43.) The Bush Administration's regulatory change, which
would allow the use of safety data from animal testing in other
countries, is a step in the right direction. Repealing the efficacy
requirement altogether would be a more decisive step.

<P>
Reform #4: Change FDA approval to certification.
 <P>  Physicians should be allowed to prescribe unapproved drugs as
long as the drugs clearly indicate that they are not approved. In this
way, the costs of the excessive delay in drug approval could be
reduced and the drugs made available to Americans who face severe
health problems without them. The FDA could serve a useful function by
testing and certifying new drugs, but those physicians (and their
patients) who prefer to be able to use newer drugs could satisfy that
preference. Short of this, drugs which have been approved in another
major country could be sold in the U.S. with the caveat they are not
yet FDA approved.

<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>Some federal policy makers in the Congress want to invest the
FDA with greater authority. They want the FDA to have more power to
seize and recall products, to subpoena company records, including
trade secrets, and to levy huge fines on companies. In many cases,
these policy makers want the FDA to have these powers without judicial
review or oversight.

<P>But the FDA already has immense power, sufficient to accomplish
almost all of its goals. If the FDA can convince a judge that its
proposed action is meritorious and deals with a genuine safety
concern, it can force companies to comply. It can back up its demands
with powerful criminal sanctions, even for violations committed
unknowingly, and it can cost a firm its reputation by indicating in
public that it has compromised safety. 

<P>Supporters of legislation to expand FDA's enforcement authority
have made no credible case that such increased authority will lead to
increased public health. Most of the arguments for the bill are
bureaucratic, not substantive; they refer to "consistency" in
regulatory powers across products, not to health outcomes. If
consistency is a goal, it can just as easily be achieved by weakening
the FDA's regulatory powers. Congress could examine instances where
FDA has abused its regulatory authority or acted with excessive zeal
at the expense of innocent companies. 

<P>The only demonstrated harm to safety associated with the FDA is
the harm it has caused by excessively delaying the approval of new
drugs. The Bush Administration's reforms of the FDA drug approval
process would enable the agency to more rapidly approve drugs. The
health of Americans would be improved if these Administration reforms
were effected, and if FDA resources were shifted away from enforcement
and used to speed up drug approval. H.R. 3642, by giving additional
enforcement power to the FDA, would likely result in more resources
being devoted to enforcement, and would therefore exacerbate the
health problems caused by the FDA through preventing Americans from
purchasing useful and beneficial therapies.

 DEREGULATING THE HOUSING MARKET: WHAT CONGRESS CAN DO </h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 177<br>
April 10, 1992<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p> 

 
 
      This year Congress can help make housing more affordable for
American families. 
<P>
      The Bush Administration is presenting to Congress a series of
budget initiatives that will promote deregulation of an overly
regulated housing market, and by this will reduce housing costs. These
initiatives are based on the recommendations of the Advisory
Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, known as the
Kemp Commission, after Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) Secretary Jack Kemp. Last July the bipartisan Commission issued
its final report, "Not In My Back Yard": Reducing Barriers to
Affordable Housing. (Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to
Affordable Housing, "Not In My Back Yard": Reducing Barriers to
Affordable Housing (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, July 1991).) The report's recommendations give
Congress and the Bush Administration an opportunity to tackle
excessive regulation in the housing market.
<P>
      The Commission, established at the behest of George Bush and
Kemp, was chaired by former New Jersey Republican Governor Thomas
Kean. (Heritage Foundation Director of Domestic Policy Studies Stuart
Butler was a Commission member. As such, he has not contributed to or
reviewed this study.) The Commission heard from expert testimony and
pored over numerous studies. It found that the types of state and
local regulations most adversely affecting housing affordability were:
zoning ordinances that exclude certain forms of reasonably priced
housing; growth control ordinances that impose ceilings on new
construction; rent control ordinances that reduce the incentive to
maintain or build rental properties; and lengthy permit approval
procedures, especially those related to environmental protection, that
delay new construction by months and often years. The Kemp Commission
concluded that the reduction in the supply of housing from this
overregulation makes housing less affordable for millions of
Americans.  
<P>
      Undercutting Expansion. Commission members noted that while
affordability for buyers and renters improved nationwide during the
1980s, it did so largely because of Reagan Administration economic
policies. The problem is that excessive regulation worked against this
trend, undercutting the expanding supply of houses and apartments.
This was especially so in major metropolitan areas in California and
the Northeast, where prices and rents, especially of new dwellings,
still remain well above those elsewhere.
<P>
      Like previous federal housing task forces, the Kemp Commission
recognizes that the tacit purpose behind much of this regulation is to
raise the market values of existing properties. Established residents
of a community, once having benefitted at the expense of newcomers,
pressure local officials to keep these regulations, and often to make
them more stringent.
<P>
      This exclusionary impulse, more than, say, a laudable desire to
protect the environment, is the motive behind such local and state
regulations. Often, new construction of any kind causes existing
residents to warn developers and local officials alike: "Not in my
back yard!" The acronym for this expression -- NIMBY -- is firmly
established in housing policy debate.  
<P>
AN AGENDA FOR CHANGE: LINKING REGULATORY REFORM TO FEDERAL HOUSING AID
<P>
      HUD wants to make the granting of federal housing subsidies to
state and local governments contingent upon the removal of excessive
regulation of land use and housing, especially of new housing. HUD
wants to make any state or local government recipient demonstrate
beforehand that it is making progress in reducing burdens upon
developers who seek approvals of proposals for residential
development. This especially would affect HOME, a block grant program
created by Congress in 1990 as part of the National Affordable Housing
Act. HOME is budgeted at $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year; the
Administration proposes spending $700 million on the program in fiscal
1993.
<P>
      Kemp and his colleagues at HUD understand that local government
officials, vulnerable to voter hostility toward new development, are
not going to remove these barriers voluntarily. They thus need
encouragement from Washington. Such incentives are contained in the
Bush Administration budget package. The most important of these
initiatives requires action by Congress. This would give HUD greater
authority to review grants made in accordance with the newly created
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). 
<P>
      The National Affordable Housing Act requires every state and
local government receiving federal housing assistance to submit a CHAS
document to HUD. A CHAS applicant must meet fifteen statutory
requirements. The most important is a demonstration by the applicant
that it is taking steps to make housing more affordable. The applicant
must reveal the extent to which its own regulations and policies drive
up the cost of housing, and must present a strategy to remove these
barriers to affordability. The Act, however, explicitly made a
regulatory barrier-removal plan the one element in a CHAS application
that HUD could not use as a basis for disapproving a request for
funding.
<P>
      Wrong Message. HUD officials argue that congressional exclusion
of the removal of regulatory barriers requirement from the HUD review
process sends the wrong message to state and local governments: They
can continue to pursue exclusionary policies with impunity. HUD
insists that this criterion for grant submission, like the fourteen
others required in a CHAS, should be subject to HUD review. 
<P>
      Kemp and other HUD officials, however, have the unenviable task
of trying to convince Congress, generally favoring increased
government regulation and subsidies as ways of promoting housing
affordability, of this view. For example, despite the repeated failure
of rent control, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat,
opposes any proposal that would deny federal housing assistance to
communities with rent-control ordinances, such as San Francisco, which
is in her district. (Conversation with Carolyn Bartholomew,
Legislative Director, Representative Nancy Pelosi, April 2, 1992.)
<P>
      Those opposed to linking federal housing assistance to removing
regulatory barriers erroneously argue that government deregulation is
only a minor factor in driving up the cost of housing. John
Gilderbloom, Associate Professor at the University of Louisville
College of Urban and Public Affairs, for example, claims that charges
of overregulation are wildly exaggerated, and that there is no
guarantee that builders and landlords would pass on the savings of
deregulation to the consumer anyway. (See testimony by John
Gilderbloom, "The Bush/Kemp Housing Commission: The Good, the Bad, and
the Ugly," U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Banking,
Finance and Urban Affairs, Subcommittee on Policy Research and
Insurance and Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development,
Report by the Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable
Housing, 102nd Congress, First Session, July 17, 1991 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991, pp. 145-178).) Such
researchers also maintain that any program of deregulation, whatever
burdens it lifts from the shoulders of builders, landlords, and
homeowners, must be accompanied by a massive increase in housing
subsidies. William C. Apgar, Jr., executive director of the Harvard
University Joint Center for Housing Studies, asserts: "Regulatory
reform does not negate the need for expanded Federal subsidy
programs." (Quoted in ibid., p. 44.) 
<P>
      Such arguments are flawed. The Kemp Commission findings
demonstrate convincingly that housing overregulation has been a major
contributor to rising housing prices and rents since the 1970s. It is
not coincidental that areas of the country subject to the heaviest
housing regulation, such as the California and Northeast coastal
metropolitan regions, have by far the nation's highest housing prices
and rents. According to William M. Connolly, Director of the New
Jersey Department of Community Affairs, Division of Housing and
Development, the percentage of the price of a new home that the
Commission attributed to housing and land use overregulation in New
Jersey -- 25 percent to 30 percent -- is, if anything, on the low
side. (Statement of William M. Connolly, in ibid., p. 47.) 
<P>
      The claim that more federal spending on housing is needed also
is without foundation. Under the Reagan Administration HUD spending
rose from $14.9 billion in fiscal 1981 to $19.7 billion in fiscal
1989. By fiscal 1991 this figure climbed to $22.8 billion, and is
projected to reach $24.2 billion and $28.1 billion, respectively, in
fiscal 1992 and 1993. Moreover, between 4.5 million and 4.6 million
low-income American households currently receive housing subsidies.
Apgar's own research at Harvard indicates that subsidized poor renters
pay about one-half the rent that unsubsidized poor renters pay, and
that even unsubsidized poor renters pay rents less the overall median.
(William C. Apgar, Jr., et al., The State of the Nation's Housing 1990
(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies,
1990), p. 21. Subsidized poor renters paid (1989 dollars) $188 in
rent; unsubsidized poor renters paid $360. Further undercutting
Apgar's argument is the fact that much of the income of poor
households is uncounted by the Census Bureau. See Robert Rector, "How
the Poor Really Live: Lessons for Welfare Reform," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 875, January 31, 1992, p. 3.) 
<P>
ADDITIONAL DEREGULATORY INITIATIVES
<P>
      Making future federal housing assistance contingent upon state
and local governments removing regulatory barriers is not the only
initiative HUD is proposing. HUD already has recommended or
established the following measures:
<P>
1)    Make grants to states for barrier removal and reform efforts.
      HUD is proposing $10 million in fiscal year 1993 Community
      Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for states to assist them
      in removing regulatory barriers to housing markets. The Kemp
      Commission report emphasizes that the states, more than federal
      or local government, can exercise the best judgment over the
      economic impact of government regulations that extend beyond
      local boundaries. Empowering the states to exercise and act on
      this judgment while using federal grant money would require
      congressional legislation.
<P>
2)    Create a Regulatory Reform for Affordable Housing Information
      Center. The Center, estab-lished earlier this year, is HUD's
      clearinghouse for information and ideas to state and local
      governments, the housing industry, nonprofit housing
      organizations, and the general public. (The Center's toll-free
      number is 1-800-292-3472.)
<P>
3)    Create an Interagency Affordable Housing Regulatory Review
      Board. This proposal, which does not require action by Congress,
      already has been approved by the White House and the Office of
      Management and Budget. The new Board will waive federal
      regulations that apply to housing proposals in states and
      localities demonstrating a commitment to regulatory barrier
      removal. These regulations cover environmental, transportation,
      labor and other federal requirements, even on many unsubsidized
      projects. Currently, states seeking such waivers must go through
      a cumbersome and time-consuming federal review process. The
      Board would be composed of sub-Cabinet officials from federal
      agencies, including HUD, the Veterans Administration, the
      Department of the Interior, and the Army Corps of Engineers. It
      would expedite reviews, ensure that the states receive full
      consideration of their requests, and make recommendations to
      federal agencies on the granting of waivers.
<P>
4)    Better coordinate federal efforts to promote affordable housing.
      HUD already has appointed its Assistant Secretary for Policy
      Development and Research, John C. Weicher, to oversee the
      removal of regulatory barriers to affordable housing. He and his
      staff will meet with builders, state and local officials, and
      non-profit and citizens' groups to discuss ways of reducing
      these barriers. 
<P>
      Taken together, these administrative and legislative measures
will remove some of the more onerous forms of housing regulation that
needlessly raise housing prices and rents. Where legislative action is
required, Congress should act forcefully on behalf of Kemp's
initiatives.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
      The HUD anti-regulatory package will help reduce the cost of
housing. HUD officials justifiably are telling those state and local
governments that receive or wish to receive federal housing aid to
cooperate in making housing more affordable for American families.
Local governments already have shown a willingness to work with state
and federal officials in reducing land use and other housing cost
burdens. (In the 1980s, HUD sponsored a nationwide project known as
the Joint Venture for Affordable Housing. Local governments, working
with HUD and builders, were able to substantially cut per-unit costs
in new developments, especially through allowing higher dwelling
densities. See U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,
Office of Policy Development and Research, The Affordable Housing
Demonstration: Case Studies (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, January 1985).) Congress can speed up
this progress by adopting HUD's anti-regulatory initiatives. The
strategy of linking federal aid to state and local governments'
removal of regulatory barriers can succeed, especially where HUD
provides technical assistance to state and local government and to
builders. 
<P>
      The cost of housing has not risen appreciably -- in some areas,
not at all -- since the onset of the recession in mid-1990. Contrary
to what big-government housing advocates have been saying for years,
there is no crisis either in the cost of the housing itself or in the
cost of mortgage money to builders, landlords, and homeowners. There
is thus no justification for boosting federal housing subsidies. 
<P>
      But there is much justification for reducing excessive
regulation. Much of the cost of America's housing still remains
artificially high, at least in several of the largest and most heavily
populated metropolitan areas of the country. Jack Kemp and his
colleagues at HUD want to give states and localities incentives to
remove excessive housing and land use regulations. Congress can
realize this objective by requiring that federal housing assistance be
granted only upon the eventual elimination of these regulations.

<TITLE>THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: APRIL FOOLISHNESS ON ANTITRUST -- Heritage </TITLE>



<CENTER><H3><I>THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: APRIL FOOLISHNESS ON ANTITRUST</I></H3>
<P>

Executive Memorandum #327<BR>
4/10/92<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

    George Bush was correct on January 28 to declare a 90-day
moratorium on new federal regulations and to instruct federal agencies
to assess the harm done by existing regulations to the American
economy. But Attorney General William Barr now has violated the spirit
if not the letter of this ban. Last week he changed the Justice
Department's enforcement guidelines to extend the reach of United
States antitrust laws, which restrict business cooperation, to foreign
companies in foreign countries.
<P>
    Attempting to enforce antitrust laws overseas is a bad policy on
its merits. These laws make American firms less competitive. Trying to
enforce them beyond America's borders invites retaliation from trading
partners. But as bad as that is, worse is the appearance that Bush is
not in control of his own cabinet. If he wishes to shed the label of
the "reregulatory President" that he so far has earned, he must
instruct Barr to reverse this decision and instruct all federal
officials to abide rigorously by his moratorium and to review
regulations thoroughly as a prelude to a major deregulation effort to
make America more competitive.
<P>
         Antitrust laws allow the federal government to prevent
cooperation between businesses that it believes will unduly restrict
competition. Justice Department guidelines have allowed enforcement of
these laws against foreign companies operating in their own countries
only if American consumers are harmed by such collusion. But there are
rarely overseas applications of these laws since American consumers
usually gain better quality products at low prices from cooperation
between foreign firms. Barr now has eliminated this "American
consumer" provision, thus opening the door for more extensive Justice
Department action against foreign firms.
<P>
    To begin with, antitrust laws are of questionable economic
benefit. The premise behind these laws is that close cooperation
between businesses will result in monopolies which restrict
competition and force consumers to pay higher prices for goods and
services. Even if this is sometimes true, cooperation often allows
businesses to turn out better quality products at lower prices. By
stifling even beneficial cooperation, America's antitrust laws all too
often make American firms less able to compete against foreign
competitors that are not subject to such harmful laws by their own
governments.
<P>
    Legally Dubious. An attempt by the U.S. to apply its antitrust
laws to foreign companies operating in their own countries in
accordance with their countries' laws is legally dubious. As the U.S.
Supreme Court emphasized in the 1986 case of Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corporation, the cartelization of a
foreign market cannot violate U.S. antitrust laws, "because American
antitrust laws do not regulate the competitive conditions of other
nations' economies." While a case under the new Justice Department
guidelines might raise somewhat different issues, the basic issue
would be the same, and the Court might well strike down these
guidelines.
<P>
    An attempt to enforce American antitrust laws overseas also would
be impractical. The Justice Department would have to act against an
American-based subsidiary of the foreign firm. The subsidiary would be
required to defend itself in a U.S. court for the actions of a parent
company, franchiser, or partner. In such prosecutions the U.S.
government would not be able to provide due process of law for the
accused. How exactly, for example, would the Justice Department
accumulate evidence, since its agents generally cannot operate legally
in foreign countries? How would the Justice Department subpoena
evidence from overseas firms, since its jurisdiction does not extend
to foreign countries? 
<P>
    Invitation to Retaliation. An attempt by the Justice Department
to enforce American antitrust laws overseas invites retaliation. The
European Community (EC), for example, might prosecute America's Ford
Motor Company's European subsidiary because workers in a Ford factory
in Michigan are not accorded the benefits mandated by EC labor laws.
The EC could claim that lower benefit levels for Ford workers in the
U.S. are a form of "unfair" competition against European auto
manufacturers. The EC would not accept as a defense that Ford's
European factory treats its workers according to EC laws. In such a
case the American government and people correctly would consider the
EC's behavior an unjustified attempt to meddle in U.S. internal
economic and political matters.
<P>
    Although the Justice Department insists that the new policy is
not aimed at any one country, Barr's change in antitrust enforcement
guidelines seems to be aimed mainly at Japanese companies that often
operate in strategic alliances called "keiretsus." But if the Justice
Department targets Japanese firms, it is likely to hit American firms
as well. American companies now are breaking into the Japanese market
by joining in such strategic alliances. Example: Last October the
Aluminum Company of America and Japan's Kobe Steel established an
alliance to produce tubing for photocopiers. Example: Last December
America's International Business Machine Corporation and Japan's Canon
Ltd. announced plans for joint production of notebook computers.
Example: In January of this year American Telephone and Telegraph and
Nippon Electric Company agreed to manufacture jointly dynamic random
access memory chips. As American firms use such alliances to become
more competitive and to penetrate foreign markets, they could find the
U.S. Justice Department frustrating their efforts in an attempt to
apply America's antitrust laws overseas.
<P>
    With his announcement of a 90-day moratorium on new government
regulations, Bush acknowledges that federal regulations often do more
harm to the economy than good, crippling American firms in their
ongoing contest with foreign competitors. A so-called "level playing
field" should not consist of applying the same destructive regulations
to overseas firms, crippling them as well.
<P>
    Freeing Business. If the Bush Administration is serious about
freeing American enterprise from the burden of regulations, the
President must get control of his own officials and demand that they
obey his 90-day moratorium. To untie the hands of American business,
the Administration should seek to amend U.S. antitrust laws to make it
easier for American firms to form joint ventures, both with one
another and with foreign firms. And as a first step in this effort,
the President should instruct Attorney General Barr to abandon any
attempt to apply American antitrust laws to acts taken by foreign
firms on foreign soil.

<TITLE>MUZZLING OIRA: AN ATTEMPT TO THWART BUSH'S WAR ON REGULATIONS -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER><H3><I>MUZZLING OIRA: AN ATTEMPT TO THWART BUSH'S WAR ON REGULATIONS</I></H3>
<P>
By William G. Laffer III<br>
Executive Memorandum #304<BR>
7/15/91<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     George Bush's commitment to reducing the federal regulatory
burdens on business is being put to the test. At issue is an important
but little-known division within the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB). It is the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)
-- pronounced oh-EYE-rah -- and was created by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 to minimize federal paperwork requirements. Later it was
tasked to head off regulations promulgated by the Executive Branch
when alternatives are available that are less costly to the economy. 
<P>
     OIRA's ability to be a whistle-blower on regulatory excess is now
in jeopardy. Senator John Glenn, the Ohio Democrat, has introduced
legislation (S. 1044) that would weaken the ability of OMB and OIRA to
halt unjustified paperwork requirements. In addition, this legislation
would saddle OIRA with massive extra paperwork, reporting
responsibilities, red tape, and crippling restrictions. It also would
impose on OIRA public disclosure requirements that Congress does not
apply to itself or to the agencies OIRA oversees. The reason,
apparently, is to destroy OIRA's independence and make it more
responsive to the special interest concerns of individual Congressmen
and Senators. In the process the Glenn bill will impair OIRA's ability
to act and thus the President's ability as chief executive to control
the regulatory process in the agencies for which he is responsible.
Bush should resist these attempts to limit the office in the Executive
Branch that is doing the most to free American businesses of red tape.
If OIRA is bound and gagged, American goods and services will become
more costly, jobs will be destroyed and the economy weakened and made
less competitive.
<P>
     Crushing Burden. Federal government "information collection
requests," that is, paperwork and red tape, impose a crushing burden
on American enterprise. Estimates of the total annual cost to
businesses of filling out federal government forms run as high as $330
billion, with $100 billion falling on small businesses that have the
least resources for handling federal paperwork. OIRA's original job
was to control and limit such "information collection requests," and
in particular to eliminate those which are unnecessary or which
duplicate other requests. OIRA has reduced the time spent filling out
government paperwork by almost 600 million man-hours per year since
1981, generating total annual savings to the economy of at least $6
billion.
<P>
     Ronald Reagan, in a 1981 executive order, gave OIRA
responsibility for reviewing all regulations promulgated by Executive
Branch departments and agencies to minimize the costs of such
regulations, and head off regulations whose costs would exceed
potential benefits. Usually OIRA simply reviews regulations to insure
that they use the least costly means of achieving statutory goals.
Sometimes, however, when regulations serve no real function, OIRA
blocks them altogether. 
<P>
Example: OIRA prevented the Occupational Safety and Health
     Administration (OSHA) from requiring all hard hats worn at
     industrial sites to be disinfected, at a cost to businesses of
     some $60 million a year. OSHA has demanded this even though hard
     hats have never been known to transmit diseases.
<P>
Example: OIRA changed an OSHA regulation that would have applied the
     complex, step-by-step safety standards followed by workers
     repairing large industrial machinery to a mechanic opening the
     hood of a car or to an electrician unplugging a lamp.
<P>
Example: OIRA headed off a Department of Housing and Urban Development
     regulation that would have required all balconies in multi-
     housing units to be flush with the inside floor level. This would
     have caused the units to flood whenever it rained.
<P>
     Despite OIRA's fine record, Glenn and other members of Congress
want to restrict its power to review regulations promulgated by the
agency and department heads who are subordinate to the President.
These Congressmen would prefer that these agencies and departments,
whose staffs consist mostly of career bureaucrats who often are more
responsive to Congress than to the President, be able to promulgate
burdensome new regulations on their own, free of presidential
interference.
<P>
     Many other members of Congress, however, understand the need to
continue freeing American entrepreneurs from the burdens of
unnecessary government red tape and regulations. A bipartisan
coalition of Senators, including Democrats Sam Nunn of Georgia and
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, and Republican Robert Kasten of Wisconsin,
has introduced the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1991 (S. 1139) to
strengthen OIRA. 
<P>
     This legislation would reauthorize OIRA for five years. It also
would close a loophole in OIRA's jurisdiction. Under current law, as
interpreted by the Supreme Court last year in Dole v. United
Steelworkers of America, OIRA has authority only to review "requests"
that call on individuals and business to provide information directly
to government agencies. Yet some one-third to one-half of the
paperwork burden on businesses is imposed by agency regulations that
"request" businesses to provide information to third parties, such as
employees or customers. These requests are not covered by the 1980
Paperwork Reduction Act. The Nunn bill would close this loophole,
making clear that the Paperwork Reduction Act applies to indirect as
well as direct paperwork requirements. The Glenn bill would leave the
loophole intact.
    <P>                      ****************

     Freeing American Businesses. As Vice President, George Bush led a
Task Force on Regulatory Relief and has often expressed his personal
commitment to lifting unnecessary regulatory burdens off the backs of
businesses. Now as President, Bush must protect the gains of the past,
and must also protect the legitimate constitutional powers of his
office. To help free American businesses from unneeded paperwork and
costly regulations, and to preserve the President's ability to control
the agencies and departments he oversees, OIRA must be left free to
carry out its responsibilities.

<TITLE>Congress Vs. Minorities: The New Davis-Bacon Rules -- Heritage </TITLE>



<CENTER><H3><I>CONGRESS VS. MINORITIES: THE NEW DAVIS-BACON RULES</I></H3>
<P>
By Scott A. Hodge and Andrew J. Cowin<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #299<BR>
4/9/91<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     The Department of Labor wants to create job opportunities for
tens of thousands of American workers, many of whom are minority,
poor, or unskilled. The Department plans to do this by expanding the
use of helpers on federal construction projects regulated by the 1931
Davis-Bacon Act. Yet Congress is attempting to block these efforts. To
protect high-paid union workers at the expense of low income workers,
Congress has tacked provisions onto the Persian Gulf emergency
spending bill (H.R. 1281), soon to arrive on George Bush's desk for
signature, that would prohibit the Labor Department from using funds
to relax the regulations now preventing less skilled minority youth
from working on federal construction projects.
<P>
     The Bush Administration correctly opposes this provision. The big
labor lobby reckons apparently that Bush will feel that he has to sign
the bill to cover the war costs incurred by non-defense agencies, even
though the bill now contains the anti-minority provisions regarding
federal construction. The Davis-Bacon Act for years has denied federal
contracts to small construction firms, many of them owned by
minorities, and jobs to low income workers. Bush should veto the bill,
telling Congress that he will not allow the Persian Gulf bill to be
held hostage to such anti-minority measures. Or the President might
use his power of "constitutional excision" and simply cross out the
offending provision from the bill. In either case, the President then
should throw his political weight behind the effort by Representative
Charles Stenholm, the Texas Democrat, to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act
altogether and thereby provide job opportunities for tens of thousands
of Americans.
<P>
     "Super-Minimum" Wage. The Davis-Bacon Act, passed in the depths
of the Great Depression, requires contractors to pay all workers on
federally funded construction projects valued at more than $2,000 the
"prevailing wage" as determined by the Department of Labor. In
practice, however, the Labor Department has tended to avoid making the
complicated wage calculations for each job classification. Instead it
uses local union wage scales as a proxy for the "prevailing wage."
Since the union wage is significantly more than the market wage, this
sets a "super-minimum" wage for each classification. This higher wage
in turn sharply reduces the pool of eligible workers likely to be
hired at that wage. Usually only union workers meet the wage test.
Traditionally the big losers in this process have been minorities --
those who are at the entry level or those who cannot break into the
union ranks.Yet individual workers are not the only victims of Davis-
Bacon. Minority and small contractors suffer also. Most of these
contractors are non-union and feel that paying Davis-Bacon wages on a
few federal projects a year would so disrupt their pay scales that it
is not worth the trouble or the administrative costs even to bid on
government projects. Most of these contractors, therefore, never
bother to bid on a Davis-Bacon regulated project.
<P>
     Davis-Bacon openly was intended to discriminate against blacks,
and that is precisely what it has done. The original Davis-Bacon Act
was drafted in 1927 by New York Republican Congressman Robert Bacon
after an Alabama contractor won the bid to build a federal hospital in
Bacon's district. As Bacon stated in the first hearing on the bill,
"The bid... was let to a firm from Alabama who brought some thousand
non-union laborers from Alabama into Long Island, N.Y., into my
congressional district." What Bacon was hinting at was that many of
the workers were black, and willing to work for less than local
building tradesmen. The debate on the bill took matters beyond
hinting. When the final bill was debated on the House floor on
February 28, 1931, Alabama Congressman Miles Allgood argued for the
Act, stating: "That contractor has cheap colored labor... and it is
labor of that sort that is in competition with white labor.. . This
bill has merit... [and] it is very important that we enact this
measure."
<P>
     Poison to Minorities. For nearly six decades Davis-Bacon has
harmed minorities. According to Ralph C. Thomas III, executive
director of the Washington, D.C.-based National Association of
Minority Contractors, "The law in its current form is poison to
minority contractors [and to] minority employment in general.... The
law stifles the minority contractors' efforts to not only hire as many
minority workers as possible, but it also hinders minority contractor
efforts to introduce new workers into the construction field."
<P>
     In an effort to give more opportunities to lower skilled workers,
the Department of Labor set out in 1982 to change the regulations that
generally had precluded "helpers" from working on federally funded
construction projects. Lower-skilled and thus lower-paid "helpers"
systematically were excluded from federal construction projects by
regulations that were "rigged" in favor of higher paid skilled workers
regardless of the tasks required. Example: if a worker who was really
a low-skilled "helper" picked up a hammer, he was declared a
"carpenter" and, therefore, must be paid a higher wage. Not only does
this discriminate against minorities, it adds billions of dollars to
federal construction costs, contributing to high budget deficits and
high taxes.
<P>
     The American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial
Organizations (AFL-CIO), whose members often benefit from Davis-Bacon,
sued the Department of Labor in 1982 to block any further enforcement
of the new regulations. After nearly eight years of litigation the
Department of Labor won on appeal and last February renewed its
efforts to enforce the regulations that would allow contractors to use
the lower-paid helpers on federally supported projects. 
<P>
     Big Labor Roadblock. The big labor lobby then struck back through
an amendment attached to the emergency spending bill by Congressman
John Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat. The amendment effectively
would withhold the funds that the Labor Department needs to carry out
the new policies and prevents the Department from administering "any
other regulation that would have the same or similar effect." The
White House's Office of Management and Budget declared its opposition
to the Murtha provision this March 7 in a "Statement of Administration
Policy."  
<P>
     Bush can make a strong statement of his support for expanding
employment opportunities for minorities and low-income workers by
vetoing this bill and sending it back to Congress for revision. Given
the President's popularity, Congress would not be able to hold Persian
Gulf money hostage to its job-destroying agenda. Or to avoid such a
situation entirely, Bush could take an even bolder approach. A number
of constitutional scholars suggest that Davis-Bacon violates the
Constitution because it discriminates against minorities. If this is
the case, as it clearly seems to be, Bush has the power through
"constitutional excision" to eliminate the offending sections from an
appropriations bill. In his only previous use of this power, on
November 3, 1989, when Bush struck a provision from an appropriations
bill, Congress did not challenge him. Whichever approach he takes,
however, the President should announce his support for efforts by
Congressman Stenholm and others to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act entirely
as a means to provide job opportunities to minorities.

<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although union members split their vote roughly 60-40 between the two major political parties in 1994, this year the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> has launched an overwhelmingly partisan $35 million "voter education project," funded mainly with mandatory union dues, to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. What most union members may not realize is that they have every right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues used to back political candidates or lobby for causes with which they may disagree. Depending on the individual union and the accounting rules applied, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 a year per union member. This alone argues for a better system both to account for and to inform union members about the use of mandatory dues payments.

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3580:">Worker Right to Know Act</a> (H.R. 3580), recently introduced by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL), would require labor unions to get permission from their members before using mandatory dues for politicking and other activities unrelated to collective bargaining. Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~gregg/">Judd Gregg</a> (R-NH) has introduced <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3580:">a similar measure</a> (S. 1845) in the Senate. The House version of this legislation has been incorporated into the campaign finance legislation currently scheduled for House floor debate.

<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The National Labor Relations Act, the basic federal law governing relations between labor unions and employers, allows a union and an employer to enter into a union security agreement that requires workers, as a condition of their employment, to pay union membership dues (or an equivalent agency fee for nonmembers). Although section 14(b) of the NLRA (popularly known as the Taft-Hartley Act) allows states to enact "Right to Work" laws that prohibit such union security agreements, only 21 states have done so. In the other 29 states and the District of Columbia, a worker can be fired for refusing to pay union dues, even if such dues are used for purposes abhorrent to his or her religious, moral, or political beliefs.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <I>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</I> that workers who so choose are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities, contract administration, and grievance processes. Writing for the majority, Justice William Brennan noted that "the National Labor Relations Act... authorizes the exaction of only those fees and dues necessary to 'performing the duties of an exclusive representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues.'"<sup>2</sup>  Unfortunately, this decision remains largely unenforced.
<p>



<b>President Bush's Executive Order</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In October 1992, President George Bush issued an executive order requiring federal contractors to notify workers of their Beck rights by posting notices of these rights at worksites.<sup></sup>  One of the Clinton Administration's first actions was to rescind this order.<sup>4</sup>  Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who frequently proclaims the Clinton Administration's concern for workers' rights, told the AFL-CIO recently that "collective bargaining is not a privilege, it is a right."<sup>5</sup>  Yet the Administration has cooperated with union officials to keep workers in the dark on their Beck rights. To Reich, the Bush executive order's requirement that workers be informed of their rights is a "burden without a benefit."<sup>6</sup>

<p>
<b>National Labor Relations Board</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to enforce the NLRA, has failed to step in to break the conspiracy of silence on this issue. Earlier this year, in the first case concerning Beck rights heard by the Board since the Supreme Court's decision eight years ago, the NLRB found that a brief notice of Beck rights in a union's annual publication was sufficient to satisfy a worker's right to know. In a dissenting opinion, however, one NLRB member declared that this single notice did not "represent a good-faith effort" to inform non-member employees of their Beck rights.<sup>7</sup>
<p>

<b>PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING LAW</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Despite the <I>Beck</I> decision, rank-and-file union members remain largely unaware of just what their rights are. In an April 1996 survey of 1,000 union members, 78 percent did not know they had a right to obtain a refund for the portion of their mandatory dues spent on political activities. The survey further revealed that once union members realized what their Beck rights were, 56 percent would be likely to request a refund.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Even for workers who are aware of their rights, trying to exercise them can be frustrating. Currently, a union can require workers to resign from the union in order to exercise their Beck rights.<sup>9</sup>  Thus, workers who want to stop contributing to union "voter education" efforts can be left without a say in such important decisions as whether to go out on strike because their unions have forced them to resign.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Moreover, unions often serve as judge in their own case by making their own estimates of the amount of dues which should be refunded to Beck claimants. Exactly what constitutes non-collective bargaining activities is a question subject to significant disagreement. Marshall J. Breger, former Solicitor of the Department of Labor, states that as much as 80 percent of union dues is used for non-collective bargaining activities, while union attorneys claim the same 80 percent figure as the amount used for collective bargaining-related expenses.<sup>10</sup>  In a recent case, the National Education Association (NEA) and a state and local affiliate were able to prove that only 10 percent of their general treasury funds were chargeable to bargaining activities.<sup>11</sup>  Workers have a right to know where their hard-earned money is going. In 1993-1994, for instance, rank and file teacher union members in Modesto, California, paid $640 in combined local, state, and national union dues.<sup>12</sup>
<p>



<b>THE WORKER RIGHT TO KNOW ACT</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In spite of foot-dragging by labor leaders, the NLRB, and President Clinton, Congress can step in to see that hard-working Americans are made aware of their Beck rights. The Worker Right to Know Act (H.R. 3580, S. 1845) would require that a union obtain a signed agreement from an employee before using dues for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities. The agreement would offer a clear statement detailing the percentage of dues used for traditional collective bargaining and the percentage used for non-collective bargaining activities such as "voter education."<sup>13</sup>  An independent auditor would determine the percentage breakdown between mandatory and voluntary activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Worker Right to Know Act also would make it clear that if individual workers chose not to give a portion of their dues to the political agendas of labor leaders, they still would retain the right to participate fully in the activities of their unions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The House version differs from the Senate version in that it would amend the NLRA and the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA), while the Senate version would amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unions argue that this legislation is unnecessary because only a small percentage of workers have chosen to exercise their Beck rights, but that is no excuse for obstructing those who do seek to exercise their rights. Moreover, union leaders fail to mention that few union dues payers have been informed of their rights. Clearly, if knowledge of Beck rights was more widespread, more workers would seek to obtain refunds.
<p>

<b>HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE?</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Determining the overall size and composition of union budgets is difficult. Information on union membership and finances provided in annual LM-2 union disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Department of Labor is often vague and incomplete. Economist James T. Bennett of George Mason University, who has done extensive work in this area, notes that the Department of Labor neither sets guidelines for the information it requests nor performs comprehensive audits in order to verify the accuracy of the information submitted.<sup>15</sup>  Therefore, unions are fully aware that incomplete or inaccurate information will not be scrutinized. For example, the United Auto Workers (UAW) lists "not available" under rates for union dues and initiation fees on all forms currently on file at the Department of Labor (forms for 1990-1995).<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

What can be discerned, however, is that rank-and-file union members in many cases are shouldering increasingly heavy burdens as membership declines. From 1991-1995, for example, among several of the major international unions that make up the AFL-CIO, total receipts taken in actually increased while membership continued to drop.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Trends in local union revenue likewise indicate the burden rank-and-file members are being forced to bear. A random sample of locals, when combined with the internationals, shows that receipts per member range from a low of $709.36 to a high of $2,019.35 per year.<sup>17</sup>  Given the vagaries of union practices and accounting procedures, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 annually per union member.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Labor unions will claim that the Worker Right to Know Act is merely election year harassment, but those who experience the real harassment and frustration are the workers who try to exercise their right to refuse to fund political causes with which they disagree. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is time to make workers aware of their rights under applicable Supreme Court decisions and to make it possible for them to exercise these rights freely. Labor unions, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Clinton Administration have kept workers uninformed of their rights. The Worker Right to Know Act would remedy this problem by giving union members the power to choose for themselves whether to give their money to political causes and by making it indisputably clear that workers can continue to participate fully in the activities of their unions even if they choose not to support the AFL-CIO's partisan political agenda.

	Wendelyn Martz has lived on both sides of the mommy wars. An urban planner in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, she had always intended to pursue her career. She took a leave of three months after the birth of her son; five weeks after her daughter was born, she raced back to work to finish a high-profile project. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Slowly she began to burn out. Her husband was working long hours, so all the duties at home landed upon her shoulders. Something had to give. "I thought, 'This is not right. I'm cheating someone and I'm probably cheating everyone,' " she says. "I needed to be home." Finally she resigned. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nevertheless, she loved her work and wanted to continue her professional interests. "I need work outside of my family," she says. "My whole world cannot be successfully reduced to just taking care of my children. I'm trying to find that middle ground." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A few years ago, Martz and a partner started a home-based business designing and marketing greeting cards. Sales took off, her husband began providing his marketing expertise, and today her Pathway Art can be found in every corner of the country, from the Borders Books chain to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in Washington, D.C. Her son, age six, even helps assemble orders and offers editorial comment on new designs. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Martz's story is becoming increasingly familiar. A growing number of career women are leaving established companies to start their own. Aided by the tools of the Information Revolution--computers, modems, and fax machine--many women with young children are becoming entrepreneurs by establishing home-based businesses. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, U.S. women own 3.5 million home-based businesses. Additionally, they provide full-time or part-time employment for an estimated 14 million people. Martz and her peers are joining an impressive group: Mrs. Field's Cookies, Est&#233e Lauder Cosmetics, Lane Bryant, Stairmaster, even Steinway pianos, all started as home-based businesses. Kim Hackett, the executive director of the Women's Home Business Network, says that information and computer-based businesses such as desktop publishing, graphic design, free-lance writing, and consulting are among the most successful such businesses. But women are finding that their skills as lawyers, accountants, real-estate agents, and public-relations professionals also translate well to businesses based at home. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's driving this wave of women entrepreneurs? For the first time in our history, the majority of babies less than a year old have mothers in the paid work force. In fact, the fastest-growing segment of mothers in the work force are precisely the ones with the greatest child-care responsibilities--those with children under six years of age. Since 1960, these mothers have <i>tripled</i> their work force participation. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The efforts of women to juggle babies and briefcases exact a stiff price: A recent issue of <i>Parents</i> magazine concluded that, among mothers, "emotional conflict is epidemic." In a startling reader survey of 18,000 women, the magazine discovered that only 4 percent of respondents would choose full-time employment if they could do "whatever they wished." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What do women really want? Most want flexibility: 61 percent of the women said they would choose part-time work if they could. Similarly, a 1995 poll of 3,000 women done by Roper Starch found that 43 percent of employed women with children would prefer to stay home. Another poll found that 87 percent of women want to spend more time caring for their children. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Meanwhile, the discussion of women and workplace issues in the women's movement and in the public-policy realm remains focused on the "glass ceiling." Women call for flexibility in employment and more time with their children while the public debate centers on day care. Even the Republican-dominated National Governors' Association favors more federal spending on day care. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the real working woman appears to be voting with her feet. According to <i>Fortune</i> magazine, "The generation of women that blazed new trails into the corporate suites is, evidently, blazing its own trails out." In 1995, <i>Fortune</i> surveyed three hundred executive women and found that 87 percent said they had made or were considering making a major change in their lives. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Home-grown entrepreneurship offers many women a way to honor their commitment to family while pursuing professional challenges. This entrepreneurial spirit has allowed some women to regain control of their lives; home-based work supplies the flexibility missing in the formal workplace. Technology and the economic dynamism of the 21st century will make home businesses a more attractive option for millions of American women.<p><b>The Taxman Cometh</b> <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Public policy threatens to stifle the vigor and creativity of the small home-based entrepreneur. "Consider the tax code," says Dianne Floyd Sutton, of the National Association for the Self-Employed. "It stands like King Canute, commanding the waves of modernization to recede." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS</a> greets the home-based worker with downright hostility and discrimination. Start with the home-office deduction. At the first national conference on home-based business, in 1994, an IRS representative commented in a workshop that "everyone who took a home-office deduction in 1993 is red-flagged for an audit." Here's the problem: To deduct the expenses of a home office, tax expert J.K. Lasser explains, you "must be able to prove that you use the home area exclusively and on a regular basis" for one of two reasons--either as a place of business to meet with customers in the normal course of your business, or as your "principal place of business." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The IRS interpretation of this law has been exceptionally stringent. Lasser points out that one woman who ran a roadside stand selling home-prepared items a mile from her home was not allowed to deduct her home-office expenses, because the IRS ruled that the stand was her principal place of business. In a similar case, a challenge to that interpretation reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1993, the Court  ruled that a deduction is not allowable when the home office is used only for administrative purposes and not for seeing customers. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This ruling hits women especially hard. In a hearing before the Small Business Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, Beverley Williams, the president of the <a href="http://www.aahbb.org">American Association of Home-Based Businesses</a>, testified that not allowing deductions for business owners who conduct business outside their home offices raises a safety issue. "Many women choose . . . to not receive their clients who are strangers into their homes," Williams said. "They should not be asked to compromise their safety or perception of safety for the sake of business deductions that other small businesses enjoy." <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other legal minutiae can bog down home-grown businesses:<ul><p><li>The "exclusive use" clause raises a hurdle for people caring for dependents, such as mothers with young children. An IRS auditor who found a diaper-changing table in a home office, for example, might disallow the deduction.<p><li>Home-based businesses are caught between local zoning laws and IRS rules. Zoning laws sometimes preclude home-based business owners from meeting clients in their offices, thereby jeopardizing their deductions. But business owners who rent offices outside their home have no difficulty deducting these office expenses, even if they, too, always meet clients elsewhere. What justifies the disparity?<p><li>IRS rules are murky in defining when a home-based business can claim "independent contractor" status. Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~nickles/">Don Nickles</a> of Oklahoma laments, "This distinction is determined by an arbitrary 20-part Internal Revenue Service common-law test. This inconsistent method has been the bane of small business owners who often face bankrupting penalties and taxation despite good-faith efforts to properly classify employees for tax purposes."	<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Over the last seven years, the IRS has reclassified 439,000 independent contractors as employees and collected more than $750 million in fines. Nickles and Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/bond.html">Christopher Bond</a> of Missouri have introduced the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1610:">Independent Contractor Simplification Act</a> of 1996 to reform tax rules in favor of home businesses. Representative <a href="http://www.house.gov/christensen/welcome.html">Jon Christensen</a>, a Republican from Nebraska, has introduced a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.1972:">similar bill</a> in the House, collecting more than 200 cosponsors.<p><li>Health-insurance costs are only partially deductible for home businesses. Author Paul Edwards, an expert in home-based businesses, points out that corporations may deduct 100 percent of health-care costs for their employees. Moreover, the health-care benefits are not counted as taxable income for the employees. But home-based firms can deduct only 30 percent of their health-care costs. President Clinton recently signed a bill increasing this deduction by 5 percent a year--but the increase will top out at 50 percent, maintaining the bias against home-based businesses.</ul><p><b>Resources </b> <P>

Main benefit to being home: being with your kids. Big obstacle to productivity: being with your kids. It can be done without a baby sitter and, after all, the point is to see them more than you would working away from home. But most people should plan to use some kind of baby-sitting.

Be professional. There's nothing like trading the perks of an office and an expense account for baby spit-up and dirty dishes to undermine a professional attitude. And our society sends not-so-subtle messages that moms and home are not cutting edge. Don't buy it. A professional image is critical and begins with inner confidence. Authors Paul and Sarah Edwards say that "being taken seriously" is the one of biggest challenges for home-based workers. The antidote is careful professionalism.<p>4. Network, network, network. Other challenges for the home-based worker are marketing, becoming out-of-touch, and personal isolation. These are disparate problems; the answer to all three is the same: use networking to help identify your home-based business or job . . . and then don't stop. Keep in touch with former colleagues. Drop notes. Do lunch. One mother who downshifted her career began giving dinner parties to maintain contacts; she's still in the loop and in demand.<p>5. Measure twice, cut once. One size does not fit all when it comes to work/family arrangements. Home-based businesses are not for everyone: it's wise to "count the cost" before beginning. Run with your talents, and recognize your limit
ations; if you are a people person who needs structure, a home-based situation might not be for you. And, although professions such as desktop publishing are suited to home-based operations, others are not.<p>It is tempting to whitewash the sacrifices involved in switching gears in your career, but there are no easy answers to the work/family dilemma. Facing that reality squarely raises your chances of success by allowing you to focus on the rich rewards of working at home, rather than on the opportunities left behind.

<h2>The Market Approach to Job Training</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The 1996 presidential primaries have pushed the plight of American workers to the top of the nation's political agenda. Some commentators argue that unfair foreign competition and callous executives have destroyed the social contract between employers and employees. Others say that inexorable economic and social trends, such as the Information Revolution, are enlarging the prospects for highly skilled workers while displacing those with less education.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All sides seem to agree that America must raise the educational level of its workers. But would-be reformers often forget that the largest educational system in the United States is neither the public schools nor institutions of higher learning. It is the education and training workers receive from their employers or in the private marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Workers learn new skills, information, and problem-solving strategies virtually every day, in formal courses or on the job. Motivated by competition and the search for greater value, many businesses try to raise productivity through training programs. In the long run, such efforts pay off in larger profits, better products, and higher wages.
<p><img src="bless2.gif" align=left><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<I>Training</I> magazine's annual survey of employee-training programs helps to clarify the issue. In 1995, about 50 million workers received some kind of formal training, up 25 percent since 1990. Employers spent more than $50 billion on formal training in 1995. Based on a ratio of formal to informal training documented in other studies, one can estimate that firms spent approximately $300 billion in informal training that same year, including the cost of supervision and lost-production time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly 90 percent of companies with more than 100 employees provided courses in management skills or basic computer skills. Many also taught skills in communication, supervising, and clerical work. While 70 percent of employers provided training for middle managers and executives, only about 40 percent did so for salespeople and production workers. Such workers are more likely, however, to receive informal, on-the-job training not included in these statistics.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Why do companies train their employees? Workers who become more skilled in their jobs are more productive. Also, studies show that training can raise employee loyalty and reduce turnover, in part because workers often find their skills to be more valuable at the firm where they were acquired.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One way to gauge the value of workplace training is to see how many workers needed some to qualify for the jobs they currently hold. A 1991 survey by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) found that 57 percent of workers said they needed training to qualify for their current jobs. About half of those workers learned such skills on the job. Another 21 percent received their training from formal company programs. Much smaller percentages said they obtained necessary skills from high school or post-secondary educational programs. Similarly, when BLS asked workers where they had received any training to improve skills, formal and informal company programs again accounted for about three-quarters.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One interesting finding of the study was that many workers with college degrees earn less than workers without college degrees who nevertheless have obtained specific training for their jobs. BLS economist Alan Eck wrote that company-provided training programs, particularly formal ones, "have more of an impact on increasing those workers' earnings than does any other source of training."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Corporate training programs run the gamut from high-tech training centers to on-the-job instruction in word processing or operating machinery. Motorola, which makes cellular phones and paging gear, is often cited as a model for its variety of training programs. The company gives all employees at least 40 hours of training a year. Much of this training occurs at Motorola University, its $120-million, 14-branch teaching center.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1985, Motorola discovered that its employees lacked even the basic skills the fast-growing manufacturer needed. About 60 percent of its work force had trouble with seventh-grade math, necessary to track error rates, compute percentages, and solve other problems. Bob Galvin, then the chairman of the company, decided to devote at least 1.5 percent of payroll to training. (This has since risen to 4 percent.) All employees must have at least seventh-grade proficiency in math, and Motorola has even begun training its suppliers in statistical process control to reduce errors.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Motorola's experience is not unusual. Forty-three percent of firms surveyed by <I>Training</I> magazine offered remedial education, defined in its broadest sense, including a host of academic skills. Limiting the definition just to reading, writing, arithmetic, and English as a second language, the magazine found that 22 percent of employers provided these services. That's an astounding number -- and 67 percent of those receiving remedial education are actually graduates of American high schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Corporate training is an enormous enterprise that employs thousands of Americans. One company with a substantial investment in it is Manpower Inc., the largest temp agency in the United States. About one million people each year get job assignments from Manpower, and many of those workers go through a company-run program that provides training in technical and computer skills, communication, customer service, and quality control. Manpower also sells its training expertise directly to employers; almost 90 percent of <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies have called on Manpower to help train their employees. As of 1995, 500,000 workers in thousands of companies had benefited from Skillware, the company's computer-assisted training program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some companies pay the tuition for their employees to attend community colleges or night school. Other firms contract out their training needs to private trainers. Companies such as Berlitz International have long provided corporate training in such areas as foreign languages, money management, business communication, and computer software. I recently visited a new training company in Greensboro, North Carolina, that uses interactive computer systems to train local employees faster and cheaper than nearby colleges can. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Avco Financial Services, in Irvine, California, asked a local nonprofit literacy organization to help start an English-as-a-second-language program for its employees. The literacy council has trained dozens of Avco employees to serve as tutors for their English-language-deficient coworkers, many of whom are recent immigrants. While improving the language skills of many employees, the program has cost the company little. Both tutors and students work on language instruction on their own time. William Dudek, the president of a manufacturing firm in Chicago, created a similar English-instruction program as well as basic math classes for his employees. "We're not saints here," he says. "We're in business to make money. We just thought this was the best way to do it."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Corporate job training is not confined to higher-skill, higher-wage occupations. Carolinas Associated General Contractors, a trade association, offers classes in construction fundamentals, math, electrical work, plumbing, carpentry, sheet metal, and mechanical skills to prospective construction workers, because its members desperately need skilled individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On a much larger scale, McDonald's U.S.A. trains thousands of young people each year in its nearly 9,000 U.S. restaurants. "Sending a kid to the Army used to be the standard way to teach kids values, discipline, respect for authority, to be a member of a team, get to work on time, brush your teeth, comb your hair, clean your fingernails," says Edward H. Rensi, the firm's president and CEO. "Now, somehow, McDonald's has become the new entry-level job-training institution in America. We find ourselves doing things in that role that we would never have imagined we would do." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, companies must subject training expenses to a rigorous cost-benefit test. The 1995 <I>Training</I> magazine survey found that business managers scrutinize training expenses to evaluate their impact on productivity. Almost two-thirds of the employers surveyed said they evaluate trainees' behavior after they return to the job, including testing workers to find out what they've learned, while about half of employers look for quantifiable changes in business results, such as sales, labor costs, or error rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite this enormous investment in training, many workers have few or no marketable skills. The problem is one of wasted resources. Public schools spend a tremendous amount of tax money but often fail to prepare young people academically to benefit from training later on. Government-sponsored job-training programs have consistently posted mediocre returns on the billions of dollars in tax money they spent.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Furthermore, federal and state subsidies encourage students to pursue post-secondary training in an inefficient manner. Federally guaranteed student loans and generous state subsidies entice students to enroll in colleges, but a surprisingly low percentage graduate. The time students waste in irrelevant (and often outdated) community-college and university classes might be better spent finding an employer that teaches useful skills. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Clinton administration and some Republican lawmakers have proposed that federal job-training programs be converted into vouchers for worker retraining. We need to go much further. Washington and the states should direct all subsidies and financial aid for post-secondary education and training directly to students and away from any particular institution. Business and payroll taxes should also be reduced to allow firms and workers to spend more of their own money on education and training. And workers should be allowed to accumulate funds (including unspent subsidies) in tax-free Educational Savings Accounts to pay for career changes and retraining in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This approach would empower workers to make their own decisions about their needs and would make better use of this country's largest and most effective educational system: private business.

<P>
The 104th Congress is considering proposals to reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and merge it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The goal of these reforms is to redefine the federal government's role in workplace safety and health to "refocus the responsibility for ensuring worksite safety and health on the workplace."1  In recent years, the federal government has been perceived as more concerned with maintaining bureaucracies and filling out paperwork than with working cooperatively with businesses to make workplaces safer.
<p>
Although Congress intended for OSHA and MSHA to assure all workers safe and healthy working conditions, the effectiveness of these agencies in carrying out their missions is questionable. From rulemaking to enforcement, the regulatory nightmare that businesses face has made OSHA inspectors as feared as IRS auditors.2  Although most employers maintain relatively safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA maintains an adversarial approach to setting and enforcing standards. Consequently, many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for compliance assistance3 for fear of triggering punitive inspections. Further, the legal requirement that every mine be inspected four times a year makes it virtually impossible for MSHA to target enforcement resources where they are needed most -- mines with poor safety records. 
<p>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending. The National Performance Review recognized that an army of OSHA inspectors is neither necessary nor likely given the federal budget situation, and MSHA's "lengthy approval process delays the introduction of new technologies that may improve mine safety."4  Businesses already have much stronger financial incentives than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost productivity, workers' compensation, and liability claims,5 to maintain and continually improve the safety of their workplaces. Thus, the role of the federal government should be redefined from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner.
<p>

<b>CURRENT REFORM INITIATIVES</b>
<p>
A number of bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to reform workplace health and safety programs. The leading bill in the House is H.R. 1834, the Safety and Health Improvement and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, introduced by Representative Cass Ballenger (R-NC). In the Senate, Judd Gregg (R-NH) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Amendments of 1995 (S. 526), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) has introduced the Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act of 1995 (S. 592). Of these three bills, H.R. 1834 represents the most comprehensive OSHA reform. It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative overhead and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA.
<p>
Legislative changes are necessary to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a permanent, central part of its program and mission. Efforts to reprioritize agency spending or administratively reinvent the agencies would change their bureaucratic culture only marginally and do little to consolidate administrative overhead and eliminate duplicative activities. President Clinton offered to reinvent OSHA after the 104th Congress announced its intention to create a more effective and efficient OSHA.6
<p>
In addition, President Clinton's proposed FY 1996 budget increased funding for compliance assistance by 23 percent while increasing overall OSHA spending by 10.9 percent. However, Congress can accomplish much more by fundamentally redefining the role of the federal government so that it recognizes and more effectively utilizes the incentives businesses already have to improve workplace health and safety.
<p>

<b>What Congress Should Do</b>
<p>
Significantly reform OSHA.
Although executive branch initiatives to reinvent workplace health and safety are welcome, statutory changes are required to redefine the federal government's role and ensure that congressional intent is carried out. Specifically,<P>
<ul>
<li><b>Reform OSHA's regulatory process.</b><br>
OSHA's bureaucratic culture and lawyers have put the search for completely risk-free workplaces and ease of prosecution above common sense. As a result, it can take ten or more years to complete a rule.7  OSHA's regulatory process would be more timely and less burdensome if it focused initially on hazards that pose the greatest risk to the most workers. The development of compliance directives should be made part of the rulemaking process and tied directly to economic analysis. Far too often, compliance directives are more burdensome than the rules themselves. OSHA also should be required to reassess the actual costs and benefits of its regulations after five years.
<p>

<li><b>Enhance and expand compliance assistance.</b><br>
Translating OSHA's confusing jumble of regulations into safer workplaces is difficult at best. Most employers want safe and healthy workplaces if OSHA will just tell them how. Unfortunately, the Department of Labor is more concerned with prosecuting employers than with providing accurate, reliable compliance information. Explicitly redefining OSHA's mission towards compliance assistance will leverage employers' desire for safety and dramatically improve workplace safety and health.
<P>
<li><b>Allow inspectors to issue first instance warnings for hazards that do not pose an imminent danger.</b><br>
OSHA continues its adversarial approach to standard setting and enforcement. Many employers are reluctant to call OSHA for assistance in making their workplaces safer for fear of triggering punitive inspections. First instance warnings will remove a major barrier to voluntary compliance.
<p>
<li><b>Require OSHA inspectors to have some expertise in the industry they are inspecting.</b><br>
OSHA inspectors are called upon to inspect a variety of workplaces, many of which, like mining, involve complex operations.8  Employers and employees deserve to have their workplaces inspected by qualified persons. 
<p>
<li><b>Merge MSHA into a reformed OSHA.</b><br>
Although OSHA and the MSHA were created separately, the rationale for keeping them apart no longer exists. Workplace injury and illness data no longer justify maintaining these agencies as separate entities with practically the same level of resources.9  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA and reallocating federal resources will accomplish two important objectives:  It will eliminate administrative overhead and duplicative costs, and increase workplace health and safety in all industries.
</ul><P>
Reforming the Mine Act to require only one inspection per year will enable MSHA to shift its inspection resources from mine operators with exemplary safety records to operators with poor safety records. By focusing on the "bad players," OSHA's new Mine Office will improve mine safety where it is needed most. Mine operators with good safety records will continue to have incentives to remain safe, in addition to fewer inspections and lower workers' compensation costs, and the new Mine Office will be able to use its resources more efficiently to focus on the "bad players."  Further, merging the two agencies will settle jurisdictional questions about enforcement and eliminate the maze of memoranda of understanding that currently exists between OSHA and MSHA. Mine workers and taxpayers will get more mine safety for their hard-earned dollars.
<p>
Heritage Foundation analysts estimate that consolidating MSHA and OSHA could save up to $510 million over five years.10  Merging MSHA and OSHA would eliminate the need for the federal government to write two separate health regulations covering the same workplace hazard, one for mining and one for everybody else. For example, there is no reason to have two separate Hazard Communication Standards, and noise protection for miners is no different from noise protection for other workers. Regional and administrative offices would be combined, and MSHA's Office of Information and Public Affairs could be eliminated.
<p>
Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA will not reduce workplace health and safety. No MSHA safety or health regulations would be abolished.11  Each underground mine will be thoroughly inspected at least once a year by qualified inspectors, and all workers will be able to request federal inspections if employers ignore their concerns about unsafe conditions. MSHA's imminent danger closure rule will be maintained, and mine workers finally will be covered by OSHA's health regulations. Focusing resources on compliance assistance will improve the ability of "good players" to translate OSHA and MSHA regulations into safer workplaces. Most important, by requiring only one mandatory inspection per year instead of four, a new OSHA/MSHA will be able to reallocate its resources to focus on improving the "bad players" instead of legally having to inspect mines with good safety records.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Federal workplace health and safety laws should be reformed to redefine the government's role and leverage the strong incentives businesses already have to improve and maintain workplace health and safety. Statutory reform is required to enable MSHA to allocate resources more efficiently and OSHA to work cooperatively with businesses -- for example, by making compliance assistance a central part of its program and mission. Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA is a sensible first step toward improving workplace health and safety, limiting unnecessary government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful government spending.
<p>
Redefining government's role in workplace health and safety should refocus the responsibility for ensuring workplace safety and health on employers and employees. Common-sense regulations and compliance assistance combined with competitive market pressures to increase productivity, keep skilled workers, and minimize legal and insurance costs will do more to increase workplace health and safety than any army of government inspectors and lawyers. Reforming OSHA and consolidating it with MSHA is a win-win for hard-working American taxpayers. American workers and taxpayers will get healthier, safer workplaces at lower cost.

<HR>

<P>

The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion workers -- chiefly blacks and Hispanics -- from competing for federally funded construction jobs. Unfortunately for these workers, it has succeeded.
<P>
Congress once again is considering repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act. And thanks to the shift in power in Congress, this year's budget process offers a real opportunity to end this Depression-era law that protects racial discrimination in the construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special interests. If the facts were the only issue, there would be no need for debate -- the Davis-Bacon Act would have been repealed long ago. However, this effort may be undermined once more by intense pressure from special interests seeking to preserve generous subsidies at the  expense of taxpayers and minority workers. Congress must withstand this pressure, act in the interests of all American taxpayers, and repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. 
<P>
The Davis-Bacon Act was adopted in 1931 when the United States was mired in the Great Depression and Congress was under a great deal of pressure to protect wages and jobs. The Act was intended to protect local unionized contractors from outside nonunionized contractors using lower cost itinerant labor, typically black workers from the South and immigrants. Davis-Bacon accomplished this by requiring contractors to pay local "prevailing" wages -- as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor -- to workers on federally funded construction projects valued at more than $2,000. Where union wage rates and benefits are specified as prevailing in a particular locality, nonunion firms and workers lose an important cost advantage in bidding for federally funded construction contracts. Further, the Department of Labor's implementing regulations continue to impose rigid craft-based job classifications and restrictive apprenticeship regulations that inflate costs by reducing productivity and sharply limit an employer's ability to hire or train       unskilled minority workers. 
<P>

<h3>FOUR REASONS WHY CONGRESS MUST REPEAL DAVIS-BACON </h3>

<b>Reason #1: Davis-Bacon was enacted out of fear and racism and continues to penalize minorities. 
</b><p>
A review of the Congressional Record reveals clearly that passage of Davis-Bacon was motivated by fear that blacks and immigrants were taking jobs from native-born white Americans. Ever since its adoption, Davis-Bacon has led to discrimination against minorities in the construction industry. In 1932, one year after enactment, only 30 of the 4,100 workers employed on the Boulder Dam project were black Americans. In 1962, two years before the landmark Civil Rights Act was passed, local construction unions in Washington, D.C., prevented black electricians from working on one of the capital's premiere building projects:  the Rayburn House Office Building.1
<P>
Even after 30 years of federally required reverse discrimination and minority set-asides, Davis-Bacon continues to keep minorities out of the construction industry. In 1994, black workers accounted for 10.4 percent of total employment but only 6.4 percent of construction industry jobs.
<P>
Davis-Bacon restricts the potential for minority-owned firms to compete for federal construction contracts. Nona Brazier, a minority co-owner of Seattle-based Brazier Construction Company, explains that to win Davis-Bacon contracts, firms not only must pay inflated wages and adopt inefficient work practices, but also must expose themselves to heavy compliance costs, threats of litigation, and union harassment.2  Well-capitalized companies can afford union wages, but their unions historically have excluded blacks. Black businesses -- often not as well capitalized -- are less able to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates. Few minority-owned firms win Davis-Bacon contracts, and many give up trying.
<P>
On May 8, 1995, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied a Department of Justice   motion to dismiss a constitutional challenge to the Davis-Bacon Act. The suit charges that Davis-Bacon would not have passed Congress if not for racial discrimination and that it continues to discriminate and deny economic opportunity today. In allowing the case to move forward, Judge William B. Bryant agreed that the case has merits that require a hearing.
<P>

<B>Reason #2:  Davis-Bacon costs taxpayers at least $1.5 billion each year through inflated construction costs.
</B><P>
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that Davis-Bacon costs the American taxpayers at least $1.5 billion per year. This is primarily because the prevailing wage determinations made by the    Department of Labor do not reflect market wages. In Oakland, California, carpenters get about $28.00 an hour on federally funded projects; the pay in private construction is about $15 per hour.3
<P>
The CBO estimates that repealing Davis-Bacon would save American taxpayers $2.7 billion to $5.3 billion from 1996 to 2000.4  These funds could be used for such things as reducing the federal deficit or increasing the number of construction projects. Repealing Davis-Bacon also would reduce significantly the construction costs for state and local government projects that involve matching federal funds.
<P>

<b>Reason #3:  Davis-Bacon imposes unnecessary regulatory burdens and heavy paperwork requirements.
</B><P>
By requiring strict assignment of workers and payroll reporting on a craft-by-craft basis, Davis-Bacon  impedes normal industry practices that improve productivity and efficiency. For example, Davis-Bacon regulations frustrate the practice of working across craft lines and discourage the use of semi-skilled helpers by requiring that all workers be paid journeymen's wages.5  This raises the cost of federally funded   construction projects.
<P>
Repealing Davis-Bacon and the related Copeland Act6 would free up an estimated five million labor hours per year that contractors now must spend completing weekly payroll requirements that Department of Labor bureaucrats admit they ignore.7  This is the equivalent of 2,400 full-time, year-round workers that could be doing something more productive. The cost of complying with these paperwork burdens is not borne by the contractor, but is passed on to the taxpayer as part of the project cost.
<P>

<b>Reason #4:  Davis-Bacon needlessly and unfairly subsidizes unions.
</b><p>The 1931 Davis-Bacon Act predated virtually all of today's basic worker protections, so its work protection provisions are unnecessary or obsolete. Today, minimum wage laws and overtime provisions prevent the exploitation of workers. Construction safety standards protect worker health and safety. State licensing requirements and building codes ensure quality construction by qualified workers. Further, the government now has an elaborate procurement process that screens out unscrupulous and incompetent contractors.
<P>
While the rest of the country pays competitively determined wages for high quality construction projects,8 Davis-Bacon requires that taxpayers pay more for federally funded construction projects. There is no reason for government to subsidize the wages of construction workers earning an average of $27,500.  Without Davis-Bacon, construction workers still would be earning on average more than $26,000.
<P>
The only significant groups that actively support retention of Davis-Bacon in its present form are the building and construction trade unions and their allies in the Congress and the Clinton Administration. But Congress should be looking out for the interests of taxpayers and all workers, not just those who gain from a restrictive law.
<P>

<B>CONCLUSION
</B>
Repealing Davis-Bacon would:
<P>
<ul><li>Remove a major impediment to unskilled minority workers entering the construction industry and minority firms competing for contracts.
<P>
<li>Allow federal, state, and local construction dollars to go farther because costs would be lower and productivity higher. Taxpayers would get more for their money.
<P>
<li>Allow free markets, not bureaucrats, to determine wages on federally funded construction projects.
</ul><p>
If Davis-Bacon were not already law it would never be passed today. Proponents of such a law would be denounced as supporting discrimination. It would be pointed out that worker-protection provisions in the legislation are unnecessary because they exist in other statutes. And lawmakers would object to the heavy, unnecessary budget costs imposed by the legislation.
<P>
Unfortunately, the legislation is already on the books. It is time to remove it.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly important to the United States. In 1995, U.S. two-way merchandise trade with the Asia-Pacific region rose to $503 billion, 38 percent of America's global two-way merchandise trade. Despite such economic intensity, however, Asia-Pacific trade remains susceptible to political upheaval that could endanger American security. The People's Republic of China is building a large military which could be used to enforce its territorial claims on the Spratly Islands and Taiwan. North Korea simultaneously poses the threats of military aggression and internal collapse. In Southeast Asia, Cambodia and Myanmar continue to repress their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region, America needs partners. The U.S. already has a number of defense partners in Asia; but some, like Japan, are not very good at liberalizing trade and other commercial activities in the region. Australia, however, in addition to being a military ally, could function effectively in helping to advance America's interest in liberalizing trade in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Australia became a major player in the Asia-Pacific region only recently. For most of this century, the government in Canberra purposely developed a strong Western cultural and economic identity; but its protectionist policies also brought the country to the edge of economic ruin by the 1980s. Following the Labor Party's victory in the March 1983 elections, Prime Minister Bob Hawke began to deregulate the economy and dismantle protectionist trade barriers. Over the next decade, Australia was transformed from the developed world's second most protected economy into a leading proponent of free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under Hawke, Australia embraced the Asian market, welcomed Asian immigration, and reoriented Canberra's diplomatic and economic ties away from Europe and toward Asia and the United States. The result has been economic vitality, and newly elected Prime Minister John Howard is continuing these successful policies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, Canberra has developed especially close relations with countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).<sup>1</sup>  As an outside superpower, the U.S. cannot easily duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and dedication have presented to Australia. By cooperating with Canberra on trade and security issues, Washington can benefit from Australia's unique relations with other Asian countries to secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, however, the U.S.-Australian relationship is not living up to its potential. While Canberra and Washington are cooperating more closely on defense matters,<sup>2</sup> the U.S. often pursues counterproductive agriculture and trade policies that cost Americans and Australians dearly. For example, President Bill Clinton's vacillating trade policy is undermining Canberra's hopes for trade liberalization at the upcoming meetings of APEC ministers in the Philippines on November 22-25 and of the WTO in Singapore on December 9-12. The U.S. should be working with, not against, Australia to make these meetings a success for free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Improving relations with Australia will help the U.S. better protect its interests in the caldron of economic opportunity and geopolitical danger that is Asia. To accomplish this goal, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs</b> that together cost American consumers and taxpayers more than $10 billion every year.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> The current Jones Act requirement that intracoastal shipping use U.S.-built, U.S.-operated, and U.S.-owned vessels adds between $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs of American firms.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> Fast track is needed to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to present a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC, and to participate in any future round of WTO negotiations.
<p>
<li><b> Support Australia's initiative to harmonize such existing free trade agreements</b> as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER), and ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) within APEC. This would enhance the prospects for expanding liberalization within APEC itself.
<p>
<li><b> Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> Under concerted unilateralism, each APEC member prepares its own action plan to liberalize trade and investment, with each plan then subject to peer review to help assure compliance in achieving the ultimate goal. At present, there still are too many differences among APEC members for formal trade negotiations to succeed. Concerted unilateralism allows APEC members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if members gain confidence in each other can a more formal negotiating process be successful.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</b> These include sector agreements to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport, and new negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b>
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles and by including Canberra in the development any future Asian missile defense network.</b>
</ul>
<p>

<b>AUSTRALIA: A RISING POWER IN ASIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is easy for Americans to overlook Australia when thinking about Asian countries. Both stable and prosperous, Australia demands little attention from the crisis-dependent U.S. media. Moreover, most Americans do not really think of Australia as an Asian country. Unlike Asian countries with exotic cultures and languages, Australia and the U.S. share a common culture and language. It can be argued that Australia is more like the U.S. than any other country in the world.
</td></tr>But to overlook Australia when examining the Asia-Pacific region is a serious omission. There are four reasons for drawing this conclusion:
<p><blockquote>
<b>REASON #1: Australia is a major market for American goods and services</b>, with a large and vibrant economy. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 was $347.6 billion, making Australia's economy the fourth-largest in Asia and the 14th-largest in the world.</b> Despite Australia's relatively small population of 18 million, its GDP is larger than that of India, Taiwan, or any Southeast Asian country. Only China, Japan, and South Korea have larger economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia is the world's 21st-largest trading power and America's 20th-largest trading partner.</b> Merchandise trade between Australia and the U.S. was $13.4 billion in 1995. In fact, the U.S. enjoyed a $7.5 billion merchandise trade surplus with Australia -- the largest such U.S. surplus with any of the world's trading powers.
<p>
<li><b> Australia hosts American direct investments of $24.7 billion.</b> Australia is the ninth-largest host to U.S. direct investment in the world and the second-largest in Asia, ranking only behind Japan.
<p>
<li><b> Trade and investment liberalization has expanded U.S. exports to Australia significantly in recent years.</b> U.S. merchandise exports to Australia have grown by 94 percent, from $5.5 billion in 1986 to $10.8 billion in 1995, and currently provide jobs to approximately 215,000 American workers. Under Canberra's liberal economic policy (especially its policy of privatization), U.S. direct investment in Australia has exploded by 165 percent, rising from $9.3 billion in 1986 to $24.7 billion in 1995.
</ul><p>
<b>REASON #2: Australia is a major proponent of free trade and investment.</b> For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia led the fight to include agricultural trade liberalization in the Uruguay Round Agreements.</b> In 1986, Australia organized the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting countries to promote free trade in farm products.<sup>3</sup>  Under Australian leadership, the Cairns Group succeeded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in winning the first multilateral agreement to liberalize trade in agricultural products. Along with Brazil, the European Union, Japan, and the U.S., Australia is widely considered to be one of the five most influential members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
<p>
<li><b> Australia founded the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> In January 1989, Prime Minister Bob Hawke proposed a meeting of government ministers from the Asia-Pacific region to establish a framework for economic cooperation. This led to the formation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Canberra in November 1989.<sup>4</sup>  In November 1994, at Bogor, Indonesia, Australia and the other APEC member economies established the goal of "achieving free and open trade and investment" by 2010 for developed economies and by 2020 for developing economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia and New Zealand were the first countries to outlaw antidumping procedures in a free trade agreement.</b> In 1988, Australia and New Zealand agreed to revise the original Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER) to make it the world's most comprehensive trade agreement. The CER removed all tariffs and quotas on trade in goods by 1990, established free trade in services, abolished antidumping procedures in bilateral trade, created a common labor market, and harmonized business and trade practices laws. As tariffs have fallen, protectionists in the U.S. and elsewhere increasingly have been employing antidumping procedures to curb imports. By abolishing antidumping procedures, the CER prevents such abuses.
<p>
<li><b> Unlike the U.S., Australia has lowered its trade barriers unilaterally.</b> In May 1988, Australia announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be lowered from 15 percent to 10 percent by July 1992. In March 1991, it announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be reduced further to 5 percent by July 1996, and that tariffs on textiles, clothing, and footwear would be reduced from 55 percent to 25 percent by July 2000.

</table>
<p>
<b>REASON #3: Australia is a strong military ally.</b> Australia is one of America's most steadfast military allies. Australian and American troops fought together in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. Australia and the U.S. also are parties to a mutual defense treaty: the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty, commonly known as ANZUS.<sup>5</sup>  Australia and Japan are among America's major military allies in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, the Howard government recently has shown its willingness to enhance cooperation with the United States on defense and regional security issues. On July 26, 1996, Canberra agreed to host a new series of biennial military exercises called "Tandem Thrust."  The first war game in March 1997 will involve 17,000 U.S. Marines and 5,000 Australian troops near Shoalwater Bay in Queensland. Subsequent American military training exercises will occur in the Northern Territory of Australia. Because of this cooperation, the U.S. can shift much of its Asian battle training away from densely populated Japan and Korea to sparsely populated areas of Australia (and possibly help to defuse local political tensions over American bases in Japan and Korea as well).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Canberra and Washington also have agreed to cooperate on missile defense issues. China is modernizing its missile forces and twice in the last year has used its missiles to threaten democratic Taiwan. During a July 1996 meeting in Canberra, Australian Minister of Defense Ian McLachlan and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry signed a new ten-year lease that will allow the U.S. to use a jointly manned intelligence facility at Pine Gap. The functions of this base will expand to include intelligence satellite downlinks now at the Nurrungar, Australia, facility, which soon will be closed. The Nurrungar facility enabled the U.S. Space Command to help Patriot missile operators defeat Iraqi Scud missiles during the Persian Gulf War, and Pine Gap could help the U.S. provide defense support that Israel can use to defeat missile threats. Such capabilities also could help Australia defend itself from missile threats.<sup>6</sup>  Australia is in an ideal position to facilitate regional missile defense cooperation, and the facilities at Pine Gap could be expanded to provide intelligence information that might help the United States verify a future arms control agreement to limit the number of missiles deployed by Asian countries.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>REASON #4: Australia maintains close diplomatic ties to Asia.</b> Australia can influence economic policymakers in Asian countries in ways the U.S. cannot. Canberra originated the concept of a regional economic forum that led to the formation of APEC in 1989. It also worked closely with President Suharto of Indonesia to persuade more reluctant APEC members to agree to the 1994 Bogor Declaration, which set as APEC's objective "achieving free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies."  Australia's successful trade liberalization encouraged the ASEAN countries to create their own ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in January 1992 and to reduce the period for its implementation from 15 to ten years in October 1995. Canberra's cooperative attitude toward trade with Asia has increased Australian influence in Asian capitals. For example, the Howard government is working closely with ASEAN leaders to coordinate strategy in APEC and the WTO.

This remarkable new role for Australia has not occurred overnight. It is the result of a long transformation with deep roots in Australian history.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's proximity to Asia, for most of its history it has thought of itself as a European country. Because of this self-conception, Australian governments pursued policies known collectively as the "Australian Settlement."  Among other things, the Australian Settlement encompassed a "whites only" immigration policy, dependence on the United Kingdom for defense and markets, and a highly protected and regulated domestic economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Throughout most of this century, Canberra tried to promote industrial development through a system of high tariffs and subsidies to Australian manufacturers. But this protectionism caused a protracted decline in Australia's economy relative to the economies of other developed countries. In 1900, Australia had the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world. Over the next 80 years, it experienced the slowest growth in per capita GDP of all developed countries. By 1980, Australia had fallen to 14th place in per capita GDP.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1970s, Australia's defense and trade ties to Great Britain diminished. The United Kingdom's accession to the European Union in 1973 denied Australia preferential access to its historically most important export market. Meanwhile, the economic rise of Japan and the other "Asian tigers" provided Australia with vast new markets for its agricultural and mineral products. The integration of separate national economies into a single global economy made Australia's inward-looking economic policies increasingly burdensome.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus began a gradual backing away from the Australian Settlement policies. In 1973, Prime Minister Geoff Whitlam ended the "whites only" immigration policy. The result was significant Asian immigration, which caused Canberra slowly to begin to see itself more as an Asian country. Asian immigrants, with their cultural knowledge and language skills, have become a major asset for Australian firms doing business in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the decisive break with the Australian Settlement came in March 1983. Suffocating from double-digit inflation and unemployment rates, Australian voters elected a Labor Government led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating. Contrary to what people normally expected of a Labor government, Hawke and Keating, driven by fear of an economic crisis, began to liberalize Australia's economy. Keating himself best summarized the challenges facing Australia:
<p>
<blockquote>
	We must let Australians know truthfully, honestly, earnestly, just what sort of international hole Australia is in.... If this government cannot get... a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for. We will end up being just a third rate economy....  Then you are gone. You are a banana republic.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hawke and Keating boldly rejected Australia's traditional policy of protectionism. The Labor government exposed Australia's domestic economy to global market forces through deregulation, privatization, and trade liberalization. The Hawke (1983-1991) and subsequent Keating (1991-1996) governments reoriented Australia's trade policies toward Asia, and Australia began to think of itself as an Asian country. Labor sought to broaden and deepen Australia's diplomatic and economic ties to China, Japan, South Korea, the countries of Southeast Asia, and the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies have made Australia a major player in the Asia-Pacific economy. Japan is now Australia's largest trading partner (receiving 24.3 percent of total Australian exports in 1994-1995), followed by South Korea (7.9 percent), New Zealand (7.1 percent), and the United States (6.9 percent). Australia annually hosts 43,000 foreign students (mainly Asian) in its universities, earning more than $1 billion annually in service export income.
<p>
<b>THE LEGACY OF U.S. POLICY: NEGLECT AND ABUSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite Australia's growing importance in Asia, U.S. policy toward Australia is best described as benign neglect punctuated with occasional abuse -- even though Australia and the United States are long-standing allies with shared interests in commercial and military travel on oceans and seas, promoting access by American and Australian firms to domestic markets in Asia, and preventing the domination of Asia by a hostile power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, it is undeniable that the U.S. has pursued agriculture and trade policies that have soured its relations with this emerging power. This may not have been intentional; American leaders simply did not pay adequate attention to the effects their decisions had on Australia. But the consequence has been undeniable: a missed opportunity to advance mutual economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>U.S. Agriculture Policy: A Losing Proposition.</b> Over the past decade, the most serious dispute between Australia and the United States has been over agriculture policy. American and Australian farmers produce a wide range of agricultural commodities that compete with each other on world markets. Because of America's role as a large, if not dominant, producer and consumer of many farm commodities, U.S. agriculture policy profoundly affects world agricultural markets. Therefore, the level of agricultural protection and subsidies that Washington gives its farmers not only determines U.S. food production, consumption, and trade patterns, but also sets world prices for major agricultural commodities.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By contrast, Australian farmers receive world prices for most of their agricultural products.<sup>10</sup>  Thus, to the extent that U.S. agricultural subsidies distort world prices, Australian farmers are affected adversely by U.S. agricultural policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem was particularly serious in the 1980s when falling commodity and land prices caused agriculture subsidy costs to soar both in Australia and in the United States. Prime Minister Hawke and President Ronald Reagan chose radically different responses to this farm crisis. Hawke initiated a phaseout of Australia's agriculture price supports and subsidies. With the exception of its dairy industry subsidy (which will have been phased out completely in 2000), Australia now limits government agriculture assistance to inspection, quarantine efforts, pest control, education, and research.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By contrast, President Reagan created new export subsidies to improve the price competitiveness of American farm exports. Through the Food Security Act of 1985, the Reagan Administration established the Export Enhancement Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program to subsidize U.S. agricultural exports. President George Bush later expanded these programs through the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the years since 1990, the attitude of American farmers toward federal agriculture programs has changed. Convinced in part by the successful transition of Australian farmers to subsidy-free agriculture, many American farmers have realized that they would be better off producing for the market instead of relying on government subsidy programs. When Congress began considering the reauthorization of federal agriculture programs in 1995, a revolution in American farm policy was at hand. The result was passage of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996. In addition to granting wheat, feed grain, rice, and cotton farmers fixed but declining subsidies through seven-year transition contracts, the FAIR Act terminates production controls on wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton. While the Act made progress toward a free market in agriculture, however, the dairy and sugar programs were modified only slightly, and the export subsidy programs were left intact. Thus, many subsidies remain. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dairy Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains high domestic prices for dairy products through a complex and interlocking system of support prices, milk marketing orders, and tariff rate quotas. This system severely restricts access to the American market by foreign competitors such as Australia.<sup>11</sup>  The dairy program costs American consumers approximately $9 billion annually through high prices for milk, butter, and cheese, and American taxpayers will pay another $1.6 billion to maintain this program over the next five years.
<p>
<li><b>The Dairy Export Incentive Program.</b> The Dairy Export Incentive Program provides subsidies to exporters of dairy products.<sup>12</sup>  In addition to the fact that it will cost taxpayers approximately $120 million over the next five years without increasing the American dairy industry's international competitiveness, the Dairy Export Incentive Program depresses world dairy prices and reduces Australian dairy exports to third country markets.
<p>
<li><b>The Export Enhancement Program.</b> The Export Enhancement Program has paid out more than $6 billion since 1986, mainly to assist wheat exports. Intended to make American grain more competitive abroad, the Export Enhancement Program is counterproductive. U.S. export subsidies depress world grain prices (to the obvious objection of Australian farmers) while raising domestic U.S. grain prices, thereby discouraging American farmers from exporting.
<p>
<li><b>The Sugar Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains a high domestic price for sugar through a system of import tariff rate quotas.<sup>13</sup>  In 1993, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the sugar program hiked the domestic price of sugar to twice the world level and cost American consumers $1.4 billion a year. Higher U.S. prices caused sugar's share of the domestic sweetener market to fall from 79 percent in 1981 to 55 percent in 1994, forcing American sugar refiners to close processing facilities. Higher domestic prices also have driven American candy companies to move confectionery plants overseas to obtain cheaper sugar. At the same time, the sugar program has reduced world prices by an average of 4.8 cents per pound and caused Australia to export 89 percent less sugar to the U.S. since 1981. Thus, this program costs Australian exporters $274 million annually.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The Jones Act: A Burden on the American Economy.</b> Another burden on both the U.S. and Australian economies is the Jones Act. Contained in Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, this law restricts maritime commerce between points within the United States to ships that are American-built, American-operated, and American-owned. In September 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission found that the Jones Act adds from $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs borne by American business firms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Jones Act also is a major irritant in relations with Australia. Canberra complains that this law prevents the sale of competitively priced Australian-made high-speed vessels to U.S. firms. On a broader scale, the Jones Act is an impediment to reaching an agreement in the WTO on liberalizing trade in maritime services. It prevents the President from opening intracoastal shipping to foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels. Because the U.S. refuses to liberalize its maritime industry in areas in which foreigners are competitive, many other countries are unwilling to liberalize their maritime industries in areas, such as logistics and port management, in which Americans are competitive. As a result, WTO negotiations on liberalizing maritime services have stalled.

<P>
<b>THE IMPACT OF U.S. PROTECTIONISM ON RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Australia has opened its economy, protectionist voices in the U.S. are urging Americans to shield themselves from the global economy. President Clinton's trade policy has been a series of mixed signals which have caused anxiety and confusion in Canberra. On the one hand, Clinton supported both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 and the Uruguay Round Agreements in 1994. He also signed the FAIR Act in 1996 to dismantle some protectionist and trade-distorting U.S. agriculture programs. On the other hand, however, Clinton appears to have strayed from his support of free trade in a number of different areas. For example, the President has:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Blocked an agreement with Congress to reauthorize fast-track negotiating authority for trade agreements.</b> President Clinton let fast-track authority for negotiating new trade and investment liberalization agreements expire in 1994. Under fast-track authority, trade and investment agreements negotiated by the President are submitted to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote; Congress may not amend any portion of a proposed agreement before voting on it. For two years now, the Clinton Administration has insisted that any bill reauthorizing fast track must allow the President to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This position has caused fast track to stall in Congress. Republican leaders fear that environmental and labor rules in trade agreements could be misused to protect certain industries. Republicans in Congress therefore offered to pass a "clean" fast-track bill without the authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues, but the Administration rejected this approach. Without fast-track authority, no country will enter into serious trade and investment liberalization negotiations with the U.S.<sup>14</sup>  The result: Canberra fears that the failure to pass fast track will stall progress on trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
<li><b> Pushed for managed trade.</b> The Clinton Administration attempted to impose managed trade policies on Japan in the automotive parts and motor vehicles dispute of 1995 and with respect to semiconductors in 1996. This strategy alarmed Canberra. Although Tokyo and Washington ultimately reached agreements in 1995 and 1996, respectively, which avoided mandatory quotas, Clinton's approach to the conflict alienated Australia and other Asian countries. The result: American influence over the direction of trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region has been diminished.
<p>
<li><b> Shown ambivalence toward the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> Canberra is happy that President Clinton embraced Australia's APEC initiative and hosted the first APEC Leaders' Meeting near Seattle in 1993. It also is pleased that in 1994 the United States agreed to create a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific by the year 2020. President Clinton and the other APEC leaders adopted a process known as concerted unilateralism to achieve the goal of a free trade and investment area in this region. Under this process, instead of negotiating a formal trade agreement like NAFTA, each member proposes its own action plan for realizing the common goal of free trade prior to the 1996 APEC meetings; each action plan is then subject to peer review to help assure that all will work toward the ultimate goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, President Clinton's actions in the last two years have caused Canberra to question America's commitment to the APEC process. First, President Clinton skipped the 1995 APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, because of the budget stalemate with Congress. This decision disappointed Australia's Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, and raised questions among other leaders in the region. Second, the Clinton Administration has yet to offer a substantive U.S. action plan for APEC liberalization; its proposed plan is confined merely to a list of liberalization commitments previously made in the Uruguay Round Agreements. Canberra fears that the Clinton Administration's failure to offer anything new will discourage other APEC members from making substantive trade liberalization commitments.
<p>
<li><b> Failed to keep its commitment to liberalize trade in the WTO.</b> One of the Uruguay Round Agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), established a general framework for liberalizing trade in various services in 1994. It also established a timetable for reaching specific agreements covering the financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport sectors.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration backed away from its WTO commitments in 1995 and 1996. Claiming that India, Japan, Korea, and certain ASEAN countries had not made adequate offers to open their financial services markets, the Administration unexpectedly withdrew from the WTO negotiations to liberalize financial services markets on June 29, 1995, the day before the agreement was to be completed. When Australia and the European Union were unsuccessful in persuading the Clinton Administration to return to the bargaining table, they joined with other WTO members and signed a two-year interim financial services agreement excluding the United States. For the first time, a multilateral trade agreement was reached without U.S. consent. This demonstrates President Clinton's declining influence over the course of world trade liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While GATS established rules to be used in opening markets for certain telecommunications products such as electronic mail, voice mail, on-line information and data base retrieval, and electronic data interchange, Uruguay Round negotiators were unable to fashion rules covering such other basic products as long distance and international services. Therefore, the WTO continued the negotiations on trade liberalization in these basic services. Once again, claiming that offers from India and the ASEAN countries were inadequate, the Clinton Administration withdrew American support for a WTO telecommunications agreement on April 30, 1996, the day negotiations were scheduled to conclude. When Australia and the European Union failed to broker a compromise, the WTO extended its negotiating deadline to February 15, 1997.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Howard government interprets this failure to reach sector agreements as evidence of President Clinton's unwillingness to subordinate the special interests of certain American firms to the general benefits of trade liberalization. At the same time, Canberra feels that Clinton Administration policies are fueling deep division within the WTO by attempting to link trade with issues related to environmental and labor standards. Australia and other Asian countries see this as nothing but thinly veiled protectionism and a brake on global trade liberalization. Not only has the Clinton Administration once again alienated potential allies (as it did in APEC), but it may have forfeited America's leadership role in the upcoming December 9-12, 1996, WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore as well.
<p>
<b>BUILDING A STRONGER U.S.-AUSTRALIA RELATIONSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's growing economic and geopolitical importance in the Asia-Pacific region, President Clinton continues to ignore Canberra. His agriculture and trade policies have hurt Australia needlessly. Moreover, the Clinton Administration's opposition to renewing fast-track authority, its campaign for managed trade with Japan, and its vacillation regarding APEC and the WTO have raised doubts in the Howard government about America's commitment to free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies must be changed if the United States is to build a stronger relationship with Australia. Australia has changed greatly over the last decade. While maintaining its defense ties to the United States, it has developed closer diplomatic and economic ties to its neighbors in East and Southeast Asia and stands today as a leading advocate of free trade and investment. This new approach creates new avenues for cooperation between the U.S. and Australia. To facilitate this relationship and to enhance U.S. security and economic interests in Asia, there are several important steps that the Administration and Congress can take. Specifically, the President should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress to terminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs.</b> With passage of the FAIR Act, the U.S. began to wind down many economically irrational programs. However, the Dairy Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Export Enhancement Program, and Sugar Program survive largely intact. These programs raise U.S. consumer prices, cost American taxpayers billions of dollars annually, and decrease world prices for agricultural commodities. Eliminating them would remove a major impediment to improved U.S.-Australia relations and strengthen both economies.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> Repealing the Jones Act would help both the U.S. and Australia by allowing the use of competitively priced, Australian-made high-speed ships in U.S. waters. The result would be to lower logistics costs for American business firms and consumers.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> The U.S. needs fast-track authority to offer a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization at APEC, to harmonize NAFTA with other regional free trade agreements, and to commence a new round of WTO negotiations. The President should drop his insistence that authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues must be included in any fast-track legislation. Environmental and labor standards issues may have an international dimension, but they should be addressed in separate negotiations on their own merits.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within APEC.</b> At upcoming APEC meetings, Canberra will urge members to harmonize existing free trade agreements such as NAFTA, the CER, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The President should support this Australian initiative. Harmonizing NAFTA, CER, and AFTA is a practical step toward trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific.
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's concerted unilateralism process.</b> There are too many differences among APEC members at present for negotiations on an APEC free trade and investment agreement to succeed. Before work can begin on a region-wide free trade zone, the APEC process must be strengthened. The strategy of concerted unilateralism allows members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if APEC members gain confidence in each other over the next few years can a more formal negotiating process be expected to succeed.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.</b> At the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, the President should support Canberra's proposal to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round. Washington must work with Canberra to reach agreements on liberalized trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport services by 1997. They also should work together to prepare for the new negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization that are scheduled to begin in 1999.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b> The President should exercise bold leadership and press other WTO members at Singapore to convene a new round of global trade liberalization talks by 1998. The new WTO round should subsume APEC's goal of free trade and investment by 2020 as its own. This policy could encourage APEC to accelerate the liberalization of trade and investment in Asia. It would not be the first time that trade liberalization in one set of negotiations spurred liberalization in another. In the early 1990s, for example, the creation of APEC helped bring the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion.
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia.</b> The agreement to stage military exercises in Australia will provide U.S. forces with a better location than Japan and Okinawa for training. Relocating training exercises from these highly populated areas also may reduce public opposition to critical U.S. defense bases there. A renewed lease on the Pine Gap intelligence facility will benefit U.S. strategic goals in Asia and the Middle East. In return, the U.S. should offer to sell Canberra <i>Tomahawk</i> long-range cruise missiles for Australia's new <i>Collins</i>-class submarines. The U.S. also should include Australia in the development of any future Asian missile defense network.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like Rip Van Winkle, who slept through the American Revolution, an Australian who dozed off 20 years ago and suddenly woke up today would find a very different country. For many years, Australia resisted developing an Asian Pacific identity. That resistance has given way to acceptance of Australia's destiny as a country embracing Asia and immersing itself in the Asian market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Australia's transformation benefits the United States in ways that should not be overlooked by U.S. policymakers. By opening its economy, Australia has expanded the market for American exports and investments. It also is a well-positioned ally that can help the United States promote trade and investment liberalization throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. has an unprecedented opportunity to help itself by working more closely with Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. Washington should take the fullest possible advantage of this opportunity by making every effort to remove irritants in its bilateral relations with Canberra. Chief among these irritants are counterproductive agriculture programs and the Jones Act, which hurt not only Australia farmers and shipbuilders, but also American consumers. The U.S. and Australia also should cooperate closely to ensure the success of the upcoming APEC and WTO meetings. Finally, the U.S. should continue and strengthen its military ties to Australia to help maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific. In these ways, the U.S. can expand markets for American goods and services while reversing the dangerous perception of declining American influence in Asia.

<li>    The "Banana republic" comment was made during a radio interview with John Laws on May 14, 1986.<p>
<li>    Prior to 1996, U.S. agricultural programs were like a dike separating two bodies of water. One body is domestic prices; the other, world prices. When the U.S. increases agricultural subsidies and import barriers to maintain domestic prices at a higher level than world prices, foreign production that would have been sold in the U.S. is sold in other markets, and the larger supplies in other markets drive down world prices. But when the U.S. lowers agricultural subsidies and import barriers, American food imports increase. Thus, removing the dike simultaneously lowers domestic agricultural prices and raises world prices until they become identical.<p>
<li>    Dairy products are an exception.<p>
<li>    To maintain domestic prices of butter, cheese, and powdered milk, the federal government purchases any surplus of these products from processors at a fixed price ($10.35 per hundredweight in 1996). The federal government and the state of California use milk marketing orders that restrict the sale of fluid milk between different regions to maintain domestic milk prices. To limit foreign competition, the U.S. employs a tariff rate quota system that establishes country-by-country quotas for dairy imports. Under this system (as distinguished from a pure quota system), exporting countries may exceed their dairy import quotas, but the U.S. levies a prohibitively high tariff on dairy imports exceeding the quota.<p>
<li>    American exporters receive cash or surplus dairy products from the federal government as a bonus for exporting dairy products to targeted markets. This moves dairy products from the domestic market to targeted foreign markets such as Algeria, Brazil, Jamaica, India, Iraq, and Mexico, simultaneously raising domestic dairy prices while reducing dairy prices in targeted foreign markets.<p>
<li>    A tariff rate quota system differs from a pure quota system. It permits imports above the quota but also levies a prohibitively high tariff rate on them. Thus, imports effectively are limited to the quota amount in most circumstances. <p>
<li>    If Congress were allowed to amend trade agreements, Congress would likely accept the concessions that foreign governments made to reach a deal while voting to reject U.S. concessions. Such an outcome obviously is unacceptable to any foreign government. To encourage foreign governments to negotiate trade agreements with the United States, Congress devised the fast-track procedure to force itself to accept or reject trade agreements as a whole.<p>
<li>    The most important dispute concerns how to prevent telecommunications firms with monopolies in their home market for international services from undercutting other suppliers in competitive markets for international services. As a compromise, Australia proposed a safeguard that would allow a country to revoke a foreign firm's license to provide international services if that firm distorts the market with such cross-subsidies.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the Mexican peso on December 20, 1994, but the United States has not. The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization policies, and efforts to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). However, the U.S. appears to have turned its back on Latin America. As free trade has faded from the foreign policy agendas of both the Clinton Administration and the 104th Congress, U.S. relations with Latin America have deteriorated significantly. On issues such as Cuba, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and even the creation of the FTAA, America today is increasingly at odds with important hemispheric trading partners such as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia.

America's flight from enlarging the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has damaged U.S. leadership and economic interests in the Western Hemisphere, but hemispheric trade expansion has not been interrupted. Mexico has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile, Bolivia, and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur),<sup>1</sup> and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral FTA with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include the five members of the Andean Community.<sup>2</sup>  Mercosur also wants to sign an FTA with the European Union. Clearly, no one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free trade express in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations established the closest and strongest relationship with Latin America that the U.S. has enjoyed in more than a century. The bases of this new hemispheric partnership were democracy and the creation of a hemispheric free trade area, as provided for in the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) and the NAFTA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But since 1993, the Clinton Administration has dissipated the achievements of more than a decade by pursuing a policy of neglect and indifference toward Latin America. Since the collapse of the Mexican peso at the end of 1994, NAFTA has become a political football for politicians who claim that free trade is the cause of such domestic problems as increased drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Instead of responding by making a strong case for NAFTA, however, some previously strong supporters of free trade have scaled back their support for its enlargement, and for the FTAA process in general. America's retreat from NAFTA's expansion is hurting American consumers and workers, undermining U.S. economic interests in Latin America, and weakening U.S. leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If this situation is not reversed, U.S. interests in Latin America could suffer lasting damage. To regain America's leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America, the U.S. Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b> Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial, to be held during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte, will be marginal at best.
<p>
<li><b> Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b> The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<p>
<li><b>Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>3</sup> H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, would improve market access for U.S. exports to Caribbean and Central American markets. It also would require CBI beneficiaries to strengthen rules relating to investment, labor standards, and the environment, among other improvements that strongly favor U.S. interests.
<p>
<li><b>Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b> The goal of such talks should be to deepen and harmonize trade disciplines between NAFTA and Mercosur as both groups take on new members; the ultimate objective should be to merge these two regional groups into a single hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b> Western Hemisphere nations should define quickly whether the FTAA will include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the World Trade Organization (WTO). America should insist on FTAA trade disciplines that improve on NAFTA and the WTO.
<p>
<li><b>Implement reforms that do not require negotiations,</b> including unilateral cuts in tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, simplification and harmonization of existing rules and regulations affecting the flow of goods and services in the region, removal of barriers to trade in services, enactment of world-class protection for intellectual property rights, and revision of investment regulations.
<p>
<li><b>Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade,</b> such as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, labor standards, and preserving the environment. The action plan approved at the Summit of the Americas on December 11, 1994, outlines such a framework; in practice, however, the Clinton Administration has sought consistently to establish conditions and linkages between free trade and other issues. As a result, tensions between the U.S. and Latin America have increased in the past two years, and U.S. leadership and credibility have suffered.
<p>
<li><b>Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b> The negotiation of bilateral free trade agreements with these countries could create momentum for the convergence of the FTAA and APEC processes into a single free trade area encompassing more than 2 billion consumers.
<p>
<li><b>Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b> Strong leadership is required to prevent regionalism from derailing the FTAA process. The goals of a second Summit of the Americas should include creation of a WTO-type entity to advance negotiations, expansion of FTAA technical working groups to propose policies and specific actions, and a commitment by all democracies in the Western Hemisphere to a specific timetable and pathway for launching the FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b> U.S. protectionism is the greatest impediment to free trade and creation of an FTAA. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers over $70 billion a year and encourage U.S. trading partners to retaliate with measures that hinder free trade and penalize American consumers and exporters.<sup>4</sup>
</ul><P>

<b>TRADE POLICY BLUNDERS IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The greatest failure of U.S. Latin American policy in recent years has been in the area of trade policy. The U.S. no longer leads the Western Hemisphere FTAA process, primarily because the Clinton Administration has chosen to retreat from free trade and NAFTA's enlargement rather than defend the trade pact's record of success. As a result, the FTAA process has lost momentum and the U.S. has surrendered leadership and negotiating advantage to Brazil, which has tilted the FTAA process toward the enlargement of Mercosur into a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil and capable of challenging U.S. economic interests and leadership in the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This retreat from free trade is severely damaging to U.S. relations with Latin America, not to mention economic and security interests in the Western Hemisphere. Without the goodwill and greater economic interaction that come with increased trade and investment, it will be more difficult for the U.S. and Latin America to develop and implement effective policies for managing such hemispheric problems as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, and environmental destruction. Moreover, Washington's reluctance to expand NAFTA means that American companies and workers risk missing out on the fast-paced trade expansion occurring today throughout Latin America. Opportunities missed by U.S. companies will be seized by investors from other countries. Exports, jobs, and wealth creation possibilities lost in Latin America by U.S. firms will accrue to others.
<p>

<b>NAFTA: TWO YEARS OF SOLID GROWTH</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994 -- only nine days after the Summit of the Americas concluded in Miami -- critics of NAFTA have been claiming that the trade pact is a failure. Many critics also blame NAFTA for the growing problems of drugs, illegal immigration, and declining real wages in U.S. manufacturing. But NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis and is not responsible for America's social problems. Moreover, far from being a failure, NAFTA has scored some impressive trade and investment successes during its first two years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA helped Mexico overcome the peso crisis. The international obligations created by NAFTA and by Mexico's membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) enabled the embattled government of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to rebuff intense political pressure to roll back Mexico's economic reforms after the peso collapsed. As a result, the Mexican economy now is recovering from the crisis, although years will pass before per capita income returns to pre-peso crisis levels.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During NAFTA's first two years, trade and foreign direct investment among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have increased. Since 1994, the average U.S. tariff on Mexican products has fallen from 3.5 percent to 1.5 percent, while average Mexican tariffs on U.S. products have dropped from 10 percent to 4.9 percent. As a result, trade among the three NAFTA countries rose by 17 percent in 1994 to $350 billion, and bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade grew by 20.7 percent, surpassing $100 billion for the first time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, despite the recession caused by the peso's collapse, overall U.S.-Mexico trade increased 8 percent to $108 billion, while total intra-NAFTA trade grew 10.6 percent to $380 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Moreover, after declining by 8.9 percent in 1995 to $46.3 billion, U.S. exports to Mexico increased by 12.1 percent during the first three months of 1996, compared with the same period in 1995.<sup>6</sup>  More than 75 percent of all U.S. states reported a rise in exports to Mexico during the first quarter of 1996.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico during 1995 totaled $33.49 billion, compared with a 1994 trade deficit of $14.69 billion with Canada and a trade surplus of $1.34 billion with Mexico. Critics have used these figures to defend their claim that NAFTA is costing jobs in America. The reason Mexico imported fewer U.S. goods in 1995, however, is simply that the peso's collapse reduced the buying power of the Mexican people by more than 50 percent, and poorer people buy fewer goods. Americans consumed more Mexican products in 1995 because the average American is much wealthier than the average Mexican. The truth is that more jobs in America today rely on imports than exports, since nearly 90 percent of American manufacturers utilize imported materials or components in their production.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the $80 billion jump in three-way trade during the first two years of NAFTA's implementation added over 1.6 million new jobs to the North American economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA is restructuring the North American economy as firms in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada create cross-border enterprises that lower manufacturing costs, improve productivity, and expand the volume and diversity of products at lower prices for consumers in all three countries. A recent study by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) found that half of Mexico's total exports to the U.S. are manufactured by U.S.-owned firms, or by production-sharing partnerships<sup>9</sup> whose products have an average U.S. content of 50.2 percent, compared with 35.3 percent for Canada, 32 percent for Taiwan, and 27.8 percent for Korea. As the output of Mexico-based co-production ventures increases, the volume and value of U.S.-made inputs imported by Mexican firms also increase, creating more jobs in America. Moreover, the rise in U.S.-Mexico co-production ventures is diverting investment away from alternative co-production sites in Asia. In 1994, Mexico was America's largest production-sharing partner, accounting for $22.9 billion, or 39.1 percent of all U.S. co-produced imports.<sup>10</sup>  U.S.-Mexico production partnerships increasingly play a prominent role in such key industries as motor vehicles, auto parts, computers, televisions and other electrical products, and textiles and apparel, among others.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>NAFTA Aiding Mexico's Recovery.</b> Only 18 months after the peso's collapse, the Mexican economy is showing signs of a promising, if uneven, recovery. Following five consecutive quarters of decline, the Mexican economy grew sharply during the second quarter of 1996 as real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 7.2 percent compared with the second quarter of 1995. For all of 1996, Mexico is expected to grow about 3 percent, compared to a contraction of 6.9 percent in 1995.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, despite a 22 percent rise in the peso against key currencies during the first seven months of 1996, Mexican exports of manufactured goods have gained 22.8 percent, while imports have increased 22.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>  Nevertheless, about 70 percent of all economic activity in Mexico is tied to the domestic economy, which may not feel the overall, export-driven economic upturn for at least another year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Political and social instability have increased in Mexico as a result of the economic crisis, the spread of drug trafficking, a weak judiciary incapable of fighting corruption, and entrenched political and economic dinosaurs that continue to block democratic reform and true economic freedom. However, NAFTA is not responsible for Mexico's current social and political difficulties. In fact, NAFTA has provided Mexico with a strong anchor and a stable point of institutional reference on the road to true capitalist democracy. Meanwhile, there is reason to be optimistic about Mexico's political future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Impressive Growth in U.S.-Canada Trade.</b> Canadian exports to the U.S. and Mexico have risen impressively since NAFTA was implemented. Foreign investment in Canada from all sources also has increased significantly. In 1995, two-way trade between the U.S. and Canada grew nearly 12 percent to $272 billion, while total foreign direct investment in Canada increased by 10 percent to $168 billion. The U.S. is the largest foreign investor in Canada. Direct investment in Canada by American firms increased by 11 percent to $113 billion in 1995, representing 67 percent of total foreign direct investment in Canada. Similarly, the U.S. remains the destination for the largest share of Canadian foreign direct investment, with a total of $76.5 billion invested.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada's exports in 1994 represented 30.1 percent of its total GDP, compared to 21.6 percent in 1991. Canada's strong export performance during the 1990s was closely related to the growth in Canadian exports to the U.S., and Canadian production of goods for international markets is closely linked to the U.S. through the intra-firm trading of U.S.-controlled firms operating in Canada.<sup>14</sup>  Transactions between related firms account for 57 percent of Canadian exports to the U.S., and 72 percent of exports by U.S.-con-trolled Canadian firms are related-party transactions. According to one survey, "U.S.-controlled [multinational companies] are responsible for the largest share of sales by the Canadian manufacturing and wholesale firms studied, and account for the largest share of their imports and exports."  Overall, the Canadian economy is "linked intra-regionally to the U.S. economy."<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>A Hemispheric Free Trade Emporium.</b> When Mexico defaulted on its external debt obligations in 1982, it triggered the Latin American debt crisis and plunged the region into a decade of negative growth and falling per capita income. However, when the Mexican peso collapsed in December 1994, Latin America was hardly affected. Economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean slowed to 0.8 percent in 1995 as the effects of the Mexican peso crisis rippled through the region's financial markets. However, U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean rose to $102 billion in 1995, up 12 percent from 1994 and 72 percent higher than total U.S. exports to the region in 1990. Although individual countries such as Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico are struggling to resolve diverse economic, political, and social difficulties, the region overall has shrugged off the aftershocks of the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank predicts that Latin America and the Caribbean will grow by 3.1 percent in 1996 and 4 percent in 1997, with Chile leading the region at 6.5 percent this year while Venezuela lags at 0.5 percent.<sup>16</sup>  The bank also predicts that average GDP growth should rise to 3.8 percent in 1996-2005, compared to average growth of 2.4 percent during the past decade.<sup>17</sup>  Free trade and foreign direct investment are driving the region's growth. Latin America's exports and imports increased rapidly as tariff barriers dropped from 50 percent a decade ago to 12 percent in 1993, one year before NAFTA went into effect. For years, U.S. exports to Latin America have increased twice as rapidly as exports to any other region of the world. Intra-regional trade between Latin American countries and trade with Asia also are growing rapidly. For example, intra-Mercosur trade doubled in four years to $15.8 billion and today accounts for 22 percent of the group's total world trade, up from 14.3 percent in 1992.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some World Bank economists believe that Latin America can achieve annual growth rates of 6 to 6.5 percent within a decade if governments in the region raise exports significantly by avoiding overvalued exchange rates; increasing investments for infrastructure such as roads, ports, and telecommunications; and attracting larger amounts of foreign direct investment.<sup>18</sup> However, while democracy, hemispheric economic integration, and trade expansion are progressing rapidly, Latin American and Caribbean countries are still struggling to resolve a host of structural impediments to faster growth and greater stability and economic prosperity. Economic reforms have not advanced sufficiently anywhere in the region, including Chile, which is routinely hailed as Latin America's star performer. The widespread absence of economic freedom is reflected in the region's high levels of poverty, illiteracy, and illegal immigration. Judicial systems are generally weak, politicized, and corrupt. Effective legal protection for individual property rights does not exist. Moreover, drug traffickers have emerged in the 1990s as major threats to the stability of countries such as Colombia and Mexico. Organized violence by subversive guerrilla organizations is increasing in Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The difficulties confronting Latin America and the Caribbean today defy easy or quick solutions. They represent both a daunting challenge to the region's expectations for a brighter economic future and a threat to U.S. economic and national security interests. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, NAFTA, and Free Trade Area of the Americas were proposed by the U.S. as the foundations of a hemispheric partnership and a new American Century based on democracy, free trade, and the economic integration of the U.S. and Latin America. This vision has not been realized. Nine days after the FTAA was launched at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, the Mexican peso collapsed and the U.S. retreated from NAFTA's enlargement.
<p>
<b>TEN INITIATIVES FOR RESTORING U.S. LEADERSHIP TO THE FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure to enlarge NAFTA to involve Chile and the Caribbean countries during 1995 was a major setback for U.S. economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. The momentum and direction of the FTAA process have changed significantly since the Mexican peso crisis. Brazil has filled the vacuum in the FTAA process created by America's retreat from free trade, and has won regional support for an alternative trade agenda that sidelines a NAFTA/WTO-plus process to create the FTAA in favor of a more limited regional approach based on the expansion of Mercosur to create a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil. Brazil also favors negotiating a trade pact with the European Union before engaging the U.S. in talks to establish a framework for the future merger of Mercosur and NAFTA into an FTAA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Mercosur has its share of internal problems that could slow its expansion, the process is well underway. Chile has become an associate of Mercosur, and Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador expect to join before the end of 1996. Mexico is negotiating an agreement with Mercosur while simultaneously blocking U.S. and Canadian efforts to launch early talks between NAFTA and Mercosur. The proposed enlargement of Mercosur and creation of a SAFTA appeals to many Latin American politicians, intellectuals, and business leaders who support higher levels of protectionism and the notion of a united Latin American front capable of maintaining its economic and political independence from U.S. pressure and interference. Latin American integration is one of the oldest dreams in the region, and it is closer to being achieved today than ever before. Meanwhile, as the free trade express in Latin America picks up speed, the U.S. lags behind even the caboose.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new U.S. partnership with Latin America celebrated by President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas has developed serious cracks. For example, entities such as the Rio Group and the Organization of American States (OAS) have condemned the U.S. for enacting the Helms-Burton Act against Cuba and for decertifying Colombia in the war on drugs. U.S. policy against Cuba also has raised tensions significantly with NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Mexico has attacked recent changes in U.S. immigration policy. A pattern of mutual recrimination has emerged. The U.S. criticizes Latin America's coddling of Fidel Castro's regime and punishes countries like Colombia and Mexico for not doing enough to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Latin American governments criticize what they perceive as the return of U.S. "big stick" unilateralism and feel betrayed by Washington's bipartisan stampede away from NAFTA's expansion and the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Leading by Example.</b> If the U.S. expects Latin America and the Caribbean to cooperate on policy issues viewed as important to U.S. economic and security interests, it must assert its leadership and set the example. Abandoning trade commitments like adding Chile to NAFTA is the antithesis of leadership, and it sets a bad example. Instead of building a bridge to the 21st century that would unite the U.S. and the democracies of the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. retreat from NAFTA's expansion and the U.S. government's managed trade policies have dug a moat between Washington and the rest of the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To restore American leadership to the FTAA process and repair the recent damage to U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S. Administration should carry out the following ten initiatives:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track in hand, the Administration cannot enter into serious trade negotiations with Chile or any other country. Chile has claimed that it will not negotiate its entry into NAFTA until fast-track is renewed. Suggestions that fast-track is not necessary to enter into trade negotiations are mistaken. No country will invest the time or the human and financial resources in negotiating with the U.S. if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte will be marginal at best; moreover, U.S. proposals are more likely to be rejected. Symbolically, making renewal of fast-track one of the first actions of a new Administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the U.S. has re-engaged in the FTAA process. The dynamics of the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial could be altered completely if the U.S. delegation arrives with fast-track negotiating authority. Without fast-track, however, the U.S. risks being left behind again as Brazil's vision of turning Mercosur into a SAFTA stokes the enthusiasm of other Latin American governments.
<p>
<b>2. Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the greatest mistakes made recently by the U.S. in Latin America was postponing the inclusion of Chile in NAFTA until after the 1996 elections. The failure to add Chile to NAFTA weakened American leadership and influence in the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no reason to delay the admission of Chile to NAFTA. Chile's total gross national product is equivalent to about 1 percent of the American economy. Chile has enjoyed positive economic growth for 14 consecutive years. Growth during the past six years under a democratic civilian government has averaged 7.5 percent annually. Chile has pre-paid a large chunk of its external public sector debt, has no balance-of-payments problems, and has enjoyed single-digit inflation since 1994. Its investment and savings rates are approaching those of the Asian Tigers. The inclusion of Chile in NAFTA would confirm America's commitment to leading the FTAA process, open a new gateway for U.S. exports to markets in South America and APEC, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage for future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<P>
<b>3. Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, is intended to correct an imbalance created by NAFTA that directly affects the interests of U.S. producers, importers, retailers, and consumers. The bill was developed to assure "parity" for producers in CBI countries with the market access provided to Mexican producers under the NAFTA. Such parity is badly needed. The Bush and Clinton Administrations mistakenly assumed that NAFTA would not divert trade and investment from the CBI countries. Since the implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, U.S. imports of certain products (such as apparel) produced in the CBI countries by American firms have been affected adversely. The trade advantages created by NAFTA have enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the U.S. As a result, the rate of growth for apparel imports from CBI countries into the U.S. fell from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996, while apparel imports from Mexico during the same five-month period grew by 41 percent.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>4. Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dynamics of the FTAA process have changed. The U.S. has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing. Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade disciplines as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1995, the Clinton Administration has been trying without success to establish a formal dialogue between NAFTA and Mercosur. The problem is a series of disagreements among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.<sup>21</sup>  Mexico opposes a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue, arguing that it is not needed to achieve an FTAA by 2005 and that NAFTA should focus instead on granting real negotiating powers to the 11 technical work groups involved in the FTAA process.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada supports the U.S. proposal for a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue but is reluctant to proceed without Mexico. The Canadians also oppose creating an FTAA as a pathway to NAFTA-Mercosur convergence by 2005. Instead, the Canadians favor replacing NAFTA and Mercosur with a new agreement negotiated simultaneously by all 34 democracies in the Western Hemisphere. Further complicating matters, enactment of the Helms-Burton Act has divided NAFTA, as Mexico and Canada are bitterly opposed to its implementation. As a result, the U.S. and Brazil announced in late August that an overdue report on the status of their ongoing bilateral trade review would be delayed. Several rounds of technical talks failed to achieve any breakthroughs on bilateral issues, such as improving the implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in both countries. In addition, the July 1996 deadline for holding the first formal meeting between NAFTA and Mercosur was missed.
<P>
<b>5. Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. should urge Western Hemispheric nations to decide quickly whether the FTAA should include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the WTO or should be abandoned in favor of merely removing tariffs on goods traded within the region.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defining the timetable and pathway for the FTAA would advance the regional trade process in three ways: 1) It would focus the efforts of the 11 FTAA working groups set up to prepare for future negotiations; 2) it would help establish priorities for the FTAA agenda; and 3) it would help set a better stage for the difficult negotiations of the details of an FTAA agreement. The U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Costa Rica at various times have supported an FTAA based on WTO-plus disciplines in which, by 2005 when the FTAA is scheduled to go into effect, all of the commitments and trading disciplines established under the WTO would be implemented. However, Brazil has forcefully opposed proposals for an FTAA that goes beyond the WTO.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fast-track negotiating authority in hand before the third post-Summit of the Americas trade ministerial next year in Brazil would improve the prospects for faster trade liberalization based on NAFTA/WTO-plus trading disciplines. Without fast-track, U.S. hopes of accelerating and enriching the FTAA process may be stillborn at the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial in 1997.
<p>
<b>6. Implement reforms that do not require formal negotiations.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many unilateral actions that governments in the Western Hemisphere could take without engaging in formal state-to-state negotiations. Moreover, these reforms could yield swift benefits for both the U.S. and Latin America, since they would improve market access by injecting more transparency into the government rulemaking process and by dismantling tariff and non-tariff barriers to the faster and more efficient movement of goods, services, and capital throughout the region. For example, governments could simplify and harmonize rules and regulations relating to customs practices, sanitary standards, and technical barriers to trade. They also could pledge to avoid imposing new tariff and non-tariff barriers or raising existing barriers to the flow of goods, services, and investment within the region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A third area in which governments should move quickly is revision of national investment laws to guarantee the right of establishment and national treatment of foreign investors, no restrictions on repatriation of profits and capital and access to convertible currency for all such transactions, protection against expropriation and compensation at fair market value in the event expropriation occurs, and phaseout of all performance requirements. Yet another area in which swift reforms are possible is the enactment of laws and policies that provide world-class protection for patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Moreover, barriers to trade in services should be removed quickly, particularly in the areas of finance, telecommunications, and transportation. In addition, governments in Latin America should eliminate requirements and preferences in their purchase of goods and services, reduce market-distorting subsidies, and strengthen national competition laws.<sup>24</sup>  These reforms would accelerate the momentum of the FTAA process and yield tangible benefits in the form of faster trade growth and increased foreign direct investment flows in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<b>7. Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both the expansion of NAFTA and U.S. leadership in the FTAA process have been undermined by the Clinton Administration's insistence on linking trade agreements to issues unrelated to free trade, such as labor standards and the environment. The Administration has threatened to impose trade sanctions against Colombia because President Ernesto Samper financed his 1994 election campaign in part with $6 million contributed by the Cali drug cartel. It also has delayed the implementation of a NAFTA obligation to allow Mexican trucks to circulate freely in the American Southwest, alleging concern about drug trafficking and U.S. national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, while hemispheric negotiations may be required to find common solutions to problems such as drug trafficking, illegal immigration, the environment, and labor standards, such pressure tactics work against U.S. interests in the region. Trade sanctions generally are not effective. Moreover, Latin American governments are unwilling to accommodate the Clinton Administration's demands for labor and environmental linkages to trade agreements; as a result, they will likely seek alternatives to NAFTA, such as Mercosur, SAFTA, the European Union, and Asian countries like Japan and Korea.
<p>
<b>8. Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many free traders believe that the pathways followed in creating the FTAA do not matter as long as a hemispheric free trade area is up and running by 2005. However, the recent breakup of the FTAA process into smaller regional trade agreements such as NAFTA and Mercosur is not a positive development. Smaller regional trade agreements may encourage increased trade and investment among the respective members of each group, but higher external tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with countries that are not members of these groups hinder the efficient global movement of goods, services, and capital. The U.S. should refocus on multilateral trade liberalization and use regional free trade areas such as NAFTA to spur even larger trade zones. Negotiating bilateral NAFTA/WTO-plus trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore could energize the FTAA process, spur faster progress in APEC, and create momentum for merging the FTAA and APEC into a single free trade area.
<p>
<b>9. Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A second Summit of the Americas should be convened in Chile in December 1997 to put the FTAA process back on a fast track to completion by 2005. However, before the second summit is held, the U.S. should renew fast-track, Chile should be included in NAFTA, and the CBI countries should be granted trading parity with NAFTA members. At this summit, the leaders of the hemisphere's democracies should agree on three things: 1) a specific pathway and timetable for achieving an FTAA; 2) creation of an institutional entity similar to the WTO to coordinate the FTAA negotiations; and 3) empowering the 11 technical working groups to negotiate firm FTAA proposals related to their respective areas of responsibility. In addition, APEC countries should be invited to participate as observers.
<p>
<b>10. Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The greatest impediments to free trade and creation of the FTAA are found in Washington. For decades, the federal government has operated a vast and complex protectionist machine that has cost American taxpayers and consumers hundreds of billions of dollars. This protectionism comes in many forms, including traditional tariffs, quotas, "voluntary" restraint agreements, orderly marketing agreements, antidumping duties, countervailing duties, tax regulations, technology controls, anti-trust laws, and many other anti-trade weapons used against foreign exporters seeking greater access to the U.S. market as well as American firms and investors trying to compete globally.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of protecting American consumers, preserving jobs, strengthening American manufacturing, encouraging new technology development, and improving American competitiveness in the global economy, this protectionism weakens U.S. companies in the international marketplace, promotes investment in noncompetitive sectors, enshrines low-skilled workers, and hinders productivity growth. American consumers pay a high price for these misguided policies. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank has estimated that import-protection schemes amount to the equivalent of a 23 percent income tax surcharge for low-income American families, or 10 percent for the average family. The Federal Trade Commission has determined that it costs the U.S. economy nearly $90 for each dollar saved by protected American firms. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers at least $70 billion a year and encourage America's trading partners to retaliate in kind, especially in the areas of anti-dumping and countervailing duty legislation.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has preached the gospel of free trade in international forums such as the WTO, APEC, and the FTAA. In practice, however, the Administration's "strategic trade policies" have laid the foundations for even greater U.S. government protectionism and interference in the economy. For example, the Administration's National Export Strategy<sup>26</sup> and Big Emerging Markets (BEMs) Initiative<sup>27</sup> outline the twin pillars of an industrial policy and an expanded federal government role in the international marketplace. The basic premise of these strategies is that "U.S. firms will need the U.S. government at their side to win a fair hearing" in the global marketplace.<sup>28</sup>  According to President Clinton, the BEMs Initiative "streamlines Administration resources to focus on the markets in which government involvement can truly make a difference for America's businesses and workers."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where trade policy is concerned, the Clinton Administration is making big government even bigger. The Administration has targeted domestic "clusters" of high-technology industries for export to key foreign markets where the U.S. government can help American firms secure market access, obtain financing, and win contracts for major projects in which foreign governments help competing bidders or play an important decisionmaking role in awarding projects.<sup>30</sup>  In addition, the Administration has established new divisions at the International Trade Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to monitor and enforce foreign compliance with U.S. trade laws and agreements.<sup>31</sup>  The Administration also wants other trading nations to adopt a core set of labor principles as part of any future trade liberalization, and continues to insist that any new fast-track negotiating authority must contain strong negotiation provisions on both labor and the environment even though Latin American governments have strenuously opposed such linkages.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. has lost its once-respected leadership role in Latin America. The Clinton Administration turned its back on Latin America when the Mexican peso tumbled in December 1994. The expansion of NAFTA has stalled, and the U.S. no longer leads the FTAA process. Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton Administration and many in Congress are reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on a fast track. Instead, they are behaving as though the American economy ends at the Atlantic and Pacific continental shelves, with nothing beyond the continent but an economic void that threatens America.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations forged the closest friendship with Latin America that the U.S. has ever enjoyed. However, it took the Clinton Administration less than three years to dissolve that exciting new relationship in acrimonious recriminations and unkept American promises. If the Administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline.

<h3>TRADE WITH ASIA MEANS JOBS FOR AMERICA</h3>

<font size="-1"><a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/fyi119t1.gif">Table 1</a>: U.S. Exports to Asia and Jobs Supported by Those Exports: State-by-State Analysis</font>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

U.S.-Asia trade grew dramatically in 1995: The 25.8 percent rise in exports to East and South Asia outpaced the growth in exports to all other regions of the world. At almost $193 billion, U.S. exports to the Pacific Rim and South Asia exceeded U.S. exports to Europe by more than $50 billion and accounted for more than 3.8 million American jobs in 1995. Overall, exports to this dynamic region have created in excess of a million American jobs since 1993 alone.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Individual U.S. states that saw dramatic increases in their exports to Asia in 1995 include South Dakota (81.4 percent more than in 1994), Vermont (49.7 percent more), Georgia (46.5 percent more), Delaware (45.3 percent more), Indiana (45.2 percent more), Louisiana (44.3 percent more), and Texas (40.3 percent more). Also noteworthy was California, the first state to top the one million mark in numbers of workers employed as a result of exports to East and South Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Asian demand for American products was particularly high in sectors like transportation equipment, agriculture products, and intellectual property (such as computer software). The good news for American exporters is that these are growth industries. As Michael Walton, chief World Bank economist for East Asia and the Pacific, puts it, "The U.S. and Asia are complementary. The U.S., in terms of its farm sector, technological capability and service sector strength, will experience a rising beneficial integration with East Asia that will be a source of growth for both sides. Asia is growing 8%, but the market there for the kinds of goods and services the U.S. provides is growing in the teens."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In more good news for the United States, it is predicted that the economies of Asia will continue to grow at high rates for the foreseeable future. As these countries become more prosperous, their demand for American products will increase commensurately. Thus, the U.S. should focus on the tremendous promise offered by the Asia-Pacific region. As the following <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/fyi119t1.gif">table</a> clearly demonstrates, Americans from all 50 states stand to benefit greatly from closer trade relations with the vital and dynamic Asia-Pacific region.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
On May 20, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to extend unconditionally China's most-favored-nation trade status for another year. At the end of this month, Congress will vote on a resolution to revoke MFN trade status for the People's Republic of China. Legislation also may be proposed to make MFN status contingent on improvements in China's human rights conditions or its implementation of international commercial and security agreements.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As Congress considers extending or revoking MFN status for China, it is important to focus on what MFN is and is not. A fundamental principle of the Bretton Woods trading system created at the end of World War II,<sup>1</sup> MFN was intended to protect the U.S. from protectionism. It is not a special privilege for any country, including China. Rather, it is the norm for trade between countries. Thus, revoking MFN for any country is the equivalent of imposing enormous punitive sanctions. But trade sanctions are not an effective tool for achieving such non-trade objectives as ending human rights abuses.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration's decision to extend MFN treatment is the right decision, but it should be only one element of a comprehensive strategy for dealing with China. This strategy should consist of a series of policies that directly protect or promote long-run U.S. interests in Asia, such as free access to markets or peace and stability. As important as having the right strategy is creating a constructive environment within which policies can operate. This environment has not been created by the Clinton Administration. The zig-zags in its China policy have undermined the credibility of its strategy and raised serious questions in the minds of friend and foe alike as to America's future role in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To protect its interests in peace and stability, freedom of the seas, and access to markets in Asia, the U.S. must create an environment that encourages China to integrate into the international system as a responsible member. Given its size and rate of growth, China is certain to have an enormous impact on the international system and American interests in Asia. For China to become a full participant in the international system and uphold international rules and norms, Chinese leaders must see that doing so will best serve China's interests. This can be accomplished only if Americans interact with, rather than isolate, China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 


To advance American interests in Asia, the President and Congress should:<ul>
<p><li>Renew China's MFN status. This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress.

<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> This gesture could help avoid future misunderstandings by directly communicating America's fundamental Asian interests and concerns at the highest level.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia.</b> Rather than confront China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement in China for granted.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> When China violates a U.S. law or international agreement, the U.S. should apply the penalty prescribed in that law or agreement. In other words, if China violates the Missile Control Technology Regime, the U.S. should coordinate its response with other MCTR members and apply the sanctions outlined in the law that ratified U.S. membership in that regime. The U.S. should not revoke MFN or impose sanctions that are not relevant to the specific broken law or agreement.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> This amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. Its primary target no longer exists, and its freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. </ul><p>


<b>AMERICA'S STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND MFN</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Over the past two centuries, the U.S. has sought consistently to protect three fundamental interests in Asia: 1) regional peace and stability, 2) freedom of navigation on the high seas, and 3) free access to the region's markets. These interests provide a firm foundation for a healthy and growing American economy. They also help promote a stable and secure world in which political and economic freedom, human rights, and democratic institutions can flourish. These interests allow the U.S. to maintain a system of healthy, cooperative, and politically vigorous relations with allies and friendly nations.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

MFN plays a fundamental role in advancing these enduring American interests in Asia. Most-favored-nation treatment is the normal tariff treatment that the United States provides to all but a handful of its trading partners.<sup>3</sup>  It is a principle which undergirds the open international trading system that the U.S. has labored for decades to expand, not merely a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China relationship that holds America's trade and economic interests around the globe hostage to the ups and downs of its political relationship with China. MFN has been, in fact, a key ingredient of America's global strategy since World War II. The purpose of this strategy has been to build a cooperative free-trade environment within which America's businesses and economy can prosper. It also has been to protect the United States and the world from reliving the tragic consequences of the isolationism and protectionism that plagued the 1930s.
<P>

<b>HISTORICAL ROOTS OF MFN STATUS FOR CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The U.S. first introduced the notion of most-favored-nation trade status into the U.S.-China relationship in the 19th century to ensure the survival of American commercial interests in Asia. After the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, several foreign powers won concessions from China and sought to establish exclusive areas of influence along China's coast. American leaders considered these actions a threat to the U.S. interest in free access to the markets of Asia. In order to keep Britain, Germany, Japan, or China from excluding the U.S. from the Chinese market, the U.S. induced China to agree to an MFN provision in its treaty obligations with the U.S.<sup>4</sup>  This provision required that any future concession that the Chinese government granted to a third power would be extended simultaneously and automatically to the U.S. as well. MFN was not considered a tool by which America would realize the full potential of the enormous Chinese market. Rather, it was one means by which the U.S. could guarantee itself equal access to that market.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The United States extended MFN status to all of its trading partners as a matter of statutory policy in 1934. The scope of this policy narrowed as the Cold War intensified. Section 5 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 required President Truman to suspend the MFN status of the Soviet Union and all countries under the control of international communism. In accordance with this act, the President suspended China's most-favored-nation status on September 1, 1951, approximately two years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Trade Act of 1974 set forth new conditions for the restoration of MFN to "nonmarket economy" countries such as China.<sup>5</sup>  According to Title IV, in order to grant MFN status to China, the President must satisfy two conditions:
<ul> 

<p><li>Condition #1: A trade agreement that includes MFN for the U.S. Under Section 405 in Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act, in order to conclude a trade agreement with China, the President must first determine that any reductions in U.S. trade barriers are reciprocated by China. In other words, as the U.S. lowers tariffs on imports from China, China simultaneously will reduce tariffs on U.S. exports to China.

<p><li>Condition #2: Freedom of emigration. This second requirement is much more contentious. Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, was intended to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jews to emigrate.<sup>6</sup>  Over time, this provision has become, albeit inadvertently, the legal basis for the current annual debate over renewal of China's MFN status. The Amendment calls on the President to deny MFN treatment to any nonmarket economy country which the President determines denies, seriously restricts, or burdens its citizens' right to emigrate. This freedom of emigration requirement can be waived annually, and it is around this annual waiver that the current debate over China's MFN status revolves.</ul>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

In the process of normalizing relations with the PRC, President Jimmy Carter in 1979 used presidential authority to conclude a three-year bilateral trade agreement with China in which China granted MFN status to the U.S. This satisfied the first requirement for granting MFN to a nonmarket economy country. The U.S. trade agreement with China, which entered into force on February 1, 1980, provides for automatic three-year extensions. Since China is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 405 of the 1974 Trade Act, however, these "automatic" extensions require the President to certify that China reciprocates reductions in U.S. trade barriers. Thus far, the trade agreement has been renewed five times.<sup>7</sup>
<P>


<b>MFN Procedures and China</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The  problem is that President Carter did not completely resolve the second requirement for extending MFN status to China. To grant MFN to China, the President must determine that China permits free and unrestricted emigration of its citizens or waive for 12 months the requirements for full compliance with Jackson-Vanik. President Carter in 1980 waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements for 12 months rather than certify China's full compliance with its freedom of emigration strictures. This has been done by every President since then. In every June since 1980, the President has had to decide whether or not to waive for another 12 months the freedom of emigration requirements in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Moreover, each year after the President's decision has been made, Congress has had an opportunity to review the President's decision and to decide whether to vote on a resolution to discontinue MFN.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

According to the procedures outlined in Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, once the President has waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements, he must submit to Congress a recommendation for a 12-month extension of the waiver authority. This recommendation, along with the President's reasons for granting it, must be submitted to Congress during the final 30 days of the current waiver. The President's recommendation traditionally has been sent by June 3 of each year. Extension of the waiver authority is automatic unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law within 60 days after the expiration of the previous waiver authority, which typically is by the end of August. Although resolutions of disapproval have been considered by Congress, MFN treatment for China has continued uninterrupted since 1980 under annual renewal of the waiver.
<p>

<b>ISSUES ENTANGLED IN MFN DEBATE</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Automatic extension of the three-year U.S. trade agreement with China and the annual presidential waiver of Jackson-Vanik requirements went smoothly throughout the 1980s, as China embarked on massive and largely successful economic reforms. Market capitalism was introduced incrementally into the Chinese economy to improve efficiency and to hasten modernization. Many in China readily admitted the failures of socialism and looked to the West for new methods to improve living standards. President Ronald Reagan visited China in 1984 and declared the dawning of a new era of freedom for the Chinese people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

But this honeymoon in Sino-American relations came to an abrupt halt on June 4, 1989, when the People's Liberation Army used deadly force against the students and workers who had gathered in protest at Tiananmen Square. In response, President George Bush invoked a series of sanctions against China. These included restrictions on arms and munitions sales, military exchanges, transfer of dual-use technologies, and U.S. government financing for projects in China. The objective was to punish the government of China without unnecessarily injuring the people of China. This same rationale was advanced to explain the continuation of MFN status for China. Revoking MFN would have injured a wide range of people in China that the U.S. wanted to help, including economic reformers and entrepreneurs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

A majority in Congress, however, did not agree with the President's decision. Each year, from 1990-1992, Congress voted to disapprove extension of MFN status to China. President Bush repeatedly used his veto authority to defeat these congressional resolutions. Members of Congress argued that the U.S. should make China's leaders pay for their brutality and that it was immoral for Americans to seek profit under such circumstances. Every year, this "automatic" procedure has provided a forum for a well-orchestrated recitation of all the ills for which China's government is held responsible.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Four years ago, candidate Bill Clinton scolded President Bush for "coddling tyrants" and vowed to make the "butchers of Beijing" pay by attaching requirements for improved human rights conditions to the continuation of MFN for China. This was his intention when on May 28, 1993, President Clinton issued an executive order which continued China's unconditional MFN status for another year but attached new conditions to China's renewal in subsequent years.<sup>8</sup>  The executive order required China to halt exports of prison labor products to the U.S. and mandated that the Secretary of State determine whether China had made "significant progress" on human rights.<sup>9</sup>  After a year of strained diplomatic relations, President Clinton, despite his campaign threats, renewed China's MFN status on May 26, 1994. He did so without declaring that China had made significant progress in human rights protection, effectively de-linking human rights from trade issues.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Although human rights has been the most prominent rallying cry for those who wish to discontinue MFN for China, there are a number of other issues that give Americans cause for concern: China's military adventurism, proliferation of missiles and nuclear technology, piracy of intellectual property, and unbalanced trade. These concerns are legitimate and are being addressed in varying degrees through diplomacy. The danger in the political debate over China is that the U.S. will try to use MFN, one of the fundamental principles of international trade, as a policy tool to advance unrelated economic, political, and security interests.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Revoking China's MFN status clearly is not an effective way to advance these interests. Certainly, China's bullying of Taiwan with missile tests interfered with international air and sea lanes and had the potential to draw the U.S. into military conflict with the PRC.<sup>10</sup>  It also put at risk peace and stability in Asia as well as freedom of navigation -- two of the three historical U.S. interests in Asia. However, revoking MFN would do nothing to stop these provocative acts. Nor would it improve the prospects for peace and stability or freedom of navigation generally. But it would violate the U.S. interest in free access to markets and free trade. Thus, while revoking MFN will affect neither China's position on human rights nor its intimidation of Taiwan, it certainly will violate a vital U.S. economic interest.
<p>

<b>Policy Solutions That Fit Policy Problems</b>

<p><b>Human Rights.</b> Rather than revoke MFN, the U.S. should craft a policy that deals as directly as possible with the source of the problem. On human rights, for example, the U.S. has been following a pattern of publicly demonizing China's leaders and then trying to negotiate quietly with these leaders for release of high-profile political prisoners and changes in PRC law. The problem with this approach is that by threatening and demonizing the PRC government, the U.S. cuts off access to those whom Americans seek to help. This tactic does not leave Chinese leaders in the mood to find consensus on these issues, and by focusing attention on a few high-profile dissidents, the U.S. risks being viewed by the Chinese people as caring only for a few superstars while ignoring the interests of the many ordinary people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way to address human rights concerns in China. The U.S. should create a positive public relationship with China's leaders while vigorously raising these legitimate moral concerns in private. To reach the people Americans seek to help, the U.S. could send more volunteers and supplies to provide direct assistance to China's orphans and poor. The U.S. also should seek to increase as much as possible people-to-people contact between the two countries, whether through business or education, to increase cross-fertilization of cultural values and understanding.

<p><b>Weapons Proliferation.</b> The U.S. intelligence community has reported Chinese sales of nuclear technology to Pakistan and nuclear capable missiles to Pakistan and Iran. The Administration is required to confirm these reports and to determine whether such transactions violate U.S. law and international agreements such as the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<sup>11</sup>  If violations of U.S. law and international agreements are confirmed, the U.S. is obliged to invoke sanctions against China. While the Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions, it has yet to determine officially whether actual violations have occurred. In addition, the threatened sanctions would only take funding away from American-run projects and would have little effect on China, as European and Japanese competitors would immediately fill the void.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The more effective approach to curbing China's proliferation problems is to work through the multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms within the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Unilateral enforcement of U.S. law, while justified if violations are confirmed, may not have the intended effect on China's behavior. Non-proliferation is an area in which cooperation with treaty partners and allies is not only critical, but also possible. A security threat is much more likely to produce international cooperation than is an economic or trade issue. Without the support of Europe and Japan, any sanction will quickly be undercut and rendered ineffective. Thus, to maximize the likelihood of success, it is important for the U.S. to have its allies' support in dealing with China, working as much as possible through the mechanisms built into international non-proliferation treaties and regimes. 

<p><b>Selling Pirated Goods.</b> With regard to intellectual property rights, officials in the U.S. software, motion picture, and computer industries have accused dozens of factories in China's southern Guangdong Province of illegally copying U.S. products and selling the pirated goods abroad. These officials estimate the damage to their industries in lost sales at $2.3 billion. In 1992, in 1995, and again in 1996, China signed agreements with the U.S. Trade Representative promising to crack down on these pirates. In May 1996, in an effort to motivate Chinese enforcement of its agreements, the U.S. Trade Representative threatened to impose sanctions totaling $2 billion on Chinese textile exports from Guangdong Province.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Indirect sanctions on textile manufacturers in Guangdong Province, while consistent with the spirit of enforcing the rule of law, do not address the source of the problem. Many of these illegal compact disk producers are operated solely or jointly by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen, and some have ties to organized crime. Thus, the U.S. cannot hope to press China alone to deal effectively with this problem. Only a carefully planned, well organized cooperative effort by the PRC, ROC, Hong Kong, and U.S. governments can possibly be successful.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way for the U.S. to address the piracy problem. If American companies can locate these illegal manufacturers, they should also be able to identify the shipping container in which the pirated goods are packaged for export. With the consent of PRC and Hong Kong officials, once the container is identified, port authorities in Hong Kong can locate and seize the pirated goods that are targeted for export markets. Seizing the goods would affect the perpetrators but very few others, unlike indirect sanctions which, like a swinging axe, harm many in the hope of punishing the guilty few. In addition, international markets serviced by Hong Kong's exporters are the appropriate target. China's own consumers lack sufficient computer and audio hardware to generate the sustained demand necessary to make these pirates profitable.

<b>EIGHT REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</b>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Since MFN is so fundamental to U.S. global commercial strategy, there are several reasons why the U.S. should continue to extend it to China. Revoking MFN for China would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Harm American workers.</b> In 1995, the U.S. exported over $12 billion in goods and services to China. American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional American jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies. The loss of exports from the inevitable Chinese retaliation against MFN revocation would seriously threaten the employment of these Americans.

<p><li><b>Threaten U.S. business and investment.</b> The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated China that will require nearly $750 billion in new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies are poised to get the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment, with American jobs lost to overseas competitors.

<p><li><b>Jeopardize economic reform in China.</b> The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of 25 percent of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to open China's economy and society even more. MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but does it keep China open to influences and pressures from the outside world. It fosters the development of a middle class and a civil society that in the future will have the means and the will to demand more responsiveness from its government.

<p><li><b>Damage the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</b> The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong depends to a significant degree on investment and export production in China. The revocation of MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. Although this point is rarely discussed, billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by the recent tensions. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Threats of across-the-board tariff increases, MFN revocation, and boycotting of Chinese goods ignore the fact that many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by companies based in Hong Kong and Taiwan, both friends of the U.S.

<p><li><b>Not improve human rights conditions in China.</b> History shows that China oppresses its people far more during periods of isolation. This clearly was the case in the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. It is a process that does not lend itself to annual review. Nevertheless, Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this transition is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.

<p><li><b>Not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction.</b> China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its commitments to the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Administration must investigate these allegations and, if such sales have taken place, apply sanctions as required by U.S. law. The law, however, needs to be changed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be targeted specifically on the responsible Chinese enterprise rather than indiscriminately on all U.S.-financed projects in China as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further than the sanctions called for under current law, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial interaction with China. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan or criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to unstable regimes. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. In the area of non-proliferation, MFN is the wrong tool.

<p><li><b>Unnecessarily set the U.S. on the road to prolonged confrontation with China.</b> Abandoning MFN for China would make it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States to realize its policy objectives most effectively, Beijing should not be an enemy. If U.S. policymakers wish to see China behave in a way that is consistent with international norms and agreements, they should work for multilateral cooperation with allies rather than engage in ineffective bilateral browbeating. How best to promote China's integration into the international commercial and security system will be among the most important challenges for American foreign policy in the foreseeable future. It warrants more deliberation and care from the President, his administration, and Congress.

<p><li><b>Violate a U.S. interest in free trade and a more open China.</b> The term "MFN" is misleading and should be changed. "General trading status" (GTS) would be a good alternative. Together with national treatment, MFN is a fundamental principle by which the World Trade Organization operates. It is normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries -- North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam -- none of which has any substantial global trade. It is the foundation of basic international commercial relations, and in the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, commercial relations are now the foundation of U.S.-China relations. Revoking MFN means seriously undercutting America's relationship with China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

For more than a century, U.S. policy has aimed at free access to the markets of Asia. For over half a century, the U.S. has labored to build and strengthen the current liberal international system of trade. In addition to being consistent with these long-term U.S. interests, MFN trade status for China demonstrates American goodwill to the people of China, if not to the government, by extending the U.S. system of free enterprise to raise their living standards and increase their economic freedoms and choices.</ul>
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The President should never have threatened revocation of MFN over human rights concerns when neither he nor the country was prepared to pay the cost of such action. The Secretary of State, ignoring congressional and public interest, should not have assured Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be granted entry into the United States only days before the visa was granted. Similarly, Administration officials should not have equivocated, delayed, and apologized for action taken in support of U.S. interests in Taiwan. Each of these blunders severely damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with China and created a negative bilateral environment that renders the correct policies ineffective.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration says one thing but does another. It has managed the relationship with China badly. The Chinese are told that the Administration is following a policy of engagement. Engagement, however, is not a policy; it is simply another word for diplomacy. The U.S. needs engagement -- and diplomacy -- with a purpose. The Clinton Administration now lacks such a purpose. The purpose of U.S. policy toward China should be to communicate to Chinese leaders that China's interests will be served best by integrating into the international system, observing its norms and standards, and pursuing peace and stability in Asia in ways that are commensurate with the interests of the U.S. and China's Asian neighbors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To deliver this message, President Clinton needs to meet personally with Chinese leaders. The President received Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat in the White House, but forced the PRC head of state to meet instead in New York without the fanfare of a full state visit. This message is not lost on the Chinese leadership, and the mere promise of frequent high-level summits to take place in a second Clinton Administration, as proposed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher this May in New York, is little consolation. Frequent face-to-face interaction between the leaders of the United States and China at the highest levels is critical for the protection of American interests in Asia. This interaction should take place in both capitals and in a formal setting that reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to achieving these American interests through cooperation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

This strategy is the best way to make progress on areas of concern to the United States. Americans frustrated with the lack of progress in China on human rights, missile proliferation, or intellectual property rights, instead of more promises, need a clear, consistent, and predictable China policy to avoid miscalculation in the Taiwan Strait and to make progress on these issues.

<p>
<b>TOWARD A CHINA POLICY THAT WORKS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	There is much that can be done to work more effectively toward American goals in Asia. China's cooperation in areas which do not conflict with its own interests will make U.S. efforts easier and less costly. There is little chance of charting a policy course that follows common interests without regular and consistent communication, at the highest levels, of what each county's objectives and vital interests are in bilateral and regional relations. To create an environment more conducive to an effective policy toward China, the U.S. should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Renew China's MFN status.</b> This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress. MFN promotes the U.S. interest in free access to Asian markets and provides Americans with greater opportunity to act as an influence for good within China.
<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> There is little reason to think that China is fated to become an enemy of the United States. It could happen, but the chances are reduced by dealing directly with China and by maintaining American strength. This is a gesture that could demonstrate that the U.S. is truly "engaged" with a purpose.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia</b> The U.S. should avoid putting too many eggs in the China market basket. Rather than confronting China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Both countries are very populous, and both are seeking foreign investment to improve their infrastructure and sustain a high rate of economic growth. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement as a given.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> China must obey the rules of the road in international commerce and security. It is right for the U.S. to seek the enforcement of U.S. law and international agreements, but it should use the dispute resolution mechanisms built into the relevant international regime or apply the recourse outlined in the bilateral agreement or U.S. law that has been violated. The remedy should target as specifically as possible the source of the problem and not cut too broadly across the spectrum of competing American interests in China, Asia, or the world.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. The Soviet Union, Jackson-Vanik's primary target, exists no more, and China is no longer dominated by international communism. It is even becoming difficult to say that China's is a nonmarket economy. In addition, the amendment's freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. If China were to permit or encourage free emigration, what countries would be prepared or willing to accept tens or hundreds of millions of Chinese migrants?  Certainly the U.S. would not be willing to accept them. The already strained U.S. immigration and welfare system would be overwhelmed by the vast numbers of Chinese people seeking greater opportunity in America.</ul>
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The question of whether to continue China's MFN status is once again before the Congress. As Members take this opportunity to assess U.S.-China relations, they should replace the mixed signals sent by the Clinton Administration with a consistent strategy for promoting America's long-term interests in Asia. Because of its size and rate of growth, China will have an enormous impact for good or for ill on U.S. interests. Therefore, it is prudent to improve the management of this critical relationship and to seek China's cooperation before forcing the American and Chinese people to pay the enormous security and economic costs of revoking MFN.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The MFN debate unfortunately is caught up in two mistaken beliefs: 1) that MFN is privileged treatment and 2) that revoking MFN would be an effective way to force a favorable change in China's behavior. These beliefs have no basis in reality. Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Moreover, discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China but would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. For these and many other reasons, most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<h3>CHINA: FRIEND OR ENEMY?</h3>

<b>By The Honorable Barbara Hackman Franklin</b>
<P>Barbara Hackman Franklin is the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on June 20, 1996.
<p>
	China has always held a special fascination for Westerners. This vast, populous country is thought by many to have the oldest culture on Earth. Certainly it was the center of Eastern civilization. China was already a sophisticated society when Marco Polo traveled there in the 14th century, bringing back such treasures as silk, tea, spices, noodles, fireworks, exquisite porcelain, jade, and wood block printing.
<p>	But our captivation with China has not translated into a smooth and predictable relationship over the past few centuries. To us, China has been alternately open, then closed, and then reopened again. The result is that we Americans do not understand China very well--its ancient roots, its history, its people, its way of life, political structure, or place in today's world. Nor do the Chinese understand us. To them, the West has seemed imperialistic and exploitive, caught up with colonial designs on their territory and disrespectful of China as a great nation.
<p>	But it is imperative--even urgent--that we learn to understand each other better. I believe the U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important--perhaps the most important--of all the bilateral strategic relationships in the world today and that we have reached a defining moment in that relationship.
<p>
<b>China's Place in the World Today</b>
<p>	Today, China is a country in transition. Much change is occurring, and it is occurring at a phenomenal pace.
	<p>This was brought home to me forcefully when President Bush sent me to China in December of 1992 to normalize commercial relations that had been disrupted with the imposition of sanctions on China after the crackdown at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. I was the first Cabinet Secretary to visit the country officially since that sad day, and my mission removed one of the sanctions--the one prohibiting ministerial contacts between our two governments. Together, my then counterpart, Minister of Foreign Economics and Trade Li Lanqing (now Vice Premier), and I reconvened the nearly moribund Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. In addition, $1 billion worth of new contracts for U.S. companies were signed, and much additional business followed.
<p>	During this trip, I saw firsthand the hunger of the Chinese for prosperity, their intense desire to move quickly into the ranks of the world's strongest economies, and the fervor with which they were applying themselves to achieving this goal. Since that trip in December of 1992, I have been back to China regularly. Each time, I am struck again by the rapid progress the Chinese are making toward this objective.
<p>	Of course, the path of dramatic change is never smooth; semi-controlled chaos might be one way to describe it. Nor is such change always clearly discernible to those outside the country. But the outcome in China has tremendous significance for us in the United States, for the whole of Asia, and indeed for the rest of the world. There are many reasons why.<ul>
	<p><li>China is an emerging great power. It is the world's most populous country--1.2 billion people.
	<p><li>It is strategically positioned as the geographic center of Asia. China shares a border with 14 different countries. It has more common borders than any other country in the world.
	<p><li>China has the world's largest standing army, and it holds one of the seven permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. This means that China has a voice in-- and a veto over--the decisions made by this organization.
	<p><li>Finally--and most importantly, given my view of the world today that economic concerns are primary drivers of global politics--we now have China's growing economic clout. China's economy is the fastest-growing large economy in the world. The World Bank already ranks China as the third-largest economy in the world behind the United States and Japan. Predictions are that China's economy will grow somewhere between 8 and 10 percent this year, and economists expect China's economy to continue growing at least 6 to 8 percent annually for the foreseeable future. That means China is well on the way to becoming the world's largest economy within the next 15 years.
	<p><li>China is the largest market in the world for aircraft, for telephones, for construction equipment, for agricultural products, and increasingly for consumer goods. The country needs virtually everything we produce and sell. And demand is growing rapidly. In cities like Shenzhen in the south of China, the first of the Special Economic Zones created by Deng Xiaoping's reform drive, one can stand on the street corner and feel the dynamism and the energy as the Chinese people build another Hong Kong. The same can be said for Shanghai, reportedly sporting nearly 25 percent of the world's cranes, or Tianjin or Zhuhai. The whirlwind pace of growth and change is awe-inspiring.</ul><p>
	Now for the flip side.<p>
	Despite the dynamic economic growth, GDP per capita in China is only about $300. Some parts of China, especially in the north and the west, have not yet been touched by the freedom of the Special Economic Zones and are still very poor. In contrast, GDP per capita is much greater--probably far higher than $300--for people living along the coast and in the south of China, where the change has been the greatest.
<p>
<b>China--A Place of Contradictions</b><p>
	China today is, in some ways, hard to describe. Contradictions abound, starting with the government's self-description of the country as a "socialist market economy." Such contradictions pop up constantly as the leadership tries to put a Communist rationale and a Chinese face on activities that would make Karl Marx turn over in his grave.
	<p>China today is not a police state like Stalin's Russia; nor is there the indiscriminate violence and intolerance of the Cultural Revolution. But neither is it a democracy. There is a ruling elite in Beijing, but the central government is no longer as powerful as it once was. The provinces are flexing their muscles, and some officials are candid about wanting "Beijing off our backs." Besides the greater economic freedoms in China today, there is greater mobility, the beginnings of better job opportunities, greater tolerance for and interest in education, and greater freedom of discussion.
<p>	China is governed by a collective leadership in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, is still alive but not active in governing. His hand-picked successor, President and General Secretary Jiang Zemin, seems to have consolidated his power for the near term. But his word is not law; he must gain consensus among the others in the collective leadership. That is sometimes difficult and makes for erratic reactions, arrogant posturing, slow decisions, or no decisions on occasion.
<p>	Some people seem to believe that when Deng finally passes away there will be a great skirmish for power. I think not. I think the post-Deng era has already begun and that the collective leadership will stay in place at least for awhile.
<p>	One indicator of the course China may take in the near future will come within the next year to 18 months. Premier Li Peng is due to move out of the premiership, according to Party rules, and the Party Congress will choose his replacement. Who the Congress chooses could be an important signal. Much jockeying is going on now behind the scenes. From the U.S. perspective, the best choice would be someone committed to reform and familiar with the United States to replace the more nationalistic Li Peng.
<p>	Longer term, the real questions are: Will the Communist Party continue to enjoy legitimacy among the populace? Will it continue to satisfy the growing appetite for prosperity? Will there be another paramount leader, such as Deng and Mao? Or will China have opened up too much for one person to be able to command so much respect and power? And if there is no paramount leader, will a collective leadership survive? If not, what form will the leadership structure take, and how will the leadership be chosen? Or will China regress? Will there be a leadership change by force? What role might the military play?
<p>	History is little help to us here. Despite the tendency of China to have "paramount leaders" throughout its long civilization, the paradigm has changed significantly, thanks to the new economic freedoms, the march of technology, instantaneous communication globally, and a more closely integrated world.
<p>	Within China, the central government and the provinces are attempting to deal with myriad problems and issues. They are working now with the Ninth Five Year Plan. This one stresses a number of goals, including strengthening China's agriculture and bringing prosperity to the rural economy; creating infrastructure and building basic industries to address such needs as water conservation, greater energy production, and reliable communications; promoting science and technology; reforming state enterprises; expanding education; and moving toward a rule of law.
<p>	A big concern is the migration of people from rural areas to the cities in search of prosperity with the attendant possibility of social unrest. There are potential shortages of water and of oil. There is corruption. There is pollution. And these are just a few of the challenges and obstacles confronting China's leadership today.
<p>	What happens in China will bear close watching. I believe the drive to free the economy may well be irreversible. The Chinese people want prosperity and material things. They want to get rich. Political freedom and democracy seem not to be at the top of most people's agendas--prosperity is. Perhaps as material needs are better met, the Chinese people's desires will change. We will just have to see.
	<p>However, I believe that the U.S. posture toward China and the tone of the U.S.-China governmental relationship can have an influence on which way things go. It will also help determine whether China is an ally, a belligerent friend, or an enemy.
<p>
<b>The U.S.-China Relationship</b><p>
	Our relationship with China is anchored on three communiques, signed between 1972 and 1982, and the Taiwan Relations Act that was passed in 1979. The 1972 communique--the Shanghai Communique--was agreed to by President Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao Zedong. This was when the "one China" policy was first articulated. It has been the bedrock of the United States' diplomatic posture toward China ever since.
<p>	Currently, the relationship between our two governments is at the lowest point it has been in many years. It is characterized by distrust and misunderstanding on both sides. Let's just review what has happened since the Clinton Administration took over management of this critical relationship.
<p>	After charging President Bush with "coddling dictators" during the 1992 campaign, candidate Clinton changed his tune once he became President. Following an entertaining spectacle of dithering and public hand-wringing of the sort that has characterized this Administration, President Clinton adopted the very same "engagement" policy espoused by President Bush. Funny how one's perspective changes after one becomes the leader of the free world, isn't it?
<p>	The problem with President Clinton's change of heart and new policy began when the Administration didn't follow it. Three years later, the policy has become so muddled by ad hoc decisions and inconsistent actions that it is hard to ascertain what it is. And because of the mixed signals sent by Clinton and his Cabinet, many Chinese now have come to believe that our policy is the "containment" of China--an idea they deeply resent.
	<p>The big turnaround on President Clinton's part occurred during the 1994 annual battle over renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China. The President announced that he would certify MFN renewal without the conditions regarding human rights that he had attached the preceding year. His decision was correct on the merits; trade and human rights should not be linked. Punishing trade does nothing to correct human rights abuses. But because the Administration made this decision unilaterally, without first gaining concessions on other trade issues from the Chinese, the policy change actually created confusion and caused the Chinese to think they had "won," that the Clinton Administration had backed down in the face of business pressure, and that they did not have to do anything else to satisfy the U.S. on trade. In fact, the Administration did give China a big victory--and got nothing in return.
<p>	Currently, from the Chinese perspective, the greatest obstacle to improving relations between our two countries probably is the question of Taiwan. One of the biggest flaps over this issue was sparked by something that to many here seemed rather unimportant--the granting of a visa to Lee Teng-hui, the President of Taiwan, in June of last year so that he could attend a reunion at Cornell University.
<p>	Again, this situation was badly handled. After promises had been made to China that such a visa would not be issued, President Clinton apparently changed his mind (what a surprise). He reversed this decision, thus pulling the rug out from under his own Secretary of State, who had made assurances to his counterpart, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, that the visa would not be granted. Needless to say, Beijing reacted angrily and promptly recalled its ambassador. The decision to allow President Lee to visit the U.S. was interpreted by the Chinese as a violation of the spirit of the "one China" policy, and therefore an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. Sovereignty is a gut issue with the Chinese and has been ever since the "one China" policy was first articulated.
<p>	Another strain on the relationship was added earlier this year. Our country was incensed at the saber-rattling missile exercises and military maneuvers the Chinese  government carried out in the Taiwan Straits prior to the Taiwan elections. In response, the U.S. sent aircraft carriers to the region. Now, in the aftermath of the Taiwan election, tensions have been lowered, but some here in the United States are still distrustful of China's intentions toward Taiwan.
<p>Countless other examples could be cited to illustrate the inconsistency of U.S. policy, the mixed signals, and the escalating tensions which have characterized the Clinton Administration approach toward China. And although the two presidents have met on more than one occasion, they have not established anything that resembles a personal or a working relationship.
<p>
<b>Renewal of Most-Favored-Nation Trading Status-Again</b>
<p>	And now here we are again, debating the subject of most-favored-nation (MFN) renewal for China one more time. The annual discussion is under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. The amendment denies MFN to any "non-market" economy which restricts free emigration unless the President makes the determination to waive the restrictions. This amendment was aimed originally at the USSR during the Cold War era. But in recent years, since Tiananmen Square, the annual MFN debate has become the vehicle through which a variety of discontents with China have been raised. This year is no different, except that the number of issues with China has increased.
<p>	The President has certified to Congress his desire to renew MFN without conditions. Senator Dole, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has stated his strong pro-MFN position. The Republican leadership in Congress agrees. Now the action is with Congress, which has 60 days to debate and vote. Congress should concur with renewing MFN for China. Denying it or attaching unrelated conditions makes no sense.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the economic consequences would be profound. Denial of MFN would impede trade, raise tariffs, and make it more costly to do business in China. At least 170,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs were directly dependent on U.S. exports to China last year, and thousands of others in such areas as transportation and finance are indirectly linked. Denying MFN would slow China's reform progress as well.
	<p><li>Second, such action would send a negative message to the Asia-Pacific region, a place where some countries already are concerned that the United States is planning to withdraw despite the fact that our presence is viewed as critical to ensuring stability in that part of the world.
	<p><li>Third, denial of MFN to China would harm the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, the two largest investors in the mainland--and both places in which we have a considerable stake.
	<p><li>Finally, denial of MFN will not correct or erase any of the concerns we have with China, whether they be human rights, nuclear proliferation, anti-Taiwan saber-rattling, or something else. Seeking to punish China through this vehicle simply does not serve our national interest.</ul><p>
	Furthermore, I think the time has come, before MFN renewal comes up again next year, to make MFN for China permanent. After all, we accord permanent MFN status to most other countries, including some considered rogue states, such as Iraq and Libya. Our strategic and economic relationship with the world's most populous country is too important to continue engaging in an annual mud-wrestling event around this issue. Doing this means changing or repealing the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an action that should be high on the agenda of the President and Congress next year.
<p>
<b>Challenges</b><p>
	There are challenges to getting this done. Many people have serious and very real concerns about China.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the issue of human rights, which has cropped up every year since the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, raises everyone's sympathy and creates outrage among all of us who value personal liberty and freedom. All of us flinch at the reports about the detention of some dissidents, Chinese methods of population control, and allegedly poor treatment of children at orphanages. Needless to say, we disagree with the way in which China deals with many of these matters, but using trade as a weapon to try to force the Chinese into adopting more respect for human rights is not the way to make progress.
	<p><li>Second, nuclear proliferation looms as a major worry. Intelligence reports over the past few years--some apparently substantiated, some not--indicate that China has shipped missile technology and parts to Pakistan and Iran. Most recently, allegations that China shipped ring magnets to Pakistan caused some people to claim that China had violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1994. This act calls for mandatory sanctions once a finding of violation has been made. Specifically, this means that the U.S. Export-Import Bank could not make or guarantee any loans for projects in China. The Administration recently declined to make such a finding, in exchange for China's assurance that it would strictly observe its obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
	<p>Once again, using trade as a weapon to address these concerns will not eliminate the problems. In addition, we have to question whether this sort of law punishes U.S. exports, and therefore U.S. jobs and well-being, more than it punishes the offending nation. This is a law which ought to be revised in the next Congress as well.
	<p><li>Third is the issue of intellectual property rights. A trade war was just averted on Monday by an 11th-hour finding by acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that China had made substantial progress in complying with a 1995 agreement to protect intellectual property rights. The Administration had threatened sanctions if the Chinese did not take concrete steps to enforce the agreement; the Chinese had threatened to retaliate. So the good news is that we found that China had closed 15 factories that had been producing 30 to 50 million pirated CDs and videos yearly, shuttered six distribution centers, and instituted a ban on the importation of equipment needed to produce these products. The bad news is that this action does not solve the problem. It is a step in the right direction, but it is just a step and an incremental one at that. We are going to have to keep consistent pressure on the Chinese to continue making progress on the matter of safeguarding intellectual property rights until the rule of law is firmly established in China.
	<p><li>Fourth is another commercial dispute--our mounting trade deficit with China. The deficit, growing at nearly 20 percent annually in recent years, could reach nearly $40 billion this year. The worry is that China's market is still too closed and that U.S. jobs are disappearing to places around the world, like China, where labor is much cheaper.
	<p><li>Fifth is the question of Taiwan. Some Taiwan advocates want to punish China for the recent saber-rattling and for other things. Despite this--maybe even because of it--President Lee Teng-hui won handily, making Taiwan a shining example of economic freedom leading to political freedom. The United States does indeed have commitments to Taiwan, and we should honor them. But we need to be careful not to overstep and involve ourselves in the Beijing-Taipei debate when we have no reason to be there. It should be noted that the Independence Party candidate garnered barely 20 percent of the vote in the March election.
	<p><li>Then there is Hong Kong, which reverts to China on June 30 next year. How Beijing handles this situation will be viewed by many as a precursor to the way in which reunification with Taiwan, if it is to occur, would be handled. Already Beijing is making many people uneasy with such actions as announcing its intention to close down the Hong Kong Legislative Council and replace it with another body and issuing confusing statements about its intentions to respect freedom of the press in Hong Kong.
	<p><li>Finally, another strategic concern is the intentions of China's military. Some people also worry that U.S. products now sold in China could be diverted for military uses.</ul><p>
	Finding ways to deal with all of these very tough issues in a constructive manner is the challenge before us today.
	<p>One interesting obstacle to getting this done is posed by the fact that the majority of the American people are viewing China through an old stereotype. They either envision a Stalinist-type police state or think of peasants and water buffalo in rice paddies. Part of the challenge for those in China--and I believe there are many--who want to have a better relationship with the United States is to make Americans understand how China is changing and what the Chinese people want in their future.
<p>
<b>The Future</b><p>
	So where do we want our relationship with China to go from here? <p>
	Currently, the U.S. policy--or, more accurately, non-policy--is fraught with inconsistencies. This has led to confusion on the part of the Chinese about what we really mean. They, in turn, often behave in ways that we have difficulty understanding, and seem sometimes to be both arrogant and paranoid.
<p>	The business relationships, however, between the two countries are much more cordial and productive. That is good and it is hopeful.
<p>	However, the tension in the governmental relationship can and does negatively affect some commercial activity. Every time tensions increase, there are large projects which are held up. Some contracts U.S. firms hope to get go to other countries. The approval of licenses and branches, particularly in the financial services area, has slowed. All of this creates a climate of uncertainty and heightens the risk for American businesses.
<p>	There is one clear example of where Administration policy, which some think politically motivated in this election year, has hurt U.S. business prospects: the enormous Three Gorges Dam project, which the Chinese have been talking about for 50 years. Administration objections to this project on environmental grounds have caused the Export-Import Bank to announce that it will not help finance U.S. companies bidding on the project.
	<p>None of this helps our overall relationship with China. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Administration to get its act together and make every effort to improve the bilateral relationship. The President and the executive branch must do it. Congress has a say, but Congress is not empowered or equipped to manage foreign relations day to day.
<p>	Engagement with China is the right policy. But the policy must be more than just words. Consistent actions speak far louder than words.
<p>	What we urgently need is a strategic framework for our relationship. This does not mean that we are going to be soft on China. It does mean that we have to define a clear set of goals, objectives, and expectations for our relationship and clearly articulate this to the Chinese. And they must have the opportunity to do the same. This is what has been missing from our relationship for the past three-and-a-half years. We must have a meaningful dialogue at the highest levels in order to push for what we want to achieve.
<p>	In putting this framework in place, we should concentrate first on areas where we have common interests and some agreement. The commercial sector is a good place to start.
	<p>Currently, thousands of U.S. companies are doing business in China. That number has increased significantly between my mission in 1992 and now. U.S. companies have about $26 billion invested in China, making the United States the third-largest investor after Hong Kong and Taiwan. Eighty percent of this investment was made since 1992. And, of course, the U.S. has considerable investment in Hong Kong as well--$12 billion at last count. In fact, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest AmCham in the world.
<p>	The U.S. needs to work with the Chinese to bring about increased market access; to enforce intellectual property rights--a crucial issue for us; to reduce the overemphasis the Chinese government currently places on technology transfer and exporting by investor companies; and to help bring about a consistent rule of law.
<p>	The U.S. also needs to work with China to bring that country into the World Trade Organization (WTO) on reasonable terms. We need to help find a way around the current impasse: that China claims to be a developing country while we maintain she is not because of the clout associated with her sheer size. It is in our interest to have China join the WTO, on acceptable terms; that way, we could pursue our trade agenda multilaterally and would have added support for getting China to conform to the rules governing world trade.
<p>	Let me digress a moment and comment further on that. I think the Clinton Administration generally has been too unilateral in its approach to trade and often has been too knee-jerk confrontational in its style--a style which has not achieved results commensurate with its bluster. I suggest that we change our approach to trade negotiating. We should concentrate on a desired objective and then decide which tools and which negotiating style will best achieve the results we want. Talking tough to win political points at home is hardly a rational trade policy.
<p>	I also believe that the Chinese want a peaceful, stable world. Their primary objective right now is to industrialize and spread prosperity throughout their land. Wars and conflicts divert resources from this objective. Here is another area where I believe there is room for us to work with the Chinese, on non-proliferation concerns as well as on other strategic issues.
<p>	For other matters about which we have had disagreements in the past, we could look for items where we have a common interest and where we could agree. In those places where we cannot agree, we should still maintain a dialogue and make every effort to manage these problems.
<p>	Some predict the U.S. and China will become enemies over time. This is, of course, possible. But if it occurs, and I hope it does not, let us hope our policies--or lack thereof--do not contribute to such an outcome. Instead, our vision of the U.S.-China relationship ought to be rooted in making allies and friends of the Chinese. Withdrawing or doing nothing is simply not an option. An American presence is critical to maintaining a balance in Asia. Thus, the United States must remain engaged, both militarily and economically, in that part of the world.
<p>	We must keep in mind, too, that many in China are concerned about the deteriorating relationship with the U.S. Despite what we might think some days, the Chinese people admire America. They covet our products and much about our way of life. This is underscored by the fact that so many of them want to come here and send their children here to school.
<p>	Much work needs to be done to repair the U.S.-China relationship. The best way to promote progress is to stay engaged, to encourage China's economic reform and integration into the world community. To do this, we need to exercise the best diplomatic judgment and skills, to disagree with the Chinese when we must, be tough-minded when necessary, but do so in the context of fostering an important friendship. We need to encourage, cajole, and coax the Chinese forward instead of blustering, threatening, and shouting at them in public as the Clinton Administration has been doing. Above all, we need to treat our Chinese friends as we would any other friends: with dignity and fairness.
<p>	The road will not be easy. The Chinese, caught up in the process of great change, at times will be difficult. They will do things we do not agree with. We need to handle these matters in the context of our broader objective.
<p>	China has made astonishing progress in the past 17 years. If that progress toward economic reforms, prosperity, and a general opening up of the country continues for the next 17 years, China will indeed be perceived as a great power. The American people need to learn this. They must become better educated and more aware of what is going on in China today.
<p>	We cannot turn our back on the possibility of helping free markets and democracy along in China. If we are short-sighted and fail to adopt a long-term vision about our relationship, if we continue our current schizophrenic approach to China policy, who knows what direction change could take? The U.S. and the world cannot afford to take this risk.

<h3>LET THE U.S.-JAPAN SEMICONDUCTOR AGREEMENT EXPIRE </h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 277<br>
May 30, 1996<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p>

(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 805, "The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement: Keeping Up the Managed    Trade Agenda," January 24, 1991.) 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Clinton Administration and some Members of Congress argue that the decades old U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement has helped save America's ailing semiconductor industry and increase previously slumping sales in Japan. They are wrong. The semiconductor agreement, signed in 1986 by the Reagan Administration, nearly destroyed America's computer industry, forced higher prices on American consumers, and has had little to do with the U.S. industry's rebound in this crucial technology. The President and Congress should let this agreement expire as scheduled on July 31, 1996.

<p>
<b>The 1986 Agreement</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The United States and Japan agreed in 1986 to monitor foreign semiconductor market share in Japan. There were two reason for this. First, the U.S. industry complained that Japan was protecting its semiconductor market from foreign competition. Thus, they argued, the U.S. was not selling as many semiconductors in Japan as it could. Second, the U.S. industry argued that Japanese semiconductor manufacturers were selling these products in the U.S. at prices below their cost of production.1  The result was the 1986 trade agreement with Japan, which sought to monitor both the level of foreign semiconductor market share in Japan and the prices of Japanese semiconductors sold in the U.S. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Some supporters of the semiconductor agreement argue that it established a "guarantee" by which foreign semiconductor manufacturers are granted a 20 percent market share in Japan. If foreign market share falls below the 20 percent figure, the U.S. and others can impose trade sanctions on Japan. Yet the 1986 agreement makes no such guarantee. In fact, the market share number is based on a secret side letter that the Japanese government supposedly sent the U.S., stating that it would work to help American companies achieve higher market share in Japan. The U.S. treated the Japanese pledge as binding, but the Japanese were more ambiguous, preferring to make it in private. The Japanese government refuses to confirm the existence of this side letter.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Unsatisfied with America's slow progress on increasing market share in Japan, the Reagan Administration had imposed some $4 billion in penalties on the Japanese industry in the mid-1980s. Most of these penalties were suspended in 1986. The Reagan Administration, however, applied some $165 million in retaliatory duties to Japanese imports in 1987. The Japanese were compelled to raise prices for their semiconductors sold in the U.S. in order to avoid the imposition of special tariffs and duties resulting from U.S. antidumping investigations. As a result, Japanese computer chips cost American computer manufacturers 30 percent to 40 percent more in the late 1980s than before the agreement. Personal computer prices shot up drastically in the late 1980s, almost destroying America's competitiveness in this crucial high-tech product area.

<p>
<b>The 1991 Agreement</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
When the semiconductor agreement expired in 1991, it was clear that foreign market share had grown only marginally in Japan, from about 9 percent in 1986 to only 14 percent. Nevertheless, the Bush Administration sought to extend the agreement for five more years. This time, the strategy was different. Rather than focus on numerical targets and guaranteed market shares, the Administration backed off the claim that the 20 percent market share number was a guarantee which, if not met, could invoke sanctions. The Administration sought to include a reference to the 20 percent foreign market share figure, but both it and the Japanese government specified that this figure was not a guarantee. The 1991 agreement states:<blockquote>

	<p>The Government of Japan recognizes that the U.S. semiconductor industry expects that the foreign market share will grow to more than 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992 and considers that this can be realized. The two Governments agree that the above statements constitute neither a guarantee, a ceiling, nor a floor on the foreign market share.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Thus, the 1991 agreement should have removed any doubt that the 20 percent foreign market share figure was to be used as a benchmark in measuring the openness of the Japanese market to foreign semiconductors. Yet, despite the text in the negotiated agreement, both the U.S. government and U.S. semiconductor industry continued to focus almost exclusively on this number, leading many economists to call this a managed trade agreement. Even so, the agreement paved the way for U.S. and Japanese firms to enter joint ventures. Both the U.S. and Japanese agreed not to enforce strict antitrust laws which could stifle such relationships, and to sponsor meetings between U.S. and Japanese companies to arrange such relationships. These joint ventures were beginning to occur, even without the agreement, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They would continue to occur without the agreement. After the 1991 agreement, instead of promoting the use of numerical targets, the Bush Administration focused on private sector solutions. The foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market has increased from 14 percent in 1991 to more than 29 percent today.

<p>
<b>The Cause of U.S. Success </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The U.S. semiconductor industry is more competitive and prosperous today than it was before the U.S.-Japan agreement. It now is the world's largest producer of semiconductors. The question is: How much does this success have to do with the agreement, and how much is the result of market forces and the sound business decisions of private companies?  The answer is simple: America's renewed success in Japan has occurred because of private sector initiatives by U.S. and Japanese companies to work together, and despite the U.S. government's managed trade policies.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The 1991 agreement emphasized the use of "long-term relationships between Japanese semiconductor purchasers and foreign capital-affiliated producers, including joint product development with Japanese customers."  This statement gave rise to an avalanche of trans-Pacific strategic alliances or joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese semiconductor companies. Some of these alliances could have been challenged under America's antiquated antitrust laws. But the emphasis on joint ventures in the agreement eased the concerns of many U.S. companies seeking partnerships with Japanese firms. In 1991, for example, there were fewer than a dozen such partnerships between U.S. and Japanese companies. Three years later, in 1994, there were more than three dozen.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Located in Japan, many of these alliances gave U.S. firms direct access to Japan's complex distribution system, advanced manufacturing techniques, and new and innovative marketing techniques. Moreover, they allowed U.S. and Japanese firms to pool resources, thereby reducing the research and development costs of new and advanced semiconductor products, and helped U.S. firms gain access to the Japanese semiconductor market. U.S.-Japanese joint ventures and strategic alliances therefore are the principal reason not only for America's regaining its role as the largest producer of semiconductors in the world, but also for America's increased market share in Japan.

<p>
<b>Misguided Focus on Market Share </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The semiconductor agreement is both a failure and an unwise policy. It is based on a fundamental misconception about trade: that because Country A's market share in Country B is significantly lower than Country A's global market share, Country B must have a closed market.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
This assumption is fallacious. Japan has 47 percent of the world market in semiconductors, excluding North America, but only 23 percent market share in semiconductors in North America. Japan also has 33 percent of the world market share in microprocessors, excluding North America, but only 6 percent share of the microprocessor market in North America. Few would argue that the North American (including the U.S.) semiconductor or microprocessor market is closed to Japan. American computer companies dominate the U.S. market because they are more competitive than the Japanese, not because the U.S. government protects them from competition.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
There is a danger that extending the semiconductor agreement could cause the U.S. to be held to the same standard of market openness as it expects of Japan. If other countries were to decide that America is closed, they could retaliate by imposing tariffs and duties on America's exports, further harming U.S. businesses and threatening American jobs. Under these circumstances, the U.S. would have no ground on which to stand against foreign retaliation.

<p>
<b>Objectives Fulfilled</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Even if the semiconductor agreement's goal was to give foreigners a 20 percent share of the Japanese semiconductor market, as its supporters contend, this goal has been exceeded, thanks largely to U.S.-Japanese joint ventures and strategic alliances. Today the foreign market share for semiconductors in Japan is over 29 percent. Moreover, while total foreign sales of semiconductors in Japan in 1986 amounted to only $900 million, foreign sales today are worth over $6 billion -- a sevenfold increase.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Clinton Administration believes that the recent success of America's semiconductor industry is the result of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. It is not. The U.S. semiconductor industry is successful today because it sought joint ventures with Japanese firms which gave American companies access to the Japanese market, advanced manufacturing techniques, and reduced research and development costs. The semiconductor agreement sets a bad precedent by focusing on market share numbers. If other countries applied the same policy to the U.S., many of America's exports could faced increased tariffs abroad. The President should let the agreement expire.

<p><li>While the U.S. International Trade Commission found that many Japanese companies were selling their semiconductors in the U.S. at prices below their production costs, there is little evidence that this was done to undercut the prices of U.S. producers. Instead, it was more the result of intensive competition within Japan and a drop in demand for personal computers in the mid-1980s, which caused the prices for semiconductors to fall rapidly. In order to cut their losses, many Japanese semiconductor firms which had overproduced and had bulging inventories sought to cut their losses by quickly selling off their stockpiles of semiconductors.

<title>Trade Secrets: Global Markets Spur Toledo's Turnaround - Policy Review - May-June 96</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h2>Trade Secrets<br>
<i>Global markets spur Toledo's turnaround</i></h2>
<p>
<b>By Christopher Garcia</b> <p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>May-June 1996, Number 77</i> <hr width=50%></center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If we didn't have international trade, we'd lose jobs," says Bob Babcock, a sorter at Sauder Woodworking Co. in Toledo, Ohio. Babcock had been laid off for 18 months before finding uninterrupted employment at Sauder, which exports to 70 countries worldwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"If we can't win in the international market, then something is wrong with us," adds Harry Eschedor, an employee at New Mather Metals, Inc., a Japanese-owned firm in Toledo.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 Even union leaders agree. "Everybody has to have free trade -- it's a global market," says Ron Conrad, United Auto Workers unit chairman at Chrysler's Jeep assembly plant in Toledo. "Our philosophy is not Pat Buchanan's philosophy."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Holy Toledo! Isn't this Ohio city the kind of blue-collar, ethnic town that was supposed to falter in a world of computerization and global competition? Didn't Toledoans watch thousands of auto-parts jobs flee overseas in the late 1970s? Weren't they handed pink slips when Owen-Illinois and Owens-Corning downsized in the 1980s? Weren't they jarred by the takeover of glassmaker Libbey-Owens-Ford by Britain's Pilkington? And isn't this the Toledo whose unemployment rate soared to 12.6 percent in 1982? In short, isn't this the kind of Rust Belt community that economic nationalists want to protect with a wall of tariffs and protective barriers? What's going on?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Trade, trade, trade. Refusing to turn its back on the world, Toledo has turned rust to riches by exploiting international trade opportunities. As a result, employment has reached a 25-year high, unemployment has plummeted to 4.8 percent, manufacturing jobs are growing at 7 percent a year, and waiting lists have formed for the 300-500 new housing units under construction downtown. Meanwhile, community life is flourishing -- from taverns to bowling alleys to Rotary Clubs. Notwithstanding the griping of economic nationalists, Toledoans are proving that exports and imports translate into more than just low prices and expanded consumer choice. They mean good jobs at good wages and vibrant, healthy American communities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Evidence of Toledo's global efforts can be found everywhere. In 1991, Burlington Air Express located its international hub in this northwest Ohio city. Burlington now employs 1,000 Toledoans and ships two million pounds of air freight a day from Toledo to destinations including Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. In 1993 Toledo created an International Studies Center to teach students and businessmen Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Polish, Russian, and Spanish. Says Joe Rutherford, a former assistant superintendent of schools, "Learning foreign languages is part of our economic-development strategy."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At the center of Toledo's comeback stands Chrysler's Jeep plant. Originally built in the 1880s, this factory is the oldest continuously operating auto-assembly plant in the United States -- and looks it. An antique brick smoke stack, still belching smoke, bears the name of Willys-Overland, the plant's one-time occupant and long-forgotten jeep inventor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the plant's time-worn exterior belies its vitality. Inside, scores of Jeep workers busily inspect Jeep Cherokees under a banner that reads, "The customer is our final inspector." The final inspector for many of these Cherokees will be Japanese. Or Chinese. Or Egyptian. This year the plant will ship 40,000-50,000 Cherokees, or 30 percent of its total production, to 130 international destinations. And these figures do not include exports to Canada, whose market is so integrated with our own that it is not measured separately. Nor does it include the completed but disassembled Jeeps the plant will ship to China, Egypt, Venezuela, and Argentina.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The plant almost closed in the mid-1980s. "We had let our guard down a bit," explains Toledo Mayor Carleton Finkbeiner. "We had become comfortable with our market share, but our days of domination were over." International competitors were beating the overalls off of American automakers, and Chrysler could not afford to operate Jeep factories in both Toledo and Kenosha, Wisconsin.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our plant generated more workmen's compensation costs than the rest of the Chrysler assembly plants combined," admits Ron Conrad of the UAW. To boost production, Jeep workers have slashed workmen's comp costs and lost-time injuries by 41 percent since 1990, and have cut employees' grievances from 1,665 in 1985 to 30 today. Workers at Jeep have even initiated a Product Quality Improvement (PQI) program in which Jeep employees work in teams (there are now 282) to identify ways to cut costs and generate efficiencies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thanks to its higher productivity, this plant survived to become the first American auto plant to produce right-hand-drive vehicles for Japanese and European markets. In 1995, the plant shipped 30,000 right-hand-drive Cherokees overseas, up from 18,000 in 1994. This year it will send 12,000 to Japan, 25,000 to Europe, and thousands more to Australia. Jeep has shaped up to ship out: Exports constitute this plant's fastest-growing market.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such success benefits the local economy, not just Chrysler's shareholders. "We have used the growth in the export market to grow our plant," says Gerald Huber, a Toledo plant manager  until his recent promotion. A plant that in 1973 employed approximately 3,000 Toledoans now employs 5,600. Workers earn $45,000-$50,000 a year, on average, and were rewarded for their efforts in 1994 with $8,000 profit-sharing checks.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Jeep's recovery has been a boon for community life on Toledo's historically Polish North Side. A shop called Cakes, Candies, and Crafts is doing a thriving business teaching locals how to make <I>pierogi</I> (Polish dumplings). Betty and David's restaurant, located across the street from St. Wojciecha's church, serves one of the best breakfasts in town to a full house every morning. Real estate is "as good or better than it's ever been," says Brent Gagn, who has sold real estate in Toledo since 1971. In the mid-1980s joblessness made it difficult for people to qualify for a mortgage, and seller-assisted financing constituted 75 percent of Gagn's business. Today's buyers get mortgages on their own. And two of the North Side's most venerable institutions, Central Catholic High School and St. Vincent's Medical Center, recently made capital investments that will keep them in the North Side well into the next century.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	John Henry Fullin, a North Side resident, talks about "an explosion of people getting involved to make things better." North Side denizens, for example, have devised a community-policing program that has reduced crime 42 percent. And many residents have become involved in Toledo's volunteer-based Sister Cities program with foreign cities. Through Sister Cities, residents established a Jeep dealership in Szeged, Hungary, that now imports Jeeps from the Toledo plant.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Jeep is not the only company in the greater Toledo area to have hitched its wagon to the global market, nor is the North Side the only Toledo community to reap the benefits of international trade. Companies throughout the region demonstrate that imports and foreign direct investment, in addition to exports, can benefit communities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	New Mather Metals produces stabilizer bars, which control automobile suspension systems during cornering. It has been a staple on the North Side for 80 years. In 1987, the company employed 70 workers. It now employs 175, and its growth shows no sign of slowing. The plant recently purchased two pieces of property and plans to add four new production lines, or 20 new jobs. While New Mather ships a small percentage of its stabilizer bars directly overseas, its domestic customers install a large percentage of New Mather's bars in cars intended for overseas markets.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Sauder Woodworking Co., situated west of town, is the world's largest manufacturer of ready-to-assemble (RTA) furniture. RTA furniture is made of particle board that is covered with micropaper laminate to give it the appearance of genuine oak or cherrywood. Approximately 260 Sauder workers owe their jobs to exports, and international sales, which have skyrocketed 400 percent the last five years, will soon enable Sauder to add 750,000 square feet of factory space to its existing facility.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Delta, an industrial suburb, a primarily residential landscape is being interrupted by the construction of a $425-million steel mini-mill. The mill will recycle scrap steel from junked cars and appliances and will generate 350 jobs and $16 million in payroll. A portion of the steel processed at this mill will be exported to Canada, helping revise America's recent record as a steel importer.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Imports and foreign direct investment are essential to these businesses. Delta's mini-mill, for example, is a joint venture between a privately held American firm and Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) of Australia. New Mather Metals, on the other hand, is entirely foreign-owned. It was bought in 1987 by NHK Spring of Yokahama, Japan, to supply Japanese car makers. And in a business where a table is often judged by its cover, Sauder imports from Japan the micropaper it uses to cover its furniture. New Mather also imports: Nearly all of its equipment comes from Japan. Jobs at Sauder, New Mather, and Northstar/BHP are bound up with either foreign money, foreign imports, or both.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As with the Jeep plant, the success of these companies in the global market affects the communities around them. Just ask Anne Summers, who owns a bar called The Village Tavern in Delta. "If you drink in this town, I probably know you," she boasts. But Summers twice considered closing her doors in the 1980s, because factory closings emptied her bar stools. Now business is booming. With a gleam in her eye, she reports that contractors will employ 3,000 workers this summer to complete construction of the mill. Summers is also excited that her two grandchildren will benefit from a new computer lab Northstar/BHP has installed in the local public elementary school.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Back in Toledo, a different small business is feeling the effects of the export-led surge in employment. Tony Packo's, a restaurant made famous by the 1970s hit sitcom M*A*S*H and well known for its Hungarian hot dogs, has served the Hungarian community for more than 60 years. Antique signs bearing the names of companies from Toledo's industrial past, like Champion, remind visitors that Packo's has seen the best and worst of Toledo's fortunes. Diana Chastien, a Packo's manager, has just hired five new employees and plans to hire more. She attributes a recent surge in the establishment's business to the turnaround in the Toledo economy. She has also noticed that Hungarians who had moved out of the community during the downturn in the 1980s are moving back.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even bowling seems to be affected. Bowling in Toledo had declined during the lean 1980s, when cheaper forms of entertainment, like video rentals, became popular, but has held its own in the 1990s. Larry Nworowski, the president of the Greater Toledo Bowling Association, reports that leagues will even gain a couple of hundred bowlers this year. Approximately 25,000 Toledoans bowl in league play -- out of a total metropolitan population of 750,000. In Toledo, it seems, citizens don't bowl alone.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In fact, everywhere you turn in Toledo international trade seems to be leaving its imprint. Demand for hotel rooms is up 20 percent from last year. Kevin Mann, a clerk at the Fairfield Inn, attributes full occupancy there to "international types." Convention business is also booming. In February, Toledo hosted the International Air Cargo convention. And international companies are supporting philanthropic causes like the revitalization of the century-old Valentine Theater and the construction of a center for science and industry.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The volume of international freight passing through Toledo is one final but important sign of the impact of trade on Toledo. The port of Toledo exported 2.8 million tons of freight to Canada, Japan, Europe, and Africa last year. Five thousand people earn $110 million in payroll in jobs related to the port's trade activities. Sauder itself sends 105 truckloads of furniture out a week, a good portion of which is destined for international markets. And trucks will line up all year to carry 50,000 Cherokees to all international points.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Toledo isn't the only American community prospering thanks to international trade. International powerhouses Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Hills Pet Products have helped create 12,000 jobs in Topeka, Kansas, since 1988. John Deere's Augusta, Georgia, tractor plant expanded its payroll 50 percent last year while importing parts from 10 countries and exporting tractors to 33. In Priest River, Idaho, Hartford Communications, a firm that refurbishes telephone systems and whose export sales are growing 50 percent a year, is hiring unemployed lumber workers. And in Rochester, New Hampshire, the state's second-largest employer, Cabletron, which will derive 50 percent of its revenues from exports by 1997, is hiring five Rochesterites a day. The list goes on.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But protectionist doomsayers insist that American communities like these can't survive without tariff and quota walls -- a kind of government-enforced affirmative-action program for U.S.-made goods. It seems of little consequence to them that America has become the world's largest exporter under a free trade regime. U.S. exports have grown more than 45 percent in the last 10 years and 12 million Americans now work in export-dependent jobs. Trade free of government interference is vital to the millions of Americans and thousands of American communities benefiting from it. Says New Mather's Eschedor, "Protectionist countries only push their people backwards. Our jobs, our prosperity, and our future depend on free trade."<p>

<title>Eight Good Reasons to Continue MFN for China - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3>EIGHT GOOD REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 449<br>
April 30, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent crisis in the Taiwan Strait has reignited the annual debate over whether to continue China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status. As the debate heats up, Washington policymakers should consider carefully the reasons why continuing MFN for China serves U.S. interests. While granting MFN status does not solve all of America's problems with China, revoking it causes more problems than it solves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are eight prinipal reasons why Congress should approve an extension of MFN status for China.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #1:</b> Revoking MFN will harm those America wants to help. Discontinuing MFN status for China would harm U.S. workers. The U.S. exported over $12 billion of goods and services to China in 1995, and American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #2:</b> Revoking MFN would threaten U.S. business and investment. The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated that China will require nearly $750 billion in new investments to fund new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies should be getting the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment. The result will be American jobs lost to competitors overseas.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #3:</b> Revoking MFN would jeopardize economic reform in China. The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of one quarter of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to encourage the further opening of China's economy and society. To be sure, MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but at least it keeps China open to influences and pressures from the outside world.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #4:</b> Revoking MFN would harm the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong. The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong is heavily dependent on investment and export production in China. Abandoning MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. It also would harm Taiwan's economy. Billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by current tensions with China. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by countries the U.S. seeks to support -- Hong Kong and Taiwan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #5:</b> Revoking MFN will not improve human rights conditions in China. History shows that China is far more oppressive against its people when isolated from the outside world. This was clearly the case during the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #6:</b> Revoking MFN will not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction. China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The MTCR monitors and controls missile components and capabilities, while the NPT is a framework for control and reduction of nuclear weapons. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan and criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to such unstable regimes as those in Pakistan and Iran. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. The U.S. must investigate the recent allegations of missile sales to Pakistan, and it has every right to ask China to explain itself. If such sales have taken place, American law dictates that technology and commercial sanctions be imposed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be specific and targeted on the responsible Chinese enterprise, to avoid jeopardizing unrelated U.S. activities in China, rather than targeted on all U.S.-financed projects in China, as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial transaction with China. In this area, MFN is simply the wrong tool.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #7:</b> MFN is not special treatment. MFN trade status is a fundamental principle on which the World Trade Organization operates. The WTO is the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. MFN is the normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries. In the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, it is the foundation of basic international commercial relations. Discontinuing MFN to China is tantamount to imposing trade sanctions on China. Such sanctions should be imposed only when a country poses a special threat to American security. As difficult as China now is, it does not present such a threat.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #8:</b> Revoking MFN would set the U.S. on the road to confrontation with China. Abandoning MFN for China would lead to Beijing's isolation, making it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States and its allies to deal effectively with nuclear weapons proliferation, unfair trade practices, and human rights violations, China must be engaged, not an enemy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even though the U.S. should continue MFN trade status for China, however, it should not ignore Beijing's recent bellicose actions against Taiwan. To demonstrate displeasure with Beijing's missile diplomacy against Taiwan, and to reward Taiwan once it meets economic criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization, the U.S. should expedite Taiwan's bid to join the WTO ahead of the PRC. In the past, China has insisted that the PRC should accede to the WTO ahead of, or at the same time as, Taiwan. The U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for Taiwan's entry into the WTO, even in the face of China's determined opposition.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China, but it would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. Most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<h3>Beyond Rhetoric: A Renewed U.S. Commitment To Hemispheric Free Trade</h3>

By Cresencio Arcos<br>
April 8, 1996

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the Italian adventurer Amerigo Vespucci landed on the eastern coast of South America, he never could have imagined that the entire Hemisphere one day would carry his name. Nor could he have envisioned what we see today -- that after 500 years of starkly different histories among its many nations, the Hemisphere finally may be finding a common future. There is, however, no guarantee that Vespucci's Americas will realize their full potential. In fact, it is more accurate to say there are far more roadblocks ahead of us than those we have already cleared away. History may well look back on the '90s in the Americas as a decade of opportunities lost. I strongly hope this is not the case, but recent events do not engender confidence that we are well on the road to a robust commercial and economic integration of the Americas. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This is all the more frustrating given that the U.S. has the power and the influence, if it wishes to use them, to be a force for positive change in the Americas. Our market dwarfs all others in the Hemisphere, and is arguably more open than any other country's, with perhaps the exception of Chile's in some areas. This huge U.S. market is extremely attractive to Latin American countries and can give us enormous leverage in opening markets in the region. However, we are on the verge of losing this strategic advantage by shirking our role as the natural leader in promoting economic liberalization.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It does not have to be this way. There is still time for the U.S. to alter its course and reassert itself. But in order for us to do that, we must take an honest look at what has gone wrong and how to fix it. First, a look at what has gone wrong. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Contrary to the many accounts that the vision of the Summit of the Americas (in reference to the Hemispheric Summit in Miami in 1994) is being fulfilled, the Hemispheric trade agenda is in a holding pattern. That nothing of tremendous substance came out of the Cartagena meetings should be of no surprise. In fact, that they even agreed to meet again next year to continue the dialogue should give us great cause to celebrate. There are several reasons why the Hemispheric trade agenda at this moment appears to be a rudderless ship, being pulled here and there by the daily tides: the peso crisis in Mexico, election year politics in the U.S., and the increased influence of Brazil in promoting a Hemispheric trade regime different from the NAFTA.
<p>
<b>U.S. RETREAT AFTER NAFTA</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Coming off an all-time high from the negotiation and passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we perhaps overlooked the fact that there would be bumps in the road and occasional setbacks. So when the peso crisis hit Mexico in December 1994, the free trade opponents like Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan said it only showed that they were right all along -- Mexico was just waiting to trick the U.S. into signing the NAFTA so it could devalue the peso and flood the U.S. with Mexican goods. Of course, it didn't show that at all. In fact, without a NAFTA the U.S. would have seen its exports to Mexico drop by over 50 percent, like it did in 1982 when Mexico devalued, instead of the 17 percent drop we experienced last year. But the Perot/Buchanan accusations were superficially appealing, and so they stuck, and politicians in the U.S. began to worry about coming out too strongly in favor of trade in the Americas. Then the economic situation in Mexico deteriorated rapidly and the U.S. came to their aid as the leader of a $48 billion loan guarantee package. This had the unintended consequence of splitting the free trade coalition in Congress (many of the supporters of the NAFTA were opposed to the loan guarantees), and placing the Clinton Administration in the unenviable position of defending the loan guarantees during an election year in which the vast majority of Americans opposed the loan package. From that time forward it was apparent that we would see little if any action from Congress or the White House to advance the FTAA until after the elections, in 1997. When the election cycle kicked into high gear several months ago, it became even more apparent that free trade would be under attack when Pat Buchanan made trade the focus of his political campaign. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With the U.S. stepping back, a political vacuum was created in the Hemisphere. This vacuum has now been partially filled by the ascendance of the Brazilians, who favor a "go slow" approach to an FTAA. They believe that NAFTA-styled free trade would hurt Latin American countries, and instead have proposed a South American free trade agreement first, which would then be able to negotiate with the U.S. on much more so-called favorable terms. I say so-called favorable, because that type of a trading regime most likely would not be favorable to U.S. businesses, nor do I believe it would be favorable to South American economies in the long run. It would, however, most likely be favorable to the economic interests of the status quo that I will describe later.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, as much as I am worried about the Brazilian initiative, I am far more troubled by the lack of U.S. leadership. After all, we are the ones holding most of the cards, and we cannot blame the Brazilians for pursuing their own interests once we have stepped back from the table. And although U.S. retrenchment may be understandable given our domestic political situation, we must realize this carries a price: namely, that Latin American countries will not unilaterally open their markets without reciprocity from the U.S. Ironically, the "opening" the U.S. needs to make is rather minor, given our already low tariffs and non-tariff barriers. But without providing a secure market for Latin American goods under a NAFTA-styled trade agreement, we will not be able to wrest political concessions from our Hemispheric trading partners. Why?  Because the commercial status quo is so hard to change. We only need to look at our own textile or agricultural industry to be convinced of that. 
<p>
<b>THE POLITICAL NATURE OF TRADE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Let's be honest, free trade is not good for everyone. It is not good for monopolies and it is not good for those seeking special favors or protections through government laws or regulators. Just to give you one example from my own industry. Up until just a few years ago, most local, long distance, and international telephone services in foreign countries were owned by government monopolies. In several countries in Latin America that still is the case. These monopolies produce poor service at high prices and reap windfall profits for doing so. In contrast, in Chile today telecommunications service is good, prices are down, and competition flourishes. In Argentina, competition in local service has also increased service, while its monopoly service for international long distance continues to keep prices well above market rates. So why don't the other Latin American countries quickly adopt the Chilean model?  Because there is more money to be made, and more political interests to be protected, by keeping things as they are. This rule works in Argentina and Mexico just like it works here in the U.S. In other words, although global competition may encourage market liberalization, the decision to open markets or keep them closed ultimately is a political one.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is neither good nor bad that market liberalization depends on politics. It is only bad when we fail to realize trade in this political context, and then wonder why our policies are ineffective. In other words, leaders in Latin America cannot place some of their protected industries in jeopardy under a free trade pact unless they can at the same time provide their competitive industries with access to our markets. The same political dynamic applied to President Clinton and Bob Dole when they sought passage of NAFTA. So if our agenda to create an FTAA by 2005 is seen in Latin America as harming more political and commercial interests than it helps, it will most likely be unacceptable. This is what is happening now. As Latin American politicians have come to believe we will not provide them the political cover they need -- consistent entry into the world's largest market through accession to NAFTA -- they have either postponed or withdrawn plans to make concessions to open their markets to our products and businesses.
<p>
<b>FOUR KEY AREAS OF U.S. TRADE POLICY </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Assuming we can once again commit ourselves to this agenda, there are four areas on which we need to focus our efforts as we attempt to create an FTAA. They are: 1) intellectual property rights, 2) procurement, 3) competition policy, and 4) services, and a fifth issue that covers all of them -- transparency. Let me describe the challenges we at AT&T and U.S. businesses face in each area. 
<p>
<b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although most of the debate of IPR has centered on the pharmaceutical company, there is much more at stake. Lax or nonexistent enforcement of intellectual property rights robs U.S. businesses of billions of dollars worldwide. The growing U.S. software and entertainment industries and what could be termed its emerging "information-based" industries are not protected in many Latin American countries. Although some Latin American countries believe they are benefiting from this lax enforcement, they are undermining a respect for property rights in general, and that will ultimately undermine the growth of their own nascent technology-based industries.
<p>
<b>Procurement</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Procurement of government services plays a much larger role in Latin American economies than it does in the U.S., with some Latin American governments controlling directly or indirectly the majority of the spending power in the country. And although the issue of procurement in the trade arena has generally dealt with how government contracts would be awarded, the telecommunications industry is particularly interested in a broader definition. The telecommunications industry is such a highly regulated field that its very existence depends on a clear and concise regulatory regime in the awarding of government contracts -- that is, in the awarding of concessions for the right to provide a wide range of telecommunications services. Our trade negotiators must attempt to remove any barriers that would prevent U.S. businesses from getting a fair chance in bidding on these "contracts." 
<p>
<b>Services</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The services industry in the U.S. employs far more workers than any other sector of the economy. And a larger percentage of our exports are now in services. Over 20 percent of exports to Latin America are in services, and that number would be much higher if we were provided all the protections our industries are provided here in the U.S. In Latin America many services industries, like telecommunications and financial services, still are considered "strategic," and as such are controlled by the government. In many Latin American countries, foreign investment is limited to a minority stake. For example, Brazil is liberalizing its telecommunications industry by allowing competition in cellular phone services. However, it is limiting foreign investment in those projects to 49 percent. If it maintains that restriction, it will limit the ability of AT&T and other U.S. companies to invest; but it will also limit the ability of the Brazilians to have the most advanced and well capitalized telecommunications system available. Lifting all restrictions on foreign investment would truly be a win/win proposition for both parties. A Brazilian official recently mentioned that his government might change this limitation. This is encouraging, and we hope the changes are made, but the U.S. would be in a much better position to influence the outcome if it were actively engaged in the process. 
<p>
<b>Competition Policy</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Competition policy is perhaps the most important area of interest. It was finally included as a legitimate subject of inquiry at Cartagena, when a working group was formed to study its implications. Broadly defined, competition policy is a set of principles that will foster competition at the local as well as international level. One of those principles is the creation and protection of long-term property rights, including contract rights. This requires a judicial process where contracts are respected and enforced. Contracts that extend beyond a five-year period are rare in Latin America, and you will hardly ever find contracts beyond ten years. This is mainly because businesses and people in the region have little confidence that their governments will respect property rights over the long term. In the case of AT&T, we have had an ongoing problem with contractual obligations we have entered into with various government or private sector monopoly phone companies. In international telecommunications, calls traditionally have been delivered by international carriers, like AT&T, which must hand off telephone traffic to the monopoly carrier in the foreign country. The payments regime for these "hand-offs" is known as the accounting rates process. Historically, accounting rates have not reflected market rates, with monopoly foreign carriers reaping windfall profits. AT&T and other U.S. foreign carriers are in the process of renegotiating contracts with these foreign carriers to get these rates down, but many of these carriers use their monopoly position to violate their contract rights or discriminate against U.S. carriers in violation of prior agreements. We should include strong provisions for the respect for property rights and the adjudication of property rights disputes in any trade agreement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Another aspect of competition policy deals with the elimination of monopolies. In the case of accounting rates, monopoly carriers have the power to reduce the profitability of AT&T and other U.S. carriers, and thus the ability of our companies to create wealth and jobs here in America. Monopoly foreign telecommunications carriers also raise the prices for U.S. customers who end up subsidizing the programs of the foreign monopolies, such as lower domestic rates in the foreign country. The result is often poor quality and limited services for both U.S. and Latin American customers. U.S. carriers must pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually in settlement payments to these Latin American carriers, with few benefits flowing to the customer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As liberalization occurs in Latin America, competition policy will play an even larger role as the regulatory issues become more complicated and subtle. The telecommunications industry is a perfect example of this. As foreign governments allow competition in international long distance, the big issue now is how will the costs for interconnection into the local network be decided. In Mexico, we see this very process going on today. AT&T and the other international carriers are preparing to enter the Mexican long distance market. We are asking to interconnect with the local monopoly at what we believe is a cost-based rate. However, there is a great disparity between what the long distance carriers believe is a cost-based rate and the current position of the telephone monopoly. We obviously don't agree on what the rate should be at this time, but that is why competition policy becomes so important. As markets are liberalized, businesses become ever more susceptible to market pricing, and so our cost structure must realistically reflect what the market demands. AT&T CEO Bob Allen has taken some harsh criticism recently about his decision to lay off thousands of workers in what people are describing as heartless and unnecessary. But as economist and <I>Washington Post</I> writer James Glassman said recently, AT&T must change because it cannot survive with its old monopolistic structure -- it is no longer a monopoly. We fight for market share on a daily basis against companies like MCI and Sprint that continue to grow. As competition in telecommunications increased here in the U.S., it became imperative to operate the company on a cost-based structure. In fact, critics five years from now may well say the restructuring was not radical enough. Consequently, since most U.S. businesses work under these exacting conditions of the market, we must insist that equal competition exists in the countries with which we will be trading under an FTAA. So our trade negotiators must insist on including mechanisms in any future FTAA
 that will limit the discretion of governments to impose political criteria on what needs to be a cost-based, market-driven process. In this particular case, that would mean establishing a clear set of rules and standards for cost-based interconnection fees. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To show how active U.S. engagement can make a difference in this particular area, we can look to Mexico. Because of our close relationship with Mexico through NAFTA, Mexico has recently announced it will follow an FCC-styled bidding process for the allocation of PCS services throughout Mexico. This process establishes a clear set of rules and procedures for bidding, and requires an open process.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There is one other area that tends to influence all commercial activities in Latin America, but does not clearly fit into any of the categories above. That is the issue of transparency. Until all government decisions are open to public scrutiny there will always be room for corruption and behind-the-scenes deals. This environment may help a select few businesses with the right connections, but it harms the economy overall and it is extremely inefficient because it injects uncertainty into the commercial transaction. This way of doing business has serious costs for U.S. businesses. The Department of Commerce recently concluded that since 1994 there have been over 100 instances of foreign firms using bribery to undercut U.S. firms' efforts to win international contracts worth roughly $45 billion. Foreign firms that bribe win bids approximately 80 percent of the time. U.S. trade negotiators must establish clear and concise rules of commercial conduct when governments are involved, and we must insist on opening up the process to public scrutiny. 
<p>
<b>REVIVING THE TRADE AGENDA</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So how do we bring about these very difficult changes in Latin America?  We do it through active and aggressive engagement. We do it by showing the American people why we need Hemispheric free trade to remain internationally competitive. We do it by showing how free trade can be a win/win for those who are not seeking special favors from governments. We don't do it by folding our hands and talking a good line about how everyone wins under free trade. We don't do it by failing to reward those countries, like Chile, that have done their utmost to open their markets. Chile is the crown jewel of Latin America. Many sectors of its economy are more open than ours. Its international telecommunications industry is so competitive, there have been times this year when it was cheaper to call from New York to Santiago, than from New York to Los Angeles. It has a strong democracy and a flourishing middle class. What kind of message do we send to the rest of Latin America when we fail to even engage Chile in negotiations? 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

What happened in Cartagena was inevitable given the direction of our current trade policy. But that direction can be altered with sufficient political will. One thing is certain. Good intentions by the U.S. are not enough. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

I met with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown in Nicaragua last week. I believe he is committed to free trade in the Americas, as is U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, but personal commitment is not enough. The forces against Hemispheric integration are simply too strong. And much more is at stake here than Hemispheric integration. U.S. global leadership rests on our ability to create a trading model at home, that we can then export to the rest of the world. Imagine how much more influence we would have with our Asian trading partners if we had just concluded a Hemisphere-wide, comprehensive, NAFTA-style FTAA?  The benefits would be enormous for U.S. businesses and the world economy as a whole.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But the reality today is that our trade agenda is still in a holding pattern. I sincerely hope we can remove the obstacles from the runway before we run out of gas.

<a href="#em">The Eminent Persons Group</a><br>
<a href="#asaka">Rescuing the Osaka Meeting</a><br>
<a href="#conc">Conclusion</a><br>
<hr>

If the budget battles with Congress do not keep him in Washington, President 
Bill Clinton will travel to Osaka, Japan, this weekend to meet with leaders 
from Asia and the Americas to discuss trade and investment in the Asia 
Pacific region. They will meet under the auspices of the forum for Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, an organization of Asian and 
Pacific Rim economies dedicated to liberalizing trade and investment.   The 
members of APEC have pledged to create a free trade and investment area in 
Asia and the Pacific Rim by 2020.
<P>
However, this dream may be shattered if China, Japan, and some other APEC 
members get their way. Their unwillingness to open their agricultural markets 
may suffocate the once-bright promise, made by APEC in 1994, to achieve 
"free and open trade and investment in the Asia Pacific" region. This would 
represent a severe setback for regional trade liberalization. President Clinton 
and the other leaders at the APEC summit should agree that liberalization will 
be comprehensive, including the liberalization of agricultural trade, or the 
hope for free trade in Asia may wither.
<P>
APEC's backsliding is mainly the fault of the Japanese. Unlike President 
Suharto of Indonesia, who hosted the Leaders' Meeting in 1994, Japanese 
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama has been unwilling to develop a 
consensus plan for making good on the promise of free trade which APEC 
made at its last meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, in 1994. Instead, the Japanese 
government has proposed that APEC members be permitted to exempt so-
called sensitive sectors of their economies from trade liberalization. 
According to the Japanese, the most sensitive sector of all is agriculture. 
China and some other Asian countries are siding with Japan against the U.S., 
while Australia and Canada, among others, support the American position.
<P>
APEC is critical to America's economic future. It serves an institutional link 
between the U.S. and the fast-growing Asian economies. It also is a hedge 
against the formation of an Asia-only trading bloc. APEC encompasses nearly 
50 percent of the world's population, 60 percent of its gross domestic product, 
and 40 percent of its trade flows. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with APEC 
members was $772 billion in 1994 -- 65.6 percent of worldwide U.S. trade or 
11.4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. In 1994, American investment in 
APEC economies was $202 billion, and APEC foreign investment in the U.S. 
was $163 billion. APEC's goal of free and open trade and investment is 
consistent with long-standing American policy supporting trade liberalization 
around the world.
<P>
Free trade and investment is too important to America's future to let APEC die 
because of irresponsible behavior in Japan and protectionism in other 
countries. Therefore, while in Osaka, President Clinton should:
<ul>
<li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Murayama that selective exemptions to APEC 
trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national 
interest in trade liberalization in Asia.
<P>
<li>Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and 
New Zealand to block Japan's protectionism. These leaders should urge Japan 
to accelerate implementing Uruguay Round trade liberalization commitments 
while seeking new agreements on antidumping, competition policy, product 
standards and testing, and investment protection.
<P>
<li>Make clear that blocking or delaying comprehensive APEC trade 
liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. Backsliding 
on free trade at Osaka could ring the death knell for APEC as an organization.
<P>
<li>Support Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization if the issue is 
raised bilaterally by the Taiwanese.
</ul><P>
<a name="bogor"></a>
JAPAN'S ACTIONS SINCE BOGOR
<P>
As host of this year's APEC Leaders' Meeting, Japan must chair all 
preparatory meetings and work with senior officials from all APEC members 
to develop a consensus on the summit's agenda. The main challenge is to 
decide how to implement the Bogor Declaration for free and open trade and 
investment in the Asia Pacific region for developed members by 2010 and for 
developing members by 2020.
<P>
The performance of Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in fulfilling 
this vital role has been unsatisfactory. Murayama's unpopular Socialist-Liberal 
Democrat coalition government has been unwilling to undertake any bold 
trade liberalization initiatives to move the APEC agenda forward. The 
Japanese government sought to deflect APEC away from trade liberalization 
in February 1995 by proposing a "Partners for Progress" scheme that would 
turn APEC into little more than a regional conduit for foreign aid. The 
proposal would have established a new secretariat that would coordinate 
foreign aid by advanced APEC members to less developed members such as 
China or Papua New Guinea. Senior officials from other APEC members 
condemned Japan's "Partners for Progress" scheme as an unnecessary 
duplication of existing aid programs and as a distraction from trade 
liberalization. As U.S. Ambassador to APEC Sandra Kristoff remarked in 
February 1995, "the proposal raised in our minds some questions about 
whether it was duplicating ODA  activities already happening elsewhere." 
<P>
Japan later withdrew its "Partners for Progress" proposals, but it has failed to 
offer concrete proposals for APEC trade liberalization. Instead of taking 
action this year, Japan has suggested merely that APEC members wait until 
1996 to table their proposals for "concerted unilateral" and "collective" action 
at the Leaders' Meeting in the Philippines. 
<P>
More ominously, Japan has proposed that APEC members be permitted to 
exempt sensitive sectors of their economies, such as agriculture in Japan or 
clothing manufacturing in the U.S., from APEC trade liberalization. The 
Japanese proposal has become a flash point dividing APEC into two warring 
camps. One camp is led by Japan, which is unwillingly to open its agricultural 
markets beyond the concessions made in the Uruguay Round agreements. 
Supporting Japan is China, which not only seeks to maintain agricultural 
sector barriers, but also wants to protect broad sectors of manufactured goods. 
In the other camp are Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the United 
States. These countries have vehemently rejected the Japanese proposal for 
exempting sectors from APEC trade liberalization. Most of the ASEAN 
countries, especially Indonesia and Singapore, also oppose Japan.
<P>
<a name="em"></a>
THE EMINENT PERSONS GROUP
<P>
During the last three years, the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) has provided 
APEC with a free trade vision and shaped its successful agenda. The EPG is 
an APEC-appointed advisory panel composed of one person from each APEC 
member and chaired by C. Fred Bergsten, a former U.S. Treasury official and 
executive director of the Washington-based Institute for International 
Economics.
<P>
In its first report, the EPG recommended "a bold, forward-looking and 
realistic vision for APEC: the progressive development of a community of 
Asia Pacific economies with free and open trade and investment."   The 
Leaders' Meeting near Seattle, Washington, in November 1993 accepted this 
challenge as APEC's goal. In its second report, the EPG recommended that 
"APEC now adopt a comprehensive program to realize the vision of free and 
open trade in the region... and complete the liberalization process by 2020."   
Responding to this challenge, the leaders agreed at their meeting in Bogor, 
Indonesia, on November 15, 1994, that APEC should achieve free and open 
trade and investment in the region by 2020.
<P>
On August 25, 1995, the EPG delivered its third annual report, Implementing 
the APEC Vision, recommending a series of practical steps to begin 
implementing the Bogor Declaration.
<P>
Step #1: Accelerating Uruguay Round Liberalization. The EPG suggests that 
all APEC members agree to accelerate the implementation of their Uruguay 
Round commitments based on the following principles:
<ul>
<li>Principle 1: Unlike preferential trade agreements such as the European Union 
or North America Free Trade Agreement whose trade liberalization benefits 
accrue to their members, APEC should offer the benefits of an accelerated 
liberalization timetable to all members of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), including those that are not members of APEC. In other words, 
APEC members would not discriminate against other countries in trade 
policy.
<P>
<li>Principle 2: APEC members should adopt a "50 percent rule" under which 
they would cut in half the time for lowering tariffs, removing non-tariff 
barriers, or reforming domestic laws. For example, developed APEC 
members could speed the timetable for Uruguay Round tariff cuts from the 
current four years on most products to two years. Developing APEC members 
could slash the period for phasing out non-agricultural subsidies from eight to 
four years. 
</ul><P>

Step #2: Broadening and Deepening the Uruguay Round Agreements. The 
EPG recommends that Uruguay Round agreements be broadened in the 
following four areas:
<ul>
<li>Antidumping. The EPG finds that antidumping laws have been abused to 
protect domestic firms at the expense of consumers. Antidumping 
proceedings are biased because they consider only the interests of import-
competing firms and their workers, but not the interests of consumers and 
domestic firms dependent on imported supplies for production. They also 
penalize foreign competitors for normal business practices. For example, the 
legal standard for proving a domestic firm guilty of predatory pricing is far 
more stringent in most countries than the legal standard for finding a foreign 
competitor guilty of dumping cheap goods on a domestic market. Thus, the 
same pricing policies that are legal for domestic firms may be held illegal for 
their foreign rivals under antidumping laws. This is pure protectionism. The 
EPG recommends that APEC leaders commit themselves to eliminating such 
abusive uses of antidumping policy.
<P>
<li>Competition Policy. Competition policy encompasses the regulation of 
monopolies, mergers, cartels, and government aid to business firms. Many of 
the trade disputes in Asia arise from differences over competition policy. For 
example, the recent automotive trade dispute with Japan centered on whether 
the keiretsu system of interlocking equity, debt financing, and personnel 
sharing among Japanese companies prevented American suppliers from 
selling their auto parts and cars to Japan. Because the WTO does not deal with 
competition policy, the EPG has called on APEC members to cooperate in 
applying competition policy laws to reduce their differences over time.
<P>
<li>Product Standards and Testing. Product standards and testing can be used as 
protectionist devices. For example, Japan has refused to accept U.S. test data 
on medical equipment and requires American suppliers to conduct another 
round of tests in Japan before certifying their products. Multiple testing can be 
expensive and may deter manufacturers from offering some products in 
certain markets. The EPG recommends that APEC should negotiate 
agreements on standards and testing. It also suggests that all APEC members 
should accept the test data and product certification of any one member, so 
long as they are based on internationally recognized standards.
<P>
<li>Investment Protection. Private-sector investment has produced rapid 
economic growth in the Asia Pacific region. Improving protections for foreign 
investors will help to sustain this growth. The EPG recommends that APEC 
members strengthen their protection of investment in the areas where they fall 
short of international norms. For example, APEC economies should adopt the 
rules followed by NAFTA countries that prohibit imposing restrictions on the 
transfer of funds related to foreign investment such as profits, dividends, 
royalties, loan payments, and liquidations in freely convertible currencies. 
Moreover, APEC should minimize the use of performance requirements such 
as local content or trade balancing rules.   Such rules are inconsistent with the 
new WTO Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures, which bans 
local content or trade balancing requirements. The EPG urges each member to 
adopt these accommodations and affirm them in a binding agreement among 
all APEC members.
</ul><P>
Step #3: Dispute Mediation Service. The EPG also has recommended that 
APEC create an official mechanism to settle regional trade clashes, to be 
known as the APEC Dispute Mediation Service. The EPG recognizes that 
many of the recent trade disputes in the Asia Pacific region involve subjects 
not covered by current WTO rules. One such subject is competition policy. 
The WTO has no jurisdiction to settle disputes in competition policy and 
other subjects that its rules do not cover. Had an APEC Dispute Mediation 
Service already been established, it could have helped diffuse the Japan-U.S. 
automotive trade wrangle that occurred earlier this year. By resolving disputes 
that the WTO cannot handle, an APEC Dispute Mediation Service would 
supplement and strengthen the WTO.

<a name="asaka"></a>
RESCUING THE OSAKA MEETING
<P>
The Japanese proposal for exempting certain sectors of the economy like 
agriculture would undermine the comprehensive free trade and investment 
regime envisioned by the Bogor Declaration. Once one member is permitted 
to exclude a sensitive sector, other members will follow suit with their own 
protectionist demands. If Japan gets its way, APEC free trade would be more 
the exception than the rule.
<P>
President Clinton must not let any country undermine APEC's bright promise. 
Therefore, he should:
<ul>
<li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Murayama that selective exemptions to APEC 
trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national 
interest in trade liberalization in Asia. The U.S. cannot accept an APEC trade 
liberalization regime that excludes sectors such as agriculture where 
Americans excel. In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald on 
November 6, U.S. Ambassador to APEC Sandra Kristoff said, "To provide for 
sector exclusions because of domestic sensitivities would be to turn Bogor on 
its head and to call into serious question the continued interest of many of us 
to participate." 
<P>
<li>Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and 
New Zealand to block Japan's protectionism. The U.S. is fortunate that most 
other APEC members disagree with the Japanese proposal. President Suharto, 
who views the Bogor Declaration as his legacy, once again may play a key 
role in bridging the division and building a consensus in Osaka. The U.S. 
should support his efforts if he does.
<P>
<li>Make clear that blocking or delaying comprehensive APEC trade 
liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. Asia's 
economies have benefited greatly from trade liberalization since World War 
II. Without credible international institutions promoting free trade, 
liberalization and the ensuing economic boom in Asia would not have 
occurred. Calling for special exemptions would rob APEC of needed 
credibility in pushing for free trade in the Asia Pacific region.
<P>
<li>Support Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization if the issue is 
raised bilaterally by the Taiwanese. The WTO accession issue likely will not 
be raised by Taiwan in the plenary session of the APEC Leaders' Meeting. It is 
possible, however, that Taiwan's representative will do so in informal bilateral 
meetings with the U.S. In that case, the U.S. should be supportive. Taiwan's 
membership in the WTO should not be held hostage to the People's Republic 
of China's membership in the WTO. Once Taipei meets the WTO's standards, 
it should be allowed to join. Taiwan's membership in the WTO would 
contribute to the overall goal of trade liberalization in the Asia Pacific region.
</ul><P><a name="conc"></a>

CONCLUSION
<P>
APEC is at a crossroads. If Japan is successful in gaining selective 
exemptions to trade liberalization, APEC will lose credibility as an institution 
and will be unable to achieve its dream of "free trade and investment in the 
Asia Pacific" by 2020. President Clinton must fight the Japanese proposal for 
granting selective exemptions and insist upon comprehensive trade and 
investment liberalization in APEC. The U.S. has a number of allies in this 
dispute, especially President Suharto of Indonesia. If the U.S. can join with 
Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Singapore to 
overcome the reluctance of Japan, China, and some other countries, APEC 
may lead the world toward a bright future of growing trade and economic 
prosperity.<hr>

<title>F.Y.I. #70 - Exports to Aisa Leads to US Job Creation -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3><I><center>As U.S. Exports to Asia Boom, So Does Creation of American Jobs
</h3></i>
By John T. Dori<br>
Research Assistant <p>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I.#70<br>
November 15, 1995<br>

<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p>
Trade with Asia is vitally important to the American economy. U.S. exports to East Asia and the 
Pacific Rim in 1994 grew at a healthy 16.2 percent to more than $153 billion. This is the steepest 
increase since 1988. The prosperous nations of the Asia-Pacific region purchased over $45 billion 
more from U.S. exporters than did the 15 nations of the European Union, and almost $30 billion 
more than Europe as a whole.<P>
More exports to Asia means more jobs for Americans. The U.S. Department of Commerce 
estimates that 20,000 American jobs are created for each $1 billion in exports. Thus, in 1994, more 
than 3 million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia. And of these 3 million jobs, more 
than 428,000 were created in 1994 alone.
<P>
The job-creating benefits of these exports were spread liberally across the United States in 1994, 
with 42 of the 50 states exporting more to Asia than in the previous year. California is noteworthy 
in this regard. Its aggressive export promotion program aimed at Asia and the Pacific Rim helped 
the Golden State increase its total 1994 exports to the region by almost $7 billion, creating jobs for 
more than 126,000 Californians. Other noteworthy performances were turned in by Arizona (21.9 
percent growth), Georgia (32.0 percent), Florida (26.6 percent), Illinois (22.8 percent), Oregon 
(21.9 percent), and Texas (19.6 percent).
<P>
Trade with Asia is increasingly important to the health and growth of the American economy. In 
order to create more American jobs and a higher standard of living for the American people, the 
U.S. must expand its access to the increasingly prosperous markets of the Asia-Pacific region. 
Washington can do this by continuing to promote lower trade barriers throughout the region. As the 
U.S. export figures show, America cannot afford trade wars with Asian countries.
<P>
The following chart provides a graphic indication of how much this country stands to benefit or 
lose in trade with Asia. Continuing on the path toward liberalized trade with this lucrative region is 
the road to continued American prosperity. The path toward protectionism and increased U.S. 
barriers to trade, on the other hand, will lead to America's being cut out of Asia's growing markets, 
and thus to fewer jobs and a lower standard of living for all Americans.

<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  "Advancing American Business Interests Through APEC" is our topic this morning. It is an important topic. We have three excellent panelists who will approach it from different points of view.
<p>
This program is a joint production of the Heritage American Trader Initiative (ATI) Advisory Council, newly formed in the last year, and the <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Heritage Asian Studies Center</a>. The ATI brings together the <a href="/heritage/library/index/g3.html">foreign policy</a> and <a href="/heritage/library/index/l1.html">international trade</a> aspects of Heritage's work, which are considerable, and we have created a new advisory council of private-sector business and policy leaders, which I am pleased to chair. I'm Barbara Franklin, former U.S. Commerce Secretary. The other half of the equation is Heritage's Asian Studies Center, which has been going on for some time and which really is excellent. I know <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">Jim Przystup</a> is here; he is the director of that program. So, with this bit of introduction, we will begin.
<p>
The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) was founded in 1989, at the instigation of Australia. The United States has been a member ever since, and in 1993 hosted the first meeting of the leaders of the member countries in Seattle. There are now eighteen countries that belong to APEC. The obvious ones are in the Pacific Rim, plus the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Chile. Ten working groups have been activated as a part of the APEC framework, and there is a secretariat today in Singapore.
<p>
That this group was formed at all is, I think, a reflection of the dynamic growth that is prevailing in Asia today, with economies growing, in many cases, in double digits. That part of the world is a very important marketplace for the U.S. In U.S. terms, our exports to Asia grew 12 percent in 1994 from the preceding year, to over $153 billion. Our direct investment climbed 17 percent in that region, to over $108 billion in 1994. Our exports to Asia now support 3.1 million jobs here at home.
<p>
There was an historic event at the APEC leaders' meeting in 1994. In fact, it was so historic that some of us wondered whether it was possible. At last year's meeting, on November 15, the heads of the APEC governments decided to set a goal for themselves:  to create "free and open trade and investment" in that region by the year 2020. President Suharto of Indonesia, where that meeting was held, deserves a great deal of credit for overcoming a lot of differences in points of view, economic realities, and cultures. He did quite a magnificent job.
<p>
Now we have before us this year's meeting coming up in just a few weeks in Japan, with the Japanese as hosts and with Prime Minister Murayama as the chairman. I think it would be fair to say that our Japanese friends have not been as aggressive in putting this meeting together as we might have hoped. After last year we began to have high hopes for what might be possible, and the hope was that we would come out of this meeting with a framework for implementing this free trade concept in the Pacific Rim by the year 2020.
<p>
Right now, we have a bit of a split, and that is what I hope some of our panelists will address. We have a split in the ranks, with the Japanese having proposed a "flexibility" that would allow the membership to exclude certain sectors, mainly agriculture, from the trade liberalization discussions. This concerns us. The U.S. is not in that camp. The "flexibility" group includes -- in addition to Japan -- China, Korea, and Taiwan. On the other side we have ourselves, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the other countries.
<p>
In just a few short weeks, on November 19, we will have this meeting in Osaka. So the real question is:  Can this division over "flexibility" and the exclusion of agriculture be overcome at this meeting?  That is really the biggest question. I have read articles recently that would indicate that maybe APEC doesn't matter, that business will flourish with or without it. It did before APEC was formed in the Pacific Rim, and some say business activity will overtake and outrun the APEC process. We have two representatives from our business community here, and we will be very interested in your answers to that question. And with that, let me introduce the panelists.
<p>
First of all is Stuart Allan, who is Director of the Office of Economic Policy, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, at the Department of State. This is the office that interacts with APEC and is involved in planning this conference. Mr. Allan is a career foreign service officer, having joined the department in 1971. He has served as Counselor of Economic Affairs at our embassy in Australia and has also served in the Netherlands, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Mexico. He is a graduate of Davidson College in North Carolina, with an M.A. in economics from the University of Wisconsin.
<p>
<b>STUART ALLAN:</b>  Thank you very much, Barbara. It's a great pleasure to be here today to talk about this very important question of free trade in the Asia Pacific region and the prospects for moving forward on that. Sandy Kristoff, my boss, does extend her sincere regrets. She had been scheduled to come, she wanted to come, but as we move closer to ministerial and summit meetings, the leaders' meeting, she gets pulled over to the White House quite frequently. So she extends her regrets.
<p>
In Canberra in 1989, when Secretary of State Baker joined the other foreign ministers for what was to be a very informal discussion on shared interests in the region, there was a lot of skepticism about the Australian initiative to pull the meeting together. There was some doubt in the region, particularly among some in Southeast Asia, as to the utility of the idea. But after the ministers met for a couple of days of fruitful discussion, they discovered that indeed they had a lot in common, that there were a lot of things they would like to pursue. They sketched out a work program in particular sectors where there might be prospects for cooperation to enhance trade and to enhance the ability of firms to do business in the region. From that slow and hesitant start, APEC has really burgeoned.
<p>
Barbara has pointed out the seminal event in Seattle in 1993, when President Clinton really elevated APEC from a meeting of foreign ministers and trade ministers to an annual meeting of leaders of the APEC economies. Then President Suharto last year hosted a similar meeting in Bogor, just outside of Jakarta, where APEC took another very important step forward. President Suharto, as an important leader of the developing member economies in APEC, and as a leader of the developing world as head of the non-aligned movement, was able to convince all the member economies of APEC to undertake this commitment to achieve free trade and investment in the region by specified dates. Those specified dates were 2010 for the industrialized members of the group and 2020 for the developing member economies.
<p>
So the challenge before the APEC members this year has been to frame an action agenda which the leaders requested. They asked the ministers to come forward with specific, detailed proposals on how to get from where we are to where they have committed us to be in 15 to 25 years. That has proved to be a major challenge over the past year. The Japanese have worked very hard, and it has been difficult. The situation in Japan is such that Prime Minister Murayama, as a member of a coalition government, is doing what he can to provide leadership. Within Japan there are competing bureaucracies that sometimes affect the Japanese ability to do things; but even with those constraints, they have worked very hard this year to try to frame an action agenda, working with the 17 other member economies, that could be finalized by the foreign and trade ministers in their ministerial meeting in Osaka and then promulgated by the leaders in their meeting on November 19 in Osaka.
<p>
The draft, as it now stands, is maybe 70 to 80 percent agreed but still has some very important components that have yet to be concluded. The draft includes a section of general principles that the APEC member economies will seek to adhere to as they move forward to the free trade goal. Those principles include things like the main point that Barbara mentioned, the question of comprehensiveness. Under that principle, the question is:  As we move forward, will it be to comprehensively liberalize trade and investment, or will there be exceptions?  In the leaders' declaration last year, they did not mention any exceptions. They said "free trade and investment in the region" by specified dates.
<p>
But as we've engaged in this initiative this year, moving from the political commitment to the practical reality, a number of member economies have found that it begins to be very hard to swallow. I think the reasons are quite understandable. They were quite evident at the closing days of the Uruguay Round, for example. We found with a number of the member economies, particularly Korea and Japan, that the problem of agricultural liberalization was a major difficulty for them, but they moved forward.
<p>
Our approach is that the APEC leaders did not state any exception to comprehensive free trade and investment liberalization, and the leaders did not say anything about special consideration for sensitive sectors. The one understanding the leaders had was a recognition of the different levels of development, and that was reflected in the two different target dates, with the industrialized by 2010 and the developing by 2020.
<p>
How do we deal with this problem at this point?  That has yet to be decided, but my sense is that in the run up to the ministerial meeting there will be intensive discussions in advance in Osaka. If the issue cannot be resolved at the working level, it will probably go to the ministers. And if the ministers are unable to reach agreement on this question of comprehensive coverage, I think it will ultimately have to go to the leaders. After all, it was leaders who made the commitment, it was leaders who did not say "except for sensitive sectors," and if there is some clarification required for the ministers and the rest of us, then maybe the leaders will have to do that. So the jury is out on this question of comprehensiveness and whether there might be an exception for agriculture.
<p>
The reason we are fairly firm on this, quite firm on it, is that once we start making exceptions for sensitive sectors -- again, agriculture in the case of Japan and Korea -- we will find that everybody has a sensitive sector. And if everyone was able to identify one sensitive sector for exclusion -- I could imagine, for example, elements in the U.S. would be happy for the Japanese to exclude agriculture -- we might exclude textiles, the Chinese might exclude automobiles, the Southeast Asians might exclude financial services. Pretty soon, if everyone takes one thing off the table, you don't have much left. It's quite easy to picture an unraveling of the objective. Moreover, agriculture is an important trading commodity, one that we are very efficient at exporting, so agriculture is an important issue. We will have to see where that comes out.
<p>
Other items in the principles section of the draft action agenda include things like the question of nondiscrimination; that is one that has to be worked out. The question of comparability is critical as member economies move forward to achieve the free trade goal:  How do they do it, and how does one assure that the efforts and, more important, the market access results are mutually beneficial and comparable?  These are open issues, and I think we will be able to reach agreement on them, but they are not yet agreed.
<p>
The second part of the draft action agenda addresses the central question of the process:  How do we do this over the next 15 to 25 years?  To generalize, there have been roughly two different approaches to this question. On one side, a number of member economies would prefer more of a voluntary and unilateral effort, whereby they accept the goal but move forward in their own way over the next 15 to 25 years to open up the different sectors, to address the different issues, so that they achieve the commitment. At the other end of that spectrum is a group of countries that think you cannot depend entirely on voluntarism, although some member economies have indeed been doing a lot unilaterally. Many of the countries in Southeast Asia, for their own benefit, have been deregulating, lowering tariffs unilaterally, to help open up their economies and continue to enjoy the rapid growth that they have enjoyed, in part because of wise, market-oriented policies.
<p>
On the other hand, there are other member economies in Asia where the track record is less encouraging. Therefore, for all the member economies to be confident that we are going to achieve the goal, some believe that we cannot depend solely on voluntarism and unilateralism, that we also need some collective action where we sit down and talk through some issues and agree on where we are going and how fast we are going to get there.
<p>
In the actual action agenda, what I think we will find is perhaps a mix of these different methods that might include unilateral and voluntary actions, might include some collective actions by member economies, ongoing actions in the context of the WTO to meet multilateral commitments which will also be beneficial in an APEC context. In APEC we have this notion of "18 minus X."  Of the 18 members of APEC, perhaps a subset of 12, for example, might be able to agree on action in a particular area. And if the other six cannot move forward in the near term, subsets of the whole group can move forward. This is copied from a technique that is used in ASEAN, where they have a "6 minus X" approach. If some parts of ASEAN, say five of the six, can move forward, you don't hold out for absolute consensus; the other one basically catches up later and the five move ahead.
<p>
After principles and a process section, the key part of the action agenda will be a section that identifies specific sectors and issues that we will be focusing on at the outset and consistently over the 15 to 25 years. These issues include things like trade in services, intellectual property protection, government procurement, regulation and deregulation, competition policy, tariffs, and non-tariff barriers. There is an enumeration of 14 or 15 specific sectors and issues where the member economies are going to focus their efforts as they pursue liberalization individually, collectively, in the WTO, 18 minus X -- the different methodologies.
<p>
That is where we stand. The senior officials of APEC -- this is the group just below the ministers level -- have met six times or so this year, both in a special restricted negotiating context and in the general meetings they routinely have. The action agenda draft is, as I say, about 80 percent toward where we need to be, but a lot of important work has yet to be done.
<p>
I would like to turn a little bit away from what I have been talking about, which is what has seized the headlines and focused the attention of a lot of people in the last 12 months, and understandably so, to look at another aspect of APEC:  the more short-term, the more practical, concrete kinds of things that APEC has been doing and will continue to do to provide some tangible benefits for business. This is what APEC really started on back in 1989, with these working groups looking at tourism, looking at telecommunications, looking at transportation, looking at energy -- some of the sector-specific working groups looking at ways the member economies could cooperate.
<p>
Let me just mention a few of the kinds of things that have happened or will be happening in this area, in different categories. One is activities that increase transparency. This is important. I think it is fair to say we have one of the most transparent trade and investment regimes in the world. But in the Asian part of APEC -- and, again, think of Southeast Asia, think of China, developing economies -- transparency is a problem for businessmen. To the extent that through APEC we can be clear in terms of what the business rules, procedures, and so forth are, and make that information more readily available to businessmen, that should make it easier to do business.
<P>
A couple of examples. One is the customs guidebook, a publication by the APEC Customs Subcommittee with information on the regulatory regimes, non-tariff barriers, and so forth, all collected in one place, in English, available globally for exporters of all the member economies. Another transparency measure seems kind of small and very specialized, but is quite important for one sector, and that is the fish inspection system handbook. There is a Fisheries Working Group looking at both health and safety and trade issues in the fisheries area. The U.S. is an exporter of seafood products, and seafood is traded widely in the APEC region. This is one of the most highly regulated sectors because of safety and health concerns. Now, through this working group, a handbook has been published that identifies what the rules, regulations, contact points, and so forth are to import and export shellfish and seafood products.
<p>
Another type of practical measure I would characterize as in the "doing business" category. This differentiation between "doing business" measures and "transparency" measures may seem a little artificial, but just let me give you a few other examples. Through one of the working groups of the Committee on Trade and Investment, over the last year the APEC member economies have developed a tariff database. It is now on a CD-ROM and can be purchased for $50 or $60 from the APEC secretariat; I can give you a contact point in the Commerce Department that can tell you exactly how to do it. Here on a CD-ROM, which will be updated annually, are all the tariff schedules for all the member economies, easily accessible on a common tariff description. I think it is BTN or the standard tariff classification. The key thing here is for American businesses, or any other businesses that are considering exporting a product into the APEC region, to find the tariff level. Is it a prohibitive tariff?  Is it something they could deal with and still be competitive in that target market?  Here is a key "doing business" question, with the information readily available.
<p>
Another one that we kicked off a few years ago was called the APEC Partnership for Education. I think this was initiated about 1991. The idea was that there are lots of foreign students studying in the United States, including many from Southeast Asia. They come here for four or five or six years and learn excellent English, become familiar with American education and the way we approach business and so on. There also are a lot of American multinationals working in Southeast Asia or in Asia that would like to offer employment to many of these students that have the language and American orientation. Many of those graduates, as they go back to their home countries, would like to offer their services as employees of those companies. So it was really a matchmaking exercise that was set up with some seed money from the U.S. Agency for International Development. I think in recent years that seed money has been removed, and the latest I heard is it is now self-sustaining by the two parties, the buyer and seller. I'm not sure who pays most of the costs, but it is an ongoing effort.
<p>
Each year for the last several years, in advance of the APEC ministerial meetings, there has been a customs symposium. I think we kicked this off in Seattle and found it to be very useful, where customs officials sit down and talk with importers and exporters about practical problems faced by firms doing business in that country. I sat in on a small part of this in Jakarta last year, and this was an incredibly well-attended event:  a roomful of probably three or four hundred businessmen talking with Indonesian customs officials. They had the director-general and the other customs officials, as well as some international customs officials from the GATT and the World Customs Organization, talking about practical problems in an actual forum where businessmen could go into some of the problems in terms of importing and exporting in Indonesia:  good contacts and a good way to exchange information and seek to improve procedures and solve problems.
<p>
Another example is mutual recognition agreements. This is something that is still being worked on. Member economies have different product standards, and products typically will have to be tested and approved by different testing organizations. Even though individual economies may have their own standards for their own reasons, the ideal is to have a harmonized standard, but in many cases that will not be possible. In terms of testing and testing conformance to standards, is it fruitful and efficient to test every product in every place, or can we in APEC come up with an approach where we agree to test it once and accept it everywhere and, if so, this really facilitates movement of products in the region?  Again, I think this is probably less a problem in the United States, but I know that many American exporters, as they try to ship a product into Japan or into China, face tremendous problems. Sometimes each product has to be tested. So if we could somehow simplify testing procedures, recognize the results of tests regionwide, that should really facilitate the movement of products in the region.
<P>
Finally, there is another category of tangible, near-term, and practical benefits for business, and I put it under the business promotion rubric. I'll give just a couple of examples. One example is simply showcasing technologies. This year Secretary of Transportation Pea hosted an APEC Transportation Ministerial meeting. All of the transport ministers from around the region met here in Washington for two days for an excellent session in one of the conference rooms of the State Department. Day One of that session was a symposium of the ministers with the business communities. Every minister was invited, and most of them brought a group of businessmen concerned with the transportation sector. For a day, the ministers sat down and talked with businessmen about transportation issues in the region.
<p>
There was an official ministers-only session the next day, and then Secretary Pea invited all of the ministers to go with him on a short tour through the United States in order to showcase some of the transportation technology of the U.S. They went to the new Denver airport, which Secretary Pea knew a lot about, as well as to Seattle to look at Boeing, look at some of the infrastructure there, and I think down to San Francisco:  a good opportunity to showcase American technology to ministers from the region. We all know that infrastructure growth in the region, particularly transportation infrastructure, is very important and offers a lot of opportunities. So the post-ministerial tour provided a good exposure for U.S. transportation technology.
<p>
There was another, similar event in Vancouver a couple of years ago, when APEC environmental ministers met under Canadian chairmanship and there was a showcase of environmental technology. I think many American environmental technology companies showed their products at that time. I would hope that there will be more opportunities of the business promotion kind.
<p>
Another impact of APEC, in my opinion -- and this may be more important for the United States than most other member economies -- is to raise the profile of the opportunities in Asia. This is not a conscious objective of U.S. policy, but it is really an important byproduct. In the United States, we have very competitive multinationals, very active globally and in the region. But in the United States, we also have lots of small and medium-sized enterprises which are accustomed to doing business in their state, maybe nationally, but they are not sufficiently oriented to international exports and international investment opportunities. To the extent that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Commerce go to the ministerial and APEC leaders' meetings and thereby draw attention to the opportunities in Asia, they can stimulate the interest of small and medium-sized enterprises in exploring opportunities in Asia that they might not have thought about before.
<p>
Small and medium-sized business here is one of the great generators of new technology, of jobs and so on, and to the extent we can get small business more internationally oriented, that is good for the United States. This is true also in most of the other member economies. Small business is an important component of many of the developing economies, and many of the practical results in APEC that I described earlier really are more beneficial to small businesses, which face these big expenses in lack of transparency and lack of knowledge, than to IBM or General Motors, which are much more comfortable working internationally.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  Next is Philip Vaughn, Director of Government Relations for Fluor Corporation, a very large, diversified engineering and construction company operating in over 50 countries. Prior to joining Fluor, Phil was vice president of International Business Government Counselors, a consulting firm here in the District. Before that, he was on the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee when Dan Rostenkowski was the chairman and with the Peace Corps in Zaire. He graduated from Georgetown, with a B.S. in foreign service and an M.A. in Arab studies, and speaks French, Arabic, and Italian.
<p>
<b>PHILIP VAUGHN:</b>  Thank you very much for asking me to be here today. As a real believer in APEC, I was very pleased to be a part of this program this morning. Actually, Fluor is very active in Asia. We have offices in all the APEC countries except for Brunei, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea.
<p>
Our involvement in this started last year, when the President asked our chairman, Les McCraw, to be part of the Pacific Business Forum, which is the business advisory group to the APEC leaders. The Pacific Business Forum is made up of two members from each APEC economy, one from a large business -- in the case of the U.S., Fluor Corporation -- and one from a small business. The small business representative for the United States was Discovery Communications, although Discovery Communications is actually not all that small. For the past two years, Fluor has also been co-chairman of the Pacific Business Forum. We have done this with Indonesia last year, and this year we have been co-chairman with Indonesia and Japan.
<p>
I was asked to speak about business views toward APEC. I'm not going to go into great detail on the report which the Pacific Business Forum produced, but I will be happy to send people copies if they want to contact me. I wanted to talk a little more broadly about why APEC is important. I think it's a bit difficult to represent U.S. business views as a whole, for two reasons. First, as you all know, the U.S. business community is probably among the most diverse in all the APEC economies. There are differences between large and small, which we touched on earlier, between the manufacturing sectors and service sectors, heavy industry and high tech; so, depending on who you talk to, you might get a very different opinion on APEC.
<p>
Second, there really is a distinct lack of awareness in the business community about APEC and what it does, so I think, as a whole, business views have not fully matured at this point. Indeed, until our chairman was asked to be part of the Pacific Business Forum, Fluor was aware of APEC but certainly not deeply involved in it. 
<p>
Before I go into the specific trade and investment issues that we were looking at this year in APEC as the PBF, I would like to make some very broad comments on why I think APEC is important to business.
<p>
First, it can help solidify the economic and political security of the region that business needs to feel confident in its investments. It is clearly in the interests of the U.S. business community to have a forum in which the U.S. can deepen its ties with all of its trading partners in the Asia Pacific region.
<p>
Second, APEC offers a mechanism for anchoring the U.S. in the region, as I mentioned, both strategically and economically. There seems to be a lot of debate today, at least around APEC, that America may be too focused on Asia, putting too much emphasis on the region; that we do not have a natural role there; that the cultural differences are far too great; and that we really should be focusing perhaps more on Latin America or Europe. I think the physical distance, the cultural differences, and the lack of a clear role in the post-Cold War world perhaps make APEC even more important, and keeping the U.S. involved in the region through APEC even more a priority.
<p>
Third, APEC is the only truly regional grouping in existence, and I think it can play an important role in bringing together the NAFTAs, the AFTAs (which is the ASEAN free trade area), the CERs (which is the free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand), and prevent the region from breaking down into a multiplicity of isolated subregional trading blocs.
<P>
And fourth, APEC offers the U.S. a broad policy forum in which we can sit down and talk to our trading partners in more constructive dialogue, rather than in destructive confrontations that I think we have had in the past.
<p>
Beyond the tariff and trade and business reasons, I think those four are very broad areas or reasons to stay involved in the APEC process. But when you get to the business side, people always look at me and say, "Well, why APEC?  Why are you involved in it?  Does this really have any meaningful impact on your bottom line?"  I think the answer really is a resounding, "Yes, it can," but only if APEC gets its act together this year and starts taking some tough decisions in Osaka is it going to prove to business once and for all that it is willing to move from being a policy talk shop into an action-oriented forum. I think that is the main thing we need to see from Osaka this year.
<P>
Our report that the Pacific Business Forum produced this year, in fact, addresses this issue. Our theme is "Making APEC more relevant to business."  To achieve that business relevancy, APEC has to do two things this year. First, it has to establish itself as a credible and effective organization in the eyes of business, and, put very simply, that means we want to see APEC take some actions that are going to have an immediate and beneficial impact on our ability to conduct business in the region. If APEC does not begin to undertake these types of activities, I think it is going to lose its growing credibility with business, both in the U.S. and in the region, and the nascent business support you are seeing for APEC is going to evaporate.
<p>
Second, APEC really needs to strengthen its ties with business. There has been some general agreement that business has been the driving force behind the tremendous growth we have seen in the region in the last decade. Business is going to continue to do its part to drive that growth and create jobs, but we can do that better in partnership with the public sector through APEC in breaking down some of the barriers that you referred to. That is going to take a great deal of effort, because I'm not convinced that all of the APEC economies really want business input into the process. It is clear the U.S. is looking for it. Australia is looking for it. But I think there is a definite lack of interest in business participation by some of the other members.
<p>
Looking to the Osaka meetings, which are coming up in just about two weeks, there are three very broad things we would like to see. First of all, we need to see a clear road map on how we are going to get to free trade and investment in the region by 2010 and 2020. This would include time lines, milestones, and frequent progress reviews so that we can see exactly who is living up to their commitments, who is not living up to their commitments, and whether APEC as a whole is moving in the right direction. Declarations of intent and promises to do things next year and the year after simply aren't good enough any more.
<p>
Second, at Osaka we need to see a series of steps announced which prove APEC is serious about this trade and investment liberalization agenda. I think these can be small things. They don't all have to be focused on the tariff area. We can accelerate the work they have done in the customs area. We can look at visa-free entry for business travelers. You could look at further work on the rather weak investment principles that were adopted in Jakarta last year, look at continued work on intellectual property. These things are not difficult. They don't cost money, and with a little bit of political will by the leaders, I think they could be done.
<p>
Third, as I mentioned earlier, we need to strengthen this partnership between business and APEC, and there are two main ways I think that can be done. PBF has recommended that a successor organization to our group be established, which would be an official advisory group by regional business to the APEC leaders and ministers. I think there is a lot of debate about how that is going to come out.
<p>
In addition to that formal advisory group, APEC really does need to reach out, whether they want to or not, and get business involved in the working groups -- the ten that you mentioned, some of the programs you mentioned -- on an ongoing basis. Getting a report from business once a year will not keep APEC on the right track. They need to include businessmen in the official discussions; they need to include business in all of their meetings on an ongoing basis. Otherwise, I think we are going to see APEC waver from the path they are setting this year.
<P>
In conclusion, I want to say that I think APEC really is a remarkable organization. It has come a lot further, a lot faster, than anyone might have imagined. We are always intoning this mantra:  that APEC's been around six years and, by God, it better do something this year or we're going to walk away from it. But if you look at it, APEC has been around for only six years. I think it has come rather far for an organization of 18 countries of very disparate levels of economic development, disparate languages and cultures. I think we need to support APEC -- give them a little more time than we have so far.
<P>
Let me make one last observation. I mentioned earlier about keeping the U.S. involved in Asia. There seems to be a big debate these days on Asian values and Western values, and on differences between our philosophies and our ways of doing things. This is usually in the context of why APEC must fail or why ultimately the East and West cannot work together. Well, the PBF was 34 people from 18 different economies, different economic backgrounds, different outlooks, yet over time we all learned to respect each other, to respect each other's points of view. We have worked in great harmony and, in the true spirit of APEC, achieved consensus and mutual respect. We produced a report which every person put their signature on. If this represents the future of the region, I am really very optimistic that we are going to be able to work together in a long and productive partnership, both as business and as government. Thank you.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  Dan Amstutz became president and CEO of the North American Export Grain Association in Washington last April. For three years previous to that, he was executive director of the International Wheat Council in London. Earlier, he had been in the Reagan Administration for six years, first as undersecretary of Agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs and then as ambassador and chief negotiator for agriculture in the GATT Uruguay Round trade negotiations. He was one of the key architects of the U.S. agriculture position in that round. When that round started, one of the U.S.'s major objectives was to have trade in agriculture products covered by GATT -- now WTO -- rules, and that was accomplished. Before that, Dan was with Goldman Sachs. He also was with Cargill for 25 years, the culmination of which was his serving as president and CEO of Cargill Investor Services in Chicago. We particularly wanted somebody who knew the agriculture sector around the world on this panel, given the divisions within APEC about that issue, so we are eager to hear from you.
<p>
<b>DAN AMSTUTZ:</b>  Thank you, Barbara. Phil mentioned that some opine that, perhaps, here in America these days we focus too much on Asia to the exclusion of the rest of the world. But from an agricultural perspective, probably we do not focus enough. When one looks at the demographic and economic outlook, it is staggering. Just to pass on a few things that most of you have heard before, it is highly likely that the world's population by 2025 will increase by 50 percent over current levels; it is reasonable to expect that at that time some 35 percent of the world's people will live in only two countries, China and India; so, within a generation, half the number of people that live in the entire world now may be living in China and India alone.
<P>
The economic scenario is equally exciting. Currently, the five largest economies in the world are the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, and France. In the year 2020, when trade liberalization is supposed to be accomplished in the APEC, the five largest economies of the world, with the exception of the United States, will be Asian:  China, Japan, India, and Indonesia. France will be ninth largest, behind Germany, Korea, and Thailand, and Britain will be the fourteenth largest, behind Russia and barely ahead of Mexico. Canada, currently part of the G-7, will not even be in the list of the top 15. It appears that the OECD is rapidly becoming irrelevant and that it will have to be replaced by a new grouping, but that is a different subject.
<p>
Consider just one example of why agriculture is so interested in Asia. This is an OECD estimate. If China, India, and Indonesia grow by an average of 6 percent a year economically, which is entirely feasible, and their income distribution remains unchanged from current levels, by the year 2010 some 700 million people in those countries will have an average income equal to Spain today. That is 600 million more than at present. The interesting thing about that number, 700 million, is that it is roughly equal to the current combined populations of the United States, the European Union, and Japan. So in a half a generation, a sophisticated market equal in size to Europe, the U.S., and Japan will develop in China, India, and Indonesia. For the agriculture sector, that is a lot of business:  a lot of meat and a lot of all kinds of food products. It presents an exciting outlook for trade expansion.
<P>
The agriculture industry in this country, by and large, is very much in favor of trade liberalization. We believe, as an industry, that trade negotiations must be comprehensive; otherwise, they are self-defeating. That means that all industries must be involved, and all segments of each industry, and that all barriers, all forms of protection, must be addressed.
<P>
The magic of trade negotiations is the concept of reciprocity, and unless you have a comprehensive negotiation, the magic of reciprocity breaks down. How in the world can you expect the U.S. to agree to liberalize import barriers for textiles and apparel, for example, if it is not going to enjoy better market access for some products in which it has a comparative advantage, namely, in agriculture?  The conclusion must be clear:  There would be no progress.
<P>
The truth is that the history of trade negotiations, both bilateral and multilateral, has been one of addressing the subject almost on a case-by-case, product-by-product basis. The terminology is "request/offer."  Country A says, "Can you open the market for more tires that we produce here?"  And Country B says, "Maybe we can do that, but what can you do about opening opportunities for the United Parcel Service?"  I use those two examples because I read that when President Zedillo was here from Mexico, these were trade issues that he discussed with President Clinton. With heads of state and heads of government meeting with each other, this is the process that has ensued. So product by product, service by service, progress is made, but slowly. The objective of a multilateral approach is to expand markets quickly, to allow for the generation of more wealth and more buying power quickly. That can be accomplished, in my judgment, only if we follow a truly comprehensive approach.
<p>
It goes without saying that when that kind of approach is endorsed, there will be some displacement of industries in various countries. It goes without saying that there is an enormous need for retraining, for restructuring, for redeveloping industries. And that becomes a national obligation, both by government and by the private sector. The reason for reluctance, and the reason countries ask for flexibility in the approach to trade negotiation, is they do not want to face those necessities. But the payoff is more opportunity, more access, more growth for more industries. This was what we preached at the beginning of the Uruguay Round, and I am proud that we were able to maintain agriculture on a comprehensive basis during that round.
<P>
I might add that, even in my industry, there are losers from this, and there are some that say, "Wait a minute, let's show some flexibility," as the government of Japan currently says. Certainly, the textile industry of this country would like to slow down the flow of textiles and apparel into the United States. And certainly, as we have trade liberalization, there is going to be a need for some restructuring and retraining and redevelopment in that industry here in the U.S. But there are always new services and new products that can be developed and for which there can be a market around the world. Again, the question is, "How quickly, how rapidly, can world economies expand?"  And the payoff from trade liberalization is that more countries are shipping more goods and services, and more wealth is indeed generated. That is what we're searching for.
<p>
We don't need an APEC to do that, I guess, but I'm here to tell you that an APEC really facilitates it, and really permits it to work much more effectively and much more rapidly. Is APEC competing with the World Trade Organization?  Not at all. It is facilitating it and advancing the objectives of trade liberalization more rapidly.
<p>
Can there be sensitivity to weak economies in this?  The term for this in trade negotiations is S&D, special and differential:  special and differential treatment for economies that are developing more slowly, special and differential treatment for industries that have particular problems in various countries. Of course there can be, and APEC is on a dual track in this regard:  2010 for the developed countries, 2020 for the developing. And there can be flexibility shown within that -- although I should not use the word "flexibility," because it's a buzz term for exclusions, and I want to speak out forcefully against that.
<p>
Within any industry there are some that will say, "Well, let's not rush too rapidly into this because we'll make some of our very good customers unhappy."  The truth is, the best customer in the world for American agriculture is Japan. By far. And I can tell you that we in American agriculture value the markets in Japan very much. We need them, we would like them to grow, and we want to help in that effort, in that pursuit. To use the word "reciprocity" again, we're very eager to help Japan's market outlets in this country grow as well.
<P>
The fainthearted cannot prevail these days on these subjects. You really cannot have your cake and eat it too; you either support overall growth in trade, or you opt for what I would say is a no-growth situation. So, again, to sum up, the opportunities for all involved in trade expansion in all the APEC countries -- certainly in agriculture -- are dramatic and exciting. We can have optimum realization of these opportunities for all only if APEC plows forward with a truly comprehensive approach. Then the magic of reciprocity will really work. It is for all of us who are not in government to urge our governments to press hard for this, and I think we will all be pleased with the results in the years ahead.

<title>The Caribbean Basin Trade Bill -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>THE CARIBBEAN BASIN TRADE BILL: <br>
GOOD ECONOMIC POLICY AND GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY</i></h3>
By Joe Cobb<br>
John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Political Economy<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 430<br>
October 12, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
Congress is considering legislation to reduce tariffs on some products from countries in the Caribbean Basin and could include this measure in the FY 1996 budget reconciliation package. This would be a wise action. The legislation is important to the economies of the Caribbean Basin and to the American companies that built factories there in the past decade under the incentives of President Reagan's 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative.
<p>
The adoption of NAFTA in 1993 reduced tariffs on products from Mexico and created a tariff disadvantage for Caribbean countries. Many American companies with facilities currently located there are considering whether to shift production to Mexico. Diverting trade from Caribbean nations to Mexico because of the tariff differential certainly would benefit Mexico, but only at the expense of the smaller economies the Reagan Administration sought to help. Extending free trade to include imports from the Caribbean nations will prevent this distortion of the market.
<p>
The Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act (H.R. 553 and S. 529), introduced in January by Representative Phil Crane (R-IL) and Senator Bob Graham (D-FL), preserves the Reagan Administration's initiative to build up the economy of the Caribbean Basin and continues the United States commitment to open trade and economic development through free-market incentives. It would do this by reducing tariff barriers equivalent to NAFTA. A modified version of this bill is being considered by both the House and Senate.
<P>
<b>Competitive Disadvantage.</b> Many American companies, particularly in the apparel industry, have invested in Caribbean Basin countries during the past 10 years. During 1994, some $4.6 billion in textile and apparel products was shipped to the United States from the region. Because of NAFTA, however, goods shipped from Mexico are becoming less expensive relative to products shipped from the Caribbean, where tariffs are higher. Mexico shipped $2.4 billion in textiles and apparel to the United States in 1994, and the amount is expected to increase in 1995. Companies now operating in the Caribbean Basin are considering relocating to Mexico because of the less costly trade restrictions. The bill would provide that the rules of  origin for component parts of goods imported from the Caribbean are the same as those that apply to goods from Mexico. It also would set equal tariff rates.
<P>
Industry groups, including the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, American Textile Manufacturers Institute, United States Apparel Industry Council, American Yarn Spinners Association, American Fiber Manufacturers Association, and National Cotton Council, as well as the Association of American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America, have urged the Senate Finance Committee to include the Caribbean Basin Trade Security provision in the FY 1996 budget reconciliation legislation to stop the investment diversion caused by Mexico's more favorable trade situation. The industry groups say approximately 275,000 American jobs depend on current Caribbean trade because of the way production has been diversified in the past decade. 
<p>
<b>Protectionism vs. Free Trade.</b> The Caribbean Basin legislation may become the first battle in the 104th  Congress between advocates of protectionism and supporters of freer trade. The bill enjoys bipartisan support. H.R. 553, introduced by a Republican, was co-sponsored by the top-ranking Democratic members on the House Ways and Means Committee, and all subsequent co-sponsors have been Democrats. S. 529, introduced by a Democrat, is co-sponsored by Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Trade Subcommittee. But opponents blocked the addition of this legislation to the FY 1996 budget reconciliation during the Ways and Means Committee markup on September 12-13. Opponents of the bill are predominantly Members of Congress who also opposed NAFTA and GATT in the last Congress. Unfortunately, they have been joined by several  otherwise free-market freshmen.
<p>
Regrettably, H.R. 553 and S. 529 have become symbols of the populist debate over trade policy. Those who opposed NAFTA and GATT in 1993 and 1994 now see the Caribbean Basin Trade Security bill as another chance to argue against international trade. They claim that American jobs will be lost and that further reducing tariffs on imports from the Caribbean Basin will cost $1.1 billion in lost tariff revenue over the next five years. But the reality is that tariff revenue from the Caribbean already is being lost from the diversion of trade to   Mexico. The legislation actually would preserve tariff revenue that otherwise would be lost over time.
<p>
Certainly there may be some U.S. jobs at risk under NAFTA as other textile apparel manufacturers establish production in Mexico. But the argument that U.S. jobs will be lost due to the Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act is flawed. Reducing Caribbean tariffs to NAFTA levels will facilitate ongoing production in joint U.S.-   Caribbean factories. NAFTA created those incentives for investment two years ago. Moving factories and jobs to Mexico from the Caribbean and reducing tariffs for Caribbean countries so that existing production facilities can remain profitable will not cost U.S. jobs but will preserve Caribbean jobs and a flow of tariff revenues to the United States. Because of generally higher transportation costs and tariffs under current law, any jobs at risk are in the Caribbean.
<p>
The Senate Finance Committee should include the Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act in its FY 1996 budget reconciliation bill, and the House of Representatives should reconsider last month's Ways and Means Committee decision. American companies have made substantial investments in the Caribbean region in response to the trade incentives Congress established after 1983. The promise of improved economic growth in Mexico following the implementation of NAFTA should not come at the expense of small, developing countries of the Caribbean Basin. Free trade fosters production and investment by allowing consumer demand to set the terms of  profitability and by getting government-imposed trade barriers and tariffs out of the way. The Caribbean Basin Initiative in the 1980s started this process in the Caribbean, and NAFTA has opened Mexico even more to    market forces. Eliminating the remaining barriers to Caribbean trade will level the playing field.
<p>
Supporters of deregulation and the free market should continue the program started by the Reagan Administration to build up the economy of the Caribbean Basin and reinforce the message of United States commitment to open trade and worldwide economic growth through free-market incentives.

<h3><i>ABOLISH AMERICA'S COSTLY ANTI-DUMPING LAWS</i></h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 261<br>
October 3, 1995<br>

(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 906, "A Guide to Antidumping Laws:  America's Unfair Trade Practice," July 21, 1992.)<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
	America's nearly century-old anti-dumping trade laws have outlived their usefulness. Anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, which prevent the import of low-priced and subsidized foreign goods, have become the protectionist weapon of choice. The U.S. government should not be enforcing laws that impose higher prices on American consumers. Nor should the U.S. be taking steps that undermine the competitiveness of some of America's largest exporters.
<p>
	But that is exactly what the federal government is doing when it demands that special duties be placed on imports that supposedly are priced "too low."  U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor in June 1993 asked the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) to conduct a study of America's anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. The ITC study, published in June 1995, found that the overall cost of anti-dumping and countervailing duties to the U.S. economy far outweighs any benefits.1 For example, the ITC discovered that anti-dumping and countervailing duty protection cost the U.S. economy $1.59 billion in lost gross domestic product (GDP). Moreover, the study concluded that when anti-dumping and countervailing duties are imposed on imports, prices for those products, and for their domestically produced counterparts, increase. As a result, the U.S. consumer has to pay more for all these goods, regardless of whether they are imported or produced in the U.S.
<p>
	<b>Findings of the ITC Study.</b> The International Trade Commission has conducted the most comprehensive study ever undertaken on the economic effects of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws.2 The ITC reviewed all cases initiated between 1980 and 1993, conducted detailed case studies of eight representative domestic industries that won anti-dumping or countervailing duty rulings against foreign competitors, and assessed the overall impact of all anti-dumping and countervailing duties on the U.S. economy. The study found that:
<p><ul>
<li> Anti-dumping and countervailing duties caused a net loss of $1.59 billion in U.S. gross domestic product in 1991;
<p>
<li> While domestic companies and their workers receiving anti-dumping and countervailing duty protection earned $658 million more in profits and wages, terminating this protection would have increased overall American business profits and wages by $1.85 billion in industries that were not receiving such protection;
<p>
<li> When these duties were applied to the items examined in the study, U.S. prices for those goods rose. For example, solid urea fertilizer prices increased by 19 percent, lamb meat prices went up by 10 percent, and domestic steel pipe and tube prices rose by 10 percent.3
</ul><p>
While protected firms and their workers may benefit from anti-dumping and countervailing duties, their benefits come at the expense of consumers, other American firms, and their workers. In 1987, for example, U.S. consumers paid $138 million more for ball bearings because of anti-dumping laws. The overall cost to the economy was $70 million. In 1985, U.S. consumers paid $23 million more for brass sheet and strip, for a net cost to the economy of $19 million. In the 1984-1985 crop year, U.S. consumers paid $11 million in higher prices for frozen orange juice concentrate, while the net cost to the economy was $8 million.
<p>
	These findings demonstrate conclusively that the anti-dumping and countervailing duty cure is far worse than the disease. While these laws may protect some jobs and provide some higher profits for selected businesses, they cost far more overall in higher consumer prices, lower production, and lost jobs in other industries. The ITC's findings support the case for abolishing these laws. There is no rational economic case for the claim that selling at below cost is an unfair practice; in a free market, prices are determined by what consumers are willing to pay for a product, not by what producers spent on making a product.
<p>
	Proponents contend that anti-dumping law protects American consumers from the "predatory" tactics of foreign firms. (Predatory pricing is an illegal scheme in which one firm seeks to drive its rivals out of business by pricing its product substantially below production costs for a long period of time.) However, U.S. antitrust law allows domestic firms to sell their products at below-cost prices. U.S. firms actually can sell their products at less than the historical production costs to liquidate obsolete, deteriorating, or unpopular products, to maintain production and sales during a recession or seasonal downturn in demand, or to introduce new products to the market.
<p>
	Why should U.S. law declare this type of pricing behavior legal if performed by a domestic firm but illegal if undertaken by a foreign competitor?
<p>
	The U.S. government's war on low prices is not justified. Anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws benefit a select few companies while doing significant damage to the entire U.S. economy. The U.S. should end these practices. It should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Repeal the U.S. anti-dumping law.</b> This law is found in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Repealing it would protect American companies dependent on imported components from costly import duties.
<p>
<li><b>Repeal the U.S. countervailing duty law.</b> This law also is found in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Some countries will continue to subsidize their businesses. In such cases, the U.S. should use the World Trade Organization's Dispute Settlement Mechanism to enforce the agreement limiting government subsidies. This agreement, part of the recently concluded Uruguay Round, over time reduces the subsidies government may provide to various industries. If a signatory country continues to provide subsidies beyond the limits set in the agreement, other member countries can initiate an investigation, after which special duties can be applied to the guilty country's exports.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	One of the principal government agencies in charge of implementing America's anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws, the International Trade Commission, has found that these antiquated laws do more harm than good. They should be scrapped. Doing so would save American consumers billions of dollars in lower prices and and would cause the entire U.S. economy to grow. This is a good deal for the majority of Americans. It is essential for the U.S. economy.

<h3>International Trade: America's Winning Formula</h3>
<p>
Delivered June 7, 1995 by Dexter F. Baker,<br>
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
<P>
In 1994, two-way trade across America's borders with the rest of the world represented a $1.6 trillion economic activity. This equals 28 percent of the total United States gross domestic economic activity. International commercial transactions by the United States with the rest of the world are growing at a compound rate of 7 percent per year. This growth rate is two-and-one-half times faster than the growth of our domestic economy. 
<P>
In the United States today, one job out of every five is directly related to either export or import of goods and services with the rest of the world. (When I use the term "goods," I mean manufactured, agricultural, and mineral products.) Future economic projections indicate that the United States' international trade in goods and services will double between now and the year 2005. That means that ten years from today, the international trade activities of the United States economy will approximate $3.2 trillion, or about 80 percent of the size of the entire U.S. domestic economy in 1995.
<P>
United States producers of goods and services have made tremendous progress since the mid-1980s. Today, U.S. manufacturers, service sector companies, and agricultural producers are the world's most competitive producers for most goods and services when compared to those of our international trading partners. The one major exception is the cost of piece-made garments produced throughout Asia. U.S.A. manufacturers are now also acknowl- edged to be the world's highest quality producers. Only high-value Japanese cars have a slight edge in terms of total quality when compared to their U.S. counterparts, and that quality differential is rapidly being eliminated.
<P>
In 1994, the U.S. market share of the world's total trade activity was the largest of all the industrialized nations in the world. Approximately 22 percent of the worldwide trade in goods and services is provided by the United States. In the mid-1980s, we were number 3. Today, we are number 1, having passed Japan and Germany as the premier producer of goods and services for the world markets.
<P>
U.S. industry, our agricultural producers, and service sector providers have the highest output per worker of all the major industrialized countries. U.S. manufacturers' worker productivity is 30 percent greater than that of Japan and Germany, and our rate of improve- ment is growing faster than either of those countries'. In 1994, manufacturing productivity in this country grew by 4 percent, or twice as fast of that of Germany and Japan. 
<P>
Our agricultural productivity is at least twice as efficient as that of Germany or France. In the service sector, our output per worker is nearly 50 percent greater than that of Germany. You may have seen the article in The Wall Street Journal last week comparing the productivity of our very competitive telephone and banking industries with those of Germany.
<P>
The only economic activity in the United States that does not compare favorably on world scales is the productivity of our "K through 12" education system and our federal and state governments' productivity.
<P>
Today, our agricultural industry has the lowest level of employment in its history and yet feeds our entire country and produces and sells an additional $20 billion worth of agricultural products abroad. Incidentally, I am advised that there is one government employee in the Agriculture Department for every farm in America. Indications are that U.S. agricultural exports in 1995 will be 25 percent greater than in 1994.
<P>
If the United States is to continue to be a world leader in international trade in the 21st century, if we are to double our international trade activity in the next ten years, then there are three policy initiatives that must be undertaken to preserve our growing successes in serving world markets.
<P>
First, we must be relentless in our pursuit to create open markets for our manufactured goods, agricultural products, and technical and entertainment services in every corner of the globe. This drive to keep and/or open markets for our products and services must be the foundation of our international foreign policy. United States goods and service producers cannot be compromised by foreign governments adopting protectionist policies which preserve their markets for their products while denying U.S. producers the right to sell into their markets.
<P>
With few exceptions, the U.S. market is an open market, and U.S. consumers have benefited from that policy; so, too, will the consumers of U.S.A. goods and services around the world benefit from an open market policy in their countries. Today, American industry can compete any place in the world on the basis of quality and price with the brightest and best of our international competitors if we are permitted to do so. But if artificial barriers are erected to keep U.S.A. producers out of selected markets, no amount of competitiveness will enable us to create jobs and enhance our nation's economic well-being by serving world markets.
<P>
Keep this point in mind:  Export-related jobs, because they are incorporated into successful enterprises, are the highest paid jobs that the United States possesses (maybe baseball players are higher). Furthermore, two-thirds of all the world's markets for manufactured products and technical or entertainment services lie beyond the borders of our nation. Those of you in Washington who are responsible for public policy initiatives must press to keep world markets open if U.S. industry is to have the opportunity to create wealth for our nation.
<P>
Secondly, our national taxation system must be modified from one that penalizes capital formation, discourages investment, and places excessive burdens on the hiring of incremental employees. Our federal government today collects 92 percent of its revenues by taxing personal wages and earned income. And in the case of earned corporate profits that are distributed to individuals, that combined rate is the highest in the industrialized world. The 92 percent ratio is also the highest in the industrialized world. Most of our international competitors in Europe and in Asia tax consumption while at the same time offering incentives for saving, investment, and employment.
<P>
The United States cannot long compete in world markets where its most efficient producers, who generate the highest wages and who pay for excellent results, are taxed at the highest rates by a government which has demonstrated no significant productivity improvement in over ten years. Our taxation system must be modified to stimulate extra invest- ment. As a nation, we need to increase the amount of capital stock that is behind each of our workers. We need to encourage a high productivity workforce. We must encourage personal savings, while at the same time improving the productivity of our government and eliminating its annual deficit.
<P>
In this regard, we must become more like Germany and Japan, where national savings rates are three to five times greater than those in the United States. Yes, they save between 15 and 20 percent of their gross income versus 4 to 5 percent here in the United States. As a result, the cost of capital for equity investment in Japan is nearly one-third less than that in the United States. No wonder it is so easy for Japan to invest in our country -- and in Europe and throughout Southeast Asia -- when their cost of equity capital is so low.
<P>
Thirdly, and most important, our federal government must become a partner on our international competitive teams. Since nearly half of the net benefit of our international trade activities flows to our government, and since nearly 50 percent of the wage dollars flow to government, it is absolutely essential that our federal, state, and local governments improve the quality of their services and improve their productivity in the same manner as have our agricultural, manufacturing, and service sectors.
<P>
We cannot win the battle for supremacy in world markets in the 21st century against Japan, Germany, China, or the Little Tigers of Asia if only half the U.S.A. team is pulling on its productivity oars. All members of Team USA must be competitive and must constantly be improving their efficiency. If Team USA is to win in world markets, all members of our team must be contributors so that our entire nation can be a winner.
<P>
We will never solve our social problems -- better housing, quality education, medical care for the needy, jobs for the unemployed -- if we continue to burden the productive side of the economy in order to redistribute our job-creating cash flows on the nonproductive, low productivity side of our economy. Industry, banking, medical care, and even private education are improving their output per dollar of intake. Shouldn't our federal government be held to the same standard?  We heard on ABC News last night that our Air Force maintains a fleet of 589 planes -- ten times the wartime regulated limit -- in order to transport its high-ranking officers around the globe. What is wrong with flying United, TWA, or American Airlines?
<P>
We will only solve our special social needs at home by expanding the size of the economic pie. This can best be achieved by encouraging the wealth-creating enterprises that effectively serve global markets. Then, and only then, can incremental revenues be generated and prudently allocated to our special social needs at home. 
<P>
But we must earn those extra revenues before we can spend them. We cannot spend our resources on solving social issues at home that we haven't yet earned abroad. Our practice of continuously borrowing from our future to solve social ills today will only debase our currency and lower the standard of living for all of our people.
<P>
The time for policy shifts is now -- the summer of 1995. You have been elected to lead that change and oversee its implementation. Let's make 1995 the most productive year in the history of our Congress. Let's together chart a course that will serve our nation well into the 21st century.
<p>
	As our friends at Nike would say--let's just do it!

<a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a><br>
<hr>
	While the recent U.S. automotive trade settlement with Japan is a failure for President Clinton, it is nevertheless a victory for America. A trade war has been averted. For more than a year, the Clinton Administration tried to force the Japanese government to agree to enforceable numerical targets for U.S. exports. Arguing that quotas would be inconsistent with free trade principles, Japan flatly refused Clinton's demand. In the end, President Clinton backed down. The automotive trade dispute was settled without mandatory targets.<p>

	However, the President's failure to force Japan to consent to managed automotive trade is a win for the American people. Managed trade harms consumers through less choice and higher prices. Moreover, managed trade hurts workers in companies or industries that government bureaucrats do not favor. <p>


<a name="agreement"><h3><center>THE AGREEMENT</h3></a></center><br>
	The main result of the recent U.S.-Japan trade settlement is to avert American imposition of 100 percent punitive tariffs on 13 models of Japanese luxury auto imports. Other key provisions of the agreement are: <p>

Auto Parts Purchases by Japanese Automakers. For months the Clinton Administration insisted that the Japanese government be involved in the enforcement of Japanese private sector plans to increase the purchase of American-made auto parts. At Geneva, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was forced to drop this demand and accept voluntary, non-binding purchasing plans tabled by Japan's five largest automakers. To underscore the non-binding nature of the plans, the Japanese government made it clear in a joint U.S.-Japan statement that "Ambassador Kantor's estimates [of Japanese purchases of U.S. auto parts] are his own and neither shared by the minister [Ryutaro Hashimoto] himself nor the government of Japan."<p>

Access to Japanese Dealers. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will send a letter to Japanese dealers reaffirming their right to carry foreign cars. Despite a letter Kantor issued forecasting that American automakers would establish 1,000 new dealership franchises by the year 2000, nothing is binding on the part of the Japanese government.<p>

Deregulation of the Replacement Parts Market. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) will conduct a one-year review of a "critical auto parts" list that limits the use of some foreign parts for safety reasons. The purpose of this review is to remove parts that are not central to safety concerns. As a first step, MOT agreed to remove struts, shocks, power steering, and trailer hitches from the list. Finally, MOT will allow specialized repair garages to establish businesses in Japan.<p>

	These developments come on the heels of two years of negotiations. From the inception of "The United States-Japan Framework for a New Economic Partnership," signed on July 10, 1993, President Clinton has demanded that Japan agree to enforceable "quantitative targets" to increase a variety of American exports. The Framework Agreement established five major areas, or "baskets," in which the U.S. and Japanese negotiators would seek individual binding agreements. The areas covered were telecommunications, medical technology, flat glass, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts. The U.S. and Japan reached a settlement in the first four areas on October 1, 1994, and an automotive accord was reached on June 28, 1995. In all of these agreements, Japan rejected numerical targets. Thus, what Kantor finally agreed to is at odds with what he sought in 1993 when he said that "We will measure the success of these agreements in qualitative and quantitative terms."<p>


<a name="failure"><center><h3>THE LESSONS FROM CLINTON'S FAILURE</h3></a></center><br>

	There are three lessons that the United States should learn from Clinton's failure:<br><ul>

<li>Enforceable trade targets or quotas are inconsistent with free trade and should never be an  object of American policy. Demands for quotas undermine U.S. prestige in the world trading community, isolate the U.S. from its allies, and violate American commitments in international trade agreements.<p>

<li>Industry-by-industry trade liberalization negotiations with Japan have seriously disrupted America's economic, political, and security partnership. While these negotiations have yielded some progress in opening the Japanese market to American exports, the costs are high, and the potential for bumbling into a destructive all-out trade war is great.<p>

<li>The root causes of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan are not protectionism, but factors that are beyond the control of governments. Japan is a country of 125 million people. America is a country of 250 million people. The average Japanese buys about the same amount of goods and services from Americans as Americans buy from Japanese. One reason the deficit exists is that there are twice as many Americans as there are Japanese.<p></ul>



<h3><a name="track"><center>PUTTING TRADE RELATIONS BACK ON TRACK</a></h3></center><br>

	Rather than threaten to impose unilateral trade sanctions on such countries as Japan, the Clinton Administration should look for ways to protect the interests of all Americans, not just those U.S. industries which spend millions lobbying in Washington. The Administration should:<p><ul>

<li>Negotiate a comprehensive free trade and investment agreement with Japan by the year 2000. President Clinton and Prime Minister Murayama have agreed to the goal of "free and open trade and  investment in the Asia Pacific no later than the year 2020."  This pledge was made at the Leaders' Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, 1994. President Clinton should join Congress to offer the Japanese a comprehensive free trade and investment agreement with the United States.<p>

<li>End the practice of using taxpayer dollars and the U.S. government as public relations for selected U.S. businesses. American taxpayers deserve more from their government than to have their hard-earned money spent to win contracts for specific U.S. companies. While Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, and Chrysler Corporation might have benefited from a 100 percent tariff on imported luxury automobiles, the American people would have been harmed. For example, American manufacturers who supplied Japanese automakers with parts for the targeted luxury imports found their orders canceled. Garden State Tanning in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, recently laid off 550 workers when Toyota was forced to suspend its purchase of leather upholstery for Lexus cars. Had the sanctions taken effect, thousands more Americans who sell, maintain, and service these autos would have lost their jobs.<p>

<li>Refrain from using bilateral trade retaliation that isolates America from the international economy. Clinton's threat to impose unilateral trade sanctions against Japan does little to improve American living standards and America's reputation as a free trade leader. In fact, it does the opposite. For example, Japanese Minister Hashimoto skillfully rallied world public opinion against the U.S. when the Clinton Administration did not take its case against Japan to the World Trade Organization before threatening sanctions, a clear violation of international trade agreements. Hashimoto isolated the United States from its trading partners in Europe and Asia and painted Japan, not America, as the defender of free trade.<p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="conclusion"><center>CONCLUSION</a></h3></center><br>

	The Framework Agreement is a failure for Clinton. But Clinton's failure is America's victory. Forcing  Japan to purchase more American autos and auto parts would have run counter to American interests -- for example, by forcing the Japanese government to become a bigger player in Japan's private sector. It would not have reduced the influence of Japan's bureaucrats in making private sector economic decisions. And it would not have resulted in increased American exports to Japan.<p>

	President Clinton took America down the dangerous path of a trade war with its second largest trading partner and largest overseas market. His purpose presumably was to force the Japanese to buy more American goods. In the end, he failed to get this commitment. Instead, America's image abroad as a dedicated free trade partner has been tarnished. Fortunately, this loss for the Clinton Administration is victory for American consumers.<p>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     The United States has made significant progress in the past two years
toward expanding free trade.  Both the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and legislation implementing the Uruguay Round of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) have been approved
by Congress and signed into law by the President.  Yet, forces are at work
in Congress to block further progress on free trade.  Special-interest groups
are mobilizing to subvert or block the legislation needed for the
Administration to open foreign markets to U.S.  goods and services. 
<P>
      This assault on free trade should be stopped.  This can best be done
if Congress grants the President "fast-track" authority to begin negotiating
agreements with those countries that are next in line for free trade --
namely, countries in Asia and Latin America.  Only then can the U.S. 
benefit from the expansion of overseas trade relations that will enlarge
economic opportunities and create new high-wage jobs for all Americans.
<P>
          Despite the progress that has been made, a succession of
events in Latin America has clouded the prospects for rapid trade
liberalization.  The collapse of the Mexican peso on December 20, 1994, not
only devastated the Mexican economy, but also eroded investor confidence
throughout Latin America.  The economic crisis in Venezuela deepened as
more banks collapsed and the inflation rate neared triple digits.  A long-
simmering border dispute between Ecuador and Peru flared up into fighting
between the armies of both countries.  Moreover, the alleged ties between
the new government of Colombian President Ernesto Samper and cocaine
traffickers have caused a serious chill in U.S.-Colombian relations.
<P>
          The news from Asia has not been much better.  The slow
response of the Japanese government to the earthquake that devastated Kobe
on January 17, 1995, highlighted the shortcomings of Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama's administration.  These shortcomings revealed a
weakness that may hamper Murayama's ability to overcome bureaucratic
resistance to develop a framework for trade liberalization in the forum for
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), which this year will hold its
Leaders' Meeting in Osaka.  Investor uncertainty about Mexico spilled over
from Latin America and caused stock markets throughout Asia to fall. 
Although the Clinton Administration settled a nasty trade dispute with China
over intellectual property rights on February 26, 1995, China's application
to join the World Trade Organization still must be negotiated.
<P>
          This bad news from Asia and Latin America has caused some
congressional leaders to cast doubt on the viability of new free trade
initiatives this year.  At a February 8 Heritage Foundation conference,
Representative David Dreier (R-CA), a leading proponent of both NAFTA
and GATT, stated, "I would like very much to charge ahead with fast track. 
But at the same time, I think that it's not going to happen because of some
questions that exist."  To his credit, however, President Clinton has
confirmed that formal negotiations to make Chile the fourth member of
NAFTA will continue.  On February 28, 1995, trade negotiators from
Canada, Mexico, and the United States met for the first time in Mexico City
to decide the structure of the upcoming talks with Chile.  The decision to
move forward with Chile to NAFTA is a good one.  The irresponsible,
politicized monetary policy pursued by the Banco de Mexico, not NAFTA,
caused the Mexican crisis.  Chile should not be penalized for Mexico's
mistakes.
<P>
          Not all the trade news coming out of Asia and Latin America
is bad.  In fact, countries from these regions continue to form free trade
agreements on their own.  For example, Australia and New Zealand have
their own free trade pact, known as the Closer Economic Relations Trade
Agreement (CER).  Moreover, the ASEAN nations agreed on September 23-
24, 1994, to accelerate the implementation of their ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA).  On January 1, 1995, the Southern Cone Common Market
(Mercosur) -- whose members include Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and
Uruguay -- became a customs union.  Chile is negotiating an associate status
with Mercosur even as it prepares to join NAFTA.
<P>
          Rapid progress toward creating an APEC free trade and
investment area and expanding NAFTA, first to Chile and then to other
countries in both Latin America and Asia, is vital to America's economic
future.  The setbacks suffered by free trade, in fact, require that the U.S. 
redouble its efforts, providing strong leadership and a public reaffirmation
of the U.S.  commitment to free trade with Asia and Latin America through
APEC and the expansion of NAFTA.  The U.S.  cannot allow past progress
to be squandered.  To expand free trade, President Clinton should:
Urge the Japanese government to devise an acceptable framework for APEC
trade liberalization.  This would set firm deadlines for negotiating and
implementing steps leading to an APEC free trade and investment area by
2020.
<P>
Ask Congress for fast-track negotiating authority unencumbered by harmful
labor and environmental restrictions.
<P>
Start formal negotiations to extend NAFTA membership to Chile within 30
days of introducing the new fast-track request to Congress, wrapping up a
deal before December 31, 1995.
<P>
Identify additional candidates for NAFTA membership in Asia and Latin
America.  Candidates could include Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore
in Asia and Argentina and Trinidad and Tobago in Latin America.  Formal
negotiations with these countries should begin as quickly as possible.
<P>
WHAT IS "FAST TRACK"?
<P>
     For free trade to progress this year, Congress must grant the
President fast-track negotiating authority.  Fast track allows the President to
negotiate trade agreements with foreign countries which then will be subject
to approval, without amendments, in an up or down vote.  This approach
gives the President more bargaining leverage since his negotiating partners
will know that the agreement will not be drastically altered by Congress
through the amendment process.
<P>
          Beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of
1934, Congress periodically has authorized the President to negotiate and
implement reciprocal tariff reductions with other countries.  Presidents have
used this authority to negotiate GATT agreements to reduce tariffs
substantially around the world.  As tariffs have fallen, however, national
governments have resorted to nontariff barriers to protect domestic industries
from import competition.  Some nontariff barriers are fairly obvious border
measures, such as import quotas and so-called voluntary export restraints. 
Others are more subtle, arising from discriminatory domestic laws and
regulations.  To eliminate such discrimination, trade agreements must go
beyond border measures and address many aspects of domestic policy.
<P>
          In the Trade Act of 1974, Congress expressed its concern
about the "growing importance and proliferation of [nontariff] barriers to the
detriment of U.S.  export trade and the need to develop new or more
adequate international trade rules and mechanisms for their discipline."  The
Act charged the President to seek to reduce or eliminate these nontariff trade
barriers in future trade agreements.  Recognizing that such agreements
would compel the United States to change some of its own domestic laws
and regulations, Congress devised a new procedure, known as fast track, to
preserve the constitutional role of Congress and fulfill its legislative
responsibilities in shaping domestic policy while reducing the uncertainties
of the legislative process for approving and implementing trade agreements.
<P>
            Under the fast-track procedure, Congress sets the objectives
for trade negotiations in an authorizing law before actual negotiations
commence.  Through authorization, Congress determines what countries and
subjects may be included in trade negotiations.  Once these negotiations
begin, the Administration must keep Congress and the private-sector
Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations informed on their
progress.  Periodic updates allow American negotiators to address potential
problems that a member of Congress or representative of an interested party
may raise before a trade agreement is reached, rather than after a deal has
been struck.
<P>
          Before signing a trade agreement, the President must give the
Congress at least 90 days notice.  During this time, the relevant
congressional committees may examine the proposed agreement, determine
what changes in U.S.  law may be required to implement the agreement, and
work with Administration officials to develop an acceptable implementing
bill.  After signing the agreement, the President must submit its final text
together with a draft implementing bill to Congress.  Once these are
submitted, the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate
Committee on Finance have 45 legislative days in which to report a bill. 
Each house must vote either for or against the bill within 15 days of
receiving the committee report.  No amendments are allowed.
<P>
          Some critics contend that fast track allows the President to
ram a trade agreement through Congress with little examination and no
opportunity for amendment.  This criticism is unfounded.  First, Congress
sets the parameters for trade negotiations in an authorization act; a trade
agreement that falls outside of these parameters is not eligible for the fast-
track procedure.  Second, regular reporting on the progress of trade
negotiations allows members of Congress and the Advisory Committee on
Trade Policy and Negotiations ample opportunity to offer suggestions and
propose changes before an agreement is finalized.  Third, the 90-day notice
before the President signs a trade agreement gives members of Congress a
final opportunity to press for changes.
<P>
THE FORUM FOR ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION
<P>
     While fast-track authority is not absolutely necessary until a
framework agreement is reached, recent progress toward creating a free
trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific region may slow unless
President Clinton receives fast-track authority from Congress before the end
of this year.  President Clinton took an important first step toward
expanding free trade by agreeing to the goal of "free and open trade in the
Asia Pacific [region] no later than the year 2020."  This commitment was
made at the Leaders' Meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) organization in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, 1994.  With this
agreement and other accomplishments, APEC launched its long-term quest
for free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region.
<P>
          Many observers had doubted whether the APEC leaders could
agree on a timetable for achieving free trade in the region.  Prime Minister
Datuk Seri Mohammed Mahathir of Malaysia strongly opposed trade and
investment liberalization through APEC, preferring his own scheme for an
exclusionary Asia-only trade bloc.  The Chinese government had threatened
to block any agreement unless the U.S.  and other APEC countries allowed
the People's Republic of China to enter the World Trade Organization. 
Such other Asian countries as Japan and South Korea also were reluctant for
APEC to set a firm date for free trade.
<P>
          President Suharto of Indonesia, chairman of the Bogor APEC
meeting, deftly overcame these obstacles and helped forge a historic
agreement.  Under the Declaration of Common Resolve, the APEC leaders
pledged that industrial countries in APEC would achieve free trade by 2010
while developing countries would require another decade to complete their
liberalization programs.  To prevent any single country from blocking
liberalization, APEC leaders agreed to a "consensus minus x" formula
allowing members that "are not ready to participate" in an APEC trade
agreement to "join at a later date."  The APEC leaders charged their trade
ministers with developing a framework within which to negotiate and
implement a free trade agreement that could be approved at the next year's
Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan.
<P>
          In Bogor, the APEC leaders also agreed to a voluntary
Concord on Investment Principles.  While its language was not entirely to
the liking of the U.S., Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was "pleased on
the substance" of the nonbinding Concord.  Also at Bogor, the APEC
leaders established an advisory council, the Asia Pacific Business Forum, to
increase private sector participation in APEC.  They also endorsed the
ongoing work of the Committee on Trade and Investment to facilitate trade
by standardizing custom procedures and harmonizing product standards.
<P>
          As host for the APEC Leaders' Meeting at Osaka in
November 1995, Japan will supervise the development of the trade
liberalization framework in APEC.  Given Japan's political uncertainties and
its reputation for closed markets, this responsibility will be a serious
challenge for Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.  New Zealand's Foreign
Minister Don McKinnon noted, "I think this will be Japan's real chance to
display real economic leadership.  If they want a seat on the United Nations
Security Council, they will have to take another major step to fulfill that
broader leadership role."
<P>
          There are many disturbing signs that the Japanese government
is either unwilling or unable to exercise leadership.  The widely reported
failure of Prime Minister Murayama and his Socialist-Liberal Democrat
cabinet to act decisively after the recent earthquake in Kobe suggests, at a
minimum, a lack of political resolve.  The government's performance raises
similar questions about its resolve in developing an acceptable framework
for APEC trade liberalization.
<P>
          There is a wide disagreement among APEC members on how
to implement the Bogor declaration.  To devise and win approval for a trade
liberalization framework, the Japanese government must exercise economic
and political leadership.  Unfortunately, the Japanese government so far has
avoided making difficult decisions on the central issue of trade
liberalization, expending its energy instead on peripheral issues of trade
facilitation and development.
<P>
       To the dismay of the United States and other APEC members,
Japan's first action as chairman of APEC was to propose creating a new
APEC foreign aid conduit, to be known as Partners for Peace, to promote
economic development in less-developed APEC countries.  Other APEC
governments criticized the Japanese government for focusing on what at best
would be a duplication of existing foreign aid programs and urged Japanese
officials instead to tackle the tough issue of devising a framework for trade
liberalization.  Under fire, Japan subsequently withdrew its proposal and
suggested instead that APEC members accelerate the implementation of their
Uruguay Round liberalization commitments.  Nevertheless, this early effort
suggests that Prime Minister Murayama may be unable to surmount
bureaucratic resistance and protectionist elements in his own coalition to
forge an acceptable framework agreement without the firm resolve of other
APEC members.  Therefore, President Clinton should:
Urge the Japanese government to devise an acceptable framework for an
APEC free trade and investment area by 2020.
<P>
EXPANDING NAFTA IN LATIN AMERICA
<P>
     Held in Miami on December 9-11, 1994, the Summit of the
Americas made history.  For the first time, all of the nations of the
Americas except Cuba were represented by democratically elected heads of
government.  More important, the heads of government established the
policy framework for a new hemispheric partnership based on open markets,
free trade, democratic governance, and respect for human and property
rights.  Significantly, all 33 heads of government agreed to make NAFTA
the benchmark treaty for creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA) by the year 2005.
<P>
          On the last day of the summit, President Clinton emphasized
America's commitment to the expansion of NAFTA by announcing that
formal talks with Chile would begin in 1995.  Even though widely
anticipated, this announcement generated a wave of enthusiasm throughout
Latin America.  Nine days later, however, the Mexican peso collapsed. 
Since then, the Mexican economic crisis and the Clinton Administration's
questionable bailout scheme have commanded all of Washington's attention. 
Some members of Congress have suggested that the Mexican crisis may
have derailed prospects for the approval of fast-track authority to expand
NAFTA to Chile.  Even one of NAFTA's strongest advocates,
Representative Jim Kolbe (R-AZ), admitted that new fast-track authority
would have to be put on hold "for the time being."
<P>
          Nevertheless, Republican leaders in Congress have pledged
to support the Administration's request for new fast-track authority as long
as it does not empower the Administration to impose labor and
environmental standards on Chile or other countries.  During a February 8
Heritage Foundation conference, Representative Phil Crane (R-IL), Chairman
of the Trade Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, said
he would move a "clean trade bill" to the House floor this year (1) granting
fast-track authority for Chile's accession to NAFTA, (2) extending the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and (3) providing trade parity
to small Caribbean countries with NAFTA.
<P>
          On February 13, 1995, U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor made clear that the Clinton Administration "intends to continue to
link labor and environment to trade, and the linkage is particularly relevant
in the upcoming negotiations to extend NAFTA to Chile."  Moreover,
Kantor indicated that the "principle of including labor and environment
should be carried forward in subsequent trade negotiations in Latin America
and Asia as well."  The Republican leadership, however, bitterly opposes
linking trade sanctions with labor and environmental issues.  In a February
9, 1995, speech to the Chemical Manufacturers Association, Representative
Bill Archer (R-TX) flatly stated, "there will be no inclusion of authority to
monkey around with labor standards and environmental standards around the
world." 
<P>
           Differences between Congress and the Administration over
the scope of the new fast-track negotiating authority could delay or derail
its approval.  That would be unfortunate.  Chile's quick accession to
NAFTA is needed for several reasons.
<P>
REASON #1:  It would reaffirm the U.S.  commitment to expansion of free
trade and democracy in the Americas and creation by 2005 of a hemispheric
free trade area.
<P>
REASON #2:  It would help to restore investor confidence in all of Latin
America, including Mexico.  In the wake of the Mexican peso's collapse
and the financial fallout this has caused throughout Latin America, the
region's democracies are waiting for the U.S.  to raffirm its commitment to
expanding NAFTA to all of the Western Hemisphere.
<P>
REASON #3:  Chile would anchor NAFTA in South America.  For the Free
Trade Area of the Americas to become a reality, NAFTA and Mercosur
must converge over time into a single free trade area, with NAFTA serving
as the benchmark agreement.  Argentina and Brazil are two of three "Big
Emerging Markets" in Latin America.   Mexico is the third.  All three are
critical elements in the Clinton Administration's export strategy and are
essential if the Summit of the Americas' central goal of creating an FTAA
within the next decade is to be achieved.
<P>
REASON #4:  Chile's economy is the freest and the best-managed in Latin
America.  Over the past decade, Chile's gross domestic product has grown
by an average of six percent per year.  Chile has even privatized its social
security system.  As a result, the assets of Chile's private pension funds are
equivalent to 50 percent of the country's annual Gross Domestic Product of
slightly more than $40 billion.  Chile has achieved a remarkable and painful
transition from socialism to military dictatorship and, finally, to stable
democracy. 
<P>
REASON #5:  U.S.  exporters and investors would benefit immediately. 
The tariff reductions Chile would make under a NAFTA agreement, plus the
transparent rules of the game established by NAFTA, would spur increased
U.S.  investment in Chile.
<P>
     Clearly, the national interests of both the U.S.  and Chile would be
served by having Chile join NAFTA as quickly as possible.  Chile not only
would provide a bridge for strengthening U.S.  relations with Argentina and
Brazil, but also would serve as a commercial gateway for U.S.  trade with
Asia by U.S.  companies established in Chile and the Mercosur countries. 
<P>
           President Clinton committed the U.S.  to a timetable for
Chile's admission to NAFTA at the Summit of the Americas.  American,
Canadian, and Mexican trade negotiators have laid the groundwork for
formal negotiations.  Chile already has its negotiating team in place and is
ready to get started.  Any delay would be interpreted as a failure of
American resolve and international leadership.  It would also be a blow to
democracy, free trade, and free-market reforms in the Americas.  To avert
this delay, the Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Ask Congress for fast-track negotiating authority unencumbered by harmful
labor and environmental restrictions.  Some members of Congress have
announced their support for new fast-track authority, provided that labor
standards and environmental issues are excluded.  President Clinton must
realize that insisting on negotiating authority on labor and environmental
issues will kill fast track.  The Clinton Administration therefore should drop
labor and environmental provisions from any trade bill submitted to
Congress.
<P>
Start formal negotiations to extend NAFTA membership to Chile within 30
days of introducing the new fast-track request to Congress, wrapping up a
deal before December 31, 1995.  With NAFTA already in place,
negotiations can reach agreement quickly with Chile on the terms of
accession.  Both Canada and Mexico enthusiastically support Chile's
membership in NAFTA.
<P>
Identify additional candidates for NAFTA membership in the Asia and Latin
America.  Candidates could include Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore
in Asia and Argentina and Trinidad and Tobago in Latin America.  Formal
negotiations with these countries should begin as quickly as possible. 
NAFTA must not be seen in Asia or elsewhere in the world as an
exclusionary trade pact.  It should be open to any country willing and able
to abide by its standards.  Therefore, the Clinton Administration should
move quickly to identify other qualified countries and invite them to join
NAFTA.  Expanding NAFTA to the Asia-Pacific is not a substitute for an
APEC free trade and investment agreement, but an interim step that would
accelerate the trade liberalization process in APEC.  Recent history suggests
that trade liberalization at one level can hasten trade liberalization at other
levels.  The willingness of the United States to pursue a subregional
approach in NAFTA is widely credited with motivating the European Union
and other countries to press for the successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round.  Likewise, expanding NAFTA to some countries in Asia may
prompt other countries to accelerate APEC trade liberalization so their
economies will not be left out of a free trade area.  
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The Clinton Administration has committed the United States to
expanding NAFTA by extending membership first to Chile and then to other
countries in Asia and the Americas as quickly as possible.  In the wake of
the Mexican crisis, Chile and the rest of Latin America need a strong
reaffirmation of the U.S.  commitment to democracy, open economies, and
free trade.  Some populist demagogues and greedy special interests want to
argue that the Mexican crisis should derail the expansion of NAFTA and the
creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005 and an APEC free
trade and investment area by 2020.  Such arguments are without merit. 
Delaying these trade liberalization initiatives would be a mistake.  Free trade
based on fair rules of the game for all participants is the surest road to
economic prosperity, jobs, and democratic stability.

<TITLE>STARTING OVER AT THE U.S.-JAPAN SUMMIT -- Heritage </TITLE>

U.S.-Japan Summit: Security Is Now More Important Than Trade," 
February 9, 1994)<P>

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>
            

     Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's January 11 visit
to Washington offers Bill Clinton a much-needed second chance to
devise a workable policy toward Japan. His first try was ill-conceived,
poorly executed, and ultimately unsuccessful. By badgering Japan to
agree to numerical trade targets, the Clinton Administration not only
has failed to resolve the longstanding trade dispute with Japan, but also
has missed a golden opportunity to work more closely with the
reformers who, like many in the U.S., want a more open Japanese
economy. The best way to resolve this trade dispute without harming
the valuable strategic relationship between the U.S. and Japan is for the
Clinton Administration to drop its managed trade policies toward Japan
and to form an alliance with Japanese who want broader economic
change.<P>
     Clinton's Japan Policy: A Rushed Political Job. The Clinton
Administration came to office committed to building a new U.S.-Japan
relationship. The Administration argued that the existing relationship
resembled an out-of-balance three-legged stool standing on security, politics,
and economics. The economic leg of this stool, Clinton contended, had to
be extended and strengthened to restore proper equilibrium to the
relationship. Originally conceived as but one element in a three-part
strategy, the trade and economic dimension nevertheless rapidly expanded
in terms of time and effort to become almost the entirety of the Clinton
Administration's approach to Japan. By focusing so much on trade, Clinton
did not restore balance to his three-legged stool; he created a new
imbalance, downplaying important political and security elements of the
U.S.-Japan relationship.<P>
     Clinton's new Japan policy culminated in something called the New
Economic Framework. Cobbled together in Tokyo in July 1993, it was a
rush job. The Framework negotiations were essentially short-term in nature,
geared to make good on the President's promise to produce results in
politically sensitive economic sectors such as autos, auto parts, and
computers. From the very beginning the negotiations over the New
Economic Framework were marked by a high degree of mutual suspicion
and distrust. In October 1994, under pressure of U.S. trade sanctions, the
Framework talks concluded with a last-minute, all-night effort which
produced minimum results. In effect, both governments called a time out in
the increasingly frustrating and contentious talks and agreed to kick the can
down the road.<P>
     U.S. Needs A New Approach. Progress on America's and Japan's
respective economic agendas is important if the two countries are to sustain
and build support for their strategically important relationship. The issue is
not whether Japan should become a more open, consumer-oriented society,
but whether the Clinton Administration's policies offer the best hope for
producing the desired results. The meager results of the Framework talks
thus far argue for de-emphasizing differences on trade strategy and
emphasizing instead the commonality of political, security, and even
economic interests. In other words, the U.S. needs to take a broader strategic
approach to Japan.<P>
     What the Numbers Tell. To start, there is no need for the U.S. to
place such a heavy emphasis on trade policy in defining its relationship with
Japan. When it came to office, the Clinton Administration alleged that the
Japan policies of previous Administrations had failed to produce trade
results. The numbers, however, tell a different story. From from 1987
through 1991, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan fell from $57 billion to $43
billion; total exports to Japan rose by 113 percent, and U.S.-manufactured
exports rose by 64 percent.<P>
     The reasons for the decline had less to do with trade negotiations
than with the fact that Japan's economy was booming and pulling in
American goods and services. The deficit began to go up again when
Japan's economy went into recession in the early 1990s. <P>
     Indeed, the President's own Council of Economic Advisers estimates
that even with near total victory in the Framework negotiations, the trade
deficit would still hover between $40 billion and $50 billion. If this is the
case, it makes little sense to focus so much on trade negotiations. It makes
even less sense to adopt numerical trade targets and other so-called objective
indicators of freer trade. Instead, the main focus of U.S. policy should be on
urging Japan to deregulate and liberalize its entire economy. This would
produce the economic growth needed to stimulate Japanese demand for U.S.
goods and to reduce the trade imbalance with the United States. 
  <P>  This strategy would build on the growing trend inside Japan toward
more deregulation and economic liberalization. By working with reformers
instead of against them in contentious trade talks, the Clinton Administration
could get real results. Rather than being cast as the external force
demanding change in Japan, the U.S. should work with Japan's reformers
to bring internal pressure to bear on Japan's bureaucracy. The result would
be a more open Japanese economy.
  <P>   Centerpiece of Security. However, de-emphasizing trade
negotiations is only one part of this new approach to Japan. The other is to
rediscover the strategic importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship, an
alliance based on a congruence of national interests. Both America and
Japan want an open international trading system and peaceful international
change. Both countries also need to prevent the domination of East Asia by
a hostile power. Across the globe, Japan has backed U.S. diplomatic
initiatives: democracy in Central America, economic development in the
Caribbean basin, the peace process in the Middle East, democracy and
economic reform in the republics of the former Soviet Union, building the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum into an institution for regional
trade liberalization, sending peacekeepers to Cambodia, and supporting U.S.
diplomacy to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
 <P>    At the same time, the U.S.-Japan alliance serves as the centerpiece
of the Asian-Pacific security system and the foundation of its stability and
economic dynamism. This is of direct and immediate importance to U.S.
economic well-being and national security. Beyond the Western Hemisphere,
America's largest markets are in Asia. Last year, trans-Pacific trade totaled
$361 billion, which is over 50 percent greater than trans-Atlantic trade. And
Asia's economies are the fastest-growing in the world.
   <P>  For Japan, Northeast Asia is a tough neighborhood. The Korean
Peninsula remains a conventional, and potentially nuclear, flashpoint. China
faces a daunting political transition when Deng Xiaoping dies. And the
process of democratization and economic reform in Russia promises to be
both protracted and perilous.
  <P>   To meet these challenges, the U.S. and Japan must stand together.
But they cannot do this if they are constantly bickering over negotiations
which have done little to correct the existing trade imbalance. By focusing
so much on trade negotiations, the Clinton White House has overlooked the
value of the alliance and its importance to U.S. regional and global interests.
Statements of the strategic importance of Japan have been confined largely
to the State Department, which is now largely irrelevant to making Japan
policy. That privilege has been reserved primarily by the White House, the
United States Trade Representative, and the Departments of Commerce and
Treasury, none of which has demonstrated a deep understanding of the
strategic relationship between the U.S. and Japan.
 <P>    To get back on track, the Clinton Administration should revive the
U.S.-Japan Global Partnership initiative, which was begun by President
George Bush and then-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in the Tokyo
Declaration of January 1992. The Global Partnership is both a framework
for political and economic cooperation between the U.S. and Japan and an
action plan to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance. Using the Tokyo
Declaration as his guide, President Clinton should begin to reconstruct and
refocus U.S.-Japan relations. Thus, in the meeting with Prime Minister
Murayama, President Clinton should: <P>
 Reaffirm the U.S.-Japan Global Partnership initiative and the commitments
of the Tokyo Declaration. The Tokyo Declaration committed the U.S. and
Japan to cooperate in shaping a post-Cold War international order based on
"shared principles of political and economic freedom, democracy, the rule
of law, and respect for human rights." It also committed both countries to
"taking effective measures to address factors underlying economic friction,
with a focus on issues in their trading and investment relations." The key is
that the Tokyo Declaration puts the issue of trade in a strategic context. It
recognizes that progress in trade makes little sense if it irreparably severs
the strategic ties linking the U.S. and Japan.<P>
Appoint a binational U.S.-Japan Commission to report on how best to
implement the provisions of the Tokyo Declaration and the Global
Partnership initiative.
Highlight the U.S.-Japan alliance and its continuing relevance to both
countries' security interests. Even in today's post-Cold War world, the
alliance represents a congruence of national interests. It serves as the
cornerstone of stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region. This fact
needs to be at the heart of U.S. policy toward Japan. <P>
 Shift the spotlight of the U.S.-Japan relationship away from trade
negotiations. Instead, the U.S. should focus more on urging the Japanese to
deregulate and liberalize their economy. America will have powerful allies
inside Japan. Taking this approach will be far more productive than
badgering the Japanese over trade targets and other indicators. The Clinton
approach thus far has produced only politically motivated stonewalling
inside Japan.
 <P>    Over the past two years, the Clinton Administration has spent much
time and energy trying to build a new framework for the U.S.-Japan
relationship, one firmly attached to what it calls a "results-oriented" trade
policy. This approach has failed. President Clinton has the opportunity in the
upcoming summit meeting with Prime Minister Murayama to start over. The
first step is to recognize the central importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance
to the strategic interests of the United States. U.S. trade relations with Japan
are very important, but not more so than the relationship itself.

 <TITLE>HOW THE U.S. CAN PROMOTE GREATER FREE TRADE IN ASIA -- Heritage </TITLE>

<H3>How the U.S. Can Promote Greater Free Trade in Asia</H3>
Robert B. Zoellick Speaking in Heritage's Van Andel Center, November 9, 1994
<P>
<br>
     I would like to thank Heritage for arranging this panel on the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.  I remember discussing
with Treasury Secretary Baker in 1988 the prospect of forming a
similar group for Finance Ministers.  We moved on to other duties that
summer and never had a chance to launch it.  When the Australians and
others launched the APEC idea in 1989, it very much fit our strategic
view.<P>
     I want to focus on three topics.  The first is the strategic
perspective.  The second is the general purposes of APEC.  And the
third is some suggestions on what APEC's future agenda might be.
   <P>  First, on the strategic perspective.  We are at the end of one
era and at the beginning of another.  So it is important to try to
convey to the public a sense of how institutions like NAFTA and APEC
fit together.  While it is perhaps a simplification, I would suggest
that after World War II, the primary strategic objective of U.S. 
foreign policy was to try to transform Western Europe and Japan into
both allies and partners so we could cooperate on a common agenda. 
The three core elements of that strategy were containment of
communism, reconstruction of Western Europe and Japan, and the
creation of a liberal economic order, particularly with respect to
capital and trade flows.
     <P> Today the United States has two similar strategic objectives. 
The first is to ensure that it maintains strong ties with Western
Europe and Japan.  We cannot take those relationships for granted in
the absence of the Cold War glue.  There are many issues on the
horizon that could lead to strains on those relationships.  We also
have the second objective:  to reach out to the next group of
potential partners that can help us in assuming mutual
responsibilities and promoting mutual economic, political, and
security interests.  Not surprisingly, these potential partners are
the nations that are building market economies, civil societies, and
pluralistic and democratic systems.  The obvious candidates are in
Latin America, Central/Eastern Europe, and, of course, East Asia.
    <P> When you look at the world with this framework, you can see the
interconnections between the things that the United States has been
trying to do through NAFTA, the Enterprise for the Americas
Initiative, APEC, the promotion of a special U.S.-EC relationship, and
our suggestions for offering special free trade arrangements to
Central and Eastern Europe.  This is the political economy structure
for U.S.  foreign policy after the Cold War.  It could be a vehicle
for explaining to the American public how these issues relate to one
another.
   <P>  My second topic is the general purposes of APEC.  I believe
regional integration can support ongoing global liberalization. 
Regional integration is natural.  It reflects economic interdependence
and a number of challenges that cross national lines.  However, it is
very important that we make sure that regional initiatives accommodate
other regional efforts and support ongoing, global liberalization. 
The countries of APEC, by and large, have prospered from an open
global economic system.  That system has been the source of much of
their astounding economic growth.  So by their very nature, most APEC
nations remain very oriented toward an open global system. 
    <P> So even though the increased trade and investment flows within
the Pacific basin provide a basis for new regional arrangements, I
think all the countries of Asia recognize that they benefit from a
healthy, global system.  APEC must fit within and support that global
system.  Similarly, it is important to demonstrate how arrangements
like NAFTA, the Asian Free Trade Agreement, or other groups relate to,
and are mutually supportive of, both APEC and the global system.  It
is also important to relate other Asian developments -- for example,
the growth triangle of Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, or the
economic region of Southern China including Hong Kong -- within this
integrative model.
   <P> NAFTA and APEC can also be employed to develop innovative
liberalizing arrangements that later can be expanded.  Let me cite
from the NAFTA example.  The provisions in NAFTA on intellectual
property, investment, services, and agriculture go far beyond what we
expect to be able to get in the Uruguay Round.  So there is the
possibility that by creating a model with one group of trading
partners, we can move the liberalization agenda ahead in ways that may
be adopted later by others.  APEC offers the same potential.
 <P>    These efforts also help fight protectionism at home.  The OECD
reported recently that over the last ten or twelve years, twenty of
the 24 OECD countries had moved in the direction of trade protection. 
The so-called bicycle theory suggests that if we are unable to move
the trade liberalization agenda forward, then the forces of
protectionism will pull us down.  Regional efforts can keep up the
momentum for liberalization.
  <P>   Another general purpose of APEC is to ensure that the economic
infrastructure of an integrated Pacific community includes the United
States.  There has been a great increase in intra-Asian and trans-
Pacific trade flows.  One statistic really brought this home to me
recently.  The merchandise trade between Singapore and Taiwan and the
United States is now 20 percent greater than the United States'
merchandise trade with Germany.  When you consider how most Americans
perceived Singapore and Taiwan twenty or thirty or even ten years ago,
I think that is a startling fact; I am sure it is one that most
Europeans do not recognize. 
    <P> The decisions we make today about economic infrastructure will
affect patterns of interaction far into the future.  In some ways, the
APEC agenda is a twentieth century analogy to what happened in the
U.S.  West in the nineteenth century.  In that century, the location
of the telegraph lines and railroads influenced the patterns of
communication, the economic flows, and how integration took place. 
Today, in the Pacific, we are determining where the airline routes go,
what telecommunication systems we will use, what languages people will
speak, where students will study, and many other questions that will
set patterns of future interaction.  It is in the interests of America
and of Asia that the U.S.  turn out to be a key part of this
"infrastructure."
    <P> The third purpose of APEC is that good economic ties create a
stronger foundation for America's ongoing security engagement in the
Pacific.  I'll illustrate the point briefly by referencing a comment
made to me by a former Australian Defense Minister.  He said that
today the policy planning staffs throughout East Asia are examining
two questions very seriously.  One is whether they should develop
weapons of mass destruction.  The other is whether they should shift
their conventional forces from internal security to force projection. 
At least in his view, the primary variable in those analyses is
whether the United States maintains a forward deployed presence in
Asia.  I believe, not surprisingly, that it is very important for the
United States to maintain that presence.  I also believe, however,
that it will be very difficult for any administration to maintain that
presence well into the future unless it can demonstrate to the
American people that we have strong economic and political ties to the
region.  So an organization like APEC, or an event like the Seattle
meeting, are ways of getting the message to the American people about
our economic and security interests in the Pacific.
   <P>  One other security point:  economic arrangements within the
Pacific can also support the cooperative security systems that the
Asians are starting to build.  For example, the ASEAN Post-Ministerial
Conference structure has started a security dialogue.  Of course, we
should not overstate the capabilities of these arrangements.  The U.S. 
force presence is going to remain critical for Pacific security. 
Nevertheless, there are areas, such as transparency of defense
budgets, dealing with narcotics problems, piracy, and I hope
proliferation, where Asian cooperation could enable others to share
the load with the U.S.  Cooperation on economic topics can prepare the
way for political and security arrangements.
  <P>   The fourth purpose that I see for APEC is that it can be an
institutional vehicle for supporting U.S.  business.  I will cite one
example.  The United States promoted a telecommunications group, both
because it is important for the region's economic infrastructure, as I
noted earlier, but also because we had very strong business support. 
We tried to involve these U.S.  businesses in the work that we
promoted at APEC.
   <P>  The fifth purpose for APEC has run throughout my comments:  APEC
can affect U.S.  public opinion.  We have extraordinary opportunities
and interests in Asia.  Yet I think that view is not well understood,
particularly on this coast.  An institution like APEC can help get the
message out.  Meetings like the Seattle conference help focus
attention in the United States.
   <P>  The sixth purpose of APEC is to help position the United States
globally.  While many people are anxious about the U.S.  role in the
world, the United States remains the one global power -- whether in
terms of security, economics, or politics.  Our share of world GNP
remains in the low 20s, as it has for about ten or twenty years.  The
United States' interests obviously cannot be restricted to the
Americas, Europe, or, for that matter, Asia.  Our objective should be
to integrate ourselves effectively into all those regions, so as to
enhance our global influence.
  <P>   Finally, I wanted to talk briefly about what should be on APEC's
agenda.  It is important to recognize that APEC's gradual pace of
development has been dictated by practical considerations of the need
to bring our Asian, and particularly ASEAN, partners along.  Singapore
has been a great booster of APEC from the very start, but other ASEAN
countries have worried that APEC might in some way dwarf ASEAN's role. 
They were also concerned about whether the institutionalization of
APEC might create a bureaucracy that could undermine their interests. 
So it took four years to get APEC off the ground. 
   <P>  At this point, APEC needs two things.  First, it needs a vision,
a sense of where it is going.  But APEC also needs practical steps
that will demonstrate how it can achieve goals that will move toward
that vision.  The "Eminent Persons" report is an effort to devise
vision.  Fred Bergsten has been the United States representative. 
From the work that I have seen, I think this group has done a very
good job.  I hope their report will be published, because it can help
launch the debate on APEC's long-term view.
  <P>   My vision is for free trade throughout the Pacific community.  I
realize that this goal will not be easy to achieve.  But I think we
will be better able to organize political and business support in the
United States if we have a sense of where we are going.
  <P>   The near-term agenda for APEC depends a great deal on NAFTA and
the Uruguay Round, not surprisingly given the fact that, at least in
my concept, all of these efforts are related.  In the very near-term,
I continue to think that there is an opportunity for APEC to give a
very needed push to completing the Uruguay Round.  I suggested after
the Tokyo Economic Summit that the U.S.  should send an emissary to
ASEAN and other countries in Asia with a message:  "Now that we have
moved forward the negotiations on market access by coming forward with
a package in Tokyo, it is time for those in Asia who also support free
trade and who want the Uruguay Round to succeed to come up with a
package that we could use at APEC."
    <P> An APEC initiative on the Uruguay Round would be a wonderful
opportunity to demonstrate that APEC stands for something.  It would
also demonstrate something that I think Asians are slow in recognizing
-- that is, the decisions on multi-lateral trade issues are not only
in the hands of the United States, the European Community, and Japan. 
The countries of East Asia are now big enough economically, and
certainly their prospects are sizable enough, that it is very
important that they also make market access offers, particularly in
the services area.  Seattle offers an opportunity for the countries of
APEC to send a signal about their outward orientation by giving the
Uruguay Round a push. 
  <P>   Beyond the Uruguay Round, and I hope beyond the NAFTA, I have a
list of ten items for APEC's future agenda.  I will touch on each, to
give you a sense for future discussions.  Some items are small, to
create movement in the near term.  Some are more ambitious.
     <P>The first is a trade and investment consultation agreement.  It
is still striking that there are many obstacles to trade and
investment that probably nobody really thinks are a good idea, but
have remained in place because countries have not devoted attention to
the detailed work of eliminating them.
   <P>  Second, I would focus on infrastructure developments.  We could
start by following through on the working groups that have been
established in APEC.  These groups deal with topics like
transportation, telecommunications, higher education and training, and
customs processes.  My former colleague, Sandy Kristoff, who is now on
the NSC staff, did a super job of trying to overcome Korean customs
impediments.  A great deal more needs to be done in this area.  In
transportation, for example, we have been trying to overcome barriers
through airline negotiations, which continue to operate through
bilateral agreements.  If the United States and Asian countries are
interested in having more contact, whether by students or
businesspeople, we should welcome competition that will help us lower
air fares.
  <P>   A third item would be mutual recognition of product standards and
testing.  We have launched some efforts in these areas with the EC. 
Some of this work is handled through standards organizations.  But we
could simply start reviewing these items, one by one, particularly in
the area of high technology, to see whether standards or approval
processes are getting in the way of business.
     <P>Fourth, APEC could address items that might fall by the wayside
in the Uruguay Round process.  This agenda might include topics like
government procurement, intellectual property, financial services, and
perhaps competition policies.  We could seek to bring together like-
minded countries to push the liberalization agenda forward,
demonstrate successful records, and then, I hope, bring others along
over time.
     <P>The fifth topic could be an investment code.  It is striking the
degree to which trade now follows investment, as opposed to vice-
versa.  As I recall, over a majority of our trade with Europe
represents intra-company trade flows.  Western Europe and North
America have a very rich exchange of direct investment, but neither
the European Community nor the United States has a similar pattern
with Japan.  This asymmetry of direct investment could be affecting
our trade patterns.
     <P>One might begin with a voluntary investment code.  It could cover
topics like national treatment, transparency, non-discrimination, and
the right of establishment.  All countries, including the U.S., have
some restrictions on foreign investment.  Countries might list those
limits and then use the GATT framework or such an agreement to roll
back those limits over time.
    <P> Investment is also very important to competition in services. 
When you examine how trade agreements deal with services, you observe
that the key to liberalization is to open investment opportunities for
people who want to start service operations in other economies.
    <P> The sixth idea is to involve the finance ministers in macro-
economic discussions.
    <P> Seven, APEC should explore ties with other institutions, for
example, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and IFC.  To help
avoid making APEC into a bureaucracy, it would be natural to involve
the ADB and others with the infrastructure program.
   <P>  The eighth point would be to continue to involve private
business, for the reasons that I noted.
  <P>   The ninth idea is of a slightly different type, which is to
explore the basis for sub-regional ties.  I know there is some concern
about this in some quarters in Asia, but it would be useful to examine
how the NAFTA and the Asian Free Trade Agreement might be able to
interact to liberalize trade, perhaps ultimately by creating free
trade arrangements between one another.  This would have to be done
carefully so as not to discriminate against others.
    <P> My tenth and final point is to give the APEC ministerials a
particular focus.  For example, if the Ministers launched an agenda
like the one I have outlined, they could review the progress of
specific topics each year.
   <P>  I think that what happens over the next week on NAFTA is going to
go a long way toward determining whether APEC has much life or future. 
I find it striking, as I am sure many of you do, that the President is
working very hard on NAFTA.  But he is struggling to get 100 votes
from his party, when he has 258 in the House of Representatives.  When
the Bush Administration secured fast track negotiating authority, over
the opponents of both NAFTA and the Uruguay Round, we got 93
Democratic votes.  Now I have just got to believe that one way or
another there is the capability to beg, borrow, or steal 100
Democratic votes.  And if they do, I am pretty confident the
Republicans will put up 120. 
   <P>  It would be a tremendously negative signal for everybody around
the world if the President could not get NAFTA through.  It would be a
signal to American politicians, most of whom do not focus on trade
issues, that protectionism was the favored course.  It would be a
signal to countries like France in the Uruguay Round that they would
be nuts to accept a difficult agriculture deal because they couldn't
be sure the Americans could get it through in our own Congress. 
Countries in Asia would say, "Why should we be making arrangements
with a country that can't do the sensible thing with 90 million people
on its border."  The ramifications of this, not only for economics,
but for foreign policy and security policy, are absolutely enormous.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Behind President Bill Clinton's confrontational approach toward
trade with Japan are two controversial ideas: a government industrial
policy that subsidizes U.S. emerging technologies and government
management of the flow of U.S. exports and imports. Inspired by these
two ideas, known generally as managed trade, Clinton is using trade
negotiations with Japan to secure guaranteed shares of the Japanese
market for U.S. exporters, possibly at the expense of other American
businesses which are already successful in Japan. Moreover, Clinton
has renewed congressionally mandated "Super 301" trade authority that
allows the U.S. to impose sanctions against foreign trading partners
accused of unfair trading practices. By September 30, the Clinton
Administration will name those countries whose trade practices it
feels unfairly restrict U.S. exports and will threaten them with Super
301 trade sanctions. <P>
     Key Clinton economic advisers, including United States Trade
Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor and Assistant USTR Charlene
Barshefsky, are threatening to retaliate against U.S. trading partners
unless they agree to increase American imports. Specifically, the
Administration wants the Japanese government to agree to specified
increases in imports of U.S. goods and services. <P>
     The Administration contends that this approach has worked before
and points to the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement as a
successful example of "managed trade," arguing that it established
"numerical targets" by which U.S. semiconductor producers received a
guaranteed share of the Japanese market. Moreover, the Administration
argues that Japan agreed to these terms because of the threat of
retaliation by the U.S. The Administration is wrong. Although U.S.
semiconductor market share did in fact increase in Japan, this
increase had little to do with numerical targets established in the
Semiconductor Agreement. Instead, the agreement inspired U.S. firms to
negotiate their own entry into the Japanese market without relying on
government help. If the agreement can be called a success, in other
words, it is not because of "numerical targets" but because it
fostered private sector solutions undertaken because of business'
frustration with the results of years of failed government attempts to
manage the trade in semiconductors.<P>
     Because it has learned the wrong lesson from the 1991
Semiconductor Agreement, the Clinton Administration has based its
trade policy with Japan on the Agreement's anti-market principles of
guaranteed markets, threats of retaliation through tariffs and quotas,
and subsidies for U.S. industry. Rather than basing U.S. trade policy
on such self-defeating protectionism, the Administration should help
open markets overseas. Specifically, it should:
<P>
Seek rapid congressional approval of the General Agreement on Tariffs
     and Trade (GATT). This wide-ranging trade agreement between the
     U.S. and 123 other nations should be approved by Congress as soon
     as possible. Based on seven years of multilateral negotiations,
     the current GATT agreement will reduce tariffs by as much as 40
     percent worldwide and expand international trade by $235 billion
     annually.
<P>
Extend free trade agreements to other countries in Latin America,
     Asia, and Europe. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
     expanded the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement to include Mexico.
     That agreement, or separate free trade treaties, now should be
     expanded to other countries, including Chile and Argentina.
     Moreover, the President should raise the free trade ante by
     offering to negotiate free trade agreements with Hong Kong,
     Japan, Singapore, and emerging market economies in Central and
     Eastern Europe.
<P>
Pursue a pact liberalizing trade among the members of the Asia-Pacific
     Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. (APEC members include
     Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan,
     South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the
     Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.)
     The 17-member trade forum is a good foundation from which to
     launch a program of liberalized trade. The U.S. exports over $150
     billion in goods and services to the Pacific Rim each year. (U.S.
     Merchandise Trade: December 1993 (hereafter cited as USMT:12/93),
     U.S. Department of Commerce, February 17, 1994.) An APEC-based
     free trade area inevitably will expand that trade.
<P>
Foster private sector strategic alliances between U.S. and foreign
     firms. The best way for American companies to gain a share of the
     Japanese market is to form private joint ventures with Japanese
     companies. These joint ventures should be encouraged and made
     part of any bilateral trade agreements with Japan or any other
     U.S. trading partner.
<P>
WHAT IS MANAGED TRADE?<P>
     Managed trade is government regulation of trade and international
investments to achieve specific levels of imports and exports. Among
the tools used by governments to manage trade are: quotas and other
limits on imports, demands for guaranteed shares of sales in another
country's market, demands that other countries adopt economic policies
that favor imports, subsidies for selected industries or government-
business "partnerships," subsidies for export industries, and some
form of national industrial and trade planning.<P>
     Clinton's approach to trade with Japan reflects this philosophy.
The Administration is pursuing a two-pronged approach: 1) protecting
U.S. industries at home through trade barriers and subsidies while 2)
negotiating numerical targets and guaranteed market shares in Japan
for specific U.S. industries.<P>
     An example of the first approach is the Administration's decision
to subsidize domestic development of flat panel displays used in
laptop and notebook computers and related products. Under President
George Bush, the U.S. imposed a tariff on the import of these displays
in an attempt to give the infant American industry a chance to
establish itself. The tariff was removed in 1993 after it was
discovered that the U.S. industry was incapable of supplying quality
displays to the U.S. computer industry. (See "Certain High-Information
Content Flat Panel Displays and Display Glass From Japan," U.S.
International Trade Commission, USITC Publication 2413, August 1991,
and Bryan T. Johnson, "A Guide to Antidumping Laws: America's Unfair
Trade Practice," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 906, July 21,
1992.) Now, however, the Clinton Administration plans to spend over $1
billion in the next decade to help U.S. businesses develop the most
advanced flat panel displays in the world. (Jonathon Rauch, "The
Visible Hand," National Journal, July 7, 1994, p. 1614.)<P>
     As an example of the second approach, the Clinton Administration,
through the U.S.-Japan Framework negotiations begun in April 1993, is
pressuring the Japanese government to accept "qualitative and
quantitative" numerical targets for U.S. exports to Japan. (From
"Joint Statement on the United States-Japan Framework for a New
Economic Partnership," press statement issued by USTR, April 1993.)
The Administration is asking the Japanese to guarantee a portion of
their domestic market to U.S. automobiles, auto parts,
telecommunication services, and insurance policies. The
Administration, moreover, is seeking to increase these guaranteed
shares by a predetermined percentage each year.
<P>
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS AS INVESTORS<P>
     These approaches are doomed to fail. Managed trade policies
require that the government decide which industry will perform best in
foreign markets. Government determines which products and services
receive government assistance, while other products and services not
seen as worthy are left to market forces. The assumption is that
government knows better than private investors which products to
develop and bring to market. <P>
     If this assumption were true, managed trade would have a
successful track record of picking winners and losers. But this is not
the case. In fact, governments are more apt to pick losers than
winners. The reason: government bureaucrats have a short-sighted view
of profitable products and technologies. Bureaucrats in charge of
picking which industries receive government subsidies or guaranteed
shares of foreign markets usually choose existing technologies, not
the more promising ones that may be profitable in the future. 
<P>
     There are numerous examples of failed industrial policy,
including:
<P>
In the U.S.
<P>
Sematech. <P>
     One of the most successful examples of industrial policy in the
United States is supposed to be Sematech, a jointly funded government-
business partnership aimed at developing advanced semiconductors.
(Robert S. Williams and George C. Lodge, Sematech, Harvard Business
School Case Study, 1988.) However, after seven years and nearly $1.5
billion spent, Sematech has produced few marketable products; some of
its biggest projects are failures. For example, Sematech funded
attempts by some companies to produce advanced lithography equipment
which etches the electrical circuit patterns into electronic
components. The project collapsed after consuming tens of millions of
dollars of Sematech's taxpayer-subsidized budget. ("Govt High-Tech
Boondoggles: Clinton Computer-Screen Next Failure?," Investor's
Business Daily, May 6, 1994, p. 1.) <P>
     Meanwhile, though remaining committed to Sematech's basic
mission, Sematech partners like American Telephone and Telegraph
(AT&T) and others have entered joint ventures with Japanese
semiconductor firms to gain access to advanced products and
production. AT&T has two joint ventures, one with Mitsubishi Electric
Ltd. begun in 1990, and three different arrangements with Nippon
Electric Company, also begun in 1990. While the jury is still out on
just how successful these ventures will be for AT&T, they demonstrate
how the company has chosen avenues other than government subsidies to
enter the semiconductor market. <P>
     To be sure, Sematech may have helped some companies pay for new
research and development projects. However, those "successes" came at
the expense of diverting capital from companies that lacked government
funding to others that received such funding. In fact, some of the
companies denied government funding achieved equal or greater success.
For example, California-based Cypress Semiconductor corporation is not
a member of Sematech, yet it produces one of the world's fastest
static random access memory (SRAM) chips, used in supercomputers to
store and retrieve data. It developed this product without help from
the government. Cypress Semiconductor CEO T.J. Rodgers says: "Sematech
has waged a public relations campaign to claim credit for the [U.S.
semiconductor industry] comeback. It is a preposterous claim. It is
true that Washington spent or will spend $1 billion of taxpayer money
on the Sematech boondoggle. It is true that the U.S. semiconductor
industry has experienced a resurgence. It is not true that one had
much to do with the other." (Dr. T. J. Rodgers, statement given in
testimony before the House Committee on Science, Space, and
Technology, Subcommittee on Technology, Environment, and Aviation,
March 25, 1993.)
<P>
Very High Speed Integrated Circuits (VHSIC). <P>
     Another U.S. industrial policy failure was the attempt to develop
advanced electrical circuits needed for military computers and
hardware such as shipboard computer systems, mobile computer products,
and a host of other products. From 1979 to 1990, the U.S. government
spent over $1 billion to support the building of advanced circuits to
meet the needs of future electronic equipment. What it got was
computer chips for existing equipment, despite market trends toward
production of computer chips that were far more advanced. The result:
$1 billion for no lasting marketable product. ("Govt High-Tech
Boondoggles," op. cit. See also Katie Hafner, "Does Industrial Policy
Work? Lessons from Sematech," The New York Times, November 7, 1993, p.
5.)
<P>
In Japan<P>
High Definition Television (HDTV). <P>
     HDTVs are next-generation TVs with better resolution, movie
screen dimensions, and compact disc-quality sound. Japan's HDTV
project was begun in the early 1980s and by 1985 was being funded
directly by the Japanese government. By the late 1980s, President Bush
was considering adopting a U.S. industrial policy for an HDTV project,
but he rejected it while Japan's project went forward. In the
meantime, some U.S. companies joined forces to build a system with an
emerging technology based on digital transmissions, an advanced way to
transmit data in large quantities very quickly. Japan's government-
funded project used older technology based on analog transmissions,
which is a slower way to transmit data. Thus, while Japan had the
first HDTV, the U.S. product is far more advanced and will become the
standard for HDTV systems elsewhere. Japan's industrial policy failed
where the U.S. market succeeded.<P>
     These examples show a common problem with industrial policy: it
tends to favor existing technology over emerging, often more promising
technology. While the market cannot always foresee future emerging
technology, private investors are better able to determine how much a
potential project may be worth by spending their own money than are
government bureaucrats spending someone else's money.
<P>
THE U.S.-JAPAN SEMICONDUCTOR AGREEMENT<P>
     Industrial policies fail because governments lack the knowledge,
incentives, and expertise to influence markets successfully. But
industrial policy is only one part of the President's managed trade
agenda. The other is the pursuit of guaranteed shares of foreign
markets. To justify such policies, the Clinton Administration is
relying on the 1991 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement as a model of
effective managed trade policy. A closer analysis of this arrangement
reveals that it has not done what the Administration claims.<P>
     In 1991, President Bush signed a trade agreement with Japan
seeking to increase the U.S. share of the Japanese semiconductor
market. The Clinton Administration maintains that this agreement
guaranteed a 20 percent portion of the Japanese market to foreign-made
semiconductors, mainly U.S. products, and argues that this guarantee,
together with threats of U.S. trade retaliation, has forced the
Japanese to buy more U.S. semiconductors. The Administration is wrong.<P>
     The Clinton Administration's argument actually is based on Ronald
Reagan's 1986 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. This agreement,
among other things, called for incremental increases in Japanese
purchases of foreign-made semiconductors and for U.S. trade
retaliation if these targets were not met -- retaliation that was
applied in 1988 in the form of tariffs. The Clinton Administration
points to the general rise in the share of the Japanese market
captured by U.S. producers as proof of this approach's effectiveness.
     But what the Administration ignores is that in the 1991<P>
agreement, Bush eliminated all references to "guaranteed market
shares" and scrapped the Reagan tariffs imposed on Japan. As the chart
above shows, U.S. market share in Japan rose generally through the
last half of the 1980s. But it was not until well after these changes
were made that U.S. companies really gained market share in Japan. The
1991 Agreement makes no reference to guarantees, simply stating that: 
<P>
      The Government of Japan recognizes that the U.S.
     semiconductor industry expects that the foreign market share
     will grow to more than 20 percent of the Japanese market by
     the end of 1992 and considers that this can be realized. The
     Government of Japan welcomes the realization of this
     expectation. The two Governments agree that the above
     statements constitute neither a guarantee, a ceiling nor a
     floor on the foreign market share.
<P>
     If numerical targets and trade retaliation did not increase
foreign market share in the Japanese semiconductor market after 1991,
what did? A closer look at the 1991 agreement shows that market
forces, sound business planning, and other aspects propelled U.S.
firms into the Japanese market. (Industry and Trade Summary:
Semiconductors [hereafter cited as I&TS:S], United States
International Trade Commission, USITC Publication 2708, December 1993,
p. 7.)
<P>
HOW THE U.S. IS SELLING JAPAN MORE SEMICONDUCTORS<P>
     The fact that U.S. semiconductor sales in Japan increased so
dramatically about a year after the 1991 agreement had much to do with
sound business decisions made by U.S. companies in the mid-1980s and
bad business decisions made by their Japanese counterparts. Consider
the following chronology of events:
<P>
As the demand for personal computers increased during the early to
     mid-1980s, so did demand for components used in these computers.
     In the United States alone, sales of computers increased nearly
     1,000 percent from 1981 to 1988 (see chart ). The main components
     of these computers are semiconductors, used in the form of
     dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips and microprocessors.
<P>
Because the Japanese government and private semiconductor producers
     believed demand would increase throughout the 1980s, Japanese
     companies initiated a massive production schedule for DRAMs. Many
     of these Japanese companies saw the expected increase in demand
     and their newly developed DRAM production techniques as reason
     enough to increase production in this crucial product area.
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. companies like Motorola Incorporated and Intel
     Corporation saw an opportunity to increase production in an area
     being neglected by the Japanese: microprocessors. Japanese
     efforts to enter this market were stifled in part because
     Japanese firms were busy trying to out-produce one another in
     DRAMs. Faced with this increased competition and dwindling
     profits, U.S. firms walked away from DRAMs and spent their money
     producing microprocessors. According to Cypress Semiconductor CEO
     Rodgers: "Gordon Moore, the chairman of Intel, admitted that
     Intel deliberately walked out of the DRAM business to make more
     profit. Two years later they made a profit of $600 million in
     microprocessors, which is where they squirreled their money
     instead of DRAMs." (Virginia I. and Steven R. Postrel, "The New
     Mr. Chips, Speaking for Silicon Valley's Upstarts," Reason, July
     1990, p. 31.)
<P>
By 1985, the Japanese had overproduced DRAMs, and prices began to
     fall. To cut their losses, Japanese companies began to sell their
     massive inventories at cut-rate prices, prompting U.S.
     semiconductor companies and the U.S. government to charge the
     Japanese with dumping, or selling them at below market value.
     (Four Years of Experience Under the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor
     Agreement: A Deal is a Deal, Semiconductor Industry Association,
     San Jose, California, November 1990, p. 59. It must be said that
     the Japanese were selling their DRAMs at prices below their costs
     of production, which did injure U.S. companies still engaged in
     DRAM production. However, these lower prices were the result of
     cut-throat competition between Japanese DRAM producers who were
     trying to unload their bloated inventories after the demand for
     DRAMs collapsed. U.S. antidumping provisions do not take these
     issues into account. For a full description of U.S. antidumping
     laws, see Bryan T. Johnson, "A Guide to U.S. Antidumping Laws:
     America's Unfair Trade Practice," Heritage Foundation
     Backgrounder No. 906, July 21, 1992.) This led to the 1986 U.S.-
     Japan Semiconductor Agreement in which the Japanese agreed, among
     other things, to stop dumping DRAMs. The resultant cutback in
     DRAM production led to an eventual price increase and to higher
     Japanese profits, which in the end may have been all that kept
     some of these businesses from going bankrupt.
<P>
While many Japanese consumer electronics companies were losing money
     in DRAMs, companies like Intel and Motorola went on to become the
     world's largest producers of microprocessors, making billions in
     profits. In fact, Intel alone controls almost all of the world's
     supply of high-end microprocessors and nearly three-fourths of
     all microprocessors, truly a tribute to the company's foresight,
     investment strategy, and business planning (see chart below).
<P>
     In short, one reason the U.S. began gaining more market share in
Japan is that some U.S. semiconductor firms walked away from the cut-
throat competition in DRAMs and invested in microprocessors. By 1991,
Japan was virtually dependent on the U.S. for microprocessors, which
they had neglected. For example, the foreign share of the Japanese
microprocessor market is 76.6 percent, and most of this is U.S. market
share. This compares to a 23.2 percent share of Japan's DRAM market.
<P>
THE KEY TO OPEN MARKETS IN JAPAN: STRATEGIC ALLIANCES<P>
     Another reason the U.S. gained market share in Japan is that U.S.
firms took advantage of language in the 1991 agreement which called
for an increase in joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese firms.
These strategic alliances are private sector arrangements between two
or more companies seeking to increase production by taking on a
partner. They can take many forms, including direct acquisition of one
company by another, a joint venture partnership between two companies,
and the merger of two companies to form a single entity for the
desired production. These alliances are key to opening the Japanese
market because they give U.S. firms unique access to Japanese
partners. Moreover, these alliances provide U.S. firms with immediate
access to Japanese technologies -- and vice versa -- that it would
take years for them to develop on their own. (Not all strategic
alliances will be successful. Even some of those mentioned in this
study may end up as failures. The significance of these alliances is
that U.S. companies have sought private sector means to address their
desire for increased market share in Japan and access to advanced
technologies.)<P>
     The real success of the 1991 Semiconductor Agreement lies in the
degree to which it encouraged these strategic alliances between U.S.
and Japanese semiconductor firms, leading the U.S. to ease its
antitrust laws to facilitate joint production arrangements between two
or more companies. (The National Cooperative Research Act of 1984
allowed two or more companies to enter joint research projects without
the threat of extreme antitrust penalties. The law was aimed mainly at
U.S. companies. Later, in 1993, President Clinton expanded the Act to
include joint production ventures, but it was still aimed mainly at
U.S. firms; foreign firms are allowed to participate, but only as
minority members.) The 1991 Agreement specifically states: "The
Government of the United States of America will provide support for
expanded sales of foreign-based semiconductors in Japan through the
promotion of long-term relationships between Japanese producers,
including joint product development with Japanese customers, and other
actions the two Governments consider appropriate." (1991 Semiconductor
Agreement, USTR.) The Bush Department of Commerce worked closely with
American businesses, giving them information on partnership and market
opportunities in Japan. Partially as a result of these and other
efforts, U.S. semiconductor companies today are engaged in hundreds of
partnerships, alliances, joint ventures, licensing agreements, and
research and development projects with Japanese firms. (I&TS:S, p. 7.)
<P>These alliances are the result of private U.S. businesses seeking
increased market opportunities in Japan, not just of the 1991
agreement, but they demonstrate that many American companies need
little prodding from government to seize an overseas opportunity. The
1991 agreement created an atmosphere in which U.S. businesses could
begin to consider joint ventures with Japanese firms as a realistic
way to break into the Japanese semiconductor market. American
companies sought new alliances or broadened existing ones. AT&T, for
example, established an alliance with Mitsubishi Electric in October
1991; National Semiconductor Corporation started two relationships
with Toshiba Corporation in May and December 1992; and Intel
established a joint venture with Sharp Corporation in February 1992.
(Dave Webb, "Intel Pulls Plug on Flash Fab," Electronic's Buyer's
News, July 11, 1994.) All of these occurred after implementation of
the 1991 agreement. ("Progress and Achievements Under the
Semiconductor Agreement," Anderson, Hibey, & Blair and Powell Tate,
Washington, D.C., February 23, 1994.)
    <P> These and hundreds of other alliances have helped U.S. companies
to reduce research and development costs while gaining access to
Japanese customers, manufacturing and marketing techniques, and
technologies that they may not have been able to develop on their own.
U.S. companies' sales in the Japanese market tripled between 1986 and
1992, rising from 7.7 percent of their world sales in 1986 to over 10
percent in 1992. (Ibid., data quoted from Dataquest.) Thus, in
contrast to President Clinton's call for numerical targets, some U.S.
semiconductor companies want more, not fewer, U.S.-Japan alliances.
    <P> For example, William Weber, Vice President of Texas Instruments
Incorporated, told the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun that "We won't
urge the [U.S.] government to set market share goals. The government's
intervention should be held to a minimum." (Asahi Shimbun, June 5,
1993.) Weber added, "Confrontation existed between the U.S. and Japan
a year ago, but the present U.S.-Japan relationship is best
characterized by trust. Foreign semiconductor suppliers are now
integral parts of the Japanese users' Keiretsu." (Denpa, June 5,
1993.) (The Keiretsu system in Japan is an inter-linked group of
businesses, banks, producers, and suppliers that have agreed to work
together to reduce costs and maximize profits.)
    <P> In the same vein, Gilbert Amelio, President of National
Semiconductor, told the Japanese press that "There is no need to set
market share goals. The relationship between U.S. and Japanese
companies has dramatically improved. Strong trust has been established
and problems can be worked out quickly through communication. It is
necessary to strengthen our business relationships further." (Nikkei
Sangyo, August 30, 1993.)
<P>
     Examples of these private sector relationships include:
<P>
Advanced Micro Devices Inc.-- Sony Corporation. <P>
     In 1990, the U.S. company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced
a strategic alliance with Japan's Sony Corporation, which promised to
help AMD reopen a dormant semiconductor manufacturing site in San
Antonio, Texas. When the agreement was announced, AMD Chairman W.J.
Sanders III noted that "access to [SONY's] manufacturing know-how will
significantly enhance AMD's global competitiveness." (AMD News
Release, February 20, 1990, p. 1.) As a result of this strategic
alliance, Sony gave AMD valuable technology needed to enter the
advanced computer memory chip business. Using this technology, AMD has
done more business and become more profitable, selling $1.05 billion
worth of semiconductors in 1990 and $1.64 billion worth by the end of
1993. Overall, AMD's earnings grew from a $35.9 million loss in 1990
to a $228 million profit in 1993. (The Value Line Investment Survey,
January 28, 1994.)
<P>
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. -- Fujitsu Ltd. <P>
     Newer computers need faster, higher memory, but smaller chips.
Developments in notebook and laptop computer technology have put
pressure on semiconductor manufacturers to produce more advanced
components for these computers. To meet this demand, AMD and Fujitsu
have teamed up to develop a new "flash" memory chip, which is smaller
and faster than similar components found in desktop machines and
represents one of "the fastest-growing segments of the semiconductor
market." (AMD News Release, April 14, 1993, p. 1.) These memory chips
have the ability to retain information even when the power is off.
According to Gene Conner, AMD's Vice President for Operations, such
"collaboration between premier players on a global scale is the wave
of the future" for the semiconductor industry. (Ibid., p. 3.)
American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) -- Nippon Electric Company
(NEC). <P>
     Many U.S. companies are breaking into new markets, especially in
Japan, yet research and development costs for new technologies are
extremely high. By emphasizing joint venture partnerships, these cost
can be shared. AT&T, for example, teamed up with NEC of Japan in
January 1992 to manufacture advanced static random access memory
(SRAM) chips for computers and other products. NEC has provided AT&T
with access to advanced SRAM technology, allowing it to introduce a
new product line more quickly than it could have on its own because of
the shared research and development costs.
<P>
LSI Logic Corporation -- Sanyo Corporation. <P>
     Digital high definition television promises to be a profitable
new technology. HDTV has better resolution, digital sound, and a wider
screen; but few companies, Japanese or American, have a competitive
advantage in the many components necessary for this new technology. In
August 1991, LSI and Sanyo announced a strategic alliance in which the
two companies would manufacture semiconductors jointly for HDTV. LSI
specializes in semiconductors tailored to its partners' needs, while
Sanyo has designed some of the most advanced semiconductors available.
Thus, LSI can take advantage of its sophisticated production
techniques and develop Sanyo's advanced semiconductor designs, making
both companies more competitive. LSI also has entered similar
alliances with Nippon Electric Company, Mitsubishi, and Japan Victor
Corporation (JVC).
<P>
Sun Microsystems Inc. -- Fujitsu, Ltd. <P>
     In the mid-1980s, Sun Microsystems had designed an advanced
microprocessor called Sparc, but was unable to develop the chip on its
own because its production techniques were not sufficiently advanced.
Sun Microsystems eventually turned to Fujitsu, one of Japan's largest
computer makers, for design and manufacturing assistance. Fujitsu soon
became the largest Japanese supplier of Sparc microprocessors for sale
in Japan and elsewhere. Today, Fujitsu sells computers built by Sun
Microsytems in Japan under the Fujitsu label. Not only has this
alliance helped an American company bring to market a product stuck in
its design stages; according to Sun Microsytems, it also is helping
the company sell more computers in Japan than it could have sold on
its own. The joint venture has provided the U.S. firm with access and
expertise on how to market and sell products in Japan. The alliance
also has provided Sun with advanced components made by Fujitsu, which
in turn have made Sun's workstations more competitive. Fujitsu now
accounts for about 25 percent of Sun's Japanese sales of $700 million
a year.<P>
     Because U.S. firms have joined hands with Japan's largest
semiconductor manufacturers, access to Japan's market continues to
grow, and U.S. market share continues to increase. Thus, the success
of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement is not due to a guaranteed
20 percent of the Japanese market, but to the fact that private
companies have reached across international borders to develop
business relationships on their own without government threats of
trade retaliation.<P>
     Instead of trying to manage trade with Japan and other partners,
the Clinton Administration should expand access to foreign markets for
U.S. businesses. Specifically, it should:<P>

Seek rapid congressional approval of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT). <P>
     After seven years of multilateral negotiations, this wide-ranging
agreement between the U.S. and 123 other nations should be implemented
as soon as possible. The current GATT agreement will reduce tariffs by
as much as 40 percent worldwide and expand international trade by $235
billion a year by the year 2005.
<P>
     There already is some debate in Congress that the current GATT
round will sacrifice U.S. sovereignty and that lower tariffs will
drain government revenues, causing higher taxes or spending cuts.
Accusations of lost sovereignty, however, are unfounded. No
international trade rule, whether emanating from GATT or from some
other multilateral institution like the proposed World Trade
Organization, can be binding on the U.S. Any such rule would have to
be written into law and signed by the President to be binding on U.S.
citizens. (See Joe Cobb, "A Guide to the New GATT Agreement," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 985, May 5, 1994. See also Joe Cobb, "The
Real Threat to U.S. Sovereignty," Heritage Lecture No. 497, August 1,
1994.)<P>
     In order to maintain the momentum resulting from the conclusion
of seven years of debate and negotiations, the Clinton Administration
should press for quick passage of GATT implementing legislation this
year.
<P>
Extend free trade agreements to other countries in Latin America,
Asia, and Europe. <P>
     The North American Free Trade Agreement expanded the U.S.-Canada
Free Trade Agreement to include Mexico. It now should be expanded to
include other countries like Chile and opened up to countries in Asia,
such as Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, and to the new democracies of
Central and Eastern Europe. As an alternative, the U.S. could offer
free trade agreements to these countries separately. This would allow
for the global expansion of free trade while avoiding the diversion of
trade between blocs that occurs when regional agreements such as the
NAFTA and the European Union erect trade barriers to outsiders.
    <P> The Clinton Administration has promised that Chile will be the
next candidate for a free trade agreement. Chile has earned this
opportunity because of economic reforms, begun in the mid-1970s, which
have made it one of the fastest-growing economies in the Western
Hemisphere. Since the mid-1980s, for example, the Chilean economy has
grown at a rate of 5.7 percent a year. With inflation rates stabilized
at around 11 percent, unemployment near 4 percent, and average
salaries rising, Chile makes a good candidate for free trade with the
U.S. (See Michael G. Wilson, "Building on the NAFTA: Forging A Free
Trade Agreement With Chile," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 991,
June 27, 1994.)<P>
<P>     The Clinton Administration should not stop with Chile. It should
begin to prepare for negotiations with other Latin American countries
once negotiations with Chile are complete. The next likely candidates
are Argentina, Colombia, and Costa Rica. The Administration also
should consider offering free trade agreements to the Czech Republic,
Poland, Hungary, and even Russia. Clinton's fiscal year 1995 foreign
aid budget request for Eastern and Central Europe and the newly
independent states of the former Soviet Union is over $1 billion,
(Congressional Presentation Fiscal Year 1995, U.S. Agency for
International Development, 1994.) but the U.S. does almost $10 billion
in trade with that region each year. (USMT:12/93.) Bringing these
countries into free trade areas could expand that trade significantly.
The economic growth created by more foreign trade would improve the
lives of Czechs, Hungarians, and Russians far more than foreign aid.
Moreover, such a move would provide many Eastern European and Eurasian
countries with the economic foundation necessary for continued and
sustained growth.
<P>
Pursue a pact liberalizing trade among the members of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. <P>
     If liberalizing trade with Latin America and Eastern Europe is a
good idea, it is a great idea for Asia. The 17-member forum for Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation is a good foundation on which to build a
free trade area in Asia. While offering FTAs to specific Asian
countries, the U.S. should work within APEC to reduce trade barriers
on a regional basis, while seeking to expand the APEC from an informal
forum to a free trade region between the U.S. and APEC's members.
Specifically, President Clinton should use the forum to pursue an
aggressive strategy of reduced tariffs and non-tariff barriers.
 <P>    In this forum, Clinton could urge countries like Japan to work
harder to integrate their economies into the international economy.
Pursuing such a multilateral approach among APEC members could result
in real trade liberalization. Moreover, President Clinton should seek
bilateral free trade areas with specific APEC members with the
eventual goal of including all its members in a free trade area with
the U.S. Clinton should start the process by pursuing a free trade
area with Japan. Such a move would allow both U.S. and Japanese trade
negotiators to eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, much
like the U.S. and Mexico have done through the NAFTA. Through this
process, both countries would benefit. For example, U.S. automobile
and auto parts companies could seek reforms in Japan's safety and
inspection laws which restrict the import of American motor vehicles
into Japan by making it difficult for them to get through the
inspection process and into the showroom. Likewise, Japanese
automobile companies could lobby for an end to the American Automobile
Labeling Act and tariff reclassification of minivans, which raise the
cost of Japanese automobiles sold in the U.S. The American Automobile
Labeling Act requires all automobiles sold in the U.S. to specify the
amount of domestic and foreign content of the automobile. The
information must appear next to the sticker price information. This
Act is a protectionist move by the domestic auto industry to portray
automobiles with foreign names as "un-American" products even though
many are built in the U.S.
<P>
Similarly, the tariff reclassification of minivans will raise the
price of imported minivans sold in the U.S. by several thousand
dollars. <P>
     Both of these policies are protectionist maneuvers by U.S.
industry to keep out imports. They would be targets for Japanese
negotiators in free trade negotiations.
Foster private sector strategic alliances between U.S. and foreign
firms. Joint ventures, or "strategic alliances," between U.S. and
foreign firms are far more successful in opening foreign markets than
are such managed trade practices as guaranteeing a fixed share of a
foreign market. They also introduce U.S. companies to technologies far
more advanced than any that have been developed by government-
sponsored industrial policies. These initiatives should be encouraged
and made part of any bilateral trade agreements with U.S. trading
partners.<P>
     As demonstrated by the 1991 Semiconductor Agreement, strategic
alliances expand U.S. business's access to foreign markets,
technology, marketing, management techniques, and capital. With these
assets, American companies can become more competitive. The Clinton
Administration should use the current U.S.-Japan Framework
negotiations to develop language in any forthcoming agreement that
encourages U.S. and Japanese companies to work together when they find
it profitable and useful. For example, a new framework agreement
should incorporate language similar to that found in the 1991
Agreement, which states that "long-term relationships between Japanese
semiconductor purchasers and foreign-affiliated producers, including
joint product development with Japanese customers," should be
promoted. (1991 Semiconductor Agreement, USTR.) While strategic
alliances may not always be successful, they remain America's best
hope for breaking into closed foreign markets.
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     President Clinton has brought the U.S. down a dangerous path. By
pursuing managed trade policies whereby the U.S. tries to strong-arm
foreign governments into guaranteeing a fixed share of their market,
Clinton not only raises the risk of a trade war with Japan and other
trading partners, but also misses the boat on how best to open foreign
markets to U.S. goods.<P>
     Much of Clinton's confusion on managed trade stems from a
misreading of the 1991 Semiconductor Agreement. The President believes
this agreement was successful because it guaranteed foreign firms 20
percent of the Japanese semiconductor market. He is mistaken. The real
reason the agreement was a success is that U.S. companies took
advantage of provisions which encouraged the growth of strategic
alliances between private U.S. and Japanese companies.<P>
     Clinton would do well to re-examine the impact of this agreement.
He will discover that successful U.S. companies gained access to
overseas markets on their own, with no help from the U.S. government.
     Instead of trying to manage trade, Clinton should try to remove<P>
barriers to it. He should seek implementation of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade as quickly as possible and follow up on the North
American Free Trade Agreement by negotiating other agreements with
countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Asia. These would do
far more to open foreign markets to U.S. goods than would any threat
of trade retaliation or guaranteed shares for foreign markets. Free
trade will benefit U.S. businesses and consumers while expanding
economic growth to all corners of the globe.

<H3>The Real Threat To U.S. Sovereignty</H3>
Joe Cobb Speaking in Heritage's Van Andel Center, August 1, 1994
<P>
<br>
     The new GATT agreement and the proposed World Trade Organization
(WTO) has sparked a vigorous debate among conservatives in this
country, and in some cases the argument has taken on an ugly tone.
Last year H.Ross Perot was so visible during the NAFTA debate that I
think some conservatives look upon his populist-oriented followers as
potentially natural recruits for the conservative constituency. The
unpopularity of President Clinton in general, and among conservatives
in particular, makes it simply incomprehensible to some that a
conservative institution like The Heritage Foundation could support
the proposed World Trade Organization.
   <P>  When I was growing up in Kansas, as a teenage Goldwater
supporter, we used to speak contemptuously about the "Liberal Eastern
Establishment." Now I find my populist conservative friends think that
I am one of them, because I support GATT and the WTO. But what I do
think is quite funny is that all of the conservatives who oppose the
WTO are making the same arguments against it that Ralph Nader has been
making. Both Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan call the WTO "world
government." Nader testified before the House Ways and Means Committee
on February 1, 1994, that
<P>
     <UL>The Uruguay Round negotiations would strengthen and
     formalize a world economic government dominated by giant
     corporations, without a correlative democratic rule of law
     to hold this economic government accountable. .. .. .. The
     provisions of trade agreements, if approved by Congress,
     could undermine existing U.S. domestic law, not only in the
     direct regulation of commerce, but in areas ranging from
     food and auto safety to natural resource conservation.</UL>
     <P>
By implication, Nader is saying a world government would dominate the
United States just as the federal government today dominates our state
legislatures.
    <P> There are two questions we need to answer in reply to Ralph Nader
and others who also fear "world government." The first is the factual
question about U.S. domestic law and whether the World Trade
Organization has any authority to change it. Second is how our
political relationship with other nations might change, as a member of
the WTO, which could powerfully influence the U.S. Congress to "go
along," and adopt or repeal laws that regulate trade.
   <P>  Before we address those two issues, however, I think we need to
digress into an inquiry in political theory. The concept of
"sovereignty" is at the center of this debate, but I haven't seen
anyone really define the term very well, much less to look at what it
means to us in the United States. Let me turn first to that question.
<P>
United States Sovereignty: We the People<P>
     What is a threat to United States sovereignty? We need to have a
clear idea what sovereignty is before we can answer the question. In
general terms, we understand sovereignty to mean a nation's
independence from other governments, and its freedom of choice to act
politically. In history, there are many examples of sovereignty
concentrated in a single ruler like the tsar-autocrats of Russia, or
the French King Louis XIV, who declared, "I am the state." But states
today have elaborate procedures that decentralize their sovereignty,
for example, through periodic elections, independent courts, etc. For
a constitutional republic like the United States, our sovereignty also
includes an important central element described in the phrase,
"Congress shall make no law.... "
    <P> We reject the idea that a king is sovereign, and we reject the
idea that a few hundred congressmen in Washington are sovereign, even
if we do have a right to vote for some of them. We say "the people are
sovereign," and in a society based on individual rights this is more
than a slogan. The U.S. Constitution makes its clearest general
statement of popular sovereignty in the Bill of Rights, Amendment IX:
"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
   <P>  Sovereignty includes not only our right to feel safe against a
foreign army's invasion and to vote for those who make our laws, but
it also touches a family's daily economic life, the right to own
property, and to work and invest in private businesses. A large part
of our sovereign "independence from government and freedom of choice
to act politically" comes from the decentralized power of a free
market economy. Popular political movements rely on fundraising and
volunteers, who need the economic independence only a competitive
capitalist economy provides. Democracy depends on a free market
economic system, which in turn is based on consumer sovereignty, which
is really "voting with dollars" for our favorite products and
services. American political sovereignty is necessarily tied to the
people's right to sell or buy whatever they find useful.
    <P> The claim that our sovereignty is threatened by the new GATT
agreement has a false premise. U.S. sovereignty isn't threatened by
fair trade rules that make it harder for lobbyists in Washington to
get special favors and trade protections from Congress, at the expense
of the average American family. The real threat to U.S. sovereignty is
from the "nationalization" of it -- the concerted effort by special
interests and lobbyists to focus all power over the American economic
system in the hands of Congress and the bureaucrats in Washington who
regulate us.
<P>
GATT and the Principle of Equal Rules<P>
     The GATT, and the WTO, are based on a series of "executive
agreements" going back to 1948. Congress authorized the President --
starting with F.D.R. and every President since -- to negotiate and
sign new GATT agreements, and Congress subsequently passed the laws to
implement those agreements, which cut tariffs, repealed quotas, and
made U.S. statutes reflect the GATT rules that other countries were
also adopting. The GATT started in 1948 to draw up rules for fair
international trade, to define certain equal rights under which all
governments agree to permit non-citizens to do business with their own
people.
    <P> The Uruguay Round of negotiations that produced the new GATT
agreement was initiated by the United States at a conference in
Uruguay in 1986. In 1988, Congress instructed the U.S. negotiators to
ask for new, stronger powers to resolve trade disputes, because other
countries often violate the GATT rules and deny equal rights to
Americans. These new powers to insist that governments follow the GATT
rules are now the most controversial issue about the WTO.
   <P>  What is most remarkable about the GATT, during its almost 50
years of existence, is the purely voluntary nature of it. A
government's membership in GATT is like membership in a chess club: if
you join, you agree to play by the rules, but nobody can arrest you if
you break a rule. The penalty is that others will then refuse to play
with you. The essential nature of a "trade sanction" is that it
represents the partial withdrawal of the equal rights that member
governments in GATT extend to each other's citizens. If one government
is found to be violating the rules, other GATT members reciprocally
"violate" the rules against it in turn by imposing a tariff, which
would otherwise be against the rules, on some imports from the
violating country.
  <P>   But the GATT rules are not self-enforcing on the government of
the United States. The nations that negotiate GATT rules, and the U.S.
executive branch, have to wait for Congress to pass specific laws to
give those rules any authority over U.S. citizens. The legal status of
GATT is technically a "non-self-executing Executive Agreement." To
implement it, Congress has to adopt whatever legal changes the
agreement calls for. A treaty with a foreign nation is an example of a
self-executing agreement, which has the status of law in U.S. courts
when ratified. The GATT agreement has less legal weight than a treaty,
which is executed by Senate ratification.
 <P>    A lot of hot air has been blown over the issue that the United
States would have only one vote among about 120 members, but this fact
misses the point that the WTO is not a legislature and a new GATT rule
is not U.S. law. The "voting" argument is a distraction. Future
amendments to GATT are not the issue. The real objections that
opponents have to the WTO and GATT are already printed in the text of
the Uruguay Round agreement. Market opening reforms will force some
protected industries to make unwelcome adjustments to a global
economy. Any future amendment proposals would still be "non-self-
executing" under U.S. law and if Congress refused to adopt them, they
wouldn't have much impact on the world's largest free market economy.
<P>
A "Supreme Court" of Trade?<P>
   <P>  Pat Buchanan likes to call the World Trade Organization a
"supreme court of trade," which echoes ominously in conservative ears,
particularly for those who are angered by Roe v. Wade and other
sweeping judicial decisions that have centralized the American
government over two centuries. The opposition of Pat Buchanan and
Ralph Nader, to the WTO dispute settlement procedures is a more
substantive objection, but a dispute settlement ruling cannot be
likened to a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court because it simply would
not have the force of law.
  <P>   As part of the 1988 Trade Act, Congress instructed the U.S. Trade
Representative to negotiate "for more effective and expeditious...
resolution of disputes and... better enforcement of United States
rights." Since 1948, the United States has been the most active user
of the dispute settlement process. As the world's largest exporter,
U.S. business people are continually running up against discrimination
in foreign countries.<P>
     Under the GATT's old dispute settlement procedures, governments
always reserved the right to walk away from the arbitration if they
were about to lose. A dispute panel could be blocked from reporting
violations of the GATT rules. Under the new procedures, a dispute
settlement report cannot be blocked; in each case, it will be
finished. If a government is found to be discriminating against the
citizens of another country, in violation of the GATT rules, the
plaintiff can ask for "compensation." This might take the form of
"sanctions," new tariffs imposed on imports from the violating
country, or anything else both sides might agree on.
   <P>  Opponents of the World Trade Organization have tried to make
"sanctions" sound like a tax on America, imposed by a world government
in which the United States would be vastly outvoted. But a trade
sanction is a tariff on imports. The country that "won" a dispute
settlement case would get the right to put a tax on its own people who
import goods from the country that the WTO panel found to be violating
the GATT rules.
  <P>   The real power of a dispute settlement decision is to embarrass a
country that loses an arbitration, because it will have been shown to
be "cheating" on the rules it agreed to, and that every other
government has agreed to respect. Other governments thereafter can
respond to its proposals for trade concessions with questions about
hypocrisy, double standards, faithlessness, and unreliability.
<P>The "Nationalization" of Sovereignty<P>
     The second concern of opponents to the World Trade Organization
is how much our relationship with other nations would change. Other
nations can accuse the United States of violating the GATT rules. If
dispute settlement decisions ruled in favor of foreign governments,
there is a good chance that Congress would make further changes in
U.S. law. This is where activists like Ralph Nader, as well as other
special interests and corporate lobbyists become very concerned about
the influence of the WTO over U.S. "sovereignty." It would compete
directly with the influence they worked so hard to earn, or have paid
so much to buy.
   <P> The political process in Washington is famously described as a
game of special interest lobbying for tax loopholes, pork barrel
spending, laws and regulations that make some giant corporations rich
and restrict competition. The lobbying by some American industries for
trade protection is no different from what they do for other causes.
The most important difference is the "us" versus "them" rhetoric.
Whenever a special interest gets a subsidy or a congressional district
gets a federal government project, we can understand how millions of
other taxpayers are paying for it. Some Americans are better off, and
some are worse off. In the debate over trade policy, however, the
rhetoric takes on the color of foreign policy, sovereignty, and an
implied common interest of all Americans.
    <P> This is what I call the nationalization of sovereignty, where
individual rights no longer count and popular sovereignty disappears,
replaced by some statist idea of the government's sovereignty.
Congress has the power to legislate tariffs and to restrict
international trade in a thousand ways. A domestic industry that faces
foreign competition -- which simply means that some other Americans
have a greater freedom of choice among larger numbers of products and
suppliers -- might lobby Congress to get restrictions imposed on
foreign producers. When the government grants this special favor to
the lobbyists and their clients, it hurts other Americans, and reduces
their choices of available products. Our government tells them they
have to pay higher prices or accept lower quality, at the mercy of the
protected domestic industry.
     <P>
Denying Equal Rights to Other Americans<P>
     The example of steel producers and steel users is a classic case
of trade restrictions that actually hurt more Americans than they
benefit. There was an article in the Journal of Commerce last March
about the problems of steel users. The U.S. steel industry is one of
the most politically active in restricting trade, but the precision
metalforming industry is far larger than the steel industry. It
consumes more than 25 percent of the nation's steel production. There
are more than 1,200 companies in 38 states, with more than 300,000
employees. This is twice as many workers as in the steel industry
itself.
 <P>    The president of one company, Raymond Hopp of the H.K. Metalcraft
Manufacturing Corp. of Lodi, N.J., which makes gaskets and other
automotive products, is quoted saying, "If we can't buy steel at world
prices, everything could come apart; it could make the difference
between a profit and a loss." Another specialized auto parts producer,
A.J. Rose Manufacturing Co. of Cleveland, requires particular
tolerances, the honing of the metal for a specific purpose, that
domestic steel suppliers will not guarantee. It has to bring in
imported steel, at a premium price, to satisfy its customers,
according to its president, Robert D. Pritchard. Nevertheless, U.S.
domestic steel producers lobby Congress very actively for trade
restrictions and file actions with the U.S. Department of Commerce to
impose tariffs on the imported steel these companies need.
    <P> Under the rules of GATT, some trade restrictions that industry
lobbyists obtain from Congress could be challenged by other countries.
They could file dispute settlement cases and ask the World Trade
Organization to determine if the United States were violating the GATT
rules. Although the dispute actions would be filed by other
governments, on behalf of their own citizens who believe they are
being unfairly discriminated against by U.S. trade restrictions, there
would actually be many American citizens represented in those actions,
with interests directly opposite the official position of the U.S.
law, as the precision metalforming companies prove. For every foreign
producer who sells goods in the United States there are Americans who
make the choice to buy those goods. It is wrong to pretend those
Americans have no rights, or no share as citizens in U.S. sovereignty
just because Congress has attempted to nationalize it.
<P>
Opening Up the Democratic Process<P>
     As a conservative advocate of the free market system, I believe
the World Trade Organization will actually open up more issues for
democratic debate about economic regulation in the United States, and
around the world. Every country has a wide diversity of economic
interests, both as producers and consumers. The fact that governments
have traditionally been protectionist and mercantilist is a sad
commentary on the unequal influence in the political process that
lobbyists have. During the great age of American protectionism, we
should remember, the U.S. Senate was so corrupted by bribery and
influence-selling that it led to the 17th Amendment and the anti-trust
laws, which might have been unnecessary if we could have simply
repealed the tariffs those trusts and monopolies depended on.
   <P>  Popular sovereignty, as conceived in the Bill of Rights, is
actually strengthened by GATT's dispute settlement procedures. The
more powerful industrial lobbyists have an advantage in Washington,
but the general rules of fair trade are in the broader interest of
more Americans, who are not as powerful or don't spend as much on
lawyers and politicians to gain influence. If a WTO dispute settlement
decision reported that the United States had violated the GATT rules,
and Congress acted to amend U.S. laws to follow the rules, clearly the
"sovereign" interests of many more Americans would be honored, not
violated, by that congressional response to an embarrassment like
violating an agreement to treat others fairly, with equal rights.
    <P> The real threat to U.S. sovereignty is the drive to "nationalize"
it -- the concerted effort by special interests and lobbyists to focus
all power over the American economic system in the hands of the
bureaucrats in Washington who regulate us. I don't think the opponents
of GATT really understand what popular sovereignty and the free market
are all about. The most populist and democratic institution ever to
evolve in human society is the free market, with strong protections
for private property rights, and the freedom of average people to buy
whatever they think is best for their families -- regardless of the
economic nostrums of protectionists. The bottom line is whether you
believe in nationalizing our sovereignty and making the power of the
federal government stronger. As a conservative, I believe in the form
of constitutional "limited government" our Founders established. The
World Trade Organization is no threat to limited, constitutional
government.

     To implement the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) agreement, which was signed on April 15 by the United States
and 124 other governments in Marrakech, Morocco, Congress will need to
make a number of changes in current U.S. trade law. This will be done
in the form of a "fast track" bill. (The provision for "fast track"
consideration of the GATT Uruguay Round implementing legislation is
found in P.L. 103-49, July 2, 1993. ) Such a bill essentially is
negotiated between congressional leaders and the White House, and it
will be put to Congress for an up-or-down vote without amendment.
<P>
     Unfortunately it now seems likely that Congress will be asked to
include measures to "strengthen" the U.S. antidumping law in the bill.
(See Committee on Ways and Means, "Draft Legislative Language for the
Administration's Implementing Proposals on the Uruguay Round
Antidumping Agreement and Corresponding Provisions in the Subsidies
Agreement," July 12, 1994. For a summary of current U.S. antidumping
law, see Committee on Ways and Means, Overview and Compilation of U.S.
Trade Statutes (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1993), pp. 62-71. See also, "Administration AD/CVD Proposals," Inside
U.S. Trade, Special Report, June 21, 1994, pp. S2-S22, and "Summary of
AD/CVD Proposals," Inside U.S. Trade, Special Report, June 17, 1994,
pp. S2-S8.  Lobbying to influence the antidumping sections of the GATT
implementing legislation is reported in Robert Keatley, "More
Protectionism May Be the Result As Congress Studies Dumping Laws," The
Wall Street Journal, July 1, 1994, p. A10; "Dumping on Importers," The
Journal of Commerce, June 30, 1994, p. 10A; and Helene Cooper,
"Corporate America Finds Devil Is in the Details As Its Lobbyists
Press Congress to Change GATT," The Wall Street Journal, June 27,
1994, p. A14.) But if enacted, the antidumping provisions actually
would result in increased trade barriers worldwide and undermine the
intent of the new GATT agreement. By including these provisions, the
White House and protectionists in Congress seem determined to go
against the sound observation of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, which reported earlier this year that "Both in the United
States and elsewhere, antidumping laws go beyond preventing
anticompetitive practices -- which should be their rationale -- and
often have the effect of protecting domestic industries from foreign
competition." (Council of Economic Advisers, Economic Report of the
President, February 1994, p. 239. Emphasis in original.)
<P>
     The U.S. antidumping law has become the primary legal tool
invoked by domestic industries supposedly to protect themselves from
unfair trade by imports, but in reality to shield themselves from
competition. Dumping is the practice of selling goods in one market at
a price below that charged in another market. The notion of a "fair
value" is usually associated with the higher price by industries
competing against the lower price, and the antidumping laws are used
to impose a tariff on the "unfair value" of the lower-priced goods.
Seasonal department store clearance sales and promotional price
cutting are normal business practices in domestic commerce, and may
lead to prices that are lower than "costs" figured in certain ways.
But under the antidumping laws, the same price and cost structure used
by an exporter to the United States could be considered a violation of
U.S. law.
<P>
     Around the world, this kind of protectionism has been growing as
tariffs and other non-tariff barriers have come down. Indeed, more
dumping cases have been filed annually against U.S. exporters around
the world in recent years than against any other country. (In the
period 1988-1992, 166 cases were filed against the United States,
compared to 98 against Japan, 75 against Korea, 69 against Brazil, and
13 against Canada. A total of 1,196 were filed worldwide. U.S.
International Trade Commission, The Year in Trade: Operation of the
Trade Agreements Program, Reports 40-44 (1988-1992).) The U.S. economy
produces the world's largest volume of exports, and therefore is the
most vulnerable to the abuse of antidumping laws. Instead of
benefiting the U.S. economy, "strengthening" the antidumping laws in
this country would not only raise costs for American consumers, but
also likely would trigger more antidumping cases against U.S.
exporters worldwide, through similar antidumping rules adopted by
other governments in future years.
<P>
     The new GATT Antidumping Agreement (Office of U.S. Trade
Representative, Final Act Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round
of Multilateral Trade Negotiations [cited hereafter as MTN/FA]
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1994), II-A1A-8.)
was drafted in the spirit of fair and open trade, but individual
governments still will determine what they regard as the unfair
pricing of imports. The new agreement cannot eliminate the bias in
favor of domestic industries in every country, but the new rules are
intended to improve the transparency and fairness of national
antidumping laws. The GATT agreement requires governments to follow
certain rules in determining when dumping cases may legitimately be
filed by domestic producers, and specifies some procedures that must
be followed in calculating whether goods are being sold "at less than
fair value." A primary goal in the Antidumping Agreement is for
governments to make their antidumping laws compare real market
conditions in a producer's home country and its export markets, and
not to bias the process of finding whether dumping has occurred by
resorting to unrealistic accounting rules. Countries also are supposed
to reexamine antidumping orders at least every five years and revoke
those that are no longer valid. This provision of the Uruguay Round
agreement has been criticized by some as "weakening" the U.S. trade
laws.
<P>
     When an antidumping case in the United States is decided against
an accused importer, the Commerce Department imposes a tariff on the
imported product, in effect raising its price to a "non-dumping"
level. The amount of the tariff is calculated by using accounting
procedures spelled out in the antidumping law. Advocates of
"strengthening" the law in Congress and the Administration would amend
the technical accounting procedures in ways that would help domestic
producers more easily win antidumping cases. But if that happens,
other countries will toughen their antidumping rules as well. The
result: a general increase in tariffs by means of case-by-case
litigation, as industries in the United States and around the world
file charges against each other alleging "less than fair value"
pricing. This would perversely close markets to competition rather
than opening them.
<P>

Comparing Foreign and Domestic Prices
<P>
     One of the most serious problems under current U.S. antidumping
law is the Commerce Department's method of comparing an importer's
prices charged in the United States with prices in its home country.
An average home-market price is computed by obtaining sales data. The
average price is then compared with individual sales transactions (not
the average) in the United States. Any U.S. sales that are above the
average home-market value are disregarded. (The comparison of "price"
to "value" is not a simple exercise because the calculations are not
simple. Note that "value" is based on the producer's cost-accounting
data according to statutory rules, and it is thus the second major
area where arbitrary, unfair results can be mandated by law or
administratively imposed by a government favoring a domestic industry.
Cost accounting depends far more on judgmental factors than accounting
for financial reports because of different ways a producer's general
fixed costs might be allocated to individual products.) But if any
U.S. sales are found to be below the average home-market value, the
Department concludes the imported product has been dumped, and a
"dumping margin" is calculated on the basis of the price differences
between the two countries.
<P>
     The Uruguay Round Antidumping Agreement requires that this unfair
method be changed to use average transaction prices in both markets
(an "apples to apples" comparison). (MTN/FA, II-A1A-8, 2.4.2, pp.
3-4.) The proposed legislation, however, specifically creates a
loophole to evade this requirement. Parties to an antidumping case may
request an annual review of a dumping order and the new GATT
requirement for comparing average prices would not apply to an annual
review. This deliberate omission would permit the Commerce Department
to conclude there has been a significant increase in a product's
dumping margin after such a case review, through an "apples to
oranges" comparison based on individual below-average transaction
prices only.
<P>

Dumping When the Importer and Exporter are Related
<P>
     Increasingly in international trade, companies produce components
of products in one country and bring them to a second country for
further work or modification before sale. Cost accountants and
economists employed by a company use various methods to allocate
indirect selling costs, including such things as advertising and
promotion costs, and to set the selling price depending on how
managers view market conditions.
<P>
     The new GATT agreement does not require any change in current
U.S. law in this area. But the Administration has proposed to change
the current practice, which is complicated enough but in general tries
to determine the price at the factory gate. The proposal is to
determine the price to the first unrelated purchaser in both the U.S.
market and the exporter's home market. This change would give the
Commerce Department more power to disregard the way international
companies allocate their indirect costs. (Ways and Means Draft
Legislative Language, op. cit., pp. 96-100.) But there is also a
strong lobbying effort by domestic producers who compete in the U.S.
market with foreign companies that built factories here in the 1980s
on behalf of a different method, which would require the Commerce
Department to treat indirect costs in a specific way that would bias
the comparisons in favor of alleged dumping. (The so-called Exporter
Sales Price (ESP) methodology as described in the Administration's
memorandum: "This is perhaps the most technical and obtuse issue in
implementing the AD agreement. Unfortunately it is also one of the
most important." Inside U.S Trade, June 17, 1994, p. S3. ) 
<P>
     The 1980s saw a significant increase in direct foreign investment
in the United States, which created millions of jobs, but both
foreign-owned and domestic companies that import component parts from
foreign affiliates are vulnerable to the abuse of antidumping laws.
Competitors could accuse internationally diversified companies of
dumping and win cases that would require the government to impose
punitive tariffs. Even the threat of such litigation would jeopardize
future foreign investment in the United States and the benefits of
competition and lower prices, which would not only affect U.S.
consumers but also thousands of U.S. companies that depend on
international suppliers to produce their own goods and services for
export.
<P>
     More careful economic study should be done before Congress
changes the rules in these cases. It is unclear how the
Administration's proposal would work, and any change in the U.S.
antidumping law in this area would be a minefield, with consequences
that may increase protectionism. The United States economy depends
critically on the free movement of investment, both to enable foreign
companies to establish factories here and for U.S. companies to
diversify abroad. The Administration's proposal would give the
Commerce Department sweeping powers to determine the way business must
allocate costs. The investment decisions of business worldwide could
be affected, after the fact, by arbitrary bureaucratic decisions in
antidumping cases. It might no longer be prudent for many companies to
invest in the United States.
<P>
Antidumping Duty as a Cost
<P>
     Another proposed change that would also strongly bias the U.S.
antidumping laws against imports, in cases where the foreign exporter
and domestic importer are related, involves the accounting treatment
of money deposited with the U.S. Treasury. The proposal would
effectively double the tariffs in these related-party cases. Under
current U.S. law, dumping duties are calculated retrospectively, but
importers accused of dumping have to deposit their potential dumping
duties with the U.S. Treasury until a review determines the actual
amount, if any, of the tariff. Later, when a subsequent review of the
dumping charge is made, the deposit is used to pay the duty or
refunded.
<P>
     Under the proposal, during the period the Treasury is holding an
importer's deposit, the Commerce Department would calculate the
imported product's price in the United States (which determines if
"dumping" has occurred) by subtracting the deposited amount from any
actual sales prices, treating it as a cost rather than a financial
asset. Thus the only way an importer could avoid being found guilty of
dumping -- and being stuck for the duty twice -- would be to increase
its U.S. price by twice the amount of the duty to avoid any risks,
which would mean no price competition at all. The issue is further
biased against importers by the Administration's proposal specifically
not to follow the new GATT requirement to use average market prices
during the review period, as discussed above.
<P>
     This measure was not contained in the Administration's published
draft proposal, but Congress is likely to insist it be in the
implementing legislation put before lawmakers because it resembles a
practice in the European Union and Canada, which do not use a
retrospective system to calculate dumping. Under the system used by
other countries, dumping duties are paid in advance and not later
modified by a review of the case.
<P>

Captive Production
<P>
     The International Trade Commission (ITC) decided a case last year
involving flat steel products, including steel at different stages of
manufacturing. At each stage as a product is processed, it can be sold
to customers or used by the same firm for further processing. The
steel industry petitioners failed to obtain the dumping protection
they sought last year because, as the ITC analyzed the facts of the
case, the test of harm to the domestic industry was deemed not to have
been met. But if steel that was further processed by the same firm had
been artificially excluded from the total amount of domestic
production, the test might have been met.
<P>
     A proposed alteration to the Administration's draft legislation
by some in Congress is to mandate the methodology the ITC must use in
these cases, so that domestic production of intermediate products
consumed within the same company to make another product cannot be
counted. As a result, the ITC would be stripped of its current
discretion to exclude such production, or not, in its analysis if it
is appropriate given the facts of each case. The Administration did
not include this very parochial proposal sought by lobbyists for the
steel industry in its recommendations. It is contrary to the
traditional requirements of international law in determining injury,
and contrary to the Uruguay Round agreement. (MTN/FA, II-A1A-8, 4.1,
p. 6 and 3.4, p. 5.) The ITC is not an agency so biased against U.S.
domestic producers that its analysis of the facts of each industry's
conditions of competition needs to be dictated by Congress.

<P>
Compensation for Petitioners
<P>
     Under current law, antidumping duties are general revenue to the
Treasury. Two proposals in Congress (H.R. 4206 sponsored by
Representatives Ralph Regula (R-OH) and Norman Mineta (D-CA), and H.R.
4716 sponsored by Representative Nancy Johnson (R-CT).) would provide
for the payment of dumping duties into a special fund that would then
be used to compensate companies supporting an antidumping petition for
various alleged injuries. Aside from providing a subsidy to domestic
industry petitioners, which could be illegal under the GATT rules,
payments to any company that supported a petition for dumping relief
would amount to a private right of action, and a lucrative source of
new income for trade lawyers. In addition, the proposal would provide
a powerful incentive to domestic industries to harass importers by
bringing petitions, increasing the probability that American consumers
would ultimately have to pay higher prices for a wide range of
products as a result of higher tariffs.
<P>

Conclusion
<P>
     There is a confusion between the advocacy of antidumping measures
to promote trade on equal terms and the actual use of these laws as a
smokescreen for protectionism. A prominent critic of antidumping is J.
Michael Finger, Lead Economist for Trade Policy at the World Bank. In
his recent book, Antidumping, How it Works and Who Gets Hurt, Finger
concludes:
<P>
    <UL> Antidumping, as practiced today, is a witches brew of the
     worst of policy-making: power politics, bad economics, and
     shameful public administration. Antidumping law is an
     oxymoron. Expansion of the power of the state to act against
     imports in the name of antidumping has been built on the
     meanest of violations against the principles of rule of law.
     Antidumping is a particularly insidious threat in that it
     appears to bring systemic justification to the trade
     restrictions it creates: it is as if the GATT system were
     programmed to destroy itself. (Ann Arbor: University of
     Michigan Press, 1993, p. 57. Emphasis in the original.)</UL>
<P>
     Since a fast track bill is being put together by congressional
leaders and the White House, it may already be too late to have a full
and open debate about the way in which the United States should comply
with the new GATT Antidumping Agreement in the Uruguay Round
implementation legislation. But before they try to "improve" on the
GATT agreement by modifying the antidumping laws, lawmakers should
carefully investigate the costs and purported benefits of the U.S.
antidumping laws. Because amendments are not permitted, the fast track
legislative process tends to invite back room negotiations between the
Administration and advocates of particular trade law changes that have
no general economic benefits, because the White House and
congressional leaders want to assure wide support for the bill when it
is finally introduced in Congress. Some of the proposals discussed
above could have extremely serious economic consequences on the U.S.
economy, and the "back room" nature of negotiations have given
protectionists a rare opportunity to insist on measures to gain their
support.
<P>
     Supporters of the Uruguay Round of GATT and its objectives of
more open world trade should insist that the fast track implementing
legislation be narrowly drafted to make only those changes in U.S. law
necessary to adopt its specific provisions. The antidumping laws are,
after all, U.S. domestic statutes that Congress could debate and amend
in the future in a more open manner, without the constraint of the
fast track process. That debate is needed. Hopefully, the more the
American people learn about how "antidumping" laws are used to raise
prices to some U.S. companies for the profit of others, to violate the
spirit of GATT rules, and to reduce American competitiveness, the more
likely will be the eventual repeal of the largely protectionist
antidumping rules.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     "The patent system has added the fuel of interest to the
     fire of genius." 
<P>
                    Abraham Lincoln

<P>
     "A country without a patent office and good patent laws is
     just a crab  and can't travel any way but sideways and
     backwards." 
<P>
                    Mark Twain

<P>
     The past few decades have seen the United States move from an
economy propelled by traditional manufacturing to one in which
services and high technology are pre-eminent. This shift underscores
the degree to which specialized knowledge and ideas have become the
basis for America's comparative advantage in trade. For America to
keep its enviable lead in high technology manufacturing and hi-tech
services, the U.S. vigorously must defend the ideas and inventions
produced by its citizens from foreign commercial theft. 
<P>
     Since 1790 the U.S. has protected its innovative ideas from being
copied by giving an inventor exclusive property rights to his new
ideas by granting patents. (The U.S.  Constitution also provides for
copyright protection in Article I, section 8, clause 8, the same
clause that provides patent protection.  For the sake of brevity, this
study will focus on the need for additional patent protection in the
current trade talks.  Many of the arguments made with respect to
patents also would be applicable to copyrights.) But patent protection
and other forms of intellectual property rights such as copyrights and
trademarks frequently are violated in foreign countries, particularly
in the Third World. A 1988 report by the U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC), a U.S. government agency that investigates and
reports on international trade issues, estimated that in 1986
worldwide losses to American industry due to infringement upon all
forms of American intellectual property were between $43 billion and
$61 billion. (United States International Trade Commission, "Foreign
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights and the Effect on U.S. 
Industry and Trade," Report to the United States Trade Representative,
Investigation No.  332-245, Under Section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of
1930, Washington, D.C., February 1988, p.  H-3.)
<P>
     Rewarding Risk. Patents are critical in maintaining the cycle of
scientific discovery, practical engineering, and production. Without
the potential for exclusive financial reward that patents provide
there would be little reason for firms and individuals to expend the
energy, invest the capital, and take the risks required of those who
wish to discover new products and bring them to market. Although many
developing nations are among the worst pirates of patents and other
forms of intellectual property, they would prosper from a strong
regime protecting patents because these protections promote invention
and industriousness and because they promote closer commercial ties
with foreigners who will see their willingness to safeguard
intellectual property as a sign of commercial sophistication and
trustworthiness. The U.S. was not a developed country in 1790 when it
enacted its first patent law, yet it prospered greatly due to the
property rights afforded to inventors for their ideas. 
<P>
     The total research, development, and safety testing costs for a
single new pharmaceutical product exceed $230 million on average. With
the average time it takes to bring a new drug to market now exceeding
ten years, the absence of patent protection would permit other firms
to copy and reproduce the drugs at a fraction of the cost,
undercutting years of research and development. Were there no patent
protection, the result would not be lower priced goods; the result
would be far fewer new goods, in this case new medicines.
<P>
     The current round of multilateral trade talks, the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), is attempting to
address the issue of patents, copyrights, and other intellectual
property rights. The White House should instruct the U.S. trade
negotiators to push GATT to offer new intellectual property
protection. The Congress, meanwhile, should declare that it will not
ratify a new GATT accord without significant gains on intellectual
property. U.S. negotiators should not make concessions at GATT in the
hope that they can be won back at the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO), a feckless United Nations body based in Geneva.
WIPO often embraces the economic ideas of the so-called Group of 77
(G-77), a bloc of Third World countries that advocates state
domination of the economy.
<P>
     In instructing the U.S. negotiators, the White House should
insist that:
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should grant patent protection for products
     and processes for at least twenty years. This is the accepted
     standard period for patents to extend protection.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should establish reasonable "working
     requirements," and imports must be allowed to meet these
     requirements. Patents are given by many countries with the
     expectation that they will lead to the sale of the patented
     products in that country. A patent is "worked" when the patented
     good is sold. "Working requirements" thus are conditions
     specifying that the good must be sold domestically while the
     patent remains in effect. Some countries go further and impose
     working requirements to force firms to manufacture or assemble
     the product in the country. In such cases, imports would not
     satisfy the working requirement. This is not reasonable. To
     satisfy the working requirement, patent holders must be allowed
     to import the good. There should be no discrimination in favor of
     domestic production in which economies of scale are often not
     available.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should contain strict restraints on compulsory
     licensing arrangements, in which a government (usually foreign)
     allows a producer other than the patent holder to produce the
     patented good or to use a patented process. The GATT should
     require that such licensing be "non-exclusive," meaning that the
     patent holder always should be allowed to produce the product
     even if a compulsory license is granted to another firm. The
     compulsory licensing arrangements also should be "non-
     discriminatory" toward patentable subject matter, meaning that
     all industries should be treated similarly.
<P>
**   All nations that are party to an agreement on patents should be
     required to develop effective legal systems to enforce the
     agreement. The international agreements should put the force of
     domestic law behind these treaties.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should not allow "parallel importing."
     "Parallel importing" is a form of arbitrage that buys cheaply in
     one market, ships the good to a higher-priced market, and sells
     for the higher price. Normally, arbitraging is an important way
     that prices in various markets keep prices aligned. In the case
     of goods under exclusive franchise, however, "parallel
     importation" undermines patent protection by permitting goods
     going to other markets, where pricing conditions may differ, to
     be returned and sold in the original market, thereby undercutting
     the prices of the patent holder.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should require a transition period of no more
     than two years for countries to adopt adequate patent laws. This
     provision will prevent countries from delaying their acceptance
     of the new standards for patent protection. Of course, the least
     developed countries should be allowed one or two years longer to
     adjust to the technical demands of enforcing patent protection,
     such as the establishment and maintenance of patent offices.
<P>
**   A GATT agreement should provide "pipeline" protection. Such
     provisions safeguard products that in effect were in the pipeline
     -- patented in one country prior to the enactment of an adequate
     patent law in another one. Once the newcomer to effective patent
     enforcement establishes its law, goods patented elsewhere but
     never marketed in that country will receive protection as if the
     new law always had been in effect.
<P>
**   The U.S. should seek a strong agreement safeguarding intellectual
     property, rather than dilute the terms of protection to gain a
     universal agreement on intellectual property accepted by all GATT
     members. An agreement that offers strong intellectual property
     protection but which may only be ratified in the short term by
     the fifty most important commercial nations is better than a
     watered-down agreement ratified by a greater number of GATT
     members.
<P>
**   The U.S. should make its patent system conform to the basic
     system used by the rest of the world. Called "harmonizing" the
     patent system, this will require that America adopt a "first to
     file" system in which patents are given to the first bona fide
     applicant to file. Of course, such an approach should include
     adequate protection against theft or other abuses that might
     permit a dishonest party to file first. The U.S. would have to
     abandon its "first to invent" method, which allows challenges to
     the first-filers by those who claimed to have conceived the idea
     previously. The American system, in its practice, is biased
     against the patent applications of foreigners and should be
     abandoned.
<P>
THE GATT NEGOTIATIONS
     When the U.S. Congress approved a two-year extension of the
President's fast track negotiating authority this May, it provided an
opportunity for the world's trading countries to complete relatively
quickly the negotiations at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
that convened in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986. GATT is a
multilateral treaty that has increased international trade by reducing
tariffs and non-tariff barriers to international trade. 
<P>
     Since the first GATT agreement of October 30, 1947, there have
been seven completed rounds of trade negotiations. The Uruguay round
is the eighth. The most noted rounds have been: the Dillon Round of
1960-1961, which adjusted the international trading system to the
creation of the European Economic Community; the Kennedy Round,
completed in June 1967, which reduced tariffs 50 percent on a broad
range of products (Louis Henkin, Richard Crawford Pugh, Oscar
Schachter, and Hans Smit, eds., International Law (St.  Paul, Minn.: 
West Publishing, Co., 1987), p.  1166.); and the Tokyo Round,
completed in 1979, which established rules of conduct (codes) in such
non-tariff areas as trade subsidies, technical barriers to trade,
import licensing procedures, anti-dumping actions, and government
procurement policies.
<P>
     Fast track authority permits George Bush to negotiate a trade
agreement until May 1993 and submit it to the Congress for a yes-no
vote on the entire measure. The House and the Senate must either pass
the agreement or reject it; neither House can amend the agreement. 
<P>
     The GATT has four fundamental features. First, it requires
contracting nations to practice non-discrimination in trade. All
nations are bound by the most-favored-nation (MFN) clause, which
requires each member to extend to other GATT members treatment that is
equal to that which is accorded to its most favored trading partner in
a specific good or commodity. Consequently, tariff reductions for one
country automatically are extended to all GATT parties. The GATT
framework allows special exceptions concerning MFN for customs unions
like the European Community and for free trade areas like that which
exists between the U.S. and Canada. ("GATT and the International
Trading System," U.S.  Department of State Dispatch, July 22, 1991, p. 
534.)
<P>
     Second, it specifies that the only protection for a member
state's domestic industries can be through tariffs. Import quotas are
generally prohibited. Tariffs are deemed more acceptable because they
are public, recognizable, and thus more easily negotiable.
<P>
     Third, it requires that imported goods receive the same treatment
given to domestically produced goods in the home market. Restrictions
and regulations made applicable to the imported goods must apply also
to the domestically produced goods.
<P>
     Fourth, it allows a member state to challenge another member
state's trading practices when they appear to violate GATT rules.
Disputes are settled by an ad hoc panel of three to five individuals
agreed to by the parties. This arbitration panel submits a written
opinion about the dispute. If the GATT Council finds that there has
been a violation of international law, it will call for compliance.
The case will be kept on the agenda of the Council until the issue is
settled. Until recently the power to authorize retaliation almost
never has been sought. (Robert E.  Hudec, "Dispute Settlement," in
Jeffrey J.  Schott, ed., Completing the Uruguay Round:  A
Results-Oriented Approach to the GATT Trade Negotiations ( Washington,
D.C.:  Institute for International Economics, 1990), p.  181.) The
problem with GATT dispute resolution is that it is too heavily
influenced by procedures that require consensus. The moral authority
of the GATT, to stretch a term, has served well in creating a desire
to comply with GATT rulings. 
<P>
     The current and eighth round of negotiations, the Uruguay Round,
are the most comprehensive multilateral trade talks ever. Many issues
in this round are being considered by the GATT for the first time.
These include foreign investment, the protection of intellectual
property, and trade in services. One of the fifteen negotiating groups
established to discuss these issues deals with the protection of
intellectual property rights. It is referred to as the Negotiating
Group on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,
including Trade in Counterfeit Goods. This is abbreviated as the
Negotiating Group on TRIPS.
<P>
     The TRIPS negotiating group must resolve the competing desires to
create an economic environment in which there is unimpeded diffusion
of technology and an environment that rewards those inventors,
entrepreneurs, and writers who seek compensation for their labor.
According to Keith Maskus, professor of economics at the University of
Colorado, there is a clear difference of opinion over the issue of
giving exclusive property rights over ideas. (Keith E.  Maskus,
"Intellectual Property," in ibid., p.  165.) Technology-exporting
countries like the U.S. and Japan see this issue very differently from
technology-importing countries like Brazil, India, and Thailand. It
may never be possible to obtain a TRIPS agreement signed by all
members of the GATT. Yet it should be possible to find enough
technology-exporters and technology-importers to reach a middle
ground.
<P>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNITED STATES PATENT LAW<P>
     A major milestone in patent law was the passage of the Statute of
Monopolies in England in 1623. This ended the most damaging commercial
monopolies, which impeded "free trade and competition in staples and
commodities." (Arthur R.  Miller and Michael H.  Davis, Intellectual
Property:  Patents, Trademarks, and Copyright (St.  Paul, Minn.: 
1990), 2nd ed., p.  5.)
<P>
     This English common law hostility toward monopolies was carried
to the British colonies in North America, where it exerted an even
more powerful influence. It was recognized in the 1770s that patents
granted to promote invention could lead to the discovery of new areas
of technical knowledge that would benefit the entire community. By the
time of the American Revolution all thirteen colonies had granted
patents, and patent procedures subsequently became well established in
some states under the Articles of Confederation. (Ibid., pp.  6-7.)
<P>
     Patent Law was considered important enough in post-colonial
America that the Constitutional Convention of 1787 gave the federal
government the power to protect certain types of intellectual property
for limited periods of time. States Article I of the U.S.
Constitution:
<P>
     <UL>The Congress shall have power... To promote the progress of
     science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to
     authors and inventors the exclusive right to their
     respective writings and discoveries. (U.S.  Constitution,
     Article I, sec.  8, clause 8.  According to Miller and
     Davis, because trademark protection comes under the commerce
     clause, its protections are much less solid than are those
     afforded to patents and copyrights which receive
     constitutional protection.)</UL>
<P>
     Congress enacted the first American patent law in 1790, and made
major revisions of this "Patent Act" in 1793, 1836, and 1952. The 1836
act established the Patent Office, which "has been vested with the
authority to examine patents and determine at the outset whether a
patent application satisfies the requirements of the statute." (Miller
and Davis, op.  cit., p.  9.) Prior to the 1836 law no administrative
body existed for examining the validity of patent claims. The Patent
Act may be found in the United States Code under Title 35.

<P>
THE NEED FOR AN AIRTIGHT GATT AGREEMENT 
<P>
     The U.S. should not sign a GATT agreement on patents unless it
affords the highest level of protection against infringement. The
reason: Once signed and then approved by the Congress, a multilateral
arrangement like GATT will supersede American laws that provide for
selective retaliation against nations that are violators of American
intellectual property rights.
<P>
     The U.S. Congress has given the President the power to single out
nations that systematically infringe on U.S. patent protection and
retaliate against them. The 1988 Trade Act, which amended the Tariff
Act of 1930, "provides for a systematic mechanism designed to ensure
that U.S. trading partners are providing adequate and effective
protection of intellectual property." (Mayer, Brown & Platt (attorneys
at law), "A Practical Business and Legal Guide to the Omnibus Trade
and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Washington, D.C.:  1988), p.  113.)
The general provisions of the 1988 law are known as Super 301 and can
be found in Sections 301 through 310 of the amended Tariff Act of
1930. (Ronald A.  Cass, "Velvet Fist in an Iron Glove:  The Omnibus
Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988," Regulation, Winter 1991, p. 
52.) The specific provision protecting intellectual property is
Section 182, which is referred to as Special 301.
<P>
     Special 301 is a useful weapon in the American arsenal against
nations that steal intellectual property. This law requires the U.S.
Trade Representative (USTR) to identify annually countries that "deny
adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights or
deny fair and equitable market access to U.S. persons that rely on
intellectual property." Then the USTR may cull from that list
"priority countries" that are the most egregious violators of
intellectual property rights. Within thirty days of this, the USTR
must initiate a Section 301 investigation of each "priority country"
and recommend action within six months of initiation, unless it
becomes apparent to the President that the initiation of the
investigation would harm larger U.S. national interests such as
national security concerns. (Mayer, Brown & Platt, op.  cit., p. 
113.) 
<P>
     If intellectual property rights are deemed by the USTR to have
been abused by an investigated country, the USTR then is required to
enter into negotiations with that country to resolve the problem. If
no progress is made in direct talks, then retaliatory measures like
selective tariffs may be imposed against the offending nation by the
U.S. government. 
<P>
     Mexican Success. One example of the successful use of Special 301
occurred after the U.S. placed Mexico on the "priority watch list" in
May 1989. The prospect of being compared to India and other violators
of intellectual property rights spurred Mexican officials to
strengthen protections. In January 1990, USTR Carla Hills removed
Mexico from the trade list after that government published a plan that
outlined the steps Mexico would take to update its patent laws. In
1991 Mexico enacted a vastly improved law to protect intellectual
property. 
<P>
     This source of U.S. leverage in bilateral negotiations on
intellectual property rights would be lost if the U.S. acceded to a
GATT provision on intellectual property, because GATT supersedes
American law. If the protection afforded to patents by the new GATT
agreement is stringent, then losing bilateral leverage would be a
reasonable trade-off. In this case, the U.S. would have made the
protection of patents, copyrights, and trademarks an important part of
the international agreements on trade and tariffs. If, however, GATT
protection for patents is weak, then the U.S. would have sacrificed
the bargaining leverage derived from Special 301 without receiving
adequate compensation.
<P>

AN AMERICAN NEGOTIATING AGENDA AT GATT<P>
     Given the many ways in which patents can be undermined, effective
protection of patents requires that the TRIPS negotiations at GATT
proceed on several fronts.
<P>
** U.S. trade negotiators should focus on GATT as the proper forum for
reaching an intellectual property agreement. 
<P>
     Concessions should not be made at GATT in the hope that they can
be won back at the United Nations' World Intellectual Property
Organization, based in Geneva. WIPO's weakness is typical to the U.N.
system: too many nations have voting power greater than their economic
size would justify. Consequently, a WIPO agreement on patents can be
shaped or vetoed by groups of states that have a small role in
international trade but who can outvote the major trading nations.
WIPO's value is in settling technical issues such as the definition of
what can be patented. It is not an instrument, however, for protecting
intellectual property.
<P>
     GATT is the only set of negotiations in which all trade issues
are simultaneously on the table. This is an advantage because it
creates opportunities for trade-offs. Example: A set of trade talks
that focused only on patent protection could not produce an agreement
since developing nations, like Argentina, would not subject themselves
to tougher patent laws. In GATT, however, these nations can get
advantages in other areas by making concessions on intellectual
property. Argentina, for instance, might receive concessions from the
European Community on agricultural goods, which Argentina exports, in
exchange for concessions on patents. Without such a wide-ranging basis
for negotiations, negotiating a comprehensive trade agreement would be
impossible. Therefore, the attention and energy of the U.S. government
must be focused on GATT. 
<P>
     This should not preclude the U.S. pursuing strong patent
protection in negotiations like the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) in case the GATT round fails. In the case of NAFTA,
Mexico recently improved its patent laws, but Canada lags behind the
other major industrial countries and Mexico in protecting patents.

<P>
** The GATT agreement should grant patent protection for products and
processes for at least twenty years. 
<P>
     This is the accepted standard period for patent protection.
European, Japanese, and now Mexican products are protected twenty
years from the date of filing for the patent. In the U.S., patents
provide protection for seventeen years after the date on which the
patent is granted. Since the average time required for the processing
of a patent around the world is two to three years from the date of
filing, the Japanese-European date and the American date are
essentially equivalent. There thus should be little difficulty
obtaining GATT agreement on this provision. Some products like
pharmaceuticals require lengthy periods of regulatory processing. For
this reason, the U.S., Italy, and Japan have extended patent
protection in this area beyond twenty years. Consequently, the GATT
should not set a ceiling of twenty years but make that the minimum
period of protection.
<P>
** The GATT agreement should establish reasonable "working
requirements," and imports must be allowed to meet these requirements.
<P>
     A patent is a property right in which a government grants
exclusive rights to produce a product to an inventing person or
organization. When an application for the patent is filed, it is made
public, thus revealing the novelty of the product or process for which
a patent is being sought. This advances technological knowledge in the
manufacturing and scientific communities.
<P>
     Patents also may be granted on the premise that they will be
"worked" or used. For example, if General Motors is given a patent in
Germany for a new type of automobile headlight, Germany may require
General Motors to sell the headlight, thereby "working" the patent.
The U.S. has no working requirements. American patent law relies on
competitive innovation to prevent abuse of the monopoly privilege. It
is conceivable that the holder of a patent for one good might not want
to sell that good if its sale could undercut the market position of
more profitable good that the firm sells.
<P>
     Typically, many countries require that local manufacturing take
place to meet a working test. If the product for which the patent is
granted is not locally manufactured within a specified period (the
period of time varies per country) then a "compulsory license" is
granted to another company to work the patent. For most kinds of goods
a period of three to five years would be adequate for the working
requirement, but for some industries this period would be too short.
In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, a period of ten to twelve
years is required to test a drug's safety, so a longer period is
needed.
<P>
     It must be permissible to import a patented product as a means of
satisfying the working requirements. Spain and some other countries
require that a product be manufactured in that country for it to
satisfy this condition. This is in reality a protectionist policy.
Requirements that a good be manufactured in every country in which it
is sold creates tremendous economic inefficiencies, destroying
economies of scale and increasing the average cost of the product. If
a manufacturer is forced to operate his plants at inefficient levels,
the cost of the product will increase for consumers.
<P>
     When countries impose working requirements, therefore, they must
allow these requirements to be fulfilled by imported goods as well as
by those manufactured in the country.
<P>
** The GATT agreement should contain strict restraints on compulsory
licensing arrangements, in which a government (usually foreign) allows
a producer other than the patent holder to produce the patented good
or to use a patented process. 
<P>
     Such licensing must be "non-exclusive" and "non-discriminatory"
toward subject matter that is able to be patented. "Non-exclusive"
means that holder of the patent should always be permitted to sell the
product. "Non-discriminatory" means that there should be no
discrimination against foreign patent holders or against patent
holders in specific industrial sectors. 
<P>
     According to the 1883 Paris Convention for the Protection of
Industrial Property, the first major international intellectual
property agreement: "Each country... shall have the right to take
legislative measures providing for the grant of compulsory licenses to
prevent the abuses which might result from the exercise of the
exclusive rights conferred by the patent, for example, failure to
work." (Paris Convention, Article 5.A.2.  The Paris Convention was
first signed on March 20, 1883.  It has been revised on a number of
occasions, most recently in 1979.  Ninety-nine nations are party to
the Paris Convention.) Under the Paris Convention a government is able
to protect its people from abuses that might arise from granting
patents, but the wording of the provision quoted above is vague and
open-ended.
<P>
     Consequently, abuses of the compulsory licensing provision are
possible. Unscrupulous governments have passed on information about
patented products or processes to domestic producers with a compulsory
license, and then refused the company with the original patent the
right to sell the good in that country's market. To make matters
worse, the domestic producer with the compulsory license often will
export the product at a considerable price advantage because that firm
did not have to bear the costs of research and development.
<P>
     The GATT agreement must specify when compulsory licensing is
permissible. GATT also must enumerate restraints on compulsory
licensing. Compulsory licensing should be minimized; the capacity to
issue these licenses is a temptation to abuse the privilege. 
<P>
     Compulsory licenses should be permissible only: 1) if the holder
of a patent fails to "work" the patent; 2) if customers are exploited
by "tie-in sales" provisions which require the purchaser of the
patented good, over which the producer has a monopoly, to buy other
goods from the patent holder that the consumer does not want, making
this in effect an act of extortion; and 3) if a national emergency
arises and additional manufacturers of a patented product are needed
quickly, as during an epidemic requiring massive quantities of
vaccines that may require additional manufacturers.
<P>
     The compulsory licenses further should be "non-exclusive" so that
the holder of the patent always would be allowed to market the
licensed good. If a compulsory license is granted to a manufacturer
who does not hold the patent, therefore, the patent holder must not be
precluded from selling or importing the product. Under GATT compulsory
licenses also should be "non-discriminatory" in two ways. First, there
should be no distinction made between local and foreign origins of the
good. A patent holder foreign to a market should not be denied the
right to sell its product in that market and reap the benefits of the
technological innovation. Second, there should be no discrimination
intended to help domestic manufacturing sectors. Governments should
not be able to protect domestic companies that use technologies made
available in the patent process from competition with the patent
holder.
<P>
     Goods that are manufactured under compulsory licensing
arrangements should not be permitted to be exported. Much of the cost
of producing an innovative product resides in costs related to
research and development. A good produced under compulsory licensing
does not bear these costs because the holder of the patent was
required to reveal the nature of its technological innovation to
receive the patent. Therefore, the goods produced under compulsory
licensing arrangements should not be permitted to undermine the
competitive position of the patent holder's products internationally.
<P>
** All nations that are party to an agreement on patents should be
required to develop effective legal systems to enforce the agreement. 
<P>
     There must be an adequate domestic legal system in which actions
can be taken to stop patent infringements and seek recompense when
they occur. There also should be an effective customs agency in each
nation that can prevent the illegal importation of goods that infringe
the right of the patent holder to make, use, or sell the patented good
or process.
<P>
** The GATT agreement should not allow "parallel importing." 
<P>
     Parallel importing occurs: 1) when goods produced to be sold in
foreign markets at a lower price than in the home market are imported
back into the country of original manufacture; 2) when unauthorized
imports (those produced with stolen intellectual property) are sold in
a market to compete with goods produced domestically under legitimate
license; or 3) when unauthorized imports into a foreign nation are
allowed to compete with authorized imports into that nation. (A. 
Duncan and T.  Jackson, "Parallel Importing:  An Economic
Perspective," Discussion paper, August 13, 1991 .) Such parallel
importing creates unfair market conditions.
<P>
     In the U.S., once the patent holder sells its product it loses
control of the pricing of that good. It is said that its control has
been exhausted by the first sale. In the case of domestic
transactions, the first sale doctrine is fine. For international
sales, however, it  is not adequate because "first sale" would allow
exporters to take a good slated for export and divert it back to the
domestic market. The allowance of such practices would  undermine all
patent protection because the pricing of goods bound for foreign
markets reflects economic conditions abroad that may differ greatly
from conditions in the  domestic market. A nation that allowed
parallel importing effectively would provide  no patent protection.
<P>
**   The GATT agreement should require a transition period of no more
than two years for countries to adopt adequate patent laws.
<P>
     Once an agreement on patents is reached at the GATT and GATT
members ratify  the intellectual property provisions, the new rules
should come into effect as quickly as  possible. One to two years
should be sufficient for the signatories to bring their domestic
policies into conformity with the international consensus. Less
developed nations  might need a bit longer to muster the technical
expertise required to establish patent offices and to enforce the
international agreement.
<P>
**   A GATT agreement should provide "pipeline" protection.
<P>
     Pipeline provisions safeguard products that were patented in one
country prior to the  enactment of a new, adequate patent law in
another country. Once the newcomer nation to effective patent
enforcement establishes its law, goods patented elsewhere but  never
marketed in that country will receive protection as if the new law
always had  been in effect. Patent holders benefit because their goods
receive protection in another  country for the remainder of the life
of the patent. The country affording the protection  benefits because
it does not have to await new inventions and subsequent patent
applications to begin offering patent protection. As a result,
companies will begin to sell  and manufacture their patented
protections in this new business environment that protects
intellectual property rights.
<P>
     A hypothetical case illustrates the pipeline issue. Take Mexico,
which this year  passed an excellent law protecting patents, as an
example. The Mexican law grants a  standard twenty years' protection
for the patent from the date of filing. Assume an  American company
sought a patent in the U.S. for a new microprocessor in 1985 and 
obtained the American patent. Assume also that the microprocessor was
never marketed in Mexico in any manner, either by the designer or by a
counterfeiter. Under  pipeline protection, as soon as Mexico enacted
its new twenty-year patent protection  law, Mexican patent protection
would cover the microprocessor as if it had been patented in Mexico in
1985. As such, the microprocessor would be protected in Mexico  until
2005, just as it would be in the U.S. This is important because even
products patented elsewhere before the enactment of the improved
Mexican law can now receive  protectionthe benefits will not be
restricted to new inventions only. Mexico will not  have to wait for
new inventions to reap the benefits of providing a commercial
environment that is more friendly to the holders of intellectual
property.
<P>
**   The U.S. should seek a strong agreement safeguarding intellectual
property, rather than dilute the terms of protection to gain a
universal agreement on intellectual property accepted by all GATT
members.
<P>
     The U.S. should seek an agreement that offers strong intellectual
property protection  even if only the fifty most important commercial
nations, with some possible exceptions, ratify the agreement. U.S.
willingness to accept a non-universal agreement will  prevent an
intellectual property agreement from being subject to the vetos of
nations  like China, Egypt, and India, and other nations with
inadequate intellectual property  protection.
<P>
     The GATT agreement concluded in the 1970s during the Tokyo Round
contains various codes that were not ratified by all nations but which
nevertheless serve as benchmark for reducing barriers in specific
trading areas. The anti-dumping code, designed  to prohibit the sale
of goods at prices below cost of production, is the most prominent  of
these agreements. There is an advantage in pursuing a code strategy. A
code can establish the fact that owners of intellectual property
deserve international protection.  Those nations that agree to the
code would be subject to the GATT's enforcement  mechanisms. The vast
majority of important trading nations would be certain to support an
intellectual property code, particularly if it is endorsed by
commercial titans  like the U.S., the European Community, and Japan.
Nations that remain outside the  code still would be subject to
bilateral trade sanctions. For the U.S., this means that the  Special
301 provisions could be triggered. Because the GATT agreement
supersedes  American domestic law, nations that did not sign a code on
intellectual property still  would be subject to U.S. law when they
allowed their citizens to pirate American intellectual property.
<P>
**   The U.S. should make its patent system conform to the basic
system used by rest of the world.
<P>
     America, the nation with the oldest patent system in the world,
follows a "first-to-invent" system, not the "first-to-file" system
used by most other countries. Under American law acts of invention
that predate someone else's filing for the patent can be used  to
establish a claim to the patent. If two inventors seek a U.S. patent
for a particular invention, therefore, "the first to conceive
generally has priority to patent protection."  There are some
exceptions to this. If the first to conceive of the idea does not seek
the  patent with "due diligence," the patent can be denied.
<P>
     Proving who was the first to conceive of an innovation can
involve costly legal discovery actions. Challenges against the
priority of a particular patent claim in legal actions are known as
"interference procedures." Such interference procedures have the 
potential to discriminate against foreign applicants. In fact, U.S.
law makes it difficult  for a foreigner to prove his claim to a
patent. Activities that might prove a claim of  first
conceptualization of the novel idea but which did not take place in
the U.S. are  not admissible in the interference process. As a result,
foreign applicants are allowed to submit fewer types of evidence than
domestic applicants to support their claims to a  patent.
<P>
     Minimal Impact. Although the actual detriment that occurs to the
foreign patent applicant from this discrimination is negligible, the
negotiating damage in trade talks is  significant. The U.S. Patent
Office recently examined a large number of cases in which  there was
potential for discrimination against foreign applicants. It discovered
that actual discrimination rarely was a factor in awarding a patent.
Because the filing date for  the patent in the inventor's home country
is bona fide evidence, and because most inventors are large
organizations with some international reach, patents are usually 
sought simultaneously around the world. Consequently, the
discriminatory impact of  this law is minimal.
<P>
     This fact, however, does not stop other nations from pointing to
the U.S. law to  make negotiating points and to put the U.S. on the
defensive at the GATT intellectual  property negotiations. The
European Community has been aggressive in trying to  wring concessions
on intellectual property out of the U.S. as a price for allowing the 
U.S. to keep its first-to-invent criteria for awarding patents.
<P>
     This is a price that the U.S. should not pay. Instead, the U.S.
should abandon its first to-invent criteria and adopt first-to-file
criteria. The legal fees associated with this  method for obtaining a
patent will be less costly, thereby lowering the costs of production.
First-to-file also will reduce uncertainty among entrepreneurs. They
will know  that once their priority in filing is established that no
other claimant later can wrest  away their patent. The U.S. should
seek harmonization by adopting the first-to-file system in the TRIPS
negotiations at GATT, and also at WIPO, where useful work is being 
done to create uniform rules for patent protection. Of course, such an
approach should  include adequate protection against theft or other
abuses that might permit a dishonest  party to file first.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The protection of American patents is vital to American economic
health, for America possesses a comparative advantage in trade related
to technology and innovation.  The costs of research, development, and
new production often are tremendous. Other  nations should not be
allowed to benefit from the inventions of Americans without 
compensating those who took the risks to develop that knowledge.

     The race to acquire new technology and the derivative products is
becoming increasingly rapid. For the U.S. to keep its front-runner
position, the U.S. must maintain a  solid base of technology that
cannot be stolen. As such, any agreement on intellectual  property to
emerge from the Uruguay Round must provide airtight protection for
patents, copyrights, and trademarks. A mediocre agreement will damage
American interests because the new GATT agreement will supersede
American laws like Special 301  that provide the bilateral means to
retaliate against nations that steal U.S. intellectual  property. A
universal GATT agreement on intellectual property protection therefore 
should not be reached by diluting the strength of that protection.
<P>
     Universal Benefits.  A GATT agreement would provide worldwide
norms concerning the protection of intellectual property that would
benefit technology-exporting nations like the U.S. and Japan, but ut
also would benefit developing countries as well.  They would be forced
to accept, at some level, the traditional notion of property rights,
which would extend their own citizen-entrepreneurs protections for
innovation that might not have been otherwise available to them. 
Additionally, in exchange for concessions on intellectual property,
developing nations will pocket concessions in industries in which they
discuss comparative advantages, such as agriculture and textiles.

<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b> Good morning. I'm Barbara Franklin, and I want to welcome you on behalf of The Heritage Foundation and the American Trader Initiative Advisory Council, of which I am the chairman. This Council is a newly created entity here at Heritage. It is a group of business and public policy leaders who advise The Heritage Foundation about international trade issues and then work with Heritage to advance the free trade agenda in any way we can.

<p>Our topic today, "Expanding NAFTA to Include Chile: The Next Step for Free Trade," is one of the most important steps that we can take in this hemisphere. I will make a few introductory comments to set the stage, and then we will turn to our three panelists, each of whom is approaching the subject from a slightly different perspective.

<p>When I served as Secretary of Commerce, NAFTA and Chile was one of our most exciting initiatives. Enterprise for the Americas had been announced earlier by President Bush and was a visionary idea of linking the Western Hemisphere in free trade. This hemisphere includes 700 million people and has an annual output of more than $8 trillion.

<p>The first item on that agenda was the North American Free Trade Agreement, which linked the U.S., Canada, and Mexico and went into effect in 1994. While I was in office and NAFTA was under negotiation, there literally wasn't a week that went by that a foreign minister or economic minister from a Latin American country didn't call saying, "I want our country to be on the NAFTA list."  It was that important to our friends in this hemisphere.

<p>In the summer of 1992, then-President Aylwin of Chile came to the U.S. to meet with President Bush. One of the purposes of his trip was to ask that Chile be the next country on the NAFTA short list, after Mexico. I was present when President Bush gave him that commitment. President Clinton came into office in 1993 and reaffirmed that commitment at the Summit of the Americas in December 1994.

<p> A year has passed since the summit in Miami. The obvious questions are: Why hasn't this happened?  And what can we do about it?

<p>There is a great window of opportunity here. I believe that this hemisphere is more important to the U.S. than is generally realized -- and vice versa. Our friends in Latin America have done a superb job in reinventing their economies, bringing economic reforms into play, and also bringing democracy to the forefront, so much so that this hemisphere is turning out to be a great bulwark for both economic reform and democracy.

<p>Some countries in Latin America are among the fastest growing in the world. In fact, Latin America is the fastest-growing regional market for U.S. exports. Between 1988 and 1994, U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean have more than doubled, from $46 billion in 1988 to $98 billion in 1994. And these exports are currently supporting two million American jobs. These are not insignificant numbers, and there is even greater potential than has been realized so far.

<p>Chile has done a remarkable job with its economy and its transition to democracy. Trade between our two countries has increased quite dramatically. Our exports to Chile in 1994 were $2.7 billion, and Chile shipped $1.8 billion in products to the U.S. Investment in Chile has grown dramatically over this period. It would seem that Chile is a natural partner for the U.S. and a natural member of NAFTA.

<p>Why, then, the slowdown in this process?  I will suggest a couple of reasons. First, NAFTA's image was tarnished by the devaluation of the Mexican peso in December 1994. Why the Mexican peso collapsed is a subject for another discussion: however, the devaluation was not caused, in any way, by NAFTA, although NAFTA's opponents are creating the perception that somehow there was a cause and effect.

<p>Second, the President needs fast-track negotiating authority to negotiate an agreement, have it voted up or down by the Congress and not nitpicked by hundreds of amendments. Then the next question is: Why can't we get fast-track authority renewed?  This requires passage by Congress because the current negotiating authority has expired.

<p>Here we get into politics, where there is a real difference of opinion. The Administration insists on the inclusion of environmental and labor provisions in the fast-track negotiating authority, and the Republican majority in Congress wants a so-called clean fast-track bill. Now we're moving into a presidential election year, and it appears that trade issues are not on the top of anybody's agenda. Perhaps this is because trade is thought to be too controversial, which is really unfortunate.

<p>Expanding free trade around the world is the way to grow the American economy and to grow the world's economy. In fact, it's the only way to do it. More trade among the nations of the world is the path to increased prosperity and job creation in the U.S. and all around the world. So we should do all we can to advance the free-trade agenda.

<p>What we propose to explore today is why this agenda -- at least with regard to NAFTA -- seems to have slowed down. We have three excellent panelists. Our first speaker is Stephen Lande.<sup1</sup>
<p>
<b>STEPHEN LANDE:</b> In Washington today, there's a lot of self-reinforcing going on about the success of NAFTA, and the truth is that NAFTA has been a success. The situation in Mexico would be much worse today if we did not have NAFTA. Try to picture what would have happened, in terms of the currency devaluation, without NAFTA. Certainly Mexico has not collapsed as occurred during the 1980s. It will take Mexico only a year or two to come out of its current problem.
<p>
The feeling in Washington trade circles is, "Let's just get on with business."  And I agree 100 percent with Secretary Franklin that the real objective is to figure out how to get fast track, and how to get this Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) negotiation underway, because it's really in everyone's interest.
<p>
The problem is that, outside the Beltway, there is a perception that NAFTA is not working. Whether you look at the polls, listen to radio talk shows (the new barometers of public opinion), read the local newspaper editorials, or listen to the speeches being made on the campaign trail, it is clear that NAFTA is not considered a success and that the idea of moving beyond NAFTA into more free-trade agreements is not on the immediate agenda.
<p>
If one talks about what the trade agenda will be next year, one talks China-Japan and Japan-China. Those are the two countries against which we can retaliate. There's a certain moral issue at stake in both of these countries, and it's not very painful to take a tough position on China or Japan.
<p>
So the problem that we are facing is that we do have an inside/outside-the-Beltway mentality, and during an election year, particularly, the outside-the-Beltway mentality plays a larger role than at other times.
<p>
I will not review why we should enter into an agreement with Chile, or why Chile, from any rational economic viewpoint, is a win/win situation. Chile was chosen as a negotiating target principally because it was easy to do, and because the Treasury Department -- not the Trade Department, but the Treasury Department -- a few years ago wanted to reward Chile because it had followed very responsible economic and financial policies. That's how the selection was made. If we can't do Chile, which is the least controversial country the U.S. can negotiate with in Latin America and which has fulfilled all of the requirements for NAFTA membership, then perhaps there are internal U.S. problems that should be considered.
<p>
Among them is the difference between election-year mentality and post-election mentality. Whoever is elected President will look at the situation differently in 1997 than he would during the 1996 election year. I suspect that the movement towards Latin American integration will intensify again in 1997, regardless of who is elected President. Should President Clinton be re-elected, the process may accelerate because second-term Presidents historically look more at the history books than first-term Presidents. Certainly President Clinton has a vision of what he would like to accomplish, and part of that vision includes becoming the chief architect of an FTAA by the year 2000.
<p>
One of the better USTRs -- and one I've had the pleasure of working for -- was Bob Strauss, who, in the best Yogi Berra style, used to always say, "If you ever come up to a wall, figure out a way to go around it."  We have spent too much time in this country focusing on this question of labor and the environment. There has not been a new thought on the issue in more than a year. Both sides definitely believe they are absolutely correct as to whether there is a relationship between labor and trade.
<p>
Recently, in that vein, a very good book was just published by Nora Lustig entitled <i>Coping with Austerity: Poverty and Inequality in Latin America.</i> In that book, Dr. Lustig focuses on a view shared generally by both Americans and Latin Americans: There can be no serious economic growth while maintaining large degrees of income inequality. That is because the size of the market is reduced.

<p>Dr. Lustig argues very persuasively in her book that the best way to eliminate economic inequality is through economic growth. A government role may or may not be helpful, but it is only through economic growth that real progress is possible. Perhaps an argument like this may succeed in changing the debate.

<p>The point is that if there is no activity over the next few months -- although that's a question mark, because sometimes issues unexpectedly pick up speed in Washington -- we should try to move away from labor and environmental linkages. The second point is that we should keep the momentum going in the Chile-NAFTA discussions by developing ideas among private sectors. Think tanks in Chile and the U.S. could begin to develop the outline of what an agreement should look like. 

 <p>Whether or not there will be unofficial government input in this process, I don't know. But that discussion could begin, based on the question "What would the really meaningful commitments be in a NAFTA-Chile agreement?"  There are a couple of tough issues in the negotiation with Chile. For example, how do you deal with perishable agriculture (because this is an area where Chile is fairly efficient) when there is some seasonal overlap with the U.S.?  How do you deal with capital investments or capital movement?  Chile has argued that one reason why it has avoided the problems faced by other countries is that it does have a limited form of capital control. Chile may say this is something the U.S. needs in the future, and it may be worth working on.

<p>A third way -- and this has been mentioned in what we always like to call the bible of Washington trade experts, <i>Inside U.S. Trade and Inside NAFTA</i> -- is through Mexico and Canada, who are beginning to discuss our negotiations with Chile. Another way to keep the process moving is to develop models. People love to develop models; now, I guess, the expression in the hemisphere is "paths."  We can have paths to NAFTA, the expansion of NAFTA, and Chilean acceptance of NAFTA.

<p>I can picture a scenario where Canada, which has no preferential agreement with Chile now, negotiates a free-trade agreement with Chile. Perhaps they aim to make it a NAFTA-level free-trade agreement. This would give Mexico the opportunity, at it does have a free-trade agree-ment with Chile, to negotiate without delving into all the areas of NAFTA. Perhaps Mexico might work with Canada, not on the duty reduction parts of the agreement, but in terms of bringing the agreement to the NAFTA level.

<p>Perhaps the U.S. will decide to work on a couple of chapters that do not require fast-track approval. The U.S. may negotiate intellectual property rights. I also do not believe that the U.S. has a bilateral investment treaty with Chile, and that too could be discussed.

<p>At least the U.S. may allow momentum to continue. This would provide for the U.S. to proceed further toward its goal. It would certainly have the advantage of serving as a counter-weight to Chile's negotiations with other South American countries. Originally, it was thought that Chile might actually negotiate a free trade agreement with Mercosur by the end of 1995. They did not make the deadline, but an agreement is expected by year end 1996. Further, they have committed that within fifteen years -- which is the normal time it takes to phase in a free trade agreement -- there will be free trade between Chile and the Mercosur countries. The objective now is to conclude the details for this agreement as soon as possible.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b> Thank you, Steve. Our next speaker is Dr. Jerry Haar.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<b>DR. JERRY HAAR:</b> Roy McClaren, the Minister of International Trade of Canada, in August 1995 gave a major policy address in Canada in which he said that it is a shame where things stand right now with regard to Chile's entry into NAFTA. This could be a serious setback for the entire movement toward free trade in the Americas, he said, and the achievement of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the year 2005.
<p>
Symbolically, I think that's true. Chile is a country that is in the right place at the wrong time. Virtue is not its own reward. Chile has been caught up not in foreign trade and international concerns, but rather in purely domestic ones. A recent poll of American voters and their opinions about trade confirmed the worst. A majority of American voters feel that tariffs ought to be raised on those nations whose products are in surplus with the United States: If a country runs a significant surplus with the United States, tariffs on their exports ought to be increased. Another finding in the poll of American voters is that those countries whose workers receive low wages also ought to be subjected to tariff increases, since the low wage is deemed an unfair trade advantage. Finally, twice as many of the respondents to the poll blamed trade rather than technological advances as the main reason for the stagnation of American manufacturing wages.
<p>
Obviously, America's public and private school systems have failed to provide economic education in the classroom, and to explain to individuals what market capitalism is all about. When you combine the poll results with the very unhealthy trend in the United States now towards nativism, isolationism, and neo-protectionism, as espoused by a small but influential clique of Republican and Democratic elements in Congress, the climate clearly bodes ill for free trade.
<p>
I think we're facing a new crisis of confidence in the United States as to whether we're going to be a player in the world scene, and whether we believe in sharing the fruits of democratic capitalism with those who have played, fair and square, by the rules.
<p>
Let me say this about Chile: Chile is not Mexico. It doesn't share a common border with the United States. It doesn't have a human rights problem, and its labor, environmental, drug, and financial problems pale in comparison with Mexico. Foreign direct investment in Chile increased 70 percent from 1993 to 1994 and is supposed to double by the end of 1996. Moreover, the nature of Chile's manufactured export base is such that 40 percent of its exports are commodity products. Chile is not in any way, shape, or form a trade threat to the United States.
<p>
So the problem, basically, is one of extraordinarily bad timing, poor education, lack of education, and -- among certain legislators and constituents in the United States -- misunder-standing what this is all about.
<p>
To recap the amazing progress that Chile has made, we're talking about an annual average increase in gross national product of 6 percent in the last 10 years and 7.7 percent growth in 1995. That's uncanny. Inflation, less than 8 percent; unemployment, 5 percent; savings and domestic investment, 27 percent of GNP. 
<p>
 What Chile has done with its social security system and the privatization of its pension funds is what we ought to be following here in the United States. There are 22 different pension funds which Chileans can invest in, and what is the annual real return?  Thirteen percent, as opposed to the Social Security fund that a lot of us have the misfortune of being required to contribute to, that has a return of only 3 percent. You can't move out of that fund or fire your broker, because with the confiscatory nature and monopoly that the U.S. government has on Social Security, there's nothing we can do about it.
<p>
This enormous amount of money in the growth of Chile has enabled them to make an early payout on the country's external debt. They have paid their foreign debt in advance. They have trade surpluses of 1.8 percent of the GDP and the highest rating of Latin American countries in Standard and Poor's risk classification. On the World Competitiveness Council's index, Chile ranks number 20. Right behind it is Argentina.
<p>
Let's look at labor and environmental standards. In some ways, Chile's standards are more advanced than America's. However, Chile is a prisoner of our domestic politics. What we're talking about are Greenpeace groupies and their supporters, their lap dogs on the left, who do not want to see anything done with Chile that would undermine their own agenda.
<p>
Looking at environmental expenditures, the private sector in Chile contributed about $648 million in 1994 -- not required by the Chilean government -- to clean up the environment and act as good corporate citizens. 
<p>
 Labor standards?  The record is that real wages have increased in Chile, and the minimum wage increased 30 percent from 1990 to 1993. There is greater worker protection. There's paid maternity leave after delivery. There are significant severance pay and procedural safeguards against the deterioration of certain labor contracts. In fact, in the labor area, Chile has engaged in some things that many of us may well have considered excessive and that would warm the hearts of the left wing of the Democratic Party and the AFL-CIO.
<p>
Chile has reduced its tariff levels from 95 percent in 1985 to 11 percent today. There are not that many items where Chile has significant tariff and non-tariff barriers.
<p>
With or without Chile's accession to NAFTA, business will tend to view Chile as an attractive opportunity. Why?  First of all, it's open. Chile has followed the spirit of former President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas. That was really the champagne bottle against the ship that launched the trade integration movement. Rightfully, President Clinton acknowledged this as well.
<p>
Chile did not have to be told to open up its economy. Chileans understood the merits of an open-market system and of an equalized trading system long before any other countries in Latin America. They have a small population with low levels of income disparity. Their infant mortality dropped from 79 in 100,000 in 1983 to something close to 11 in 100,000. The social advances in Chile have also been phenomenal.
<p>
Even under the first year of the Pinochet government, for example, Chile was the only country in the hemisphere that spent more money than Cuba on social, education, and health projects as a percentage of the budget. Sixty percent of Chile's budget was spent on different types of projects in urban housing, on development, and on social issues. So Chile now is at the point where it is, in fact, progressing socially as well as economically.
<p>
There are few areas of contention in terms of Chile's trade relations with the world. The Chileans are poised as an export base to other areas in the Western Hemisphere, as well as to Asia. They are keen on, and active in, receiving the transfer of U.S. technology. They are exporting services, and they have a superb educational base. Chile is incorporating technology from all over the world. They're not situated with a population like Mexico that must find room for one million new entrants into the job market every year.
<p>
If you take a look at Chile's export base, 41 percent of Chilean exports are natural resources. They have been wise in diversifying the country's trading base, so that 24 percent of Chile's trade goes to the European Union, 21 percent to the United States, and 19 percent to Latin America and the Caribbean.
<p>
There is also a lot of posturing. Is Chile going to sign with the European Union because the United States is not going to admit Chile to NAFTA?  Well, the European Union has actually increased its trade with Chile significantly -- nearly 50 percent over the last six years -- while, at the same time, Chilean exports to the European Community have declined. So the European Union is more or less a one-way street for Chile.
<p>
The coin of the realm is still the U.S. market, and it's still a trade relationship that is going to proceed whether Chile accedes to NAFTA or not. I believe that's the point. American corporations are positioning themselves to take advantage of Chilean capital and technology for acquisition and expansion into related markets in South America and the Pacific Rim. U.S. multinationals are also poised to supply high value-added goods to Chilean consumers.
<p>
Is Chile a threat to the U.S. under NAFTA?  Not at all. Chile is a small economy, with a GDP one-eighth the size of Mexico's, and Chile's exports to the U.S. are more than 20 times smaller than Mexican exports to American consumers. The U.S. enjoys a favorable balance of trade with Chile, and that is going to increase. The bulk of Chilean exports are concentrated in commodities -- copper, metal, minerals, pulp, and paper. The most affected U.S. products are going to be those in the agribusiness sector, including wine, vegetables, grapes, tomatoes, and processed fruits.
<p>
On the import side, Chile increasingly is importing large amounts of capital goods, spare parts, and specialized agricultural products where the U.S. has a great competitive position. If Chile were admitted to NAFTA, the U.S. trade surplus with Chile would increase.
<p>
I would argue that there is a compelling case, by any measure, to admit Chile to NAFTA. Even if that doesn't happen, however, trade expansion will proceed, and Chile will diversify its economic base, providing the U.S. corporate sector incredible investment opportunities, while the Chilean private sector will see opportunities elsewhere, including in the United States. 
<p>
 The numbers of mergers and acquisitions, and Chilean acquisitions of U.S. companies that provide raw materials, will grow. In telecommunications, where Chile is especially strong, we are already seeing, in South Florida, Chilean investors taking equity interests in telecommunications firms and software companies. The spirit of NAFTA, at least, is alive and well in the private sectors of both Chile and the United States.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b> Thank you, Jerry; you make a strong case as well. Our next speaker is Mr. William C. Lane.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b>WILLIAM C. LANE:</b> By way of introduction, I should confess that, by training, I'm an accountant. In fact, for 11 of the 20 years I've been with Caterpillar, I worked in that capacity. I believe that experience uniquely qualifies me to discuss trade legislation because, like arithmetic, trade is really quite simple. But somehow we have allowed lawyers and protectionists in Washington to make it exceedingly complicated. 
<p>
 I don't think there's a better example of this than what's going on with the effort to expand NAFTA to include Chile. As Mrs. Franklin pointed out, Chile-NAFTA has been the bridesmaid of trade agreements now for over four years. So one would think there must be a compelling issue which has stymied negotiations. 
<p>
 The first possibility is that perhaps there is something wrong with the suitor. In other words: Is there something about Chile that disqualified the country from membership in NAFTA?  But when you look at Chile, there's not a more qualified candidate. In fact, Chile practices what The Heritage Foundation preaches. I should point out that America doesn't always practice what it preaches, but Chile does. Its savings rate is the envy of the world. It has privatized its pension system. It has embraced trade liberalization and economic reform. In short, there's no better candidate for NAFTA membership. In fact, I think you could say that Chile is probably more qualified to join NAFTA than half a dozen U.S. states. 
<p>
 If the problem is not Chile, perhaps there is a U.S. interest that's so threatened by Chilean trade that negotiations must be delayed until after the presidential election. If you check your map, you'll find that Chile is a very long country, but it's also very narrow. True, with the Andes mountains, it is a rather tall country as well. But no matter how you measure it, Chile is not an economic superpower. 
<p>
Nevertheless, Chile is an important trading partner for some countries. Last year it was Caterpillar's second largest export market in Latin America. We exported over $100 million worth of U.S. products to Chile. Are there U.S. industries that are concerned about import competition from Chile?  Well, the only two groups, I believe, that have voiced concern are salmon and wine producers. I understand that USTR explained to the salmon industry that there are currently no U.S. trade restrictions on the importation of salmon, and that seemed to satisfy them.
<p>
As for wine, Chile produces high-quality wine. I've noticed that whenever Chilean wine is discussed, there is usually someone in the audience who raises his hand and says, "You say it's low cost and it's high quality -- not that I'd do it, but where do you buy this wine?"  Then someone points out the closest ABC store, and we lose half the audience.
<p>
In any event, current U.S. tariffs on wine are relatively small. Because Chilean wine qualifies for GSP status, the U.S. tariff is only a couple of percent. The U.S. industry has identified some trademark issues, but they were not considered showstoppers. The U.S. wine industry, after all, is highly competitive, and while there may be some concerns, I don't think the industry, in the end, will oppose an agreement. So, by process of elimination, if the problem isn't Chile or opposition from the U.S. wine industry, perhaps we can identify a fatal flaw in the proposed trade agreement.
<p>
Currently, Chile has an 11 percent duty on almost all imported products. By joining NAFTA, Chile would be obligated to eliminate its duty on all U.S. products. That's fair enough. What would America be required to do in return?  Not much!  With the new GATT agreement in place, U.S. tariffs are already being cut. For example, the U.S. tariff on construction equipment is already scheduled to be eliminated via GATT. Yet, while Chile would be obligated to eliminate its tariffs on our products, it would continue to apply its 11 percent duty on products made in Europe and Asia. Is that fair?  From where we stand, there's nothing fair about it; it's just a good deal. It would give us an 11 percent competitive advantage when we sell in Chile.
<p>
Why would anyone in the United States be against that?  It's a mystery to me. Sometimes I think people tend to forget that tariffs are more than just trade barriers. A tariff is a tax. What I don't understand is why some conservatives who truly believe in the merits of reducing taxes are reluctant to endorse trade agreements which in effect require other countries to reduce their taxes on American products. Expanding NAFTA to include Chile is so positive that you would think that even a Congressman would be able to understand that. Yet Chile is still the bridesmaid.
<p>
At Caterpillar, we've discussed the best way to describe this proposed trade pact. Is it a great deal?  Is it a historic agreement?  If we're not careful, we may give hyperbole a bad name. Expanding NAFTA to include Chile may not be historic, and it may not change the cosmic scheme of things. It's just a good deal, and in business, when a good deal comes along, you don't sit around and say, "Wait a second. This isn't historic. This isn't monumental. We better not do it."  In business, if it's a good deal, you take it.
<p>
We've established that the problem is not the suitor, not domestic opposition, and not a flaw in the proposed agreement. Out of desperation we are forced to entertain the idea that maybe the problem is the status quo. Perhaps there's something about the status quo that is so compelling that folks are reluctant to change.
<p>
This hasn't made headline news, but in Latin America, tariffs on U.S. products are currently increasing. There's a new trade alliance called Mercosur that includes Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. In an effort to establish free trade within the area, these countries are setting a common external tariff. As a result, some tariffs on American products are going up. If you work for a company that has some production in, say, Brazil, this development can be managed. All you have to do is move work from the United States to Brazil, but that is hardly something the U.S. government should want to encourage. This is no time to defend the status quo; it's time to change it. It's also time for the answer. 
<p>
 What is keeping Chile out of NAFTA is purely politics. On the surface, the debate centers on the issue of fast-track negotiating authority and whether trade liberalization should be formally linked to environmental and labor policies.
<p>
At Caterpillar, we believe cutting taxes on U.S. exports is a worthy goal in itself. Others disagree. But with Chile and its high standards, these issues could easily be finessed. That was true last summer, and it's true today. There's just one problem: Currently there's a lack of political will among both parties to take on the issue of free trade. Some Republicans are concerned that supporting an expanded NAFTA would offend the Buchanan wing of the party. Most Democrats are unwilling to take on organized labor. Until that changes, we have a stalemate.
<p>
This is not to say that everyone has given up. There are still House Republicans committed to seeing that process move forward. Phil Crane continues to make a U.S.-Chile agreement a top priority. And, quite frankly, I think the Administration will be willing to address the issue of labor and the environment in a positive way. I believe this because recently the Administration has come out with a proposal that would expand the U.S.-Israeli free-trade agreement to include the West Bank and Gaza. It's a worthy objective. But while the Administration seeks an expanded trade agreement with Israel, it is not insisting that environmental and labor side agreements be part of the pact. Given this, you could even make a strong case that maybe Chile is trying to join the wrong trade pact. Instead of trying to join NAFTA, perhaps they should try to join the U.S.-Israel free-trade agreement. After all, the agreement would be noncontroversial. The issue wouldn't be demagogued in Congress, and Chile's tariffs would still go to zero. On top of that, Israel is a major trading partner of Chile. 
<p>
 Of course, I am being somewhat facetious, but the point is true. If it makes sense to reduce trade barriers that apply to the West Bank, it certainly makes sense to reduce trade barriers that apply to the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
The Heritage Foundation has a unique role to play in the continuing battle for free trade. We live in a world where our leaders are embracing the politics of focus groups. Focus groups are setting the agenda. Focus groups are deciding what issues should be addressed this year, and which ones should be deferred until 1997. 
<p>
 Regrettably, politicians are increasingly getting elected based on their ability to read their audience instead of their ability to lead their audience. The Heritage Foundation has never been, and will never be, focus group-driven. I've noticed that Heritage sometimes takes the lead even when there's no one in the audience. In this fight, we need your continued vigilance. Some of our friends who have traditionally been for free trade are being tempted to politicize international commerce. I strongly believe that Heritage needs to redouble its efforts to remind both our friends and foes of the virtues of free trade and the evils of protectionism. If that means going against some of our core constituency, so be it. It is a price worth paying.<p>

<a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a><br>
<hr>

<P>




A year ago, the United States had a clear vision of where it was going in Latin America. The U.S. 
was dedicated to spreading free trade throughout the Western Hemisphere by expanding the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This vision has all but disappeared in the eyes of the 
Clinton Administration. Bent on cluttering trade bills with environmental and labor restrictions, the 
President has thrown up obstacles to the rapid accession of Chile to NAFTA, contrary to his own 
repeated promises. The result:  NAFTA expansion has stalled.
<p>
Some in Congress want to approve a "fast-track" trade bill this year, but they do not want the 
environmental and labor restrictions demanded by Clinton.   On September 21, 1995, the House 
Ways and Means Committee reported out a measure that would renew fast-track negotiating 
authority for five years.   The Clinton Administration immediately announced that it would not 
support the bill, effectively blocking its approval by Congress. Without the President's support, no 
Democrats will vote for fast track, and Republican leaders in the House and Senate will not bring 
fast track to a floor vote if the bill does not enjoy solid bipartisan support. Making matters even 
more difficult, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS) has come out against extending fast track 
authority, arguing that President Clinton has failed "to explain to the American people why we need 
yet another trade agreement at this time."   A two-year delay in extending NAFTA to Chile would 
hurt U.S. economic interests in South America and diminish America's stature in Latin America.
<p>
If fast track is not renewed, and Chile's accession to NAFTA is pushed back two years, the biggest 
loser will be the United States. Without fast track legislation, the U.S. has nothing to offer Latin 
America. Without fast track, the U.S. cannot negotiate any agreements to expand NAFTA. In this 
vacuum, others such as Brazil will take the lead in shaping the future course of trade liberalization 
in South America, the U.S. will lose its trade privileges in the region, and the dream of a 
hemispheric free trade zone will be dead.   With fast track legislation, however, Chile's accession to 
NAFTA in 1996 will be practically assured, and the U.S. will retain its competitive edge in South 
America's trade liberalization, benefiting U.S. exports and jobs. To ensure that the U.S. continues to 
lead the process of hemispheric trade expansion, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<LI>Renew fast-track negotiating authority in 1995. 1997 is too long to wait to acquire this 
indispensable tool to expand NAFTA.
<p>
<li> Extend NAFTA to Chile in 1996. Chile's membership in NAFTA would be a reaffirmation of 
U.S. leadership in creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Other Latin American countries are 
following the situation carefully. If the U.S. fails to honor its pledge to Chile, these countries may 
lose faith in America's commitment to hemispheric trade expansion. 
<p>
<li> Avoid trade sanctions. The use of trade sanctions to pressure America's trading partners to open 
up their markets to U.S. exports rarely succeeds. Trade disputes between the U.S. and other 
countries should be settled by the World Trade Organization (WTO) of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
<p>
<li> Deal separately with issues extraneous to free trade. When policies and practices relating to labor, 
the environment, corruption, and bribery reduce market opportunities for U.S. exports, separate 
agreements may be negotiated and included with trade agreements whose implementation qualifies 
for fast track. However, trade sanctions should never form part of the enforcement mechanisms for 
such agreements.
<p>
<li> Spread the benefits of free trade to the Caribbean Basin. A congressional bill, the Caribbean Basin 
Trade Security Act, would grant the small countries of the Caribbean Basin the same access to the 
American market that Mexico has under NAFTA.
</ul><p><a name="chile">
ADMIT CHILE TO NAFTA NOW 
<p>
Chile is the benchmark against which the rest of Latin America will measure U.S. commitment to 
hemispheric trade expansion. If Chile's entry into NAFTA is pushed back to 1997, NAFTA will 
lose credibility. American policymakers should realize that postponing Chile's admission to 
NAFTA until 1997 could sideline the United States from playing a leading role in South American 
trade liberalization for as long as two years.
<p>
Chile has long been ready to join NAFTA. It has the strongest economy in Latin America. For the 
past 11 years, the Chilean economy has grown at an average annual rate of 6.3 percent. Inflation has 
been reduced to as low as 7.5 percent, and unemployment has been brought down to 5.5 percent. 
Chile has been reducing its tariffs unilaterally since the mid-1970s. The average tariff is now 11 
percent. Chile's tax structure is efficient and provides a stable income flow to the treasury, as well 
as a positive incentive to increase domestic savings, which were equivalent to about 25 percent of 
GDP in 1994. These savings underpin investment levels equivalent to 27 percent of GDP and are an 
important factor in the country's economic and financial stability. 
<p>
As ready and willing as Chile is to join NAFTA, nothing can be done unless Congress gives the 
President "fast-track" authority to negotiate a trade agreement without the encumbrance of 
congressional amendments. Without fast track, Chile will give up its bid to join NAFTA and look 
elsewhere. Free trade in South America is very competitive. The U.S. is an important player in 
South America, but so are Brazil, Chile, the European Union, and Japan. Brazil plans to consolidate 
Mercosur  before giving serious consideration to joining NAFTA. Mercosur already has signed a 
framework trade agreement with the European Union. Meanwhile, Chile is negotiating an associate 
status with Mercosur and by 1997 is likely to sign an agreement with the European Union, upgrade 
its existing bilateral trade agreement with Mexico, and wrap up an agreement with Canada, which 
is keenly interested in Chile's enormous mining potential. Moreover, as a member of the forum for 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Chile is also exploring opportunities for free trade 
agreements with Asian countries, including Japan. Argentina wants to join NAFTA, but if Chile is 
spurned, Argentine President Carlos Menem may start looking elsewhere as well. In South 
America, no one will wait for the U.S. to catch up with the Latin American train of free trade.
<p>
<a name="trade"></a>
PUTTING NAFTA EXPANSION BACK ON TRACK
<p>
For want of a nail, goes the old adage, a kingdom was lost. The failure to renew fast track quickly 
will deprive the United States of its most effective foreign policy instrument for promoting the 
economic and democratic transformation of Latin America and the Caribbean. Moreover, the pace 
of economic and democratic reform could slow in many Latin American countries where there still 
is much popular and political resistance to capitalist democracy.
<p>
Over the past decade, Latin America has been one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, and 
the United States has been one of the principal beneficiaries of this growth. U.S. exports to other 
countries in the Western Hemisphere have increased over 50 percent since 1990 -- from $137 
billion in 1990 to nearly $207 billion in 1994 -- creating a total of 1.4 million new jobs in the U.S. 
in only five years. Of the total exported to Western Hemisphere markets in 1994, the U.S. exported 
nearly $98 billion to Latin America, directly supporting 1.96 million U.S. jobs. Total U.S. exports 
to Latin America now represent 19 percent of all U.S. exports, and Latin America is the fourth-
largest market for U.S. goods. 
<p>
Many Americans and policymakers believe mistakenly that NAFTA caused the Mexican crisis. 
This is not true. NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. Mexico's currency collapsed 
because Mexico's economy is unfree and its political system is undemocratic. Investors fled Mexico 
not because they feared NAFTA, but because Mexico's weak economic and political institutions 
failed to inspire confidence in the country's long-term stability. The truth is that NAFTA kept the 
Mexican crisis from becoming much worse. NAFTA prevented investor confidence in Mexico 
from evaporating completely and also provided Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo the institutional 
strength he needed to resist domestic political pressures to abandon its free market policies and 
raise tariff barriers.
<p>
The emerging capitalist democracies of Latin America and the Caribbean have embraced free trade 
and NAFTA without reservation. This is an historic opportunity for the United States. It would be a 
pity if the Clinton Administration allowed short-term concerns and ideology to stand in the way of 
expanding trade relations in the Western Hemisphere. To put NAFTA's expansion back on track, 
and to promote greater prosperity and more jobs in America, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li> Extend fast-track negotiating authority in 1995. Representative Phil Crane (R-IL), Chairman of 
the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, hopes to put together a package of trade 
measures before the end of November 1995. This package would include:
<ul>
	<li> Renewal of a "clean" fast-track negotiating authority that excludes environmental, labor, 
and other restrictions not directly related to trade;
<P>
<li>Expansion of trade benefits for Caribbean Basin countries;  and
<P>
<li>Implementation of an international agreement to curb shipbuilding subsidies.  
</ul><P>
If President Clinton is serious about free trade and NAFTA's expansion, he will support this 
package. If the President refuses to compromise with Congress on fast track, American workers and 
businesses will lose.
<p>
Moreover, Senate Majority Leader Dole should rethink his opposition to extending fast-track 
authority this year. The Senator has been a defender of free trade in the past. His leadership will be 
no less needed in the future.
<p>
<li> Extend NAFTA to Chile in 1996. If Chile is not admitted to NAFTA in 1996, President Clinton 
will have reneged on a promise that he made at the Summit of the Americas. This will badly 
damage U.S. credibility in the region and cede the initiative for expanding hemispheric free trade to 
Brazil, the European Union, and other countries that may want to exclude the U.S. from Latin 
American markets.
<p>
<li> Avoid trade sanctions. The use of trade sanctions to pressure America's trading partners to open 
up their markets does not create jobs for Americans or benefit U.S. exports. Most of the time, trade 
sanctions imposed unilaterally by the U.S. have backfired. The principal U.S. law used to threaten 
trade retaliation is Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which grants the President the authority to 
impose punitive trade restrictions on imports. Of the nearly 80 Section 301 cases initiated by the 
U.S. since 1974, only about 15 were successful. Even in these cases, American consumers were 
saddled with billions of dollars in higher prices caused by higher tariffs and special duties. In the 
end, all Americans lose when trade sanctions are utilized. 
<p>
Instead of resorting to such counterproductive tactics, the U.S. should rely on multilateral trade 
organizations such as the World Trade Organization to settle disputes between the U.S. and its 
trading partners.
<p>
<li> Deal separately with issues extraneous to free trade. Issues related to labor, the environment, 
corruption, and bribery should never be included in any free trade agreements. For example, the 
Congress should not pass fast track legislation that forces the President to require that Latin 
American trading partners meet U.S.-style environmental standards. Under certain circumstances, 
such extraneous issues may reduce market opportunities for U.S. exports and imports in countries 
with which the U.S. is seeking a trade agreement. In such cases, however, and only after the 
Administration consults with Congress and American industry, separate agreements should be 
negotiated and attached to a legislative package of free trade agreements whose implementation 
qualifies for fast track. Any agreements covering issues extraneous to free trade should include 
specific settlement procedures, such as those contained in the NAFTA side agreements on labor and 
the environment, but trade sanction provisions should never be part of such agreements. 
<p>
<li> Spread the benefits of free trade to the Caribbean Basin. The Caribbean Basin Trade Security Act 
(H.R. 553 and S. 529), introduced in January by Representative Crane and Senator Bob Graham (D-
FL), would grant the small countries of the Caribbean Basin the same access to the American 
market that Mexico has under NAFTA. This measure preserves the Reagan Administration's 
initiative to build up the economy of the Caribbean Basin and continues the U.S. commitment to 
free trade and economic development through free-market incentives.
<p></ul><a name="conclusion"></a>
CONCLUSION
<p>
The Clinton Administration has forgotten that its greatest foreign policy achievements have 
involved the expansion of free trade. The approval of NAFTA in 1993, the approval of the GATT 
agreement that created the WTO in 1994, and the Summit of the Americas in Miami at the end of 
1994 were the high points of this Administration's foreign policy. In every other area -- in Somalia, 
Haiti, Cuba, and now Bosnia -- the Administration's foreign policy has been confused and feckless. 
If the U.S. expects to be viewed in Latin America as the region's leader and foremost champion of 
free trade, President Clinton must meet Congress in the middle, as he promised he would do 
immediately following the mid-term elections of November 1994.
<p>
Meeting Congress halfway means accepting a "clean" fast-track negotiating authority that keeps 
labor, environmental, and other extraneous issues separate from free trade. It also means not 
allowing the Administration to include trade sanction provisions in any agreements covering free 
trade or other issues. Without a "clean" fast track bill, Chile will not be joining NAFTA any time 
soon. If NAFTA is not expanded to include Chile in 1996, the United States will be pushed to last 
place in the race to liberalize trade in the Western Hemisphere and create a Free Trade Area of the 
Americas. If President Clinton and Congress fail to put NAFTA back on a fast track, U.S. 
leadership and influence over the process of hemispheric trade expansion will be diminished for 
years to come.<p><hr>

<h3><i>CHILE SHOULD JOIN NAFTA</i></h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
The prompt accession of Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would be a powerful incentive for other Latin American countries to accelerate the pace of economic liberalization and democratic reforms. These reforms constitute a necessary institutional framework upon which a successful Free Trade Area of the Americas can be built. Conversely, delaying Chile's entry into NAFTA could paralyze the consolidation of capitalist democracy not only in Chile, but also throughout all of Latin America. Similarly, if negotiations imposed conditions on Chile that are unrelated to free trade, such as side agreements on labor and the environment, Chile's economy would be damaged. Chile, therefore, would likely balk at including such agreements in a NAFTA expansion agreement.
<p>
Free trade agreements like NAFTA are the most efficient way to open up intra-regional markets. They eliminate most tariffs on trade, substantially reduce non-tariff trade barriers, and remove restrictions on the free flow of capital. Since average tariff levels are clearly higher in Chile than in the United States, the tariff elimination schedule resulting from Chile's accession to NAFTA would encourage a rapid expansion of American exports to Chile and more high-wage jobs for American workers.
<p>
Chile's quick accession to NAFTA would be a reaffirmation of U.S. leadership in the construction of a Free Trade Area of the Americas. Other Latin American countries are following the situation very carefully. They are waiting for the U.S. Congress to approve a new "fast track" negotiating authority and are wondering whether the Clinton Administration can wrap up a NAFTA deal with Chile that will pass muster in Congress. At stake is a pledge by President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas in Miami that Chile would become NAFTA's fourth member before mid-1996. If that timetable is not met, the pace of economic and democratic reform could slacken in many Latin American countries where there still is much popular and political resistance to open markets and true democracy.
<p>
NAFTA would encourage faster growth of American exports to Chile, but Chile also would benefit from the removal of some non-tariff barriers that affect Chilean exports to the U.S. market. A NAFTA agreement would shield Chilean producers from protectionist tendencies in the U.S. that fluctuate with the business cycle and are sensitive to a wide variety of special-interest groups. Similarly, the trade dispute settlement mechanism that would form part of a NAFTA deal would provide added security for Chilean exporters. 
<p>
For Chile, however, the greatest benefit of joining NAFTA is that the agreement could provide the institutional insurance Chile needs to resist domestic pressures for abandoning the free-market model. By supporting a path of more stable and higher economic growth, accession to NAFTA would be a decisive step in placing Chile in the developed world more quickly. Membership in NAFTA would encourage more foreign investment in Chile by dramatically reducing the perception of risk associated with investing in a country which, despite the high and sustained rates of development achieved in the past two decades, could still repudiate the free-market policies that have been maintained successfully since the mid-1970s.
<p>

<b>INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR FREE-MARKET POLICY</b>
<P>

NAFTA would establish an institutional framework to compel the government of Chile to guarantee the long-term stability and continuity of sound free-market policies. It also would create permanent barriers against tax increases, exchange controls, and other interventionist actions that could trigger an immediate decline in country risk perceptions about Chile. On July 11, 1995, Standard and Poor's upgraded its rating for Chile's sovereign long-term foreign debt from BBB+ to A-, placing Chile in the same top credit rating category assigned to successful Southeast Asian economies. Joining NAFTA probably would make the needed difference in raising Chile's credit rating to the highest level normally given to the most developed countries. 
<p>
Since 1974, U.S. investors in Chile have accounted for almost 50 percent of registered foreign investment and 40 percent of realized foreign investment. Following Chile's accession to NAFTA, these percentages should grow rapidly as investment restrictions are liberalized in such key economic sectors as banking and financial services -- one of the fastest-growing economic activities today in Latin America. 
<p>
The accession of Chile to NAFTA undoubtedly would expose the country to significantly greater competition, but it also would open up a fast-growing new world of trade and investment opportunities. However, in order to take full advantage of those opportunities, Chile must rise to the greatest challenge it faces today:  Chile must become more productive, competitive, and efficient. This challenge will require better leadership from a government committed to perfecting and consolidating the free-market policies responsible for Chile's track record of sustained high economic growth since 1985. Fortunately, the timing of the challenge could not be better for Chile.
<p>
Chile has won international praise and respect for the success of its free-market model and for its successful transition from military regime to freely elected democratic government. Paradoxically, however, since democracy was restored at the beginning of the 1990s, the pace of free market reform has slowed in Chile. In recent years, the Chilean government has raised taxes, made the country's labor laws more rigid, increased public spending excessively, and expanded its regulatory powers. Moreover, the government has failed to continue opening the economy. The government also has paralyzed further privatizations of state-owned companies and has ignored the need to facilitate private-sector participation in the provision of human and physical capital infrastructure. As a result, the competitiveness of the Chilean economy has been weakened, although the private sector has made remarkable strides in becoming more efficient and productive during this period. Thanks to these efforts, Chile is well-positioned today to improve its competitiveness if the government of President Eduardo Frei rectifies its present course. Accession to NAFTA would be an important catalyst for ensuring that President Frei makes these necessary changes.
<p>

<b>THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
Chile is at the forefront of developing nations. For the past 11 years, the economy has grown at an average annual rate of 6.3 percent. This growth has been accompanied by a steady reduction of inflation. In recent months, the yearly inflation rate has been as low as 7.5 percent, while unemployment has reached levels of 5.5 percent. The commitment of Chile's independent Central Bank to sound monetary policies has been decisive in bringing down yearly inflation to single digits. 
<p>
The public sector has been downsized to less than a third of what it was only two decades ago through a process of aggressive privatization and rationalization. One important consequence of this process has been a dramatic increase in private and public-sector savings. The stated goal of fiscal policy has been to maintain a balanced budget, but in practice, the government in recent years actually has maintained a permanent budget surplus equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP. Chile created this budget surplus by reducing the tax burden on individuals and corporations and by drastically reducing current expenditures from the equivalent of 30 percent of GDP in 1984 to 18 percent of GDP in 1994. Taxes also declined during the 1980s, from 19 percent of GDP in 1984 to 15 percent by the end of that decade, although since then they have increased again to about 17 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, the economy's tax structure is efficient and provides a stable income flow to the treasury, as well as a positive incentive to increase private savings.
<p>
One of Chile's principal economic strengths today is its high level of domestic savings, which was about 25 percent of GDP in 1994. These savings underpin investment levels equivalent to 27 percent of GDP. High levels of savings differentiate the Chilean economy from its neighbors not only in Latin America, but in all of the Western Hemisphere, including the United States. Savings are an important factor in Chile's economic and financial stability, shielding the country from the normal volatility of short-term capital flows. 
<p>
Another important feature of Chile's economic stability is the development and depth of its capital markets. The strength and solvency of Chile's capital markets is one of the characteristics that most distinguishes the country from the rest of Latin America. In addition, Chile's consolidated banking system is not only highly capitalized and profitable; it also is the most soundly supervised system in the region. 
<p>
The growth of Chile's capital markets and savings levels is tied directly to the successful privatization of the country's social security system during the early 1980s. The traditional pay-as-you-go system managed by the government was replaced with a privately managed and competitive system of individual capitalization. The companies that manage these pension funds compete for savings deposits, and workers can decide for themselves what percentage of their income they wish to place in the pension funds. As a result, the national level of savings has climbed impressively, adding depth to Chile's capital markets and favoring a more efficient allocation of resources for investment and savings.
<p>
The key to Chile's success in achieving sustained economic growth has been the outstanding performance of the country's export industry. Twenty years ago, copper accounted for 77 percent of Chile's total exports. Today, copper accounts for 37 percent of the country's export package. Moreover, Chilean exporters have been very adept at diversifying products and creating new markets. The geographical spread of Chile's exports currently is distributed almost evenly among the European Union, Latin America, the United States, Japan, and the rest of Asia. Argentina and Brazil are Chile's most important trading partners in Latin America.
<P>
Chile has been reducing its import duties unilaterally since the mid-1970s. The average tariff is now 11 percent. This policy of unilateral tariff cuts was bolstered by Chile's strong adherence to the multilateral efforts of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Free trade agreements negotiated with Chile's main trading partners in Latin America have played a positive role. Chile is a full member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group (APEC) and is becoming a free trade associate of Mercosur, the South American integration group that includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. 
<p>
During the last ten years, there has been a dramatic improvement in the level of Chile's external indebtedness in relation to GDP. The country's external debt has declined from nearly 120 percent of GDP in 1984 to nearly 40 percent of GDP in 1994. Over the same period, the servicing of that debt -- payments of principal plus interest -- declined from the equivalent of 35 percent of Chile's total exports a decade ago to less than 8 percent today. Chile's external debt in 1994 -- less foreign assets -- was equivalent to only 15 percent of GDP. 
<p>
Chile's social progress during the past twenty years has been as outstanding as its economic performance. For example, the infant mortality rate was reduced from 66 per thousand live births in 1973 to 15 per thousand in 1991. Access to safe water in urban areas increased from 67 percent to 98 percent of the urban population, and life expectancy at birth of the population grew from 64 years in the mid-1970s to 72 years at the beginning of the 1990s. Real per capita GDP more than doubled during the same period, measured in 1994 dollars, from $1,715 in 1973 to $3,719 in 1994.
<p>

<b>ADDING VALUE </b>
<P>
Chile is leading the current wave of structural economic reforms in Latin America, but there still is much room for improvement. To maintain high rates of economic growth, Chile must achieve significant increases in investment and savings -- both public and private -- and economic policy must be managed with great care. In this respect, a crucial factor will be a renewed government commitment to two broad policies that were developed during the early stages of the reform process in Chile. 
<p>
The first policy focused on providing incentives to private enterprise by reducing the size of government and thereby expanding the spaces available to private initiative. The creation of free-market conditions to assure the private sector's health and development was an integral part of this policy. The second broad policy was that the government should not interfere with the economy or try to steer the market's behavior, even under the pretext of acting for the "common good," as it has been doing recently. The Chilean government must understand that its proper role is to ensure that markets operate efficiently. Thus, governmental regulation should not distort markets, but facilitate their creation. 
<P>
A number of important structural reforms are still pending in Chile today. For instance, the still-high uniform tariff level of 11 percent must be reduced unilaterally in order to expand Chile's international trade, and regulations governing balance of payments capital transactions must be liberalized. In addition, investment in human capital must be improved and rationalized by reforming education and health care. A system of private concessions must be implemented to build the physical infrastructure that Chile must have in order to become more competitive internationally. Private investors must be allowed to finance, build, and operate ports, airports, and water and sewage systems. Fortunately, the legislation for most of these reforms is already in place or under discussion in the Chilean Congress.
<p>
The accession of Chile to NAFTA will stimulate a permanent inflow of international resources, causing the peso to appreciate in value. This means that, in order to prevent any loss of international competitiveness, Chile must increase its domestic savings levels from around 25 percent of GDP to at least 30 percent of GDP, and it must do so quickly. This can be achieved by cutting back public expenditures and improving the economy's tax structure by reducing the tax on personal and corporate savings. Before joining NAFTA, the Frei government also must address structural weaknesses by further liberalizing trade, moving toward capital account convertibility, and opening up the financial sector.
<p>
There is no reason to delay these structural reforms. For many years, Chile has enjoyed the economic benefits created by the unilateral reduction of its import duties. There is no need to wait for a NAFTA deal before carrying out these reforms. In fact, Chile's hand in the NAFTA negotiations will be strengthened if the Frei government acts quickly. Moreover, the NAFTA negotiations should not pre-empt or slow the process of opening up unilaterally to other countries and regions, thus minimizing the potential effects of any trade diversion that NAFTA might cause.
<p>

<b>REAFFIRMING U.S. LEADERSHIP</b>
<P>
Chile's early entry into NAFTA could spark renewed efforts throughout the rest of Latin America to push forward with difficult economic and political reforms. Chile's quick accession to NAFTA would be a powerful signal that, despite the Mexican crisis, the U.S. remains strongly committed to supporting free trade and structural economic reform in the Western Hemisphere and that there is a real reward ahead for countries that persevere in the creation of free-market democracies.
<p>
The time to act is now. This must be done before the region loses the sense of urgency that has driven the reform process since the end of the 1980s. Latin America has made a quantum leap forward in terms of economic liberalization and democratic reform, but there is always the risk that the region could backslide to its statist, interventionist past. Venezuela already has done so, while in Mexico a growing chorus of critics are wrongly blaming the peso's collapse on the free-market policies of the Salinas and Zedillo governments. In both Mexico and the U.S., the enemies of NAFTA once again are urging its abolition.
<p>
The expansion of NAFTA to include Chile presents the U.S. with a major opportunity to receive full credit for developing the vision of a free trade area encompassing all of the Americas. U.S. influence would increase significantly throughout the region if Chile were included in NAFTA. Moreover, U.S. exporters, investors, and workers would be direct beneficiaries of this enhanced influence thanks to America's fast-growing trade with the rest of the region.
<P>
But NAFTA's expansion to include Chile, and subsequently other Latin American countries, will not be a free ride for the United States. Instead, it will demand a minimum level of accountability from U.S. trade policy. The rhythm and conditionality of Chile's accession to NAFTA will be followed closely by other potential candidates for membership, such as Argentina and others in the Andean and Caribbean regions. Depending on the outcome of Chile's negotiations to join NAFTA, these countries could be encouraged to reform their economies with the goal of attaining NAFTA-level standards. However, if they are spurned by the U.S., they may seek alternatives such as Mercosur or the recently created Association of Caribbean states, whose members include NAFTA partner Mexico and communist Cuba, among others, but not the United States.
<p>
If the U.S. expects to be viewed as a legitimate champion of free trade in the world, and if it wants to be viewed in Latin America as the region's natural leader, the Clinton Administration and Congress must reach agreement quickly on a new fast track negotiating authority to implement Chile's accession to NAFTA. Moreover, the bill approved by Congress and accepted by the Clinton Administration should be a clean bill, without language on labor or environmental issues. In addition, the U.S. must implement a stable, predictable trade policy with regard to Latin America -- one that avoids the threat of unilateral actions against the region's economies and also resists pressures by special-interest groups to impose a non-trade agenda that would pose a threat to development. These are the challenges facing the U.S. as it negotiates Chile's membership in NAFTA.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     With the passage last November of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), the Clinton Administration has the opportunity to
set in motion a free trade revolution throughout the Western
Hemisphere. By expanding the NAFTA beyond the United States, Mexico,
and Canada, and pursuing an aggressive free trade agenda with Latin
America, the Clinton Administration can help create vast new markets
for U.S. exports and solidify free-market democracy in a region that
only 15 years ago was dominated by dictators and was beset by
diminishing hopes of prosperity. 
<P>
     Today, Latin America is the fastest growing region in the world
for U.S. trade and the only region where the U.S. enjoys a trade
surplus. Free trade with Chile and other reform-minded countries in
the Western Hemisphere such as Argentina and Colombia, makes sense
just like the NAFTA makes sense. Trade deals are a good way to lock
into place free market reforms and expand global trade. They also are
the key to boosting U.S. economic competitiveness and job creation at
home. Despite this, the Clinton Administration seems to be moving in
slow motion on advancing free trade in the Americas. The
Administration did request on June 16 fast-track negotiating authority
from Congress. Fast-track authority guarantees that any future trade
deal will receive an up-or-down vote from Congress, without amendment.
But the Administration's request was for seven years with no single
country identified as a top priority. (Peter Behr, "White House Floats
Trade Talks Plan," The Washington Post, June 17, 1994, p. F1. )In
spite of these mixed signals from the Clinton Administration regarding
its Latin American trade agenda, leaders in the region are wasting no
time. For example, already more than 20 free trade agreements have
been signed among these nations, with intra-regional trade increasing
in value by over 135 percent between 1986 and 1992. (Representative
Jim Kolbe, "Principles for the Creation of a Western Hemisphere Free
Trade Area," an address given before the Association of American
Chambers of Commerce in Latin America, Washington, D. C., May 5, 1994.
) 
<P>
     The next step in this process should be to extend the free trade
benefits of the NAFTA to Chile. In doing so, President Clinton would
be honoring a pledge made by former President George Bush to then-
Chilean President Patricio Aylwin in 1992 that free trade negotiations
would begin as soon as possible after the NAFTA was passed. In his
annual trade report, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor
acknowledged Bush's pledge when he noted on May 4 that Chile is the
only country with which the U.S. is "committed to [negotiate] a free
trade agreement. " ("Report to the President and the Congress on
Significant Market Opening," Office of the United States Trade
Representative, Washington, D. C., May 1994. ) 
<P>
     The focus on Chile makes economic sense. Chile is a free market
and democratic success story. No country in the developing world has
moved farther and faster in adopting free market democratic reforms.
In 1973, Chilean military leader Augusto Pinochet embarked on a
program to privatize state-owned industries, liberalize investment
rules, retire Chile's debt burden, lower taxes, and reduce trade
barriers. With the election of Patricio Aylwin in December 1990,
Chile's "economic miracle" was followed by a democratically elected
government. The transition to democracy in Chile was completed in
March 1994, when leadership was transferred from Aylwin to newly
elected President Eduardo Frei. Frei took office stressing that his
country would remain on the free market path and that Chile would
continue to push for a free trade pact with the United States. 
<P>
     The White House can acknowledge Chile's embrace of democratic
capitalism and advance its own hemispheric trade policy on June 27 and
28, when Frei visits Washington for a "working visit" with Clinton and
senior U.S. officials. By inviting Chile to enter negotiations for its
participation in the NAFTA, President Clinton will signal such
countries as Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, and Venezuela that the U.S.
sees NAFTA as just the first step in a process that might one day
include the entire hemisphere. 
<P>
     To instill confidence in the U.S. as a world economic leader,
boost U.S. exports and job growth through free trade, as well as live
up to the commitments made to the Chilean government and people, the
Clinton Administration should:
<P>
Seek multilateral fast-track authority and inform Congress that it
    intends to begin negotiations with Chile. Fast-track authority
    shields trade agreements from congressional amendments and
    protectionist tinkering that almost certainly would kill most
    trade negotiations. Without it, serious free trade talks cannot
    begin. 
<P>
Announce at the June 27-28 Clinton-Frei meeting that negotiations
    between the two countries will commence once fast-track authority
    is approved. <P>
Bring Chile into the NAFTA, rather than negotiating a bilateral free
    trade pact. While this could be more complicated because of
Mexican and Canadian participation, future NAFTA accession by additional
    countries will be easier once the first new member is accepted. 
<P>
Refrain from seeking far-reaching labor, environmental, and social
    "side accords" in the negotiations with Chile. Sufficient
    protection in these areas already exists in the current NAFTA
    agreement and additional provisions and bureaucracy only will
    undermine the free trade components of the pact with Chile. 
<P>
Make free trade with Chile and other hemispheric countries a top
    priority at the Summit of the Americas. The heads of state of the
    34 Latin American democracies will meet in Miami in December 1994.
<P>
Link the expansion of NAFTA to Chile with a broader commitment to free
    trade throughout the Western Hemisphere. In 1990 George Bush
    launched his Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) to 
    spread free trade throughout the Western Hemisphere. It has
    attracted widespread support from hemispheric leaders. Clinton now
    should create his own EAI. Besides creating a free trade zone
    stretching from Alaska to Antarctica, the EAI would spur regional
    prosperity and stability by assisting Latin American countries to
    attract foreign investment, find debt relief, and apply free
    market solutions to environmental protection. 
<P>
CHILE'S LEADERSHIP IN THE LATIN AMERICAN FREE MARKET REVOLUTION
<P>
     Chile has earned the opportunity to be a free trade partner
because of a campaign of free market reforms that began in the mid-
1970s. The government of Augusto Pinochet in 1973 eliminated price
controls, reduced tariffs across the board to a flat rate of
approximately 10 percent, privatized most of Chile's large state-owned
companies, cut back restrictions on foreign investment, and reduced
taxes. <P>
     This economic reform paid off. Since the mid-1980s, the economy
has grown at an average annual rate of 5. 7 percent, inflation has
been reduced to 11 percent from 21 percent in 1989, unemployment has
decreased to approximately 4. 5 percent last year from 12 percent in
the late 1980s, average salaries are rising, and exports have
increased to over 30 percent of Chile's Gross Domestic Product.
("Chile:Exports, Investment, and Economy," Chilean Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, No. 47, January 1994, p. 17. )Chilean products are of a high
quality and compete well in world markets. Because foreign investors
are offered favorable terms regarding taxation, expatriation of
profits, legal protection, and respect for property rights, some $6
billion in foreign investment has been attracted to Chile since 1985.
By the mid-1990s, foreigners are expected to commit some $20 billion
in new capital to Chile's robust economy. (For more information see
John F. H. Purcell and Dirk W. Damrau, "Chile:An Investment-Grade
Credit," Salomon Brothers, May 1991. ) 
<P>
 U.S. -CHILEAN ECONOMIC TIES<P>
     This record of free market reforms and the transition to
democracy has spurred the U.S. to consider free trade talks with
Chile. Washington and Santiago signed a free trade and investment
framework agreement on October 1, 1990, paving the way for an eventual
U.S. -Chile free trade agreement. The accord established a joint
U.S. -Chile Council on Trade and Investment to monitor bilateral
economic ties and to further open markets to both nations. Agenda
items for the Council have included cooperation in the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), increasing
market access for goods and services, protecting intellectual property
rights, improving investment policy, promoting the EAI, and reducing
tariffs. <P>
     U.S. -Chilean economic ties have been expanding rapidly for
several years. Trade between the two countries has grown for seven
straight years, reaching some $4. 2 billion in 1993. ("NAFTA Accord
Back on Chile's Agenda," The Financial Times, May 5, 1994. )The U.S.
is Chile's principal trading partner, accounting for about 23 percent
of Chile's total imports and absorbing 20 percent of its exports.
Within the past decade, U.S. -Chilean trade doubled in volume.
("Chile-Economic Trends," Embassy of the United States, Santiago,
Chile, January 1994, p. 1. ) <P>
     According to the Central Bank of Chile, Chilean exports to the
U.S. in 1993 exceeded $1. 6 billion. The composition of these exports,
however, has changed over the past ten years. While copper continues
to be the main U.S. import, Chilean fresh fruit, seafood, chemical
products, and wine also have found their way to the American
marketplace. <P>
     U.S. exports to Chile, one of America's fastest growing markets,
totaled approximately $2. 4 billion in 1993 and have grown by 200
percent since 1986. Chile's imports from the U.S. are heavily weighted
toward high-tech equipment, such as computers, and consumer goods.
(For more information on the content and quantity of U.S. -Chile
trade, see "Trade and Investment Between Chile and the United States
for 1993," Embassy of Chile, August 1991. )<P>
     The U.S. also is the principal foreign investor in Chile's
banking, insurance, forestry, mining, light manufacturing, and
agricultural industries. As a result of the high returns on foreign
investments, a total of some $3 billion in foreign investment flowed
into Chile last year alone. Total investments in Chile surpassed 27
percent of GDP last year, six times the average rate for the region.
("Chile Lights Way for its Neighbors," The Financial Times, February
17, 1994. )<P>

THE CASE FOR A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHILE<P>
     There are many Latin American countries that could be candidates
for a free trade agreement with the U.S. However, Chile's economic
promise puts it at the head of the list. In fact, there are six
reasons why the U.S. and its NAFTA partners should begin free trade
negotiations with Chile. 
<P>
REASON #1: Chile's economy is one of the most open and advanced in
    Latin America. Since the mid-1970s, Chile has reduced the number
    of its government-owned enterprises from approximately 500 in the
    mid-1970s to about 50 today. Moreover, the average tariff rate has
    dropped from about 105 percent during the two years of the Marxist
    government of Salvador Allende prior to 1973 to 11 percent in
    1993. And while in 1973 Chile's GDP shrank by some 12 percent, it
    grew by over 10 percent in 1992 and a still impressive 7 percent
    last year. ("U.S. Market Access in Latin America:Recent
    Liberalization Measures and Remaining Obstacles," United States 
    International Trade Commission Report No. 2521, June 1992, pp. 5-1
    to 5-22. )Chile's economy is one of the fastest growing and most
    open in the world. With much of this growth fueled by trade,
    accession to the NAFTA is sure to further boost the economic
    performance of all signatories. 
REASON #2:Other countries in Latin America would be encouraged to
    follow Chile's democratic and free market model, thus advancing
    the prospects for hemisphere-wide free trade. Rapidly concluding
    an agreement with Chile will encourage other countries in Latin
    America to imitate Chile's unsurpassed economic and democratic
    successes. These countries are eager to sign free trade pacts with
    Washington or to join NAFTA directly, in order to attract American
    investment and to boost exports to the U.S. If Chile joins NAFTA
    quickly, they will conclude that their reforms might lead to
    similar results. Already Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica,
    El Salvador, Uruguay, and Venezuela are modeling much of their
    economic reform program on Chile's. The hemisphere-wide momentum
    toward democracy and free market reforms must not be allowed to
    slow. Acknowledging the country that has reformed the most will
    undermine populist and nationalist opponents of free market
    reforms that still exist throughout the region. <P>
REASON #3:There is little opposition to free trade with Chile from
    U.S. labor unions. A free trade agreement with Chile will meet
    little opposition from organized labor in the U.S., unlike the
    NAFTA. The reasons:Chilean sales of fruit and seafood to the U.S.
    require the intensive use of American labor at ports of entry, and
    thus will create new jobs here. More important, Chile exports much
    less to the U.S. than Mexico and Chilean imports do not affect
    economic sectors in the U.S. that are heavily unionized.
    Moreover, the AFL-CIO, America's leading labor union, and Texas
    billionaire Ross Perot, both strong NAFTA foes, have not made much
    effort to undermine an agreement with Chile. In fact, a number of
    unions are now looking into ways that they can benefit from NAFTA
    and other trade pacts. ("NAFTA Success May Aid New Trade Accords,"
    The Wall Street Journal, June 13, 1994, P. A1. )The obstacle in
    the U.S. to free trade with Chile, therefore, is not
    protectionism, but indifference. <P>
REASON #5: U.S. agricultural interests have no reason to oppose an
    FTA with Chile. Chile's growing seasons are the reverse of those
    in the U.S. When U.S. produce is coming to market, Chile is in
    the midst of winter -- and thus is not exporting agricultural
    goods to the U.S. The result:Chilean grapes, kiwi fruit, peaches,
    plums, and apples do not compete directly with crops grown by
    American farmers. Lacking competition from Chilean farmers,
    American farmers and agricultural groups will be less opposed to a
    free trade pact with Chile than they were in the case of Mexico,
    which has the same growing season as the U.S. (See: "Chile:
    Exports, Investment, and the Economy," No. 47, The Chilean
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs, January 1994. )
<P>
REASON #6: Chile has already demonstrated that it is a safe climate
    for U.S. investors. Americans already have over $1. 5 billion
    invested in Chile, primarily in the mining, financial services,
    agriculture, forestry, and telecommunications industries.
    According to the Commerce Department, U.S. profits on investments
    in Chile have been more than 40 percent per year for the past four
    years. Chile offers American investors political stability and a
    well-educated work force. It also is the fastest growing market in
    Latin America for such U.S. -produced capital equipment as mining
    and agricultural machinery. By removing trade barriers and
    restrictions on investment, a free trade pact would facilitate
    American investments in Chile. (For more information on Chile's
    investment climate, see: "Chile :Foreign Investment Report,"
    Chilean Foreign Investment Committee, February 1994. )
<P>
CLINTON'S SLOW MOTION ON U.S.-LATIN TRADE <P>
     Despite the preponderance of evidence in favor of early free
trade negotiations with Chile, the Clinton Administration has sent
mixed signals about its Latin American trade strategy. Senior trade
and economic advisors at the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and
State privately acknowledge that they have been nudging Clinton and
Trade Representative Kantor to be more aggressive in spreading free
trade in the Western Hemisphere. These officials stress that a free
trade agenda needs to be established no later than this fall so that
it can be unveiled in Miami next December at the so-called Summit of
the Americas. (The Clinton Administration announced last December 1 in
Mexico City its intentions to host a 34-nation Western Hemisphere
summit in Miami, Florida, this December. During the announcement, Vice
President Al Gore called for greater hemispheric coordination on
economic, environmental, political, and cultural issues, and referred
to the NAFTA "as a starting point for dealing with the common
challenges of the Americas. "The Heritage Foundation has been urging
the Administration to make free trade and economic reform the top
issues at the historic summit. )They understand that failure to do so
will be seen as a lack of leadership by the U.S. But other than
rhetoric about expanding free trade in the Western hemisphere, there
has been little movement by the White House and USTR on enlarging the
NAFTA. ("USTR Foot-Dragging on Post-NAFTA Policy Leads to New
Initiatives," Inside NAFTA, from the publishers of Inside U.S. Trade,
Washington, D. C., Vol. 1, No. 8 (April 20, 1994), p. 1. )<P>
     To be sure, the USTR has been distracted with finishing the
Uruguay Round of GATT talks. In addition, there is a growing sense in
Washington that additional trade negotiations will take a back seat to
other issues important to the Administration, like health care reform.
The coming mid-term congressional elections, combined with the need to
obtain congressional passage of implementing legislation for the GATT
agreement by August, has cooled interests in pushing vigorously ahead
with Chile and other Latin American countries. Moreover, the
Administration has yet to develop a concrete plan on how to spread
free trade throughout the hemisphere and on what types of agreements
it will negotiate. The NAFTA implementing legislation, however,
mandates that the President deliver to Congress by July 1 precisely
such a plan on U.S. trade policy. <P>
     There also are mounting cries from the protectionist wing of the
Democratic party to go slow -- or scuttle entirely -- trade expansion
in the Americas. While House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt
introduced a bill in Congress on May 9 calling for the start of free
trade negotiations with Chile, the bill is seen by free traders to be
largely a smokescreen for protectionist interference. (The Chile Free
Trade Agreement Negotiating Act of 1994 was co-sponsored by
Representatives Bill Richardson (D-NM), Robert Torricelli (D-NJ), and
Senator Harris Wofford (D-PA), all strong opponents of the NAFTA and
free trade. )The reason:The Gephardt bill ties free trade talks with
Chile to rigid labor and environmental conditions, and attempts to
codify trade regulation that can be used in all trade talks in the
region. Many leading Republican members of both the House and the
Senate, who swallowed the environmental and labor side-accords in the
NAFTA, seem less willing to do the same in future trade deals.
Moreover, Chile has even hinted that it would not negotiate an
agreement that contained such strict non-trade regulations and that it
would seek new trade opportunities in the rest of Latin America and
Asia. <P>
     Consequently, the Administration is playing down the expectations
of Latin American countries on free trade. For example, James Jones,
the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, stated on May 10 that no new members
are likely to be admitted to the NAFTA during 1994 because "the U.S.
congressional calendar is full" and because there is a "shortage of
time. " ("Kevin G. Hall, "Ex-NAFTA Advisors Discourage Separate
Bilateral Accords," The Journal of Commerce, June 1, 1994. )Given
these confusing signals from the President, the Congress, and the
USTR, supporters of free trade in the Americas doubt the White House's
philosophical and political commitment to advancing the NAFTA beyond
Mexico. 
<P>
CHILE AND THE POST-NAFTA AGENDA FOR THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
<P>
     In his "Report to the President and the Congress on Significant
Market Opening," Kantor lauded Chile as a "leader [throughout Latin
America] in long-term macroeconomic stabilization" and stressed that
Chile's record of "sustained economic growth and efforts to alleviate
poverty are also unsurpassed. " ("Chile Singled Out for Trade Pact,"
The Journal of Commerce, May 5, 1994. )The report states unequivocally
that "The Administration intends to work with the Congress towards
[the goal of a U.S. -Chile FTA]. "<P>
     The Clinton Administration must back up its rhetoric with
concrete actions. Free trade with Chile will help consolidate and
expand the mutually beneficial relationship that has developed between
the two countries in recent years. To spur economic prosperity
throughout the Americas by extending the benefits of the NAFTA to
Chile, the Clinton Administration should: 
<P>
Obtain broad-based, multilateral fast-track authority and inform
     Congress that the President intends to begin negotiations with
     Chile. <P>
     "Fast-track" negotiating authority allows the Administration to
negotiate a comprehensive agreement and present it to Congress for
approval or rejection as a whole. (For a full discussion of the
process, see Wesley R. Smith, "Why Bush Needs the Fast Track for Trade
Negotiations," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 163, April 30,
1991. )This process frees the trade negotiators from concerns that
what they agree to at the bargaining table will be amended by
Congress. Congress approved fast-track authority for President Bush's
NAFTA negotiations with Mexico; this authority was extended through
last December 15 to cover final negotiations of the Uruguay Round of
the GATT, but has now expired. <P>
     Under fast-track rules, free trade talks with a given country
cannot begin until 60 legislative days after Congress has been
notified. Therefore, time is running out for negotiations to begin
this year. If the Administration hopes to begin negotiations with
Chile this year, it must obtain fast track authority before the
traditional August congressional recess and the start of the fall
campaign season. Once the campaigns begin, it will be virtually
impossible to conduct sober debate over such a potentially divisive
issue as free trade. <P>
Announce at the June 27-28 Clinton-Frei meeting that negotiations
     between the two countries will commence once fast track authority
     is approved. <P>
     The upcoming visit to Washington by Chilean President Frei gives
President Clinton the opportunity to reclaim the free trade high
ground and end the drift in U.S. trade policy since the conclusion of
GATT last December. The visit will give Clinton a platform on which to
declare his commitment to early free trade negotiations with Chile,
and to restate the vision for free trade throughout the hemisphere.
Soon after he was elected, Clinton told the American people:"I think
that a major part of our economic future rests in building up a strong
two-way trade with Latin America. . . . I hope that we can get a trade
agreement with Chile. I'm also very encouraged by what's going on in
Argentina now. " (Remarks by then-Governor Bill Clinton before the
Bipartisan Congressional Leadership Press Conference, November 19,
1992. )The Frei visit will give Clinton the chance to recall that
message. 
<P>
Refrain from seeking far-reaching labor, environmental, and social
     "side accords" in the negotiations with Chile. 
     Issues not directly related to trade issues should not be made an
integral part of future free trade agreements, whether they be in
Latin America, Europe, or Asia. Labor standards, environmental
enforcement, human rights, anti-drug efforts, or even levels of
democratic development should not be tied directly to whether or not
the U.S. decides to enter into a free trade agreement with a specific
country. Free trade is a goal that should be pursued on its own merit.
(For more information, see Kolbe, op. cit., pp. 7-10. )It is important
to remember that as countries become more developed economically, they
also tend to improve labor standards, protect the environment, observe
human rights, promote the rule of law, and advance democratic
governance. A heavy dose of labor and environmental regulation will
only serve to destroy the bi-partisan, pro-free trade coalition that
has grown in the U.S. and diminish interest in free trade in the
developing world. <P>
     Senate Republicans have already warned Clinton that there is
"lack of consensus . . . with regard to . . . your proposal [to] link
trade to labor and environmental issues. " (Letter from Senator Robert
Dole, et al. to President Clinton, June 21, 1994. )In a letter signed
by all 44 GOP Senators regarding the Administration's request for
fast-track negotiating authority, Republicans pointed out that "the
relationship between trade and labor and environmental matters raises
important questions," an examination of which would be denied if the
Administration negotiates them under fast-track rules that require an
up-or-down vote with no changes to the agreement. 
<P>
Bring Chile into the NAFTA, rather than negotiating a bilateral free
      trade pact. <P>
     The Chilean Finance Minister, Eduardo Aninat, stated last month
that the Frei government would rather join the NAFTA than negotiate a
bilateral pact. ("NAFTA Accord Back on Chile's Agenda," The Financial
Times, May 27, 1994. )For its part, the Clinton Administration has yet
to decide which countries will qualify for free trade negotiations,
and whether these countries will join the NAFTA, negotiate bilateral
pacts, or seek free trade status with the U.S. as blocs. U.S. Trade
Representative Kantor, however, has stressed that direct accession to
NAFTA should be possible for Latin American nations like Chile which
"seem to be in a position to be able to take on NAFTA obligations. "
("Kantor Signals the need for Interim Trade Pacts in Latin America,"
Inside U.S. Trade, January 28, 1994. )Kantor was referring to the fact
that Chile has moved farther and faster than practically any other
developing country in its free market reform program. <P>
     The Clinton Administration would be wise not to adopt a rigid
"cookie cutter" approach to expanding trade throughout the region. The
multilateral negotiations needed to expand NAFTA will be more
difficult than reaching bilateral agreement on a country-by-country
basis. But Chile's advanced economy makes it an excellent candidate
for inclusion in the NAFTA. Examples:its tariffs are low, it has a
deregulated economy, it has liberal investment laws, and its labor
standards are advanced. A bilateral approach could be used by
protectionists who feel that the labor and environmental side accords
to the NAFTA do not go far enough. They would use bilateral
negotiations as an opportunity to essentially renegotiate the NAFTA or
as a wedge to inflict cumbersome regulations on new trade partners.
(The author is indebted to former Deputy U.S. Trade Representative
Julius Katz for his views on this issue, which he presented during a
Heritage Foundation Panel Discussion "The Kantor Report And What It
Means For Free Trade In Latin America," June 8, 1994. ) <P>
     As Representative Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) recently stated:"Countries who
want to join the NAFTA should agree to undertake the obligations
outlined in each chapter and then negotiate phase-in periods and
exceptions in the annexes of each chapter. But the overarching
principle must be eventual assumption of NAFTA's obligations.
Exceptions should be kept to a minimum. " (Kolbe, op. cit., p. 5.
)Moreover, the NAFTA provides a trade standard that will make it
easier for importers and exporters to conduct business unencumbered by
the requirements of a plethora of country-specific agreements. The
NAFTA is viewed as the best trade expansion model by such groups as
the U.S. Chamber to Commerce, the Council of the Americas, most Latin
American governments, and almost all pro-free trade Members of
Congress. <P>

Make free trade with Chile and other hemispheric countries a top
     priority at the Summit of the Americas. <P>
     The Clinton Administration should be congratulated for its
decision to hold a summit of 34 democratic nations from the Western
Hemisphere in Miami this December. Such a meeting has not been held
since a 1967 meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay. Administration
officials have suggested that the summit agenda will include many
issues besides trade, including democracy, the environment, human
rights, and "sustainable development. " (Assistant USTR Carmen
Suro-Bredie discussed the summit at a Heritage Foundation Panel
Discussion, "The Kantor Report and What It Means for Free Trade in
Latin America," June 8, 1994. )<P>
     This broad array of issues, however, would dilute the summit
agenda. Progress in trade, investment, and market reforms will bring
the economic wealth needed to address these other compelling issues.
In preparing the summit agenda, the Administration should make it
clear to its summit partners that trade will be the top priority. This
message will be well appreciated by Latin leaders who understand the
importance of trade. The Administration should also establish the year
2000 as a target date for the creation of a Western Hemisphere free
trade community. This admittedly ambitious deadline will provide the
governments and negotiators impetus to proceed aggressively with free
market reforms and free trade talks. <P>

Link the expansion of NAFTA to Chile with a broader commitment to free
     trade throughout the hemisphere. <P>
     Clinton should create his own EAI-style program that would build
a free trade zone spanning the entire hemisphere. The 1990 EAI concept
has attracted widespread support from hemispheric leaders from Frei in
Chile to Salinas in Mexico. The goals of such a program should be to
1) create a free trade zone in the Americas, 2) stimulate foreign
investment in the region, 3) cancel U.S. government loans to countries
that pursue free market reforms, 4) wean countries away from the
reliance on foreign assistance programs, and 5) find free market
solutions to protecting the environment. <P>
     The EAI offered a vision for democratic capitalism that went
beyond the narrow objectives of trade. Clinton should adopt this
vision explicitly as his own and use free trade negotiations with
Chile to give new life to the EAI. Doing so would signal to other free
market democracies in the region, such as Argentina, Costa Rica,
Colombia, and Venezuela that U.S. relations throughout the hemisphere
will be inclusive and comprehensive. 
<P>
CONCLUSION<P>
     The U.S. and Chile both will be winners under a free trade pact.
The benefits for the U.S. will be increased markets for American
goods, lower priced and better quality products for consumers, more
jobs, and a more stable and economically prosperous Latin America. For
Chile, the key benefits of an FTA will be more jobs, increased export
earnings, more U. S investment, a more competitive economy, and
greater political stability resulting from economic growth and
prosperity. <P>
     Now that countries like Chile have the confidence to seek free
trade agreements with the U.S., Washington should not lack the
confidence or leadership to negotiate these agreements. The Clinton
Administration can fortify Chile's impressive gains and create strong
incentives for free market reform throughout Latin America by signing
a free trade pact with Chile. Clinton also should enlist Chilean
President Eduardo Frei's help to promote a trade agenda linking the
hemisphere. A U.S. -Chile FTA will be a first, but very important step
in this direction. An FTA with Chile, as well as the EAI-style
program, will create new and vibrant markets throughout the Western
Hemisphere for U.S. products. It also will help spread economic
prosperity and political stability in the region. <P>
     By contrast, indifference or inaction by Washington could result
in a setback for free markets, democracy, and security in the
Americas. If the Clinton Administration does not take advantage of the
current pro-free market and pro-democracy mood in the region, Latin
American countries could grow increasingly skeptical of U.S. free
trade policy. This could lead to socialist and anti-democratic
backlashes throughout the region. In the long run, therefore, Chile's
success or failure will help determine whether Latin America remains
mired in poverty, debt, drugs, and violence, or joins the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico in creating what could become the world's most
prosperous and competitive free market -- a free trade zone spanning
the entire Western Hemisphere. <P>

<TITLE>The North American Free Trade Agreement: Ronald Reagan's Vision Realized -- Heritage </TITLE>


<CENTER><H3><I>THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT:RONALD REAGAN'S VISION REALIZED</I></H3>
<P>
By Michael G. Wilson<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum #371<BR>
November 23, 1993<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     The approval by the Congress of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) is a victory of engagement and competition over
withdrawal and complacency. The trade pact, which will eliminate
tariffs on goods and services between the United States, Canada, and
Mexico over a fifteen-year time span, will create the world's largest
market: some 360 million people, with an economic output of more than
$6 trillion a year. The NAFTA thus guarantees that American workers
will remain the most competitive in the world and that American
consumers will continue to have access to the world's finest goods and
services.
<P>
     The North American free trade area that the agreement creates
will produce 25 percent more goods and services than the European
Community, giving North America enough economic muscle to challenge
the emerging unified market in Europe and an East Asia market
dominated by Japan. The NAFTA also will offer Americans cheaper goods,
and increase U.S. exports by making them more affordable for the rest
of the world. Moreover, it will create an estimated 200,000 new jobs
for Americans, reduce illegal immigration from Mexico, help tackle
drug trafficking, strengthen Mexican democracy and human rights, and
serve as a model for the rest of the world.
<P>
     President Clinton has correctly described the agreement as "just
a first step," stressing that he will reach out to other Latin
American countries in an effort to spread free trade throughout the
hemisphere. In so doing, he will move even closer to the conservative
vision of a hemisphere-wide free trade area.
<P>
     Long-Standing Support for Free Trade with Mexico. Ronald Reagan
first proposed a free trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico in
his 1980 presidential campaign. Since that time, The Heritage
Foundation is proud of the role it has played in articulating
President Reagan's vision of free trade in Latin America and around
the world. Since the mid-1980s, Heritage analysts have been stressing
that a free trade agreement with Mexico not only will stimulate
economic growth in the U.S., but will make Mexico a more stable and
prosperous country. Heritage has published over three dozen studies
stressing the benefits of free trade in North America. 
<P>
     The Foundation also has highlighted the Mexican success story.
Under the leadership of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
Mexico has moved further and faster than practically any other country
in the world in promoting free market reforms and free trade. The
approval of the NAFTA by the Congress is a recognition of these
historic advances and will help ensure that the momentum in favor of
economic and political liberty throughout the Americas is maintained.
<P>
     In June 1986, then-Heritage analyst Edward L. Hudgins wrote "A
U.S. Strategy to Solve Mexico's Debt Crisis." In that Backgrounder,
Hudgins urged the Reagan Administration to "explore further special
free trade and investment arrangements" with Mexico. Said Hudgins:
"The possibility of a complete free trade and investment zone [between
the U.S. and Mexico] should be explored. Ultimately, a complete Free
Trade Area between the U.S. and Mexico should be sought, similar to
the U.S.-Canada pact [then] being negotiated." 
<P>
     Four years later, Heritage analyst Michael Wilson argued in an
Executive Memorandum entitled "Bush and Salinas Should Launch Free
Trade Talks Between the U.S. and Mexico": "What were once distant
neighbors now appear to be developing into economic and geopolitical
partners. George Bush should strengthen this cooperative relationship
not only by supporting Salinas's economic reforms, but by moving
quickly to negotiate a free trade agreement with Mexico."
<P>
     The Politics of Fear vs. the Politics of Hope. The approval of
the NAFTA not only represents a victory for the U.S. economy and the
American people, it also deals a blow to organized labor and other
protectionist forces. The agreement reaffirms the American commitment
to competition and free enterprise that other nations emulate.
<P>
     By supporting the NAFTA, the Clinton Administration and a
majority of Congress wisely rejected calls for a return to the same
protectionist policies, demonstrated by the Smoot-Hawley tariff laws,
which helped create the Great Depression. Many of these protectionist
calls were from labor unions concerned that the NAFTA would cost U.S.
jobs in older industries. Despite such concerns, though, labor will
see that, as consumers in a growing economy, they too are better off
when nations are free to trade with one another and workers are
exposed to the rigors of international competition.
<P>
     Looking to the Future. President Clinton should ride the free
trade momentum that conservatives have given him and reaffirm his
support for free trade agreements with other Latin American countries,
namely Chile, Argentina, and Venezuela. He has wisely voiced his
support for George Bush's vision of an Enterprise for the Americas,
which seeks to create a free trade area stretching from Alaska to
Antarctica. Latin America is the fastest growing market for the U.S.
and the only region where America enjoys a trade surplus. Every Latin
American leader, from Carlos Menem in Argentina to Patricio Aylwin in
Chile, has voiced support for free trade with the U.S. The Clinton
Administration should begin negotiating free trade agreements with
them.
<P>
     President Clinton should also extend the offer of free trade to
America's partners in Europe and Asia. A successful conclusion of the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in
December would be a welcome first step in that direction, as would the
President's disavowal of "managed trade" ideas in the wake of the
meeting of Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders last week
in Seattle. 
<P>
     The NAFTA win is a great victory for free trade conservatives. It
was they who first championed the notion of free trade with Mexico.
And it is they who will carry the banner of free trade in the future
-- a banner under which even Bill Clinton now marches.

<TITLE>Why This Conservative Favors This NAFTA -- Heritage </TITLE>
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 473</b>
<p>
<h2>The Heritage Foundation Lectures and Seminars</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Why This Conservative Favors This NAFTA</h3>
<a href="http://www.house.gov/armey/welcome.html">Representative Dick Armey</a> Speaking on November 4, 1993
<p>
<br>
     I appreciate this opportunity to speak to you today about one of
the most important opportunities that America has faced in several
decades.  The North American Free Trade Agreement, which adds Mexico
to the current free trade area with Canada, will create the largest
free trade zone in the world, with a population of 370 million and a
gross domestic product of $7 trillion.
<P>
     Most of the arguments in favor of NAFTA have focused on the
short-term economic benefits to the U.S.:
<P>
     <UL>Mexico's tariffs on American goods average about ten percent
     while America's tariffs on Mexican products average only about
     three percent.  Consequently, when NAFTA eliminates these
     tariffs, America gains greater access to Mexico's market than
     Mexico gains to America's.

     Under NAFTA Mexico will allow American enterprises to provide
     banking, securities, insurance, and other services in its market.

     All serious scholarly studies of the effects of the agreement
     find net new jobs created in the U.S.  The only open question is,
     "How many?"</UL>
<P>
     With all of these benefits, it is curious that some conservatives
actually oppose NAFTA.  On a few points their concerns are valid, but
their conclusions about the actual effects of NAFTA are mistaken.  The
environmental and labor commissions established by the NAFTA side
agreements, for example, are unneeded.  But, they do not give more
power to radical American environmental groups, they do not endanger
American sovereignty, and they do not offset the benefits that will
result from freer trade.
<P>
     Today I want to give you ten reasons why all Americans who want a
prosperous, growing country, and conservatives in particular, who
favor less government control of the economy and more freedom for
individuals, should favor NAFTA.
<P>
REASON #1:  NAFTA originated as part of the vision of one of the most
outstanding conservatives in this country's history -- Ronald Reagan.
<P>
     In the late 1970s Ronald Reagan was setting forth his vision of
America, a vision that won him the White House and a vision which,
when translated into economic policy, led to this country's longest
period of economic expansion.  Part of that vision was a free trade
area in this hemisphere, stretching from the Yukon in the Arctic to
the Straits of Magellan in South America.
<P>
     The Reagan Administration negotiated the country's first free
trade area in 1985 with Israel.  Next followed the FTA with Canada. 
NAFTA is the next step in the Reagan vision of a free trade
hemisphere.
<P>
REASON #2:  Conservatives stand for the freedom of individuals, not
for the power of governments.  NAFTA restores sovereignty to
individuals.
<P>
     Too often we speak of free trade as, for example, between Mexico
and the U.S.  But what do we mean by Mexico and the U.S.?  Do we mean
the governments of these countries?  Do we mean the physical
territory?
<P>
     In point of fact, Mexico and the U.S.  do not trade anything. 
Individual Americans and individual Mexicans are the actual merchants
and customers.
<P>
     NAFTA removes the current restrictions of the Mexican and U.S. 
governments on the freedom of their citizens to trade with one
another.  NAFTA removes power from the hands of governments and
restores freedom to the sovereign individual.

     <P>Some critics have complained that somehow, by allowing the
economies of Mexico and the U.S.  to become more interdependent, NAFTA
robs America of its sovereignty.  But to these critics I say that it
is not your economy to begin with.  Conservatives reject the premise
that a country's wealth is collective or communal.  The American
economy belongs to millions of individual private property owners who
should be free to use and dispose of their property as they see fit. 
This freedom includes the right to buy from and sell to Mexicans.
<P>
REASON #3:  Conservatives respect the lessons of history.  One of
these lessons is that free trade leads to a prosperous world.  Another
is that protectionism leads to poverty.
<P>
     To paraphrase my friend Thomas Sowell, I don't have faith in free
trade, I have evidence.  Freer trade leads to greater prosperity.
<P>
     In the 19th century Britain became the dominant economic power. 
Why did Britain, a small island, rise to economic dominance?  In part
it was because Britain progressively opened its markets to imports. 
It realized that it makes little sense to waste manpower, raw
materials, land, and capital to produce goods and services that can be
purchased more cheaply elsewhere.  It is better to allow the
individuals who are most efficient in producing any given good or
service to do so and to allow them to trade with others for the things
they cannot produce as efficiently.
<P>
     Even countries that kept their markets more closed than Britain
to the outside world in fact prospered through trade liberalization. 
Germany, for example, was only united as a country under the
leadership of Prussia in 1871.  But that union was the culmination of
a process of eliminating trade barriers between the numerous small
German principalities.  The efficiency that resulted from the free
trade area between these German states helped what became unified
Germany to grow and prosper.
<P>
     The U.S.  kept trade barriers relatively high in the 19th century
as well.  But much of the American national enterprise in that century
was settling the vast territory of the West.  America was a huge,
European-size continental free trade area, stretching from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, the same distance as between Madrid and
Moscow.
<P>
     NAFTA will apply this lesson, that freer trade means greater
prosperity.
<P>
     History also shows us the follies of protectionism.  During the
1920s the U.S.  progressively raised its trade barriers to other
countries.  Of course, that meant that other countries could not earn
the dollars necessary to purchase U.S.  products.  So the U.S. 
government, through the newly created federal reserve system, expanded
credit and encouraged lending to other countries.
<P>
     When the stock market crashed in October 1929 because of these
policies, policy makers and the public assumed the country was in a
temporary recession.  By early 1930 the economy was beginning to
rebound.
<P>
     But in that year President Hoover changed a recession into a
depression by raising taxes twice.  First he raised taxes on personal
and business income.  And second, he raised taxes on purchases from
overseas, under the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.
<P>
     Britain followed suit at the 1930 Ottawa conference by
establishing the imperial preference system to favor trade within its
empire and discourage trade outside of it.  Similarly, France tried to
restrict within its empire.  Fascist Italy already was trying to keep
out foreign goods and investments.  And when Germany went fascist it
followed a similar policy.
<P>
     Unlike a trading bloc, NAFTA does not establish significant new
barriers to non-NAFTA members.  Rather, it opens markets and, it is
hoped, will lead to more free trade areas.
<P>
REASON #4:  Conservatives understand the need for institutional checks
on government abuses of freedom.  NAFTA provides such a check.
<P>
     To explain this point, I call your attention to one of the
principal reasons why Mexico wants NAFTA.  The Mexican government over
the past seven years has taken major steps to convert its socialist
economy into a free market economy.  It has joined the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and, as a result, already lowered many
of its trade barriers.  It has controlled the runaway inflation of its
currency.  It has sold off many government-owned enterprises.
<P>
     But the free market advocates in Mexico understand that these
reforms could be undone by a future government.  And the Leftist
opposition in Mexico that might control or influence such a government
is indeed anti-American and anti-free market.  Two Leftist critics of
the government of Mexican President Carlos Salinas, for example,
recently suggested that in place of NAFTA, Mexico levy a 100 percent
tariff on American imports while allowing Japanese and European
imports into the country duty-free.
<P>
     Thus, to make it difficult or impossible for a future government
to scrap the free market reforms, Mexican reformers understand the
need to integrate their country's economy with the economy of a
relatively prosperous, more free market country.  For Mexico, the
obvious candidate for economic partnership is the U.S.  If Mexico is
more integrated with America's economy, what would happen, for
example, if the government of Mexico decided to nationalize and run
enterprises that belong in the private sector? 
<P>
      Naturally such companies would run inefficiently.  But with a
free trade area, American firms would provide alternatives to the
high-cost, low-quality government goods or services.  The Mexican
government enterprises would lose millions of dollars and require
massive government bailouts even larger than those normally required
by such enterprises.  Mexico would have a very hard time affording
such an economically irrational policy in a NAFTA with the U.S.  and
Canada.
<P>
     But the same controlling effect on government can work on America
from closer economic ties with Mexico.  For example, many of America's
environmental laws have little or nothing to do with protecting the
public health and safety, and everything to do with empowering
bureaucrats.  With NAFTA, the U.S.  will have a strong incentive to
replace these senseless laws with a more efficient and just form of
environmental protection based on private property rights.  America
would have a strong incentive to clean up its own competitiveness act.
<P>
REASON #5:  Conservatives examine new arrangements closely and base
their decisions on facts.
<P>
     Conservatives know well not to trust the words and assurances of
governments when they propose new policies.  This does not means that
conservatives oppose all change, only change that limits freedom and
expands government power.
<P>
     Some conservatives fear that the labor commissions and especially
the environmental commissions set up by the NAFTA side agreements
might take away American sovereignty or give radical environmentalists
in America more power.  These concerns are legitimate and reflect the
kind of care and attention to the potential dangers of new government
bodies that is a hallmark of conservatives.  But I'm happy to report
that while the commissions are unnecessary, they do not pose a danger
to Americans.
<P>
     Let me review briefly what the commissions can and cannot do. 
The first function of the commissions is fact-finding.
<P>
  Each commission consists of representatives of the three NAFTA
governments and a Secretariat.  The secretariat of the environmental
commission is empowered to investigate cases called to its attention
of a country's failure to enforce its own laws.  The commissions
cannot search for cases on their own.
<P>
  Further, the commissions have no subpoena powers for collecting
evidence.
<P>
  What the commissions can do, in the end, after an arduous process
that weeds out nuisance complaints, is issue reports of their
findings.  These reports, like other reports by international bodies,
might be informative or they might be useless.  But they have no
effect whatsoever on the power of the American people to conduct
policy as they see fit.
<P>
     The second function of the commission is dispute resolution.
<P>
  If a NAFTA member government believes that another member is
engaging in a "persistent pattern of failure to effectively enforce"
its own environmental or labor laws where a tradeable good or service
is involved, it can request consultations and, on the agreement of the
other NAFTA member, have a dispute resolution panel convened.  But if
a country is found to be engaging in such a pattern, its sovereign
powers still cannot to overridden by the panel.
<P>
  If the guilty country does not agree to change its practices, the
panel can levy a fine of no more than $20 million.  If the country
refuses to pay the fine, the worst the panel can do is allow the
aggrieved country to restore certain limited tariffs to pre-NAFTA
levels to collect the fine.  This is similar to retaliation under
GATT.  It does not limit sovereignty.
<P>
     It is critical to note that nothing in NAFTA prohibits a country
from changing its own laws.  Often critics cite Article 1114 of the
accord which states that "it is inappropriate to encourage investment
by relaxing domestic health, safety or environmental standards."
<P>
But NAFTA contains no mechanism by which member governments can act
against an alleged violator.  The lip service paid by NAFTA to these
standards does not confer upon any international body legal authority
over U.S.  domestic affairs.  The U.N.  charter, for example, calls
for the peaceful solution of all international disputes.  Has this
produced world peace?  Has an American weapons manufacturer found
itself answering to an international tribunal for violating such
policies?
<P>
  The environmental agreement makes clear that, while NAFTA countries
are urged not to reduce environmental standards, they still retain the
right to make their own policies.  Beginning the side agreement is a
preamble "Reaffirming the sovereign right of States to exploit their
own resources pursuant to their own environmental and development
policies....  "
<P>
 Article 3 of the side agreement, while calling for high levels of
environmental protection, does so while "Recognizing the right of each
Party to establish its own levels of domestic environmental protection
and environmental development policies and priorities, and to adopt or
modify accordingly its environmental laws and regulations....  "
<P>
Free market advocates need not fear that American special   interest
groups will use the commissions to impose more    regulations on the
U.S.  economy.  According to Article 2021    of NAFTA, private parties
do not have a right of action in   U.S.  courts based on Commission
findings.
<P>
REASON #6:  Conservatives understand that free trade areas breed more
free trade areas, that NAFTA is a means to spread economic liberty
throughout the hemisphere and the world.
<P>
     The U.S.  often complains about trade barriers in other
countries.  American firms face restrictions when they try to sell
computers in Brazil or rice in Japan.  Of course, the U.S.  has many
trade barriers as well.
<P>
     The U.S.  government often uses the threat of trade retaliation
as a means to force other countries to remove trade barriers.  This
approach does not work very well.
<P>
     But consider the economic dynamics set up by a free trade area. 
Brazilian firms, for example, want to compete with American firms
selling products in Mexico.  But under NAFTA, American products enter
Mexico duty-free.  Brazilian products, however, are subject to an
average ten percent duty.
<P>
     How can Brazil make up for this disadvantage?  By raising trade
barriers on Mexican or American products?  No!  Such an approach would
not make their goods more competitive in Mexico.
<P>
     Brazil would have a strong incentive to follow the strategy "If
you can't beat 'em, join 'em."  Only by seeking membership in the free
trade area, could a country place itself again on an equal footing
with their competition.
<P>
     This phenomenon in fact is already occurring.  The Japanese, for
example, were concerned about the U.S.-Canada FTA and are now
concerned about NAFTA.  NAFTA gives the U.S.  more leverage to open
the markets of Japan and Europe.
<P>
REASON #7:  Conservatives understand that only through free exchange
can American living standards continue to rise.  NAFTA expands such
exchange. 
<P>
     Rising material living standards result from rising productivity. 
To be more productive, American businesses must produce more goods and
services with given amounts of labor, capital, land, and raw
materials.  The only way workers can trade their labor for more real
purchasing power is if their labor is more valuable, that is, if they
produce more goods and services.
<P>
     But to prosper we cannot simply produce more of the same old
things.  The history of economic development over the past two
centuries is one of creating new goods and services never before
dreamt of.  This development included introduction and/or mass
production of everything from trains, planes, and automobiles, to
skyscrapers and assembly lines, to penicillin, anesthetics, heart
transplants, to telephones, radios and televisions, microchips, and
personal computers.
<P>
     The world's leading industrial countries are those that pioneer
the new products.  How can we assure ourselves that America will
remain on the economic cutting edge?  How can we give American
entrepreneurs the strongest incentive to continue in our pioneer
economic spirit?  How can we make America competitive in the future? 
Simple.  Allow Americans to compete.
<P>
     By creating a huge free trade zone, NAFTA will allow for a more
efficient division of labor.  Mexicans and Americans respectively will
put more resources into the production of goods and services at which
they are most efficient.  The combination of greater competition and a
larger market will help guarantee that America will remain the world's
most productive economy.
<P>
REASON #8:  Conservatives are optimists who seek to expand economic
opportunity, and not cower behind trade barriers.
<P>
     The motivation of many opponents of NAFTA seems to be simply
fear.  While none can demonstrate exactly what the dangers of freer
trade are from NAFTA, they want us to take their emotions as a reason
to deny freedom of commerce to Americans.  It is embarrassing to hear
Americans fear that they just can't compete.
<P>
     But America is the one country in the world built on the attitude
of optimism and the expectation of opportunity.  This country was
settled by pioneers who risked everything to move to a new land, faced
physical dangers, left countries that offered no avenues of
advancement for a country that offered absolutely no guarantees but
one:  the guarantee that every American be free from repressive
government, that every American be free to rise to whatever level they
could through his own hard work and efforts, and to trade freely based
on mutual consent.
<P>
     The result was the most prosperous country in the world.
<P>
     Again, while some concerns about NAFTA are legitimate, some fears
manifestly are not.
<P>
NAFTA opponents should not fear free trade when America has the most
productive economy in the world.
<P>
NAFTA opponents should not fear free trade when America is the largest
exporter in the world.
<P>
NAFTA opponents should not fear free trade with a country whose
economy is only one twentieth the size of America's.
<P>
NAFTA opponents should not fear free trade when the history of
American enterprise, when unshackled from government taxes and
regulations, is one of meeting and winning every economic challenge.
<P>
REASON #9:  Conservatives understand that if this country abandons
free trade and free markets, it could indeed become a second-rate
power.
<P>
     It is instructive to consider the example of Argentina.  Earlier
in this century, Argentina was one of the top ten richest countries in
the world.  Its living standards were comparable to those in Europe. 
It is a country blessed with incredible natural resources, for
example, the pampas, which is one of the most fertile wheat and cattle
producing parts of the world, and its own oil reserves.  British
investors built what was then a state-of-the-art railroad.  It had
power plants, factories, and other facilities.
<P>
     But in the 1940s it followed the anti-free trade, anti-foreign
investment, pro-central planning approach of Juan Peron.  It closed
its markets.  And over the decades it joined the ranks of less
developed countries.  Today, Argentina is engaged in a great national
struggle to transform its economy and to rejoin the world market.
<P>
REASON #10:  Conservatives understand that with NAFTA, America can
enter the 21st century as the preeminent economic power in an
economically expanding hemisphere.
<P>
     I conclude my talk by observing that America truly has the
opportunity to enter the 21st century as the preeminent economic power
in an economically expanding hemisphere.  NAFTA is an agreement that
is good for America.  But it is an agreement that especially should be
favored by conservatives.  NAFTA reflects the optimism that is basic
to the American character and the search for opportunity that made
America great and will make it greater still in the future.
<P>
     If we abandon NAFTA, Republicans run the risk of ceding the
intellectual high ground of free trade and allowing Pat Buchanan and
Ross Perot to put a stamp of protectionism on the party.  But this
party stands for ideas, for individual freedom and for economic
opportunity.  When Reagan followed this formula, the result was seven
years of economic growth and prosperity.  We cannot abandon our
principles and a winning formula for the purposes of an apparent
political expediency that will politically damage our party and our
country in the future.<P>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     With the signing of supplemental agreements on labor and
environmental issues on September 14, the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) has now been completed and awaits congressional
consideration. These side agreements had been proposed by President
Bill Clinton during his presidential campaign last year to address
concerns raised by organized labor and environmental groups. Although
they were originally aimed at bolstering NAFTA's fortunes by
persuading reluctant Democrats to support the agreement, they have had
an opposite effect: alienating free market Republicans and Democrats
while failing to win over any protectionists.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration is largely to blame for this result.
By proposing a vast array of regulatory powers for the international
commissions to be established under these side agreements, the
Administration frightened supporters of free trade, who feared that
the NAFTA would be turned into a powerful protectionist device that
would impose significant new burdens on U.S. businesses and greatly
expand government regulation of the economy. Also understandable were
concerns for the effect these international commissions would have on
U.S. federal and state sovereignty.
<P>
     Despite its efforts, the Clinton Administration was unable to
persuade Mexico and Canada to agree to provisions that, they realized,
would reduce their sovereignty. As a result, the U.S. negotiating team
had to settle for face-saving agreements that contained little more
than vague language, including monitoring commissions with little or
no power of enforcement. Although, for political reasons, the
Administration has tried to portray these agreements as substantial
additions to government regulation, they have won no converts among
the protectionists, who correctly see the commissions created under
the accords as largely powerless to raise protectionist trade
barriers. But, ironically, they have managed to convince a sizeable
portion of conservatives and supporters of the free market that the
free trade provisions of the NAFTA have been significantly eroded and
that U.S. sovereignty has been surrendered to the supranational
bureaucracies.
<P>
     In truth, although these side agreements are troublesome and
establish worrisome precedents, the protectionists are correct: they
are largely meaningless. However, that message has yet to be
understood by many conservative and free market critics of the NAFTA,
most of whom continue to base their critique on the Clinton
Administration's original proposals. A close reading should be
sufficient to dispel most of the remaining objections, especially
those regarding sovereignty. Among the most common are:
<P>
Objection #1: The side agreements undermine U.S. sovereignty by
      creating trinational commissions that can force the federal,
      state, and local governments to change their health, safety,
      environmental, and labor laws. In addition, the dispute panels
      created by the councils can force national, state and local
      governments to adopt "action plans" the council has created.
      These plans can supersede federal, state, and local government
      laws. 
<P>
Facts: 
     The side accords establish a Commission for Environmental
Cooperation (CEC) and a Commission for Labor Cooperation (CLC). Each
commission would be run by a council made up of representatives of the
U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Under the CEC, a Secretariat and a Joint
Advisory Group (JAG) made up of non-governmental organizations assists
the council in its activities. A Secretariat and a National
Administrative Office (NAO) in each country performs a similar
function under the CLC.
<P>
     These organizations have no legal power to compel the U.S.
government or the states to do anything. Under no circumstances can
the commissions or councils override U.S. or state laws. Their
function is restricted to serving as a public forum for discussing
environmental and labor issues of mutual concern, monitoring the
enforcement of existing national laws, investigating complaints, and
recommending fines or sanctions. A long and cumbersome process must be
followed before either fines or sanctions can be resorted to, with
many safeguards limiting any potential action.
<P>
     If requested by a member country, the environmental and labor
councils can appoint a panel made up of representatives from the three
countries. This panel will be responsible for investigating complaints
regarding a "persistent pattern of failure... to effectively enforce
[a country's] environmental law [and occupational safety and health,
child labor or minimum wage technical labor standards]." (North
American Agreement On Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC), Final Draft,
Article 22; North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC),
Final Draft, Article 33 (The NAFTA:  Supplemental Agreements,
September 13, 1993).) If a panel decides that such a complaint is
valid, it can issue fines and ultimately allow an offended country to
impose sanctions in the form of tariffs. The fines are levied against
the national governments -- not against businesses or individuals --
while sanctions are imposed against the specific industry sector
concerned.
<P>
     However, neither fines nor sanctions can be imposed until after a
long and arduous process of consultations between the countries has
failed to resolve the dispute. More important, any country is free to
reject the decision of the tribunals along with the fine, and the
panel has no power to collect it. If a country chooses not to pay the
fine, the other member countries can impose sanctions in the form of
tariffs, but those tariffs are limited to levels currently in
existence. In other words, even in the worst case, no country would be
worse off than it is now. 
<P>
     It is true that the labor and environmental councils can
authorize the creation of an action plan, but only if such a plan is
"consistent with the law of the Party complained against." This action
plan is established only after a panel has decided there has been
consistent nonenforcement of an environmental or labor law. However,
this action plan is not enforceable. If the country or state decides
to reject the plan, the panel can issue a fine against the federal
government, but not against a state, business, or individual. If it so
wishes, the federal government can choose to ignore the fine, in which
case the offended country can levy tariffs to compensate for the
alleged damage resulting from non-enforcement, but only up to pre-
NAFTA tariff levels. 

<P>
Objection #2: The side agreements mandate ever-increasing government
      regulation regarding labor and environmental issues.
<P>
     Some free market organizations, such as the Washington-based
Competitive Enterprise Institute, oppose the NAFTA, and especially its
side agreements, because they believe these will require increasingly
restrictive environmental and labor standards. According to the CEI,
"the NAFTA side agreements mandating the 'upward harmonization' of
domestic regulations between the signatories will impose foreign
regulations on the United States, and heap costly new regulations on
the impoverished citizens of Mexico, thereby lessening free trade."
("A Declaration of Independence on NAFTA," Competitive Enterprise
Institute, August 1993.) According to Llewellyn Rockwell, Jr., of the
Auburn, Alabama-based Ludwig von Mises Institute, the accords will
"please regulators, union bosses, and environmentalists, but prevent
future Republican presidents from enacting free-market reforms."
(Llewellyn Rockwell, Jr., "Risk of the Side Deals," The Washington
Times, September 7, 1993, p.  E3.) And commentator and former
presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan has said, "If NAFTA passes,
the dream of a conservative-libertarian counterrevolution, to roll
back Big Labor's special interest laws, and to reverse Congress'
capitulations to the Greens, is gone -- forever." (Patrick Buchanan,
"GOP's Drift," The Washington Times, September 10, 1993, p.  F1.)<P>
Facts: <P>
 Free market critics of the NAFTA vastly exaggerate the power of the
commissions to bring about such "upward harmonization" to the point of
invention. Despite its ritual incantation by critics, nowhere in the
text of the NAFTA or the side agreements does the phrase "upward
harmonization" appear. Article 756 of the NAFTA does recommend that
the three countries "pursue equivalence of their respective sanitary
and phytosanitary standards." In other words, to avoid disputes from
arising between countries regarding the preparation and processing of
food products that are traded, the three countries pledge to harmonize
these processes "to the extent feasible." However, neither the NAFTA
nor the side agreements provides an enforcement mechanism for this
commitment if a country chooses not to abide by it. 
<P>
     Article 1114 of the NAFTA text says it is "inappropriate" for a
country to relax standards to encourage foreign investment from
another North American country. Again, there is no enforcement
mechanism for this provision, the countries being encouraged to pursue
"consultations" if a violation of this article occurs. Articles 1114
and 756 are non-binding recommendations, intended to encourage
cooperation between governments, and cannot reasonably be interpreted
as an infringement on national or state sovereignty.
<P>
     Part of the confusion regarding these provisions stems from the
rhetoric of the Clinton Administration, which is keen to portray the
NAFTA side agreements as more substantive than they really are. For
example, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said on several
occasions that the side accords will guarantee that no country or
state lowers its standards. Most recently, Kantor wrote in the Wall
Street Journal, "the supplemental agreements will help ensure... that
no nation will lower labor or environmental standards, only raise
them. Of course, all states or provinces can enact more stringent
standards." (Mickey Kantor, "At Long Last, A Trade Pact To Be Proud
Of," The Wall Street Journal, August 17, 1993, p.  A14.) 
<P>
     Kantor is speaking more as an advocate of the agreement than an
objective observer. Although the agreements encourage each country to
maintain high standards, there is absolutely no enforcement provision
if a country fails to do so. Fines and sanctions are applicable only
for countries that do not enforce the laws they themselves have chosen
to enact, a process over which they retain complete control.

<P>
Objection #3: The side accords promote a radical environmental and
      labor agenda that is anti-business. Murray Rothbard of the
      Ludwig von Mises Institute calls the side accords "international
      socialism camouflaged in the fair clothing of freedom and free
      markets. Populists are right to view it with deep suspicion."
      (Murray Rothbard, "Rothbard-Rockwell Report," unpublished draft,
      Center for Liberal Studies, September 1993, p.  14.) 
<P>
 Facts: <P>
 In the labor and environmental side agreements, there is a call for
each government to "promote sustainable development,... promote
education in environmental matters... prepare... reports on the state
of the environment," and "assess environmental impacts." However,
these are all nonbinding recommendations and carry no enforcement
mechanism. Usually unnoticed by critics is the obligation "to promote
the use of economic instruments for the efficient achievement of
environmental goals." In other words, the market is to be used to
address environmental problems -- a far cry from a single-minded
effort to increase government environmental regulation. 
<P>
     Article 3 of the environmental accord does call for each member
country to ensure that its "laws and regulations provide for high
levels of environmental protection." But this nonbinding
recommendation carries no provision for enforcement, including either
fines or sanctions. In fact, it is preceded by a declaration that
explicitly reaffirms each country's sovereignty and freedom of action
by recognizing "the right of each Party [member country] to establish
its own levels of domestic and environmental protection... and to
adopt or modify accordingly its environmental laws and regulations."
(NAAEC, Article 3.)

<P>
Objection #4: The NAFTA and the side accords will force state and
      local governments to lower their standards in order to harmonize
      standards among the three countries. 
<P>
     Groups like Ralph Nader's Public Citizen believe that provisions
like Article 756, requiring countries to "pursue equivalence of their
respective sanitary and phytosanitary standards," could force federal,
state, and local governments to lower standards in order to make them
equivalent to lower Mexican or Canadian standards. Ross Perot has
conjured up images of local authorities being compelled to lower
health and safety standards under the NAFTA in order to allow for the
entry of pesticide-laden Mexican produce.

     <P>
Facts: <P>
This fear is misplaced. The commissions are restricted to monitoring
the enforcement of whatever laws a country chooses to pass; it has no
power to override existing laws or impose new ones.
<P>
     Article 756 is intended to help the U.S., Mexico, and Canada
avoid trade-related disputes that might arise concerning the
preparation and processing of food products. In the past, the U.S. and
state governments have sometimes attempted to protect industries from
outside competition by creating sanitary laws that had placed heavy
costs on foreign and out-of-state producers. These laws usually had
little relationship to consumer safety or health. They are, in fact,
protectionist measures and it would be best if they were done away
with altogether, but Article 756 allows for states and the federal
government to continue these practices, if they wish. 
<P>
     There is an added protection in Article 756 that directs
countries to harmonize standards only "to the extent practicable," and
if it is possible to do so "without reducing the level of protection
of human, animal, or plant life or health."

<P>
Objection #5: With the side accords, the NAFTA package closely
      resembles the European Community's Maastricht Treaty which
      empowers an unelected, international bureaucracy and severely
      limits its member countries's sovereignty over issues such as
      labor relations, the welfare of its citizens, tax policy, and
      immigration. According to NAFTA critics like Samuel Francis,
      "NAFTA really is 'the first vital step' toward the political
      ratification of a global politico-economic regime that would
      swallow national sovereignty." (Samuel Francis, "NAFTA and the
      Sovereign Issues," The Washington Times, August 31, 1993, p. 
      F1.)
<P>
Facts: <P>
The trading arrangement the NAFTA creates within North America is
entirely different from the economic, social, and political
integration Europeans set forth under the Maastricht Treaty. Under the
NAFTA, the U.S., Canada, and Mexico will remove virtually all of their
tariffs and other barriers to imports from one another and also give
added protection to each other's investments. That arrangement is a
far cry from the Maastricht Treaty and European integration in
general. For example: <P>
 Maastricht creates a uniform immigration and foreign policy, and a
common monetary system. The NAFTA does not even mention these.
<P>
In the EC, labor can move freely between member countries. Under the
NAFTA, the U.S. will allow only 5,500 Mexican professionals temporary
entry into the U.S. on trade-related business. In addition, the NAFTA
does not establish a common labor policy in North America.
<P>
The harmonizing of the EC's economic regulations, as well as its
health and welfare laws, is being done by an international bureaucracy
in Brussels. The NAFTA side agreements reaffirm each country's
sovereign right to determine the laws it will create and enforce.
<P>
The EC's bureaucratic directives are enforced through a supranational
judicial system that encroaches on the sovereignty of each member
country. The NAFTA will have no effect on the independence of national
or state judicial systems. In addition, no private rights of action
are allowed under the agreement.
     There is no greater advocate of free trade, nor strenuous
opponent of the EC and its international bureaucracy, than the former
Prime Minister of Britain, Margaret Thatcher. Thatcher said recently
in a speech to Americans: 
<P>
      I<UL> agree with the North American Free Trade Area.... I think
     Mexico is scared stiff that their people will buy from you,
     and you're scared stiff that you'll lose jobs to them.
     You'll both do well. You must have free trade, in fact, to
     get a very enterprising economy. Anyway, if you're good, you
     don't fear competition. Let's face it: America is the most
     scientific, most technologically advanced, most enterprising
     country inthe world. And you have nothing to fear. </UL>
<P>
     
Objection #6: Canada has exempted itself from the sanctions that the
      U.S. and Mexico agreed to. Patrick Buchanan asks, "Can
      Republicans support a treaty that leaves their own country
      subject to trade sanctions that Prime Minister Kim Campbell
      found intolerable for hers?" (Patrick Buchanan, "GOP's NAFTA
      Divide," The Washington Times, August 30, 1993, p.  E1.)
      According to Jim Sheehan of the Competitive Enterprise
      Institute, "NAFTA subjects the U.S. and Mexico to the same trade
      sanctions that Canada utterly rejected as an infringement on its
      autonomy." (James Sheehan, "NAFTA -- Free Trade in Name Only,"
      The Wall Street Journal, September 9, 1993, p.  A21.) 
<P>
 Facts: <P>
     It is true that Canada refused to accept sanctions as a means of
enforcing fines levied by the commissions. The effect, however, is to
deny the Canadian government the right to refuse to pay any fines
levied against it. In the place of sanctions, Canada proposed that
fines become automatically enforceable by Canadian courts, without the
right of appeal. In other words, Canada voluntarily signed away its
right to refuse to pay fines. As a result, Canadian courts will be
required to enforce decisions made by international panels, an
infringement of sovereignty neither the U.S. nor Mexico was willing to
tolerate.
<P>

Objection #7: "Right to Work" states -- those which do not allow union
      membership to be a prerequisite for holding a job -- will be
      forced to rescind their laws because the North American
      Agreement on Labor Cooperation promotes "to the maximum extent
      possible, the labor principles... the right of organized workers
      to freely engaged in collective bargaining," and "the right of
      workers to strike in order to defend their collective
      interests." (NAALC, Article 1.)
<P>
Facts: <P>
These provisions, like most others in the side agreements, are
nonbinding recommendations without enforcement mechanisms. The council
can decide only whether or not a country shows a "persistent pattern
of failure... to effectively enforce its occupational safety and
health, child labor or minimum wage technical labor standards."
(NAALC, Article 33.) This language does not preclude states from
adopting Right to Work laws but merely recognizes the right to
organize and strike, rights already embodied in U.S. federal labor
law. In addition, these provisions only promote the protection of
unions, and do not in any way discourage the creation of Right to Work
laws. 
<P>

Objection #8: The side agreements threaten the U.S. Constitution by
      failing to respect federal and state prosecutorial discretion in
      the enforcement of labor and environmental laws.
<P>
Facts: <P>
     The councils cannot impose fines for persistent nonenforcement of
labor and environmental laws in the U.S. if the government's
nonenforcement (1) is based on reasonable prioirities as to what
violations they will investigate and prosecute, and how they will
enforce compliance generally; or (2) results from legitimate decisions
to spend resources on environmental and labor matters determined to
have higher priorities. (NAAEC, Article 45; NAALC, Article 49.) 
<P>
     Under the side agreements prosecutorial discretion is an
exemption to nonenforcement of labor or environmental laws, and thus
cannot be a basis for assessing fines or sanctions.
<P>

Objection #9: The side agreements will allow private parties, like the
      Sierra Club or industries seeking protection from foreign
      competition, to sue U.S. companies based on a commission finding
      or decision. This will lead to more, not less, litigation under
      the NAFTA.
<P>
Facts: <P>
     Article 38 of the environmental agreement and Article 43 of the
labor agreement bar private groups from suing in federal or state
courts based on any findings or decisions by the commissions. (Under
Article 38 "No Party may provide for a right of action under its law
against any other Party on the ground that another Party has acted in
a manner inconsistent with this Agreement.") In addition, no private
parties can petition the councils to create a dispute panel for
alleged nonenforcement of environmental or labor laws. Only the
governments of each country can petition the council to create a panel
to resolve a dispute arising under the agreement. Even in this
process, a member country must cross many hurdles before being able to
impose sanctions against another member country. The process is
intended to promote consultations and cooperative efforts between the
member countries, not confrontation and litigation. 
<P>

Objection #10: Private companies can be fined or sanctioned under the
      agreement, thus exposing U.S. companies to decisions by
      international bodies.
<P>
Facts: <P>
     Only the national governments of each country can be fined, and
only entire sectors -- and not individual businesses -- are subject to
sanctions, and only then after
<P>
     a panel created by a council has determined that they have
     persistently failed to enforce their own laws; and 
<P>
     they have failed to create an "action plan" to remedy the
     nonenforcement, or have failed to implement an "action plan"
     which they have created themselves, or which was proposed by the
     council.
<P>
     If a national government chooses not to pay the fine, then the
country offended against can impose sanctions in the form of tariffs.
However, tariffs cannot exceed pre-NAFTA levels, which U.S. companies
will continue to face without the NAFTA. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Fears that the NAFTA side agreements will infringe on U.S.
sovereignty and impose restrictions on state and local authorities are
unfounded. Despite the Clinton Administration's original proposals,
the erosion of free trade and expansion of government regulation
feared by NAFTA supporters did not occur. The economic benefits that
the U.S. will enjoy under the NAFTA will far outweigh any potential
problems under the side agreements, a conclusion arrived at by none
other than Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman. Protectionist
members of Congress still oppose this agreement because they know that
it is fundamentally a free trade agreement. 
<P>
     Neither should there be any great concern that these side
agreements will interfere with federal, state, and local law
enforcement activities. Federal sovereignty is not threatened under
the side agreements, and state sovereignty issues can be addressed
through the implementing legislation Congress must begin drafting and
which the Administration has promised to support.
<P>
     The public debate over the NAFTA would be better served if facts
took precedence over unfounded fears. A close reading of the side
agreements will show that, despite the best efforts of the Clinton
Administration, the free trade provisions of the NAFTA remain intact
and that the feared erosion of sovereignty never came to pass.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     The Clinton Administration on September 14 launched its campaign
to secure congressional ratification of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). (The NAFTA will be considered by Congress later
this year or early next year.  It is a trade agreement between the
United States, Canada, and Mexico that will create the world's largest
open market, with a population of 370 million and a gross domestic
product (GDP) of some $7 trillion.  It will do this by eliminating
most tariff and non-tariff barriers between the three countries over a
period of fifteen years.) Flanked by former Presidents Gerald Ford,
Jimmy Carter, and NAFTA architect George Bush, Bill Clinton used the
occasion of the signing of the side accords on environmental and labor
standards to kick off his pro-NAFTA drive. Clinton's mission: convince
the American people and members of a dubious Congress that the free
trade pact with Canada and Mexico will create new U.S. jobs, expand
exports, and improve U.S. economic competitiveness. 
   <P>  However, the White House and other NAFTA supporters are facing an
uphill struggle. Anti-NAFTA forces, led by Texas billionaire H. Ross
Perot, conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan, civil rights
activist Jesse Jackson, consumer rights advocate Ralph Nader, and a
conglomeration of radical labor and environmental groups, have made
the defeat of the NAFTA their top priority.
<P>
     Flat-Out Incorrect. At the forefront of this effort to derail the
historic free trade accord is Perot's book, Save Your Job, Save Our
Country: Why NAFTA Must be Stopped --Now!. (Ross Perot and Pat Choate,
Save Your Job, Save Our Country:  Why NAFTA Must Be Stopped--Now! 
(New York:  Hyperion, 1993).) The book, co-written with economist Pat
Choate, an ardent union supporter and long-time protectionist, alleges
throughout its 142 pages that the U.S. has been "outtraded" by Mexico
and Canada in a "secret deal" that will undermine the U.S. economy.
Perot wrongly claims that cheap Mexican wages will "suck" millions of
high-paying American jobs south of the border like a "giant vacuum"
and that the U.S. manufacturing base will be wiped out. The Perot and
Choate book, which most independent economists and trade experts
regard as simplistic and flat-out incorrect, overlooks the many
factors, other than wage levels, that actually drive business
decisions and the location of factories. (Economists or trade experts
who disagree with Perot's allegation include:  Gary Clyde Huffbauer
and Jeffrey J.  Schott of the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics; Steven Globerman and Michael Walker of the
Fraser Institute in Canada; Milton Friedman of the Hoover Institution;
Rudiger Dornbush of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mexican
economist Rugelio Ramirez De la O, Paul Samuelson of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and James Buchanan of George Mason
University.) Perot and Choate call the NAFTA a "drastic and unfair
scheme" that will pit American and Mexican workers "in a race to the
bottom." (Perot and Choate, p.  i.) They also promote the myth, as
does Pat Buchanan, that the agreement will "radically reduce the
sovereignty of the United States" and that the "secret" agreement has
been forced upon the American people by crafty lobbyists, all paid for
by foreign governments and multinational corporations. (This theme
permeates the Perot and Choate book.)
<P>
     Almost every independent and U.S. government study shows,
however, that Perot, Choate, and the other anti-NAFTA leaders are dead
wrong on the free trade pact. For example, it is estimated that under
the NAFTA there will be a net increase of 200,000 jobs as a result of
increased U.S. exports to Mexico. Today, trade with Mexico alone
sustains at least 700,000 jobs in the U.S. ("The NAFTA:  Expanding
U.S.  Exports, Jobs, and Growth," Clinton Administration Statement on
the North American Free Trade Agreement, July 1993, p.  3.) Moreover,
the NAFTA will help address many of the other concerns raised by NAFTA
critics. The agreement will accelerate the rate of rising Mexican
wages, it will address environmental concerns along the border and
inside Mexico, it will help lock into place Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's free market and democratic reform programs, and
it will diminish over time the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs
across the U.S. border.
<P>
     Competing Visions.  The bipartisan gathering of NAFTA defenders
that convened at the White House on September 14 for the side accord
ceremony demonstrated that the battle lines on the trade pact are not
drawn along party lines, but rather according to two different
economic visions. Those that favor the NAFTA believe that U.S. workers
can compete and win in the global marketplace. They are also convinced
that free and expanded trade benefits all Americans. Opponents of the
free trade accord like Perot are inward-looking, favor the status quo,
and fear competing with other countries. Perot and other NAFTA
opponents believe that opening U.S. markets to foreign goods greatly
harms U.S. workers and the economy. They also argue that U.S.
sovereignty and security will be threatened if the NAFTA goes through.

<P>
     Perot and other NAFTA opponents misunderstand the economics of
the NAFTA. The bottom line is that the NAFTA is a "win-win" agreement
for America. After the NAFTA, the U.S. will eliminate an average 4
percent tariff on Mexican goods, while Mexico will drop its average 10
percent tariff on U.S. goods. As a result, it will be easier to
produce goods and services in the U.S. and sell them to Mexico.
Therefore, once the NAFTA is passed, American companies will have less
of an incentive to move south of the border to try to penetrate the
Mexican market. 
<P>

     There is another reason why the NAFTA is sound economics:
Mexicans purchase more U.S. imports per capita than do much wealthier
Japanese and Europeans. These exports to Mexico create American jobs.
As stated by Senator Bill Bradley, the Democrat from New Jersey: 
<P>      
<UL>Defeating NAFTA won't create jobs, control immigration, or
     clean the environment. Either we address the problems of
     economic transformation head on, or we bury our heads in the
     sand, blame NAFTA for situations it did not create, and
     accept a lower standard of living and a fraying social
     fabric.... NAFTA opens more than a trade door. It will
     enhance our nation in ways that are absolutely critical to
     growth, progress, and security in the 21st century." (Bill
     Bradley, "NAFTA Opens More than a Trade Door," The Wall
     Street Journal, September 16, 1993.)</UL>

     <P>
MYTHS AGAINST NAFTA: EVALUATING PEROT'S ALLEGATIONS
<P>
     In their attempts to discredit the NAFTA, Perot, Choate, and
other critics often misrepresent the facts and distort the truth about
the agreement. Their arguments, nevertheless, have greatly harmed the
NAFTA's chances in Congress. Consequently, as Congress begins its
deliberation on the pros and cons of the NAFTA, it will require clear
and concise information on the merits of the pact. Only then will it
be able to distinguish between myth and reality. The myths advanced in
Perot's book are:
<P>
Myth #1: As many as 5.9 million jobs will be lost in the U.S. as a
      result of the NAFTA. (This theme permeates the Perot and Choate
      book.)
<P>
Reality:  <P>
     Almost every independent study on the NAFTA predicts that there
will be a net gain in the number of U.S. jobs as a result of expanded
American exports to Mexico and new foreign investment in the U.S.
(See, for example:  Larry Brookhart and Robert W.  Wallace, "Potential
Impact on the U.S.  Economy and Selected Industries of the North
American Free-Trade Agreement," USITC publication #2596.  (Washington,
D.C.:  U.S.  International Trade Commission, January 1993); Rudiger
Dornbusch, "NAFTA:  Good Jobs at Good Wages," paper presented at
"NAFTA Summit:  Beyond Party Politics," a conference sponsored by The
Brookings Institution, The Center for Strategic and International
Studies, and The Fraser Institute, (Washington, D.C.:  June 28-29,
1993); Steven Globerman and Michael Walker, Assessing NAFTA:  A
Trinational Analysis (Vancouver, B.C.:  The Fraser Institute, 1993);
Edward Hudgins, Ph.D., "Myths About NAFTA," House Republican
Conference Issue Brief, 1993; Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Jeffrey J. 
Schott, NAFTA:  An Assessment (Washington, D.C.:  Institute for
International Economics, 1993); Paul A.  London and Jonathan Whittle
(The Stern Group, Inc.), "Investment, Trade, and U.S.  Gains in the
NAFTA" (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business
Committee, 1992).  Alan Reynolds, "The Impact of NAFTA on U.S.  Wages
and Jobs," paper presented at the Cato Institute conference on The
North American Free Trade Agreement, Washington, D.C., June 8, 1993;
Lenore Sek, "North American Free Trade Agreement," Congressional
Research Service Issue Brief, June 8, 1993.) Since Mexico began to
open its economy in 1986, the number of American workers producing
merchandise exports to Mexico has risen from 274,000 to an estimated
700,000 last year. With the NAFTA, the non-partisan International
Trade Commission (ITC) predicts, 200,000 more export-related jobs will
be created by 1995. It is estimated that for every $1 billion in
increased exports, 22,800 jobs are created in the U.S. Since 1986,
American exports to Mexico have exploded from $12.6 billion to $40.6
billion last year. As U.S. exports to Mexico increase under NAFTA, so
too will the U.S. job base. Moreover, Americans working in jobs
related to exports to Mexico make 12 percent more than the national
average. (For more information see:  "Potential Impact on the U.S. 
Economy and Selected Industries of the North American Free Trade
Agreement," U.S.  International Trade Commission Report, January
1993.) 
<P>
     Even Clyde Prestowitz, the President of the Economic Strategy
Institute, a Washington-based think tank that once was strongly
against the NAFTA, now says that the pact should be ratified. Last
fall, Prestowitz claimed that the NAFTA would cost up to 222,000 jobs.
Today, however, he argues that "NAFTA will be a plus in the long run."
His reasoning: Many U.S. companies will likely shut down their
operations in Mexico and return home once Mexico lowers its trade
barriers. If U.S. companies can penetrate the Mexican market without
confronting tariffs, one of the key rationales for locating there in
the first place disappears. Moreover, it is likely that many U.S.
corporations will move their Asian manufacturing facilities to Mexico
once the NAFTA is enacted, making it almost certain that they would
import components from the U.S., thereby creating new U.S. jobs. (Bob
Davis, "Prestowitz Shifts to Support of NAFTA, Reconsiders Predictions
of Job Losses," The Wall Street Journal, September 17, 1993.) 
<P>
     According to Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott, authors of the
Institute for International Economics book NAFTA: An Assessment, "If
the NAFTA is rejected, the U.S. is likely to experience job losses.
Rejection of the NAFTA would probably cause capital to leave Mexico.
The resulting slowed Mexican growth and a potential devaluation of its
currency would contract Mexico's imports and expand its exports,
thereby slashing the U.S. trade surplus with Mexico." ("NAFTA:  A
Win-Win-Win Situation for North America," Institute for International
Economics News, February 17, 1993.) While Hufbauer's and Schott's
estimate of job increases is slightly different from those predicted
by the ITC or the Clinton Administration, they still calculate that
under the NAFTA, a gross total of 316,000 U.S. jobs will be created,
while a gross total of 145,000 U.S. jobs will be lost -- leading to a
net gain of 171,000 new jobs. (Ibid.)
<P>
Myth #2: Lower wages in Mexico will encourage U.S. companies to
      relocate their plants and factories there. (Perot and Choate,
      pp.  35 and 68.) 
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Since labor represents only between 10 percent to 20 percent of
production costs for most businesses, Perot's argument about lower
wage levels in Mexico luring U.S. plants south of the border is
greatly exaggerated and in most cases wrong. (Keith Bradsher, "Perot
Leads Attack on Trade Agreement," The New York Times, September 16,
1993, p.  A20.) If U.S. companies were going to move to Mexico, they
would have already done so. The reason: there is absolutely nothing
stopping them from relocating there today. Mexico has removed most of
its restrictions on foreign investment and ownership of manufacturing
facilities. ("NAFTA:  Summary and Analysis," House Republican
Conference Issues Brief, September 13, 1993, p.  3.) Moreover, wage
levels in Mexico are not nearly as low as many people believe and will
rise steadily under the NAFTA. It is estimated that Mexican wages have
risen by 28.7 percent since 1987. Rapidly increasing wage levels in
Mexico, combined with lower productivity levels, often erases much of
the wage advantage anyway. 
<P>
     U.S. workers earn high wages because they are the most productive
workers in the world. By contrast, Mexico's wages are low because the
economy is poor. U.S. companies wishing to relocate to Mexico must
deal with the consequences of what is essentially a Third World
economy. For example, the operating costs for U.S. firms doing
business in Mexico are raised considerably by higher levels of worker
absenteeism, lower educational standards, political instability,
limited access to raw materials, and the problems associated with long
distance management. Consequently, few companies base plant locations
on a simple calculation of wage differentials; for most U.S.
manufacturers, the cost of labor is less important than such factors
as access to technology, the skills of the local work force, and the
quality of the transportation network. If cheap labor were the sole
determinant of plant sites, then Perot and other U.S. industrialists
would be relocating their factories to countries like Haiti and
Nicaragua.
<P>
Myth #3: NAFTA will destroy America's manufacturing base. (Perot and
      Choate, page 28-40.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Perot and Choate clearly misrepresent the facts when making this
charge. The NAFTA benefits the U.S. economy and manufacturing base
because it levels the playing field of trade with Mexico. As far as
most imports from Mexico are concerned, the U.S. already practices
free trade. The NAFTA will mainly affect Mexican barriers against U.S.
goods. Mexico's average tariff barriers against U.S. exports are 2.5
times higher than U.S. tariffs against imports from Mexico. By
contrast, over 50 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico already enter
duty-free and the average U.S. tariff on Mexican goods is only 4
percent. Moreover, complex Mexican domestic licensing requirements
further impede U.S. exports to the Mexican market. The NAFTA, however,
will eliminate these non-tariff barriers.
<P>
     Mexico is the United States' third largest and fastest growing
export market. Only Canada and Japan purchase more U.S. goods and
services. Only Canada buys more U.S. manufactured goods than Mexico.
Since 1986, U.S. exports to Mexico have increased by 228 percent to
$40.6 billion -- 2.3 times faster than U.S. exports to the rest of the
world. Moreover, Mexicans buy more U.S. goods per capita than do much
wealthier European and Japanese consumers. (Clyde Prestowitz, "NAFTA: 
Why we Hafta," The Washington Post, September 19, 1993.) It is
estimated that 70 cents of every dollar that Mexico spends on foreign
products is spent on U.S. goods. (For more information, see "The
NAFTA:  Expanding U.S.  Exports, Jobs, and Growth," Clinton
Administration Statement on the North American Free Trade Agreement,
July 1993, pp.  4-7.)
<P>
     American exports of manufactured goods to Mexico have grown
rapidly since Mexico lowered its trade barriers in 1986. This rise in
U.S. exports to Mexico has added more than 400,000 new jobs to the
American economy. By increasing export opportunities, the free trade
accord will enable the U.S. to take advantage of its economic
strengths, which include high-wage, high-technology manufacturing.
U.S. exports to Mexico will jump by 46 percent by 1995, to $60
billion, compared with $41 billion last year. Six years ago the figure
stood at only $14.5 billion. (The Kiplinger Washington Newsletter,
September 10, 1993, p.  1.) This increase in trade, much of which is
in U.S.-manufactured goods, will undoubtedly help fortify -- not
damage -- the U.S. manufacturing base.
<P>
     As pointed out by Hufbauer and Schott, Puerto Rico has enjoyed
free trade with the U.S. for decades. While a major gap still
separates manufacturing wages in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, American
jobs have not been lost as a result of the differential. Between 1970
and 1990, employment in Puerto Rico's manufacturing sector rose only
from 132,000 to 160,000 jobs, and those numbers fell as a share of the
work force from over 17 percent to under 15 percent. If low wages were
such a magnet for manufacturing activity, Puerto Rico should have
gained far more new jobs as a result of U.S. companies relocating
there. That did not happen. Moreover, the proportion of the labor
force engaged in manufacturing activity should have risen, not fallen.
(Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit., p.  12.)
<P>
Myth #4: NAFTA is not a free trade agreement, but an investment
      agreement. (Perot and Choate, pp.  11, 68.)
<P>
Reality:  <P>
     The protection and expansion of U.S. investments overseas has
been a cardinal principle of American foreign economic policy for
decades. American investment in foreign markets helps generate U.S.
exports, thereby creating new high-paying jobs at home. As a business
leader, Perot should understand that securing good investment
agreements are vital to reaching good trade agreements. Investment
agreements establish the legal groundrules under which U.S. companies
can invest in foreign countries. They also govern issues such as
taxation of the repatriation of profits.
<P>
     While the NAFTA prohibits arbitrary seizure and expropriation of
foreign property, one of the major purposes of the free trade pact is
to remove Mexican laws that encourage U.S. firms to relocate to
Mexico. Under the NAFTA, the Mexican government will end policies that
require U.S. companies to operate inside Mexico in order to sell to
the Mexican market. U.S. companies will be able to sell goods to
Mexico without restriction. Furthermore, the NAFTA ensures that U.S.
companies doing business in Mexico will no longer be forced to
purchase Mexican-made goods. Instead they will be able to use imported
U.S.-made equipment and components.
<P>
     The NAFTA negotiators have, in fact, produced a landmark
agreement on investment. The NAFTA commits the U.S., Canada, and
Mexico to provide national treatment to investors, meaning that U.S.
companies will be treated the same as domestic companies. ("NAFTA:  A
Win-Win-Win Situation for North America," p.  6.) Moreover, the NAFTA
also protects U.S. investors against restrictions on the repatriation
of capital, profits, and royalties. In addition, private investors,
under the rules of the NAFTA, can seek binding arbitral rulings in
trinational forums set up under the agreement directly against the
host government if these rights are infringed upon.
<P>
Myth #5: NAFTA will turn Mexico into a "platform" that Japan, Europe,
      and China can exploit to route their exports into the U.S.
      (Perot and Choate, pp.  9-10.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Once again, Perot and Choate are misrepresenting the facts. As
with the 1989 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the NAFTA
contains rules of origin to prevent non-member countries from using
one NAFTA country as a way to evade the trade restrictions of another.
For example, most motor vehicles are required to contain 62.5 percent
of North American parts in order to qualify for duty-free treatment.
This rule of origin is meant to prevent Japanese firms from using
assembly plants in Mexico as a way to bypass normal U.S. restrictions
on U.S. imports. ("NAFTA:  Summary and Analysis," House Republican
Conference Issue Brief, September 13, 1993, pp.  2-3.)
<P>
     <UL>The International Trade Commission also states that:

     the NAFTA's rules of origin are intended to ensure that the
     benefits of tariff reductions will accrue principally to the
     NAFTA parties and to provide incentives for North American
     production and sourcing. To qualify as a North American
     product under the NAFTA, a number of industrial sectors will
     be subject to a stricter and more detailed change in tariff
     classification rules, higher and more stringent value-
     content requirements, and rules requiring that certain
     components and parts be produced in North America. (The
     International Trade Commission, op.  cit., p.  ix.) </UL>
<P>
     These sectors include automotive goods, computers and other
electronic equipment, machine tools, steel mill products, textiles and
apparel, major household appliances, and industrial machinery.
<P>
     In fact, the NAFTA's rules of origin are so strict in that some
free market economists fear that they will hinder foreign investment
and North American economic competitiveness. While rules of origin are
an integral part of all free trade pacts, they can be used as
protectionist tools to discriminate against foreign competition.
Strict rules of origin can penalize regional producers by forcing them
to buy their parts and components from less efficient suppliers
located within the free trade area. Moreover, some economists argue
that the NAFTA rules of origin could establish a protectionist
precedent for other preferential trade pacts, thereby limiting global
trade liberalization. (Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit., pp.  5-6.)
<P>
Myth #6:The intellectual property rights provisions in NAFTA will
      "offer incentives for moving [U.S.] operations and jobs to
      Mexico." (Perot and Choate, pp.  92-93.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     This charge is false. The NAFTA stands as a model for resolving
outstanding disputes over intellectual property. The free trade pact
will ensure a high level of protection under Canadian and Mexican law
for U.S. owners of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and
integrated circuits, as well as safeguards for computer programs,
pharmaceutical inventions, and sound recordings. The NAFTA obligates
Canada and Mexico to enforce intellectual property rights against
infringement internally and at their borders. By protecting
intellectual property rights, the NAFTA will help increase trade and
diminish losses from piracy and counterfeiting. This will lead to
economic growth, new jobs, and increased competitiveness in the U.S.
("Summary of Principal Provisions of NAFTA," U.S.  Department of State
Dispatch, Volume 4, No.  35, August 30, 1993, pp.  601-602.)
<P>
Myth #7:More U.S. companies will move to Mexico to take advantage of
      the so-called maquiladora program if the NAFTA is passed. (Perot
      and Choate, pp.  31, 48-50.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     U.S. companies have been operating assembly plants, known as
maquiladoras, along the U.S.-Mexico border since 1965. Under this
program, components made in the U.S. are sent to Mexican plants for
assembly, utilizing Mexico's less expensive labor. The finished
product is then shipped duty-free to the U.S. or exported elsewhere. 
<P>
     Despite charges by Perot and others that the maquiladora program
has hurt the U.S. economy, it has not caused a net loss of U.S. jobs.
To the contrary, by reducing labor costs, this program has allowed
U.S. manufacturers to remain globally competitive and keep their U.S.
plants operating. (For more information see:  Wesley R.  Smith, "The
NAFTA Debate, Part I:  A Primer on Labor, Environmental, and Legal
Issues," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  936, April 9, 1993.)
<P>
     According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR),
the maquiladora program will effectively end once the NAFTA is in
place; all imported parts from the U.S. will enter Mexico without
custom changes or conditions. The free trade pact, moreover, will
eliminate maquiladora rules that prevent Mexican-based U.S. companies
from selling their products in Mexico. Maquiladoras can now sell only
20 percent of their products in Mexico. (U.S.  Department of Labor,
"Economic Discussion Paper #29," August 1988, p.  17.) Under the
NAFTA, there will be no such restrictions. Instead, U.S. maquiladoras
will be allowed to sell 100 percent of their products in the Mexican
market. Perot and Choate claim that most U.S. exports to Mexico have
been funneled through the maquiladoras to the U.S. for re-export. This
is incorrect. Instead, an estimated 83 percent of U.S. export growth
to Mexico has been for Mexican consumption, and not for re-export.
(Correcting the Record:  Response of the Office of the U.S.  Trade
Representative to the Perot/Choate NAFTA Book, September 2, 1993, p. 
27.)
<P>
Myth #8:Low wages will lead U.S. automotive companies to relocate
      their plants to Mexico, thereby threatening the jobs of U.S.
      auto workers. (Perot and Choate, pp.  9-10 and 31-33.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     A study of the NAFTA by the U.S. Office of Technology (OTA)
demonstrates that such assertions by Perot and Choate are unfounded.
The OTA reports that it costs a Mexican plant $9,180 to deliver a car
to the U.S. market, compared to $8,770 for a U.S. auto maker.
("U.S.-Mexico Trade:  Pulling Together of Pulling Apart," Congress of
the United States, Office of Technology Assessment, October 1992.)
Mexico's high shipping, parts, and inventory costs more than offset
its lower labor costs. Furthermore, the U.S. cost advantage grows as
Mexican wages rise. Under the NAFTA, moreover, U.S. exports of
automobiles to Mexico will greatly increase, thereby increasing jobs
in the American automotive industry. 
<P>
     There is another problem with Perot's and Choate's analysis. They
fail to acknowledge that the current U.S. tariff on Mexican
automobiles is only 2.5 percent. In contrast, Mexico's tariff on U.S.-
made cars is 20 percent, or eight times higher than the U.S. duty.
Under the free trade pact with Mexico, this tariff will be cut in half
almost immediately and then fully eliminated over the next nine years.
The Big Three U.S. auto producers estimate that the NAFTA will
increase annual U.S. exports to Mexico from 1,000 vehicles a year
today to over 60,000 vehicles in the first year of the free trade
accord. (The Kiplinger Washington Letter, September 10, 1993, p.  1.)
<P>
     The NAFTA also will end the requirement for U.S. automotive
companies to manufacture in Mexico in order to sell there. Moreover,
it will eliminate Mexican local content and local production
requirements that have encouraged U.S. automobile and parts
manufacturers to move production and jobs to Mexico. With NAFTA, the
U.S. will be able to increase significantly automobile and auto parts
exports to Mexico. Without the NAFTA, Mexico will almost certainly
maintain its high tariff and non-tariff barriers on U.S. cars.
(Correcting the Record, pp.  5 and 23.)
<P>
Myth #9: The NAFTA will hurt U.S. farmers and agricultural interests.
      (Perot and Choate, pp.  10-11.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Under the NAFTA, the U.S. and Mexico will eliminate all tariffs,
import quotas, and licenses on all agricultural products on January 1,
1994. However, according to economists Steven Globerman and Michael
Walker, "The agriculture sector is politically sensitive to [trade]
liberalization, and this was acknowledged by the longer transition
period (15 years) granted for certain products both for the U.S. and
Mexico. Special treatment was given to sugar, frozen orange juice
concentrate, peanuts, and certain fruits and vegetables (asparagus,
broccoli, cantaloupe, and cucumbers) for the U.S. and for corn, dry
beans, and milk powder for Mexico." (Globerman and Walker, op.  cit. 
p.  150.) Both the Bush and Clinton Administrations have predicted
that the U.S. agriculture sector and American farmer will be big
winners under the NAFTA. Conservative estimates show an expected
increase of $2 billion to $2.5 billion in U.S. agricultural exports
annually to Mexico by the end of the transition period. 
<P>
     The NAFTA will end decades of agricultural socialism in Mexico.
By opening up the Mexican market to U.S. agricultural products and
equipment, the U.S. economy will benefit and millions of jobs will be
created. Moreover, under the NAFTA, U.S. investment in Mexican
agriculture, which was once shunned, will now be encouraged. Finally,
American consumers will benefit under the NAFTA because they will have
a wider variety of food products at a lower cost.
<P>
Myth #10: Since the NAFTA was not submitted to Congress prior to June
      1, 1993, it is not covered under the so-called fast track trade
      authority. (Perot and Choate,  pp.  14-16.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Fast track trade authority, which has been used by U.S.
Presidents since 1974, is essential for negotiating and ratifying free
trade pacts. Fast track powers allow the White House to negotiate
trade accords without the threat of the many congressional amendments
that would almost certainly kill most trade agreements. Moreover, they
call for an up-or-down vote once the agreement is submitted to
Congress. Perot and Choate contend that the fast track powers no
longer apply to the NAFTA since the pact was not sent to Congress
prior to June 1, 1993, when the two-year fast track authority ended. 
<P>
     Once again Perot and Choate do not understand the facts. In a
report titled Correcting the Record, the USTR calls this passage in
the book "pure fiction." It stresses that because of the 1991 fast
track legislation, fast track procedures remain available for trade
agreements signed by the U.S. President prior to May 31, 1993.
President Bush signed the NAFTA on December 17, 1992, over five months
prior to the deadline. Consequently, the USTR correctly states that
"fast track procedures [are] still available for NAFTA; no new
legislation [is] needed."
<P>
Myth #11: The fast track authority gave President Bush the authority
      to negotiate the agreement "in complete secrecy without the
      participation of either Congress or the U.S. public." (Perot and
      Choate, p.  14.)
<P>
Reality:  <P>
     On the contrary, no trade agreement in history has been the
subject of as many consultations as the NAFTA. During the negotiation
process, the Administration held nearly 1,000 consultations or
briefings with individuals outside the executive branch. These
included public hearings at which hundreds of individuals testified,
350 meetings with official advisory committees, and repeated contacts
with key members of the House and Senate.
<P>
Myth #12: Some regions of the U.S., especially the midwestern states,
      will be hurt by the NAFTA. (Perot and Choate, pp.  34-37.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     A June 1993 study by The Heritage Foundation demonstrates that
the NAFTA will benefit the country as a whole, not just one or two
particular regions. (Douglas Seay and Wesley Smith, "Why the Governors
Support the NAFTA (And Washington Doesn't)," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No.  946, June 15, 1993.) According to the study, at
least 41 of the country's fifty governors support the agreement, with
the others remaining undecided. Their confidence in the NAFTA stems
from the fact that most states already have seen sharp increases in
exports to Mexico over the last five years. The U.S. Department of
Commerce estimates that nearly every state in the nation has
benefitted from increased trade with Mexico, with every region in the
U.S. posting large increases in exports to Mexico last year.
(Statistics provided by the U.S.  Department of Commerce.) According
to their figures, 31 states doubled their exports to Mexico, while
fifteen states tripled their exports. In fact, the industrial midwest
-- home to such NAFTA opponents as Democrat Representatives David
Bonior of Michigan and Marcy Kaptur of Ohio -- posted a 90 percent
increase in exports to Mexico just since 1987. Other examples from the
same period of time: Illinois turned in a 417 percent increase;
Wisconsin, a 247 percent increase; Ohio, a 188 percent increase;
Indiana, a 30 percent increase; and Michigan, a 32 percent increase.
(Statistics provided by the U.S.  Department of Commerce.)
<P>
Myth #13: NAFTA does not sufficiently address environmental issues.
      (Perot and Choate, p.  99.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     The NAFTA does more than any trade agreement in history to
protect the environment. The NAFTA explicitly ensures America's right
to safeguard its environment, while encouraging Canada and Mexico to
strengthen their environmental standards.
<P>
     The NAFTA side accords create a North American Commission on the
Environment which will oversee the enforcement of each country's
environmental laws. Any individual, business, independent
organization, or government will be able to file a complaint with the
commission. Disputes over one country's repeated failure to enforce
its national labor and environmental standards will be mediated by the
commission. If the matter cannot be resolved effectively, the
disagreement will be forwarded to an arbitration panel of independent
experts. If the panel finds that a signatory country has persistently
failed to comply with already agreed-upon standards, it will then be
free to impose fines. If violations persist, trade sanctions in the
form of quotas and tariffs could be placed on the violating country
with a maximum financial loss of $20 million per year. Moreover, if
the NAFTA goes through, the White House has agreed to establish a $4
billion environment fund to clean up the 2,000-mile border with
Mexico. 
<P>
     Because of the NAFTA's efforts to protect and clean the
environment, several prominent environmental groups have voiced their
support of the free trade pact. Last September 16, the leaders of six
environmental groups, including the National Audubon Society and the
National Wildlife Federation, vowed that they would help the White
House fight for congressional passage of the NAFTA. They view the
NAFTA as the only mechanism for improving environmental conditions in
Mexico and along the border. If the NAFTA is defeated and Mexico
remains a poor nation, it will not have the resources or the
motivation to take strong steps to safeguard the environment. (Keith
Schneider, "Environmental Groups are Split on Support for Free-Trade
Pact," The New York Times, September 16, 1993.) According to Kathryn
Fuller, President of the World Wildlife Fund, "Our support of NAFTA
boiled down to this: The environment in North America -- and the
global environment, for that matter -- will be better off with NAFTA
than without it." (Bob Dart, "Six National Groups on Environment
Endorse NAFTA," The Washington Times, September 21, 1993.) 
<P>
Myth #14: NAFTA will undermine U.S. food safety and health
      regulations. (Perot and Choate, pp.  82-83.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     The NAFTA permits the U.S. or any individual state or city to set
its own health and sanitary standards as high as it wants, as long as
it shows a scientific basis for its standards and it treats domestic
products the same way as imports. (J.W.  Anderson, "Perot's Little
Book of NAFTA Nonsense," The Washington Post, September 5, 1993.)
Moreover, the supplemental agreements to the NAFTA include a
commitment by the three signatories to "harmonize standards upward"
for food and health regulations. While the NAFTA's provisions will
discourage a "downward harmonization" of health and safety standards,
it does not require the U.S. to change any particular standards.
Instead, claims the U.S.Trade Representative, "the NAFTA creates a
process by which the three countries can try to reach greater
compatibility of standards, but does not require [the U.S.] to agree
to any particular change in standard." (Correcting the Record, pp. 
48-49.)
<P>
Myth #15: The NAFTA jeopardizes the safety of American travelers by
      opening U.S. roads and highways to Mexican trucks and drivers
      that do not meet minimum U.S. safety standards. (Perot and
      Choate, pp.  3-6.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
 There is not a single provision in the NAFTA agreement that exempts
Mexican vehicles or drivers from U.S. safety and environmental
standards. All Mexican trucks entering U.S. territory will have to
comply fully with all applicable safety and emissions standards, and
these will be enforced regardless of the nationality of the operator.
All U.S. safety regulations on truck weight, size, brakes, and
servicing will be enforced against Mexican drivers. So, too, will be
U.S. regulations covering the expertise of the drivers and their
ability to read and speak English. Moreover, Mexican drivers will be
tested for licensing according to a standard that is fully compatible
with that in the U.S.
<P>
Myth #16: Under the NAFTA, smuggling drugs into the U.S will become
      much easier. (Perot and Choate, pp.  6-7.)
<P>
Reality: <P>
     Once again, Perot and Choate are misguided. Under the NAFTA,
border control will gradually be expanded. In fact, since U.S. Customs
agents will be focusing increasingly less on the assessment and
collection of tariffs, they and other officials will have more time to
inspect shipments for illegal narcotics. 
<P>
     If the free trade pact is passed, moreover, the improved ties
between the U.S. and Mexico will be cemented and cooperation in law
enforcement efforts will grow. The economic benefits that the NAFTA
will bring to Mexico will also allow it to dedicate more of its own
resources to fighting the drug trade. More important, free trade with
the U.S. will generate new and better paying jobs in Mexico, thereby
making it more likely that Mexicans will reject the temptation to
engage in the narcotics business. The use of Mexico's agricultural
land for drug crops also will likely decline over time as more acreage
of legal export crops are produced for export to the U.S. The removal
of U.S. trade barriers on Mexican fruits, vegetables, and other
agricultural products will reduce the incentive to grow such illegal
crops as marijuana and opium poppies. (See Michael G.  Wilson, "The
NAFTA Debate, Part II:  A Primer on Political, Security, and Human
Rights Issues," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  950, July 19,
1993, pp.  6-8.) As the U.S. Trade Representative's office argues,
"Nothing in the NAFTA limits [the U.S.] ability to stop illegal drugs"
flowing across the border.
<P>
     According to a senior anti-narcotics official in the U.S.
government, who wishes to remain unnamed, a rejection of the NAFTA
would result in "a serious setback in U.S.-Mexican cooperation in the
fight against drug trafficking." Salinas would view it as "a slap in
the face," says the official, and the Mexican government would likely
be far less willing to work closely with the U.S. to interdict drugs
and destroy drug crops in Mexico. 
<P>
Myth #17: The NAFTA will increase illegal immigration in the U.S.
      (Perot and Choate, p.  72.)
<P>
Reality:  <P>
     For many years, large numbers of Mexican workers have been coming
to the U.S., legally or illegally, in search of higher wages and a
better life. In 1990, for example, there were approximately 4.5
million Mexican-born residents in the U.S. This number, which does not
count all illegal aliens, represents about 21 percent of all foreign-
born residents. Germans, with 1.2 million residents, or 5.4 percent of
foreign-born residents, make up the second largest group.
("U.S.-Mexico Trade:  Pulling Together or Pulling Apart?," Office of
Technology Assessment, U.S.  Congress, January 1993, pp.  116-117.)
Moreover, in 1992 alone, the U.S. Border Patrol arrested 1.2 million
people attempting to cross illegally into the U.S. from Mexico.
("Mexico:  Respect Restored," The Economist, February 13, 1993, p. 
4.) 
<P>
     Many people argue that these immigrants have contributed greatly
to the U.S. economy and culture, helping businesses survive labor
shortages and making the U.S. economy more productive. Others,
however, contend that too many illegal immigrants are entering the
U.S., straining social services and taking jobs away from American
workers. 
<P>
     As economic growth in Mexico leads to gains in wages and living
standards, some of the pressure to emigrate to the U.S. will abate.
The expected increase in foreign direct investment in Mexico under a
NAFTA is estimated to range from $25 billion to $52 billion from 1992
to 2000. ("Investment, Trade, and U.S.  Gains in the NAFTA," U.S. 
Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee, The Council of the
Americas, 1992, p.  12.) As a result, economic growth rates in Mexico
under the free trade pact could reach as high as 6 percent a year over
the next decade. Such high growth rates will produce an estimated
609,000 new jobs south of the border. (Hufbauer and Schott, op.  cit.)
Finding jobs in Mexico will eliminate one of the main incentives for
Mexicans to leave their homes for the U.S.
<P>
     These new jobs in Mexico will also pay better wages. With the
NAFTA, wages in Mexico are expected to grow by as much as 16 percent
in the coming years. (Wilson, op.  cit.   pp.  8-9.) The allure of
higher- paying and better-quality jobs in Mexico will almost certainly
convince many Mexicans to stay at home and contribute to their own
economy. Polls indicate that when given a choice between staying in
Mexico and working, or illegally crossing the border to work in the
U.S., the vast majority of Mexicans surveyed said that they would
rather stay in their own country.
<P>
     By contrast, a rejection of the NAFTA could drive down wage
levels in Mexico and slow down the growth in new export-related jobs.
This would diminish the standard of living in Mexico, making it more
likely that Mexican citizens will cross the border illegally into the
U.S. seeking employment. Moreover, if new trade barriers are erected
between the U.S. and Mexico, farmers and industries in U.S. border
states like California and Texas also will see their businesses
damaged and revenues fall. It is possible then that they would be more
tempted to hire illegal aliens as a cost-cutting measure, thereby
actually increasing the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S.
(Estimates of undocumented immigration are by nature unreliable. 
However, the total number of illegal residents in the U.S.  is thought
to be in the range of 2 million to 3 million, increasing at about
200,000 a year.  Mexican are believed to make up two-thirds to
three-fourths of the undocumented population, with many of the others
from elsewhere in Latin America.) 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Ross Perot and Pat Choate conclude their book by saying: "The
first action that is required of Congress is to reject NAFTA.
Congress' second action should be to reauthorize the president to
negotiate a win-win trade deal with Mexico."  (Perot and Choate, pp. 
102-103.)
<P>
     A rejection of the NAFTA would dramatically curtail trade
opportunities with America's fastest growing foreign market. It would
also result in soured U.S.-Mexico relations and a setback in President
Salinas's free market and democratic reform program. Moreover, a
failure of the free trade agreement would not only halt the spread of
free trade in the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, but dampen
as well the prospects for reaching an agreement in the Uruguay Round
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Geneva. 
<P>
     Belief in America. NAFTA opponents believe that America cannot
compete in the global market. NAFTA supporters, on the other hand,
believe in America's strength and ability to compete. The choice,
therefore, is clear: does the U.S. wish to risk job loss and possibly
economic depression as the result of isolationism and protectionism?
Or does the U.S. want to take a leadership role in the global economic
community, seeking out new markets for its goods and investments,
thereby making American more competitive and creating new, higher-
paying jobs? 
<P>
     For Robert Matsui, the California Democrat, and Jim Kolbe, the
Arizona Republican, the choice is clear. As they stated in a May 28
letter to Perot, "Growing trade is an important engine of economic
growth. What greater proof of this is there than the period of
prosperity that has been enjoyed by the United States and the West
since World War II.... Circling the wagons and ignoring our trading
partners will not only hurt us competitively, but will also
disadvantage our whole region as a trading force in the international
market. We firmly believe that NAFTA will promote growth and
employment in our country... and continue our role as the dominant and
competitive force in the world."

<P>


     After years of negotiation and repeated postponements, the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been completed and now
awaits congressional consideration.  As if on cue, a torrent of
opposition has erupted.
<P>
     The most surprising aspect about the NAFTA debate is the
criticism by some conservatives.  Opposition to the NAFTA is
understandable on the part of protectionists, champions of increased
government regulation, and those who unashamedly seek to advance their
own fortunes at the expense of the national interest.  But for
conservatives, there should be little dissension.  All the existing
empirical data regarding U.S.  trade with Mexico, as well as basic
economic theory stretching back over 200 years to Adam Smith, shows
that the NAFTA is good for the U.S.  This is why Ronald Reagan,
Margaret Thatcher, and Milton Friedman, to name only some of the most
prominent conservatives, strongly support the agreement, even with its
admitted flaws.  As Thatcher told a U.S.  audience recently, America
has "nothing to fear" from the NAFTA.
<P>
     Why, then, is there such strong and growing opposition among
conservatives?  In large part, much of this opposition can be traced
to insufficient familiarity with the terms of this complex agreement. 
The hundreds of pages of dense text make it a formidable obstacle, and
most commentators have chosen to rely on general summaries of its
content, along with word of mouth, for their understanding.  Thus,
they are insufficiently prepared to counter the propaganda and
outright fabrications put forward by opponents.  As more conservatives
become familiar with the actual text of the NAFTA and its side
agreements on labor and environmental issues, they are likely to
become more supportive.  An objective reading of the text and
consideration of the evidence reveals that the NAFTA will:
<P>
Create American jobs.  <P>
     Economists are virtually unanimous in their conclusion that the
NAFTA will have a strongly positive impact on job growth throughout
the U.S., with most estimates in the hundreds of thousands. 
Opponents' predictions of a net job loss are backed by no evidence
whatsoever.
<P>
Make America more competitive abroad.<P>
     America has two choices with the NAFTA:  to become more
competitve abroad with it, or to become less competitive without it. 
With the NAFTA, American companies can become more competitive in
foreign markets by taking advantage of Mexico's lower-cost labor, much
as the Japanese have long done through co-production arrangements in
other East Asian countries.
<P>
Not endanger American sovereignty.<P>
     The NAFTA's labor and environmental commissions cannot supersede
U.S. or state laws nor do they have any power to compel any action. 
Neither do they have subpoena or independent inspection powers; they
are limited to "recommendations."  The U.S.  retains complete control
over the content and enforcement of its own laws.
<P>
Help stem the tide of illegal immigration, slow the influx of illegal
     drugs, and better secure America's border with Mexico.  
     As Mexico's economy grows, fewer Mexicans will migrate to the
U.S.  in search of employment.  Moreover, there is nothing in the
NAFTA that will exacerbate the illegal drug trade; removing tariffs on
tomatoes is not likely to endanger U.S.  security.  In fact, U.S. 
cooperation with Mexican border patrols will increase under the NAFTA.
<P>
     Many of the concerns of conservatives about the labor and
environmental side agreements stem from what the Clinton
Administration originally proposed, not what was actually negotiated. 
In that sense, many conservative critics of the NAFTA are fighting
battles that have already been won and warning against dangers which
never actually materialized.  For a close reading of the recently
released texts of the side accords reveals that the actual damage to
the NAFTA's free trade provisions was far less than feared.  This does
not mean that they are entirely harmless:  they do set bad precedents
and have the potential to be strengthened at some future date. 
Therefore, a high priority for the next free trade administration
should be to remove them.  But for now they contain little more than
empty phrases and little or no enforcement power.  If anyone has cause
to oppose the NAFTA, it is those protectionist groups who eagerly
expected a real advance toward managed trade and more government
regulation.  They did not get it, and that is why Ralph Nader and the
AFL-CIO and their lobbyists in Congress are so bitterly opposed to the
NAFTA.
<P>
     Lack of Confidence.  Unfortunately, outdated and inaccurate
information about the NAFTA and the side accords is only one of the
sources of conservative opposition.  At its core is a more serious
problem:  a lack of confidence in the U.S.  and a growing pessimism
regarding its ability to compete in the world.
<P>
     A lack of confidence in the U.S.  is nothing new for those on the
left, many of whom do not hide their distaste for American society and
whose penchant for government regulation creates a bias in favor of
barriers against the outside world.  This negative image of America,
and the accompanying national paralysis it engendered, enjoyed
increasing currency until Ronald Reagan's presidency largely dispelled
it.
<P>
     What is new is that it has now been taken up by many
conservatives, whose reading of the NAFTA is distorted by this
defeatist world-view.  Seen through their eyes, the U.S.  needs to
erect new and higher barriers to shield itself from an array of
threats.  They believe that the easy U.S.  primacy is now over, and
increasingly the U.S.  will not be able to compete in the world.
<P>
     In trade, protectionists on the left and right loudly proclaim
the need for the U.S.  to tilt the rules in its favor.  For them, a
fair contest is to be avoided at all costs because their assumption is
that the U.S.  would always lose.  The government, therefore, must
take control, not just of trade, but of an ever-widening array of
activities to ensure an equitable outcome.
<P>
     But if conservatives believe in anything, it is in human liberty
and in the workings of the free market.  Conservatives are pledged to
remove the constraints that governments seek to impose, regardless of
whether these are derived from ideological reasons or at the behest of
organized interests.  Conservatives know that there is no need for the
U.S.  to adopt a defensive crouch.  All that America needs to prevail
in global trade is open access to foreign markets.  Protectionism,
regardless of whatever imaginative rationale is put forward for it, is
an admission of defeat.
<P>
     America's Self-Image.  The NAFTA debate is not merely an argument
about a trade agreement; it is also a fight over the self-image of the
U.S. and this country's role in the world.  The result will be either
a confident embrace of the future or the beginning of what may become
an endless retreat.  Liberals and protectionists may oppose the
accord, and given their beliefs it is understandable that they should
do so.  But conservatives cannot do so without betraying their
fundamental principles.
<P>
     The U.S cannot hide from the world, and there is no reason
conservatives should want to.  Adopting a bunker mentality is the
surest way to undermine America's role in the world and to sabotage
her ability to pursue and defend her interests.  If there is anything
to fear it is those who, in the name of protecting the U.S., would
erect constraining barriers and foist upon Americans a ruinous self-
image of weakness and victimization.  The costs it would impose cannot
be measured in dollars, although these would be substantial.  Far more
damaging would be its corrosive effect on America's image of itself.
<P>
     Conservatives should heed Ronald Reagan, who wrote recently,
"When it comes to freedom and prosperity, Americans have never been
content merely with the status quo or allowed limitations to be placed
upon us. Today we must realize the competitive challenge of the global
economy and step right up to our rightful place as leader."  "The
North American Free Trade Agreement," says Reagan, "can bring us that
victory."

Backgrounder Update #199<BR>

Labor, Environmental, and Legal Issues," April 9, 1993.)<P>
</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

     Judge Charles Richey of the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia on June 30 hurled a judicial thunderbolt against
the NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico.
<P>
     Agreeing with the complaint of three special interest groups --
Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, the Sierra Club, and the Friends of the
Earth -- Judge Richey in Public Citizen v. Office of the United States
Trade Representative, found that the United States Trade
Representative (USTR) had failed to comply with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by not preparing an environmental
impact statement on the NAFTA. He then ordered the Clinton
Administration to write such a statement as soon as possible. 
<P>
     An environmental impact statement, or EIS, is an evaluation of
the environmental impact of a U.S. government agency action or
legislative proposal. The agency must canvass affected state and local
governments, prepare an assessment of environmental vulnerabilities,
and propose alternate options. The EIS was mandated to ensure that
administrative agencies take environmental factors into account in
their decision-making processes.
<P>
     By statute, the EIS requirement applies in terms not only to
agency decisions such as rule-making but to such informal action as to
where to place a dam. Indeed, it goes so far as to apply to "every
recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment." Congress, however, has always known how to get
information it wants from the executive branch. Thus, students of
environmental law have never understood the point of the requirement
of an EIS for legislative proposals. Judge Richey seemingly wants to
instruct them.
<P>

The Posture of the NAFTA
<P>
     George Bush signed the NAFTA agreement with Mexico and Canada on
December l7, l992. Bill Clinton had stated during the presidential
campaign that he would not send NAFTA implementing legislation to
Congress unless he successfully negotiated side agreements on labor
and environmental issues with Mexico and Canada. Among his
requirements were the creation of two tri-national commissions, one on
labor and one on environmental issues. The Clinton Administration
currently is negotiating these side agreements and hopes to reach a
successful resolution this summer in order to simultaneously submit
implementing legislation for both the NAFTA and the side agreements to
Congress this fall.

<P>
Judge Richey's Opinion
<P>
     Richey's opinion is vulnerable for a number of reasons. First, it
remains doubtful whether the "public interest" plaintiffs have
standing to sue. Do they have a sufficient interest in the controversy
that justifies their bringing the case? Can they show some concrete
injury-in-fact? Under recent Supreme Court precedents, Judge Richey's
grant of standing, based on the mere conjecture that the NAFTA will
constrain U.S. environmental regulation in a manner that increases
environmental degradation, is problematic at best. Similarly, Public
Citizen's assertion that organization members living in border states
will be affected adversely by the trade agreement is no more than an
"academic exercise in the conceivable." Ultimately, plaintiffs are
reduced to relying on a bizarre form of injury. They argue that the
failure of the government to prepare an EIS deprives them of needed
information about the environmental effects of NAFTA. 
<P>
     Even if the plaintiffs do have standing to bring this case to
court, it is unlikely that the environmental impact requirement for
legislative proposals is judicially enforceable. The NEPA does not
create an independent private right of action. If someone wants to sue
for a violation of NEPA -- such as a failure to prepare an EIS -- it
must be done through the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which
permits judicial review of "final agency action" only. Judge Richey
tried to get around this hurdle by finding that final agency action
was taken by the United States Trade Representative. He is simply
incorrect. It is the President who submits the NAFTA implementing
legislation to Congress. It is settled law that the President is not
an agency for purposes of the Administrative Procedures Act. Thus, as
the Supreme Court has underscored in the 1992 census case
(Massachusetts v. Franklin), where it is the President, not an agency,
who specifically must take final action under a statute, APA review is
not available. The Administration's decision not to draft an EIS,
therefore, is simply not a reviewable agency action. 
<P>
     Far more important, however, is that the Richey decision raises
significant constitutional issues. It places constitutionally
problematic strictures on the President's power to propose
legislation. And more broadly, it intrudes the courts into the
President's authority to effectively enter into international
agreements. 
<P>
     Indeed it is hard to imagine that Congress, in passing the NEPA,
actually contemplated that the President must prepare an environmental
impact statement for international agreements and treaties negotiated
with foreign countries. While it may be unsurprising that the State
Department, for many years, has prepared EIS's for numerous
international treaties and agreements, these precedents in no way
vitiate the constitutional issues presented since the State
Department's past voluntary actions in no way impairs the scope of the
President's executive authority.

<P>
Legal Effect
<P>
     The immediate legal effect of the Richey decision on the NAFTA is
unclear. Judge Richey did not enjoin the USTR to stop negotiating the
side agreements with Mexico and Canada until an EIS is completed. Nor
did he forbid the Clinton Administration from submitting the NAFTA to
Congress without an EIS, stating only that USTR "shall propose such an
Environmental Impact Statement forthwith."
<P>
     Under traditional NEPA jurisprudence, an agency action based on a
defective EIS is open to judicial review. However, where a legislative
EIS is required, as in the NAFTA implementing legislation, no court
can prevent Congress from voting on that legislation because the court
believes that an environmental impact statement is defective. In that
sense, this Public Citizen litigation should be regarded as a
"nuisance" suit, brought less to accomplish legal purposes than to
wreak political havoc with the NAFTA. 

<P>
Political Effects
<P>
     Here it may succeed. The political effect of the district court
decision is potentially devastating to the fate of the NAFTA. It
provides succor to those who oppose the NAFTA for any and all reasons
and raises the "price" the Administration will have to pay in the
NAFTA side agreements to secure "Green" support. It provides an excuse
for those who want to delay the NAFTA to demand that Congress wait
upon the judicial branch. And indeed it may yet lead those within the
Clinton Administration who are ambiguous about the NAFTA to put the
whole thing off until next year. Such a delay would likely doom the
NAFTA.
<P>

What To Do?
<P>
     The Clinton Administration has sought an expedited review of
Judge Richey's decision. Already the parties have agreed to a
compressed briefing schedule with final briefs due on August l0. At
that time the Court of Appeals will set a hearing date. The Justice
Department has requested that the Court hear the case in late August.
It is important that the Court do so. A decision would then be
possible sometime in September, and this would still allow the NAFTA
to be voted on this fall.
<P>
     The pendency of the Court decision ought not preclude the
Administration from moving quickly to conclude its negotiations over
the NAFTA side agreements. The Court case has absolutely no impact on
the side agreements. Indeed, concluding the side agreements should
clarify significantly the environmental impact of the NAFTA and how
the U.S. is seeking to protect the environment of the U.S. and Mexico.
<P>
     In the unlikely event that the Court of Appeals affirms Judge
Richey's decision, the Administration should immediately seek
expedited review in the Supreme Court. In light of the NAFTA's
importance, the Administration also should be ready to submit an EIS
forthwith if the Supreme Court so requires. While some have suggested
that preparation of an EIS would take six months to a year, this need
not be the case. The Administration has already done extensive work on
the environmental impact of the NAFTA. It has prepared a 250-page
Review of U.S.-Mexico Environmental Issues assessing its various
environmental ramifications. Thus, much of the "scoping" of issues has
already been done. Furthermore, many of the environmental consequences
of the NAFTA are speculative at best. Thus, the amount of further
empirical work that must be done is limited. While in no way
preferable, it should be possible, if legally required, to provide
Congress with an EIS while it debates the NAFTA.
<P>
     In any event, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has pointed
out that the Clinton Administration is free to submit the NAFTA to
Congress at the earliest possible moment -- regardless of whether the
environmental impact statement is finished. Judge Richey did not
forbid this. Indeed, as Public Citizen itself has admitted, "the
Administration remains fully free to send the NAFTA to Congress for
approval whenever it wishes, whether or not the office of USTR has
completed its EIS by that time." And obviously the Congress, in Public
Citizen's words, has "the right... to consider the NAFTA with or
without an EIS." In the final exigency, the Administration must be
prepared to act.
<P>
     On its own, Judge Richey's decision cannot derail the NAFTA. It
can only slow down the train. Any delay in bringing the NAFTA to the
Hill, however, provides oxygen to NAFTA opponents. It is up to the
Clinton Administration to prevent the battle over the NAFTA from being
bogged down in a dispute over the reach of the National Environmental
Policy Act.

<TITLE>Why the Governors Support The NAFTA (And Washington Doesn't) -- Heritage </TITLE>

<P>


INTRODUCTION<P>
     Seen from the perspective of Washington D.C., the prospects for
the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) appear
gloomy. According to Leon Panetta, President Bill Clinton's Director
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the agreement is "dead."
Many others in the Administration who also support the NAFTA -- most
notably Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Labor Secretary Robert
Reich, and Clinton himself -- are equally concerned because
congressional opposition is widespread and growing, most notably among
Democrats but with a sizeable Republican contingent as well. A well-
financed and -organized effort to derail the agreement is underway by
a coalition of interest groups, most prominently labor and
environmental lobbying organizations. The opponents' strategy is to
portray the NAFTA as leading to a massive loss of jobs, the de-
industrialization of the U.S., and a lowering of labor and
environmental standards to those of the Third World.
<P>
          In sharp contrast to this intense hostility and feverish
activity in the nation's capital is the view from the statehouses.
There, the political atmosphere is far more supportive of increased
trade with Mexico, the NAFTA in particular being regarded as almost
self-evidently good for the states. Even as the ranks of those in
Washington opposed to NAFTA swell, the governors of the fifty states
line up almost unanimously in support of the agreement. 
<P>
           The reason cited universally by the governors for their
support is NAFTA's expected positive impact on their states,
especially on job growth. This surprising consensus among the nation's
governors has gone largely unnoticed in the debate over NAFTA, and the
agreement's supporters have overlooked a valuable set of allies. More
important, however, this difference in outlook reveals much about the
difference in decision-making in Washington and the states. Whereas
Washington is overrun by special interest groups, the governors have
become champions not only of their states' interests but of the
general welfare of the nation. On the issue of NAFTA, the governors
better represent the interests of the American people than their
elected officials in Washington.
<P>

NAFTA'S TORTUOUS PATH
<P>
     NAFTA's path to congressional consideration has been a long and
difficult one. First advanced as an idea by Ronald Reagan in his
presidential campaign of 1980, and promoted in the mid-1980s by The
Heritage Foundation, negotiations for a free trade zone among the
U.S., Canada, and Mexico did not get underway until proposed by
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 1990. Although
Salinas's original proposal was for a bilateral U.S.-Mexican
agreement, Canada soon requested participation to safeguard its gains
from the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
<P>
          The trilateral negotiations which began in 1991 proved much
more difficult than anticipated, largely because of Mexico's desire to
delay the opening of many of its most sensitive and politically
powerful sectors, such as financial services. The resulting agreement,
although not perfect, did provide for the removal of most barriers to
trade among the three countries. Substantially completed by May 1992,
delays in the negotiations shelved congressional action on the
agreement until after the 1992 national elections.
<P>
          George Bush's defeat in November removed the agreement's key
proponent in the U.S. Although Bill Clinton repeatedly expressed his
support for the NAFTA in the campaign, he conditioned his approval on
the negotiation of additional and unspecified "side agreements" on
labor and environmental issues. Ross Perot, by contrast, denounced the
agreement, predicting its implementation would result in a "giant
sucking sound" of U.S. jobs being drawn south to Mexico. In one of his
last acts as President, Bush signed the completed agreement on
December 17, 1992, and forwarded it to Congress, where it awaited the
new President.
<P>
          Since assuming office, Clinton's policy has been to postpone
congressional consideration of the NAFTA until the side agreements
were completed. Negotiation of them began only in March. Since then,
further delays have emerged, most importantly, Mexico's and Canada's
opposition to the Clinton Administtration's attempts to turn the side
agreements into vehicles for protectionism. As a result, Treasury
Secretary Bentsen announced in April that the Administration's focus
on its domestic economic package would delay a vote on the trade pact
until the fall.

<P>
ENEMIES ORGANIZE
<P>
     These repeated delays have given the agreement's enemies time to
organize. Among the first to lobby the new Administration were
representatives of the flat glass and sugar growing industries, each
of which sought to reopen the NAFTA text for modifications in their
favor. Much more serious, however, are the efforts of organized labor
and other groups, such as environmental organizations, whose economic
and ideological interests pit them against free trade.
<P>
          The AFL-CIO makes no secret of its opposition to the
agreement. The defeat of the NAFTA was proclaimed as the "number one
objective" of the organization by Secretary/Treasurer Tom Donohue. A
coalition of environmental and leftist organizations opposed to free
trade in principle, such as the Citizen Trade Campaign, Greenpeace,
and Public Citizen, have given added weight to this opposition. A
well-financed and broad propaganda campaign has been launched which
prominently features provocative allegations against Mexico, such as
the employment of child labor, indiscriminate use of dangerous
pesticides, and the abuse of human rights.
<P>
          The most important issue, however, is jobs. According to the
Clinton Administration, 700,000 jobs have already been created in the
U.S. as a result of increased exports to Mexico. Several hundred
thousand more jobs will be added by the NAFTA. Every serious study of
the effects of the NAFTA (For more information see:  Clopper Almond,
Alberto Ruis-Moncayo, "Industrial Effects of a Mexico-U.S.  Free Trade
Agreement," Interindustry Economic Research Fund, 1991; KPMG Peat
Marwick, Policy Economics Group, "The Effects of a Free Trade
Agreement between the U.S.  and Mexico," 1991; "Review of Trade and
Investment Liberalization Measures by Mexico and Prospects for Future
United States-Mexican Relations," United States International Trade
Commission, Pub.  No.  332-282, October 1990.  Gary Clyde Hufbauer,
Jeffrey J.  Schott, "NAFTA:  And Assessment" (Washington, D.C: 
Institute for International Economics, February 1993); Steven
Globerman and Michael Walker eds.  "Assessing NAFTA:  A Trinational
Analysis" (Vancouver, B.C.:  The Freaser Institute, October 1992). )
shows the U.S. with a net gain in employment, the sole exceptions
being a condemnatory brief produced by the AFL-CIO, and a 1992 study
conducted by the leftist Economic Policy Institute. (Jeff Faux and
Thea M.  Lee, "The Effect of George Bush's NAFTA on American Workers: 
Ladder Up or Ladder Down?"  (Washington, D.C.:  The Economic Policy
Institute, 1992)) Nevertheless, despite the overwhelming empirical
evidence to the contrary, organized labor continues to charge that
there will be a net loss of jobs. This charge resonates in the slow-
growing U.S. economy, where fears of job security among the population
have provided fertile soil.
<P>
          As a result of the intense lobbying by anti-NAFTA forces,
what was once commonly regarded as a done deal now shows signs of
unravelling. Although two-thirds of the Republicans in Congress
support the NAFTA, only one-quarter of Democrats do, according to
informal congressional surveys. The situation is worse among the newly
elected members, where one-third of the freshmen Republicans in the
House oppose or are leaning against the NAFTA. According to Democrat
Representative Robert Matsui of California, a NAFTA supporter, only
five of 63 freshman Democrat Congressmen openly support the trade
pact. The leaders of both houses of Congress, Senator George Mitchell
and Speaker Tom Foley, stated in April that, although they themselves
support the agreement, a vote on NAFTA would lose in both the Senate
and the House of Representatives. Among congressional opponents, the
most commonly cited reason for their position is fear of a loss of
U.S. jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
<P>

NAFTA SUPPORT FROM THE STATES
<P>
     Yet, even as support for the NAFTA erodes in Washington, it
remains solid among the nation's governors. The overwhelming majority
of governors actively support the NAFTA; none has come out against the
agreement. (This information was gathered by Heritage Foundation staff
from March 1 to June 9, 1993, through telephone surveys to the offices
of the governors of the fifty states.) Of the 50 governors offices
contacted by the Heritage Foundation, at least 40 -- 20 of the 29
Democrats, one of two Independents, and all nineteen of the
Republicans -- reported active support for the agreement, with the
others having yet to go beyond their signing of the February 1993
National Governors Association statement backing NAFTA.
<P>
          Their confidence stems from the fact that most states
already have seen sharp increases in exports to Mexico over the last
five years. During that time Mexico removed many of its most egregious
trade barriers against U.S. goods. The NAFTA will simply accelerate
the process of opening Mexico to U.S. businesses and exports. Contrary
to popular belief, the principal effect of the NAFTA will not come
from its elimination of already low U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods --
now averaging 3 percent -- but rather from its dismantling of Mexico's
still-formidable barriers to trade, with tariffs currently averaging
11 percent and quotas limiting or excluing altogether many U.S.
products. Thus, the governors and U.S. business leaders understand
that with the NAFTA in place, the competitive positions of American
companies will be even better than they are now.<P>
SUPPORT FROM THE BORDER STATES

<P>

California
<P>
     California's experience is illustrative of the growing importance
of the Mexican market. Last year, the state's businesses exported $6.6
billion to Mexico, an increase of 190 percent over five years. More
than 110,000 Californians' jobs depend on exports to Mexico, and an
additional 106,000 jobs are supported by U.S. companies operating in
Mexico that draw upon the services of California's trucking,
management, warehousing, and service industries. (International Trade
Administration, U.S.  Exports to Mexico:  A State-by-State Overview
(Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Department of Commerce, April 1993), p. 
34.) The NAFTA is projected to directly generate nearly 50,000 new
jobs in California over the next ten years and to support tens of
thousands more.
<P>
          The opportunities of the Mexican market extend across the
business spectrum. Over the past five years, California's exports have
increased 489 percent in the food products sector, 382 percent in
transportation equipment, 248 percent in electric and electronic
equipment, 244 percent in chemical products, 169 percent in industrial
machinery and computers, and 548 percent in apparel.
<P>
          Specific examples are even more revealing. Cal-State Lumber
Sales' business in Mexico has increased by 700 percent in recent
years, allowing the company to increase its work force in California
by 30 percent. (U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee,
The Impact of the NAFTA on California, prepared for The Trade
Partnership, Washington, D.C., September, 1992, p.  5.) The positive
impact on jobs extends beyond the company's own payroll. According to
the company's Director of International Relations, Mary Alice Acevedo,
"We buy lumber from several mills; our purchases have helped the mills
keep U.S. workers on the job."
<P>
          Another example is SJS Products, which distributes U.S.
manufactured electro-mechanical products. This company faced sizeable
layoffs beginning in 1990 because of the economic recession. SJS at
that time turned to Mexico to expand its sales and, according to
William McGillivray, Director of Sales for the Company, "We have not
had to lay off one person since our involvement in Mexico. And all the
products we export to Mexico are 100 percent U.S. manufactured."
(Ibid.) 
<P>
           Free trade with Mexico has economic benefits that go beyond
job creation. One of the most important is allowing U.S. companies to
remain internationally competitive through an arrangement in which
some of their production is shifted to Mexico. Called co-production,
this technique is criticized for losing jobs to Mexico. However, co-
production arrangements actually create jobs in those U.S. branches
which supply the components and services for a company's Mexican
operations. As important, such measures save existing U.S. jobs by
making American companies more efficient and better able to face
increasing international competition, especially from the Japanese who
also use co-production in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.
<P>
          Businessmen typically are more far-sighted about Mexico's
opportunities than are NAFTA critics. Especially important is the
realization that, given that 70 percent of Mexico's imports come from
the United States, increasing prosperity there quickly translates into
increased sales for U.S. companies. Leonard Rabinowitz, the co-
Chairman of Carole Little Inc., an apparel manufacturer in Los
Angeles, says: "People's fear that this trade agreement is a license
to give away American jobs is ludicrous. They're not looking at the
big picture. By providing jobs in Mexico, we can create a better
marketplace there for American-made products." ("Thumbs Up for NAFTA,"
Women's Wear Daily, August 19, 1992.)
<P>
          Given the strong backing of the trade agreement by the
state's business community, it is not surprising that California
Governor Pete Wilson is a committed supporter of the NAFTA. He has
worked closely with the state's many businesses, and the California
trade promotion office is one of the nation's most aggressive.
Wilson's reasons for backing the agreement are straightforward:
"Commerce between the United States and Mexico freed of the
constraints of tariff and non-tariff barriers means increased trade,
and increased trade translates into vitally needed jobs on both side
of the border." Because of Mexico's recent trade liberalization,
"between 1987 and 1990, California's exports to Mexico more than
doubled -- creating tens of thousands of new jobs."
<P>
          California's two Senators, however, do not share these
views. Barbara Boxer campaigned on an anti-NAFTA platform, giving as
her principal reason the loss of jobs that the agreement supposedly
would produce. Similarly, Dianne Feinstein has voiced serious
reservations about the agreement, again largely related to the feared
negative effects on employment. And in California's House delegation,
several representatives have taken an anti-NAFTA stance, most
justifying their position as a defense of jobs. Among them: Republican
Duncan Hunter and Democrats Bob Filner, Dan Hamburg, and George
Miller.

<P>
Texas
<P>
     Governor Ann Richards is one of the strongest supporters of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, because the Texas economy is so
strongly connected to Mexico's economy. In 1992 Texas exported over
$18 billion worth of goods to Mexico. According to the United States
Trade Representative's office, 148,000 jobs in Texas are directly
dependent on exports to Mexico, and another 23,510 jobs are supported
by co-production operations in Mexico. ("Production-sharing" includes
maquiladoras as well as other businesses that use U.S.  parts and
components in production in Mexico. )
<P>
          Texas exports range from consumer goods to capital
equipment. Tecnol Medical Products, Inc., a Fort Worth-based
manufacturer of disposable medical products, employs 850 people with
annual sales of $75 million. Tecnol expects its sales to Mexico to
grow by 100 percent in 1993 to $150 million. Omnitrition
International, Inc., of Carrollton, Texas, sold over $5 million in
nutritional and personal care products last year in Mexico through its
40,000 distributors there. (Statement from the State of Texas
Department of Commerce, April 28, 1993.)
<P>
          Service companies based in Texas are also taking advantage
of increased business activity in Mexico. According to Robert L.
Herchert, President and CEO of Freese & Nichols, a consulting
engineering company from Fort Worth, "Mexico has become a very good
market for engineering services and environmental-related operations.
Mexico is currently our fastest growing export market. We believe this
trade agreement will not only enhance but also sustain our domestic
economic growth. Specifically, NAFTA will create new jobs for the U.S.
economy and achieve real liberalization in services and intellectual
property rights protection." (Ibid.)
<P>
          Small Texas businesses will benefit the most from a NAFTA.
The reason: the trade agreement will reduce the costs of transacting
business across the U.S.-Mexican border. For example, CEO Eusebio
Compian of American Ice Machines Inc., based in Houston, believes that
"traditional cumbersome bureaucracy on both sides of the border
hampers the completion of business transactions." According to
Compian, "passage of the NAFTA is a necessary tool to simplify,
enhance, and increase future business between our two countries. A
small firm like ours [over $1.5 million in sales per year] would
benefit greatly from the passage of this legislation." (Ibid.)
<P>NAFTA SUPPORT IN AMERICA'S HEARTLAND
 <P>    The opposition to the NAFTA within California's congressional
delegation is unusual among the border states. In the others --
Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas -- the governors' support for the NAFTA
is matched by that of their congressional delegations. Governor Ann
Richards, an especially vocal supporter of the NAFTA, captures the
pro-NAFTA spirit of the border states well: "For Texans, the
successful conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement cannot be
overestimated. NAFTA will have an enormous impact on our economy,
putting us literally in the geographic center of a hemispheric trade
zone, one that is 25 percent larger than the European Economic
Community." (Statement by Governor Ann W.  Richards of Texas on the
signing of the NAFTA, August 12, 1992.)
<P>
          Strong bipartisan support for NAFTA in such border states as
Texas is often dismissed by critics as being the result of regional
self-interest because this area generally is considered as having the
most to gain from increased trade with Mexico.
<P>
          However, some of the strongest supporters of the NAFTA are
located in the Midwest, the very heartland of U.S. manufacturing that
NAFTA opponents allege will be devastated by Mexican competition. The
governors of the industrial states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, and Ohio all are strong supporters of the NAFTA.

<P>
Michigan
<P>
     Of these, Michigan is the most interesting case, for the state is
depicted routinely as a certain loser from the NAFTA, and its
congressional delegation leads the opposition to the agreement.
However, according to the Michigan Department of Commerce, by 1992 the
state's rapidly increasing exports to Mexico had actually generated
31,000 jobs, double the amount of Mexico-related jobs that existed in
Michigan only five years ago. And those exports were largely
manufactured products, most prominently fabricated metal products,
transportation equipment, industrial machinery, and other capital
goods.
<P>
          The opening of the Mexican market has had a strongly
positive impact across the range of Michigan's manufacturing
industries. For example, Detroit Diesel Corporation of Lansing
increased exports to Mexico by 80 percent from 1991 to 1992.
Employment directly related to Diesel's Mexican sales increased 46
percent, representing 26 percent of all new hiring in Diesel's
Michigan operations. (J.  Nancy Martin, Detroit Diesel Corporation, in
letter to Export Development Authority, February, 18, 1993.)
<P>
          Haworth Corporation is a furniture manufacturer in Holland,
Michigan, that employs 4,000 U.S. workers, 3,500 of them in Michigan.
Haworth President and CEO Richard Haworth claims that he supports
NAFTA because his shipments to Mexico have increased tenfold in the
last two years. The reason: Business growth in Mexico increased demand
for office furniture. Says Haworth, "With Mexican tariff rates of 15
to 20 percent for U.S. office furniture products being phased out
[under NAFTA] we anticipate significant progress and growth for the
next several years." ("Haworth Inc., Voices Support for North American
Free Trade Agreement," press release, Haworth Corporation, March
1993.)
<P>
          In addition to manufactured products, the reduction of
Mexican trade barriers has also led to dramatic increases sales of
consumer products by Michigan companies. Steelcase Inc., Amway
Corporation, Gerber Products Corp., Kitchenaid, and Vlasic Foods are
only a few of the Michigan businesses which have found new markets in
Mexico's rapidly expanding middle class. 
<P>
           As in California, the business community's enthusiasm for
NAFTA is reflected in the governor's outspoken support for the
agreement. According to Governor John Engler, although Michigan "is
more than a thousand miles from the border, only California and Texas
export more goods to Mexico than does Michigan. Among the foreign
nations with which we trade, Mexico is our second largest export
customer." (Statement by Governor John Engler on NAFTA, May 27, 1993.)
And the benefits are concrete. Says Engler: "31,000 jobs depend
directly on trade with Mexico. In 1991, Michigan companies sold their
products to Mexican customers at the rate of $180,000 an hour -- and
that added up to $1.6 billion by the end of the year. Today [1993]
Michigan exports to Mexico are fast approaching $2 billion a year."
(Statement by Governor John Engler on NAFTA, May 20, 1993.)U.S.
Department of Commerce figures and analysis conducted by the
Governor's own state economic development agency back him up: Over the
past five years food product exports are up by 3,719 percent; textiles
up by 2,975 percent; furniture and fixtures up by 1,509 percent;
electric and electronic equipment up by 363 percent.
<P>
          Engler also challenges organized labor's opposition to the
NAFTA, saying that they "should understand that if cheap labor were
the key to company location, then Vietnam or Somalia would be
manufacturing meccas. They are not. Our location, knowledge
infrastructure, and workers' skill level give us what I believe is the
'Michigan Advantage' -- and NAFTA will strengthen our advantages even
more. We in Michigan should be concerned about union opposition
because if NAFTA is not ratified, it will cost us jobs here in
Michigan."
<P>
          Governor Engler's strong advocacy is in sharp contrast to
Michigan's congressional delegation. Although Michigan will be a big
winner under the NAFTA, most of the Michigan delegation remains
opposed to it. In particular, Senator Donald Riegle and Congressman
John Dingell and strong allies of organized labor vocally oppose the
NAFTA. Senator Carl Levin voted in May 1991 against giving the
President the "fast-track" authority to negotiate trade agreements
such as the NAFTA, and has expressed serious misgivings about the
pact. Levin, who receives considerable financial support from
organized labor, also opposed the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement, the precursor to the NAFTA. Today, however, his state
employs 234,000 people in jobs directly dependent on exports to
Canada.
<P>
          The industry most closely associated with Michigan is
automobiles, one which it shares with a number of states. Critics of
the NAFTA charge that Mexico's cheap labor will devastate employment
in the U.S. automobile industry. U.S. companies supposedly will now
move their plants south to take advantage of cheaper Mexican labor. 
<P>
           However, far from devastating the industry in the U.S., the
NAFTA will open a range of new opportunities. It is the Mexican
automobile and auto parts market, not that of the U.S., which has long
been shut tight against foreign competition. As Governor Engler noted
in meetings with Mexican officials last March, an American-made
Oldsmobile now costs $50,000 in Mexico because of import restrictions.
Any opening of the Mexican market would only increase the potential
for U.S. exports to that country. In fact, the reduction of Mexican
trade barriers since 1986 has increased the number of U.S. jobs
directly supported by exports of automobiles and automobile parts to
Mexico from around 12,000 to 75,000.
<P>
          As impressive as that number is, it is much smaller than it
could be because of Mexico's remaining protectionist policies on
automobiles. For example, last year fewer than 20,000 of the 300,000
automobiles sold in Mexico were manufactured in the U.S. However, the
NAFTA could raise that total to one million in sales annually by
forcing Mexico to eliminate its export performance laws, remove the
domestic content rules that require U.S. car manufacturers to use
Mexican parts for cars made in Mexico and cut in half tariffs on U.S.
cars and light trucks. (Alan Reynolds, "Opposition to Free Trade Hurts
U.S.  Industry," Detroit News, April 7, 1992, p.  3B.)
<P>
          Although the U.S. automobile companies likely will continue
relocating some of their existing operations to Mexico, the jobs lost
will be more than offset by a net gain in employment from the export
of automobiles and parts. Engler adds that U.S. automobile exports to
Mexico easily could double once Mexican barriers are removed. His
estimate is supported by General Motors Executive Vice President
William Hoglund who notes that the U.S. Department of Commerce
projects that the Big Three U.S. auto makers -- General Motors, Ford,
and Chrysler -- should increase their exports to Mexico by $1 billion
the first year after NAFTA is implemented, meaning 15,000 new jobs.
<P>
          As in other industries, the benefits of the NAFTA to the car
companies stem not only from increased exports, but also from
efficiency to be gained through co-production. Although Ford and its
U.S. workers will benefit from the increased sale of U.S.-manufactured
cars in Mexico, Ford also will be able to use its Mexican operations
to remain competitive against European and Asian rivals. Through
existing "production-sharing" arrangements, Ford makes most of the
components for its small cars and trucks in Michigan. These include
brakes, fuel tanks, and electronic components for instrument panels.
For every car Ford produces in Mexico, three-fourths of the components
originate from U.S. plants. Without its co-production facilities in
Mexico, Ford could not remain competitive with Japanese small car and
truck imports and those jobs in Michigan would be lost. Similarly, for
GM, 15,000 of its U.S. jobs are due to its current exports to Mexico.
In Michigan alone, 72,000 jobs in a range of industries are connected
to this type of "production-sharing" with Mexico, which the NAFTA will
increase to over 75,000. (Border Trade Alliance, op.  cit.)
<P>

Ohio
<P>
     Ohio's two Senators strongly oppose the NAFTA. According to
Howard Metzenbaum, if the NAFTA is adopted, "thousands more American
manufacturers will flee the U.S. to exploit Mexico's lax labor and
environmental protections." Metzenbaum's opposition to the NAFTA is
consistent with his earlier opposition to the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement. Yet, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office,
exports from Ohio to Canada and Mexico have created an estimated
170,000 jobs in the state.
<P>
          Senator John Glenn also has expressed similar concerns about
massive job loss. Yet, exports to Mexico over the past five years have
risen dramatically: 1,622 percent in paper products, 412 percent in
rubber and plastic products, 186 percent in industrial machinery and
computers, and 181 percent in fabricated metal products. These have
already created 15,000 jobs in Ohio. (U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S. 
Business Committee, The Impact of the North American Free Trade
Agreement on Ohio, prepared for The Trade Partnership, Washington,
D.C., September, 1992, p.  2.) The Border Trade Alliance estimates the
total will quickly jump to over 60,000 under the NAFTA. (Ibid.) Well-
known companies like the Mead Corporation, Procter & Gamble, and
Anchor Tool & Die -- all operating from Ohio -- have already
benefitted from liberalized trade with Mexico over the last five
years. Procter & Gamble says their exports to Mexico alone support
1,500 jobs in the U.S., and estimates the NAFTA will create an
additional 2,000. (Ibid., p.  5.)
<P>
          The automobile industry is important in Ohio as well. As
with Ford, General Motors' Mexican operations will allow the company
to compete against low-cost Asian imports and will increase employment
in those U.S. plants which supply components. GM's Packard Electric
Division has been able to add component manufacturing jobs at its
Warren, Ohio, plant because of exports to its subassembly facilities
in Mexico. Of less interest to Ohio's citizens, but nevertheless
significant, is the fact that Packard Electric has also opened a
components manufacturing plant in Mississippi to service its Mexican
operations.
<P>
          Despite the predictions of doom from the congressional
delegation, Ohio Governor George Voinovich is a strong supporter of
NAFTA because he has traced one in seven manufacturing jobs in Ohio to
exports, many of those to Mexico.

<P>
Illinois
<P>
     Governor Jim Edgar of Illinois also supports the NAFTA. Says
Edgar: Passage of the NAFTA will mean "thousands of jobs for Illinois
and an economic boost for our state, particularly in the long term.
Illinois exports to Mexico have more than tripled in the last five
years, and the elimination of trade barriers will mean our businesses
and their workers can continue to prosper from that trend." (Governor
Jim Edgar, "Remarks on Free Trade, 1992 Republican National
Convention," August 17, 1992.)
<P>
          Edgar's support is well-founded. Since he took office in
1990, Illinois' exports to Mexico have grown 137 percent, and Mexico
is now its second-largest export market. Exports have increased
enormously over the past five years: in food products by 2,080
percent, in fabricated metal products, 1,133 percent, in primary
metals, 966 percent, and in transportation equipment, 638 percent.
(U.S.  Exports to Mexico:  A State-by-State Overview, op.  cit.) In
1992, 30,000 Illinois jobs were directly attributable to exports to
Mexico, over 15,000 of those being added during Edgar's tenure.
Another 84,000 jobs in Illinois are linked with production-sharing
operations in Mexico in industrial machinery and computers, electric
and transportation equipment, and chemicals. Chicago-based Sears,
Roebuck & Company has opened several stores in Mexico in anticipation
of the growing consumer market under NAFTA; also in Chicago, Baxter
International's exports of medical equipment have increased 60 percent
since 1988 as Mexico's tariffs on medical products have come down.
<P>
          In testimony before the U.S. International Trade Commission,
William Lane of Peoria-based Caterpillar explained the multiplier
effect on employment in exporting Caterpillar equipment to Mexico:
"Cat's 1990 exports to Mexico generated work for about 900 U.S.
Caterpillar employees and 1,800 employees at the company's American
suppliers. I should point out that most of this work was performed at
Cat facilities in Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania." (William G. 
Lane, International Governmental Affairs Representative for
Caterpillar Inc.,"Probable Economic Effects on U.S.  Industries and
Consumers of a Free Trade Agreement Between the United States and
Mexico."  Statement before the International Trade Commission,
Chicago, Illinois, April 10, 1991.) Estimates are that over 10,000 new
jobs will be created over the next ten years in Illinois, directly
connected to exports to Mexico. (Border Trade Alliance, op.  cit.)
<P>
          Illinois will also benefit from the NAFTA because of its
location along the Mississippi River. As North-South commerce
increases, towns like Granite City will benefit. According to Bob
Wydra, General Manager of the Tri-City Regional Port District in
Granite City, their three million tons of annual shipments to Mexico
have created approximately 5,000 jobs in Illinois. Throughout the next
decade, Tri-City officials expect increased trade with Mexico to
create and sustain thousands of jobs as cost-effective modes of
transportation and development. (Statement from Bob Wydra, General
Manager of Tri-City Regional Port District, May 4, 1993.)
<P>
          U.S. financial services and insurance firms, formerly
excluded from the Mexican market, will be allowed to operate freely
there under the NAFTA. The financial services industry is a sector in
which Illinois companies have an enormous competitive advantage.
Chicago-based Allstate and State Farm Life Insurance companies, along
with Kemper Corporation, will be able to participate in what is a $3.5
billion and rapidly growing market in Mexico. Continental Bank
Corporation Vice-Chairman Richard Huber expects his $1 billion trade-
related financings to double two years after NAFTA is implemented. 
(State of Illinois, Washington office.)
<P>
          Navistar International, a Chicago based truck manufacturer,
entered into a long-term cooperative agreement with Dina Camiones
S.A., the largest Mexican manufacturer of medium and heavy duty
trucks. According to Navistar, in 1989 Dina bought $6 million worth of
components. In 1990, that figure swelled to $30 million, and in 1992,
the Mexican company purchased $100 million from its U.S. partner. Paul
Roseland, the Vice President of Manufacturing for Navistar asserts
that "As the Mexican economy continues to improve and investment in
industrial infrastructure moves ahead, Mexican business will require a
growing number of trucks -- that means good business for us." 
<P>
           Despite this broadly positive economic impact on Illinois,
both Illinois Senators -- Carol Mosely-Braun and Paul Simon -- are
lukewarm on the NAFTA and several Congressmen oppose the accord. They
have focused on predictions by opponents that companies such as Zenith
will move their operations to Mexico, thereby displacing U.S. workers.
However, Zenith Chairman Jerry Pearlman predicts new jobs will be
created for Zenith's television-tube producing plants. Co-production
between Zenith's U.S. and Mexican operations will reduce costs and
make Zenith's televisions less expensive than Asian ones which are
currently assembled in Mexico with Asian components and sold in the
U.S. <P>
 SUPPORT IN OTHER STATES<P>
     Beyond the industrial Midwest, governors from states as
economically and geographically diverse as Arkansas, Colorado,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and
Washington are as supportive of the NAFTA. And yet opposition to the
agreement often features prominently in their congressional
delegations.<P>
North Carolina and South Carolina<P>
     North Carolina and South Carolina are a case in point. North
Carolina Democratic Governor Jim Hunt and South Carolina Republican
Governor Carroll Campbell both support the agreement. Both governors
work closely with their state development offices to spur exports from
such diverse industries as textiles, chemicals, industrial machinery,
and transportation equipment. Companies across the range of industry,
such as Tyson Foods, Northern Telecom, Kimberly-Clark, Mount Vernon
Mills, and Monsanto have increased exports to Mexico and hope to
improve that record under the NAFTA.
<P>
          But the three Republicans and one Democrat that comprise the
Senate delegation from those states oppose the agreement. Their
political antennae have been oriented toward the politically powerful
apparel industry in both states that may experience minor losses in
employment because of Mexican competition under the NAFTA. But a focus
on this sector to the exclusion of the statewide benefits to be gained
by other industries ignores the fact that exports to Mexico have
already grown 249 percent in North Carolina and 191 percent in South
Carolina since 1987. Exports to Mexico already have created 8,500 jobs
in North Carolina and 2,500 in South Carolina. North Carolina's
furniture exports are up by 6,813 percent and transportation equipment
by 1,359 percent over the past five years.. Over the same period South
Carolina's fabricated metal exports rose by 1,222 percent, paper
products by 844 percent, and electric and electronic equipment by 476
percent.
<P>
          Surprisingly, the Senators' opposition also overlooks
NAFTA's benefits to the textile industry. Many in the industry fear
Mexican competition, but in reality Mexico's market would be more
closed without the NAFTA. As Kin Cobb of Stonecutter Mills Corporation
of Spindale, North Carolina, says, "I'm in the yarn department, and we
haven't done much business with Mexico because we are unable to be
competitive with [their] high barriers. When barriers go down, the
yarn portion of our company can then do business in Mexico."
(Statement from Kin Cobb, Stonecutter Mills Corporation, May 1, 1993.)
In fact, Mexican government figures show that imports of U.S. textiles
have risen 26 percent in the past two years, reaching $1.6 billion in
1992, with an $81 million U.S. surplus. (Estadsticas Anuales,
Direccin General de Inversin Extranjera (SECOFI), 1992.) North
Carolina's textile and apparel exports rose 946 percent and 524
percent respectively since 1987 and South Carolina's by similar
amounts. Far from planning to ravage the U.S. market, the Mexican
textile industry is in a deep recession, and its owners and workers
alike fear being swept away by U.S. competitors once the market is
opened by the NAFTA.

<P>
Wisconsin
<P>
     Of all the states to support a free trade agreement with Mexico,
Wisconsin is one of the most unlikely. Located far from Mexico's
borders, it has few long-standing historical, political, and
commercial ties to that country. Nonetheless, Governor Tommy Thompson
has been quick to recognize the commercial opportunities for his state
under a NAFTA and outspoken in his support of the agreement. Governor
Thompson led a delegation of Wisconsin businessmen to Mexico toward
the end of last year. Said Thompson: "In the five short days of the
mission, Wisconsin companies were able to lay the groundwork for
promising business deals... in everything from milking and farm
equipment to Christmas trees."
<P>
          According to Carlos O. Rioja, Export Director for Wisconsin-
based Oshkosh Truck Corporation, the NAFTA would provide both added
job security and better relations with his company's trading partners.
"If the Mexican and Canadian economies improve [as a result of the
NAFTA], they will be capable of buying more Oshkosh Truck products."
This business was a result of a November 1989 trade mission to Mexico
led by Governor Thompson. At that time, Oshkosh Truck Corporation was
able to identify and conclude their first-ever contract with a Mexican
company, worth approximately $1.2 million. (Statement from Carlos O. 
Rioja, Export Director, Oshkosh Truck Corporation, May 3, 1993.) The
Paper Converting Machine Company of Green Bay also has experienced
significant growth in its business with Mexico. In 1989 paper
shipments to Mexico totaled $2,600,000. By 1992 shipments to Mexico
reached $14,400,000. (Statement from Paul DeCaster, Manager of
Marketing, Paper Converting Machine Company, April 30, 1993.)
<P>
          Elizabeth Dubman, Manager of Market Development for Polar
Ware Company in Sheboygan states that Polar Ware exports to Mexico
grew 200 percent in the last eighteen months alone. Dubman has
concluded that "there are significant growth opportunities and we are
continuing to aggressively focus to expand distribution in Mexico."
(Statement from Elizabeth Dunman, May 7, 1993.)

<P>
Maryland
<P>
     Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer has been a strong
supporter of the NAFTA, regarding it as essential if his state's
businesses are to remain internationally competitive. Maryland's
exports to Mexico have increased at an average annual rate of 44
percent since 1987.  (U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business
Committee, The Impact of the NAFTA on Maryland, prepared for The Trade
Partnership, Washington, D.C., September, 1992, p.  1.)Under the
NAFTA, Maryland-based insurers GEICO Corporation and USF&G will have
access to Mexico's insurance industry, which previously was closed to
foreigners. The NAFTA will also benefit Maryland companies like GSM
Industries that produce oil and gasfield equipment, because the
agreement forces Mexico's state-owned electricity and petroleum
monopolies to adopt competitive bidding practices and accept bids from
U.S. companies on an equal basis. Mexico's $6 billion
telecommunications industry will be fully opened to U.S.
telecommunications manufacturers and services companies when the NAFTA
becomes law, expanding opportunities for Maryland's Bendix Corp.
Microlog Corp.,and Western Electric Company. (Directory of American
Firms Operating in Foreign Countries, Vol.  3, 12th ed.  (New York: 
World Trade Academy Press, 1991); Greater Cleveland Growth
Association, The Greater Cleveland International Trade Directory,
1992-93. ) To spur Maryland exports to Mexico, Schaefer's department
of commerce has sent several successful delegations of businesses to
Mexico in recent years. In an April 21 speech to the Southern
Governors Association, Schaefer called for passage of the NAFTA and
advocated extending the NAFTA to include countries in Central and
South America.
<P>
          Contrasted to Schaefer's support for the NAFTA is the
opposition by Maryland's two Senators: Barbara Mikulski and Paul
Sarbanes. Once again, the principal reason given for their opposition
is the feared negative impact on employment; but unlike Schaefer,
neither has visited Mexico with businesses from the state. Nor do
these Senators fully appreciate the NAFTA will create jobs for
Maryland's insurance, oil equipment, and telecommunications
industries.<P>
Colorado<P>
     Democrat Governor Roy Romer is a strong supporter of the NAFTA.
Since Mexico began opening its economy in 1987, Colorado's exports to
it have increased by 118 percent, from $69 million to $151 million.
(U.S.  Exports to Mexico, op.  cit., p.  36.) As in many other Western
states, the NAFTA will stimulate jobs in services industries in
Colorado that will grow with the expansion of North-South commercial
activity. According to Eric Miller, Executive Vice President of
Blackfox Investment Group in Denver, Colorado, "With Denver on the
Rocky Mountain Ridge, we should focus on North-South trade instead of
East-West. That is the future of this area. Denver becomes a
distribution base for Mexican companies wanting access to U.S. markets
and similarly for Canada." ("Selling South of the Border:  Some
Colorado Businesses Already Have Made the Move to Mexico, but Others
May Need to Hustle for a Piece of the Action," Colorado Business, Vol. 
19, No.  11, p.  43.) Other Western states like Utah, Arizona, and New
Mexico also are looking to develop more sophisticated transportation,
warehousing, and delivery systems along several corridors connecting
Mexico with Canada.
<P>
           Governor Romer is working with Colorado's mining,
agricultural, and high-tech industries to locate markets in Mexico.
According to Nat Bostwick, a former official with the Colorado state
development office who now works for John Clark Inc., a mining
equipment manufacturer in Colorado which does business in Mexico,
"Mexico is one of the largest mining countries in the world. All of
the [U.S. mining] companies are doing business through joint ventures.
Mexico has gone from one of the most protected markets to virtually
free trade."  (Ibid.)
<P>
          Another area for U.S. markets is Mexico's growing consumer
base. Gerry Baby Products Corporation has been taking advantage of
this market by selling since 1988 the car seats, strollers, carriers,
and cribs it manufactures in Colorado to Mexico. Gerry expects annual
sales to grow by 15 percent in the coming years because of Mexico's
insatiable demand for U.S. consumer products among its growing middle
class. (U.S.  Council of the Mexico-U.S.  Business Committee, The
Impact of the NAFTA on Colorado, prepared for The Trade Partnership,
Washington, D.C., September, 1992, p.  5.) Jerry Busto, President of
Jerry's Discount Auto Repair and Emission Testing Corporation, also
sees a growing market for auto piston seals it manufactures in Denver
and is now exporting to Mexico. According to Busto, "Many people in
Mexico need our product because they drive cars with worn-out diesel-
powered engines that use greater than normal amounts of fuel." (Linda
Walker, "Local Firm Develops Ties With Mexico," Rocky Mountain News,
March 1, 1992.)
<P>
          In states like Colorado, jobs created under production-
sharing operations between U.S. manufacturers and Mexican assembly
operations are growing. Denver-based Samsonite Corporation, which
employs 1,100 workers in Colorado, is a typical example of how U.S.
companies are using Mexico to remain internationally competitive while
keeping jobs in the U.S. According to Tom Leonard, President of
Samsonite USA, its luggage assembly operations in Nogales, Mexico,
support 100 jobs at the Samsonite's Tucson Arizona facility, another
187 jobs employed by Samsonite's 64 domestic suppliers located in
eighteen states. Says Leonard, "Samsonite's production-sharing
operation in Nogales is essential to our competitive position, giving
us an advantage over competitors, whose operations are in Southeast
Asia, both in terms of quality and design protection." (The Impact of
the NAFTA on Colorado, op.  cit., p.9.)

<P>
THE ROLE OF THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS
<P>
     Environmental organizations opposed to the NAFTA have been
especially active in Congress, but the most powerful anti-NAFTA
lobbyists in Washington are those of organized labor. The reason for
organized labor's opposition to the NAFTA is that, although virtually
every study indicates that overall U.S. employment will expand from
freer trade with Mexico, there will inevitably be some job
dislocations, particularly in those industries which are the most
heavily protected and often the most heavily unionized. Thus,
organized labor's opposition stems not from a concern for the general
welfare of the American people, but for the interests of its own
members.
<P>
          The most vocal opponents of the NAFTA in the Congress are
those most closely associated with organized labor, which is quick to
reward those it favors with generous campaign financing. For example,
Ohio's Senator Metzenbaum received $602,000 in direct contributions
from labor PACs in the 1986-1992 period. ("Federal Election Campaign
Reports," Almanac of American Politics (Washington, D.C.:  The
National Journal), pp.  2-3.) During the same period, Senators Riegle
and Levin from Michigan netted over $470,000 and $678,000
respectively. (Ibid., p.  2.) These figures include only direct
payments and do not include the often much larger indirect
contributions and support operations. Although he faces a primary
challenge in 1994, Senator Riegle has already been endorsed by the
AFL-CIO, with the union's Michigan President Frank Garrison saying
that the organization "is going to make damn sure Don Riegle is re-
elected." ("Survivor Riegle gets labor backing as Dem.," The Observer,
February 11, 1993, p.  17A.)
<P>
          A cross-referencing of the most active anti-NAFTA Senators
and Congressmen with a list of the recipients of large campaign
contributions from organized labor reveals a remarkable overlap. Of
the top forty recipients of labor campaign contributions, for example,
90 percent oppose the NAFTA. To be sure, ideological affinity accounts
for most of this, as those most closely associated with organized
labor usually are also philosophically opposed to free trade. But it
also clearly demonstrates that there are more material incentives at
work to help the representatives toe the line. This understandable
attentiveness to the concerns of their most important backers,
however, does put these members of Congress at odds with the interests
of their states. In fact, an unusually high proportion of the funding
for Metzenbaum's 1988 record-setting campaign came from out-of-state
contributions. (Paul Furiga, "Most Metzenbaum Funds Are From Non-
Ohioans," The Repository (Canton), August 25, 1988, p.  H6.)
<P>
          Because of the NAFTA's demonstrably positive impact on the
general welfare and strong support throughout the local economy,
organized labor's clout at the state level has not been sufficient to
force a governor into open opposition to the NAFTA. But it has
persuaded some governors to temporize their endorsements. Such is the
case of New York's Governor Mario Cuomo. Exports to Mexico of
manufactured goods have created over 23,000 jobs for New Yorkers over
the past five years, and they are growing rapidly. (Border Trade
Alliance, op.  cit.) In addition, New York's enormous financial
community will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the NAFTA as the
trade pact forces Mexico's formerly closed financial sector to open to
American competition. Exports are up in all categories. Even such
unlikely exporters as New York's apple growers, which formerly were
effectively excluded from Mexico's market because of tariff walls,
have benefitted from Mexico's opening and see the NAFTA as the only
way to ensure their long-term access to that growing market.
<P>
          Despite the agreement's beneficial impact on New York,
however, the normally outspoken Cuomo has been surprisingly reticent
regarding the NAFTA. His silence is not attributable to a lack of
information, as his own state development agency has been quite active
in promoting business in Mexico and has kept his office informed
regarding the strong support for the NAFTA among the state's
businesses. Nor is he opposed to free trade: He has repeatedly
protested against "Japan-bashing," being fully aware of the importance
of Japan's market for New York's businesses. Instead, the reason for
his reluctance to openly support the NAFTA presumably lies in Cuomo's
close relations with organized labor, which has long been generous to
his campaigns. 
<P>
           Mario Cuomo is not the only governor whose national
political ambitions have produced an equivocal attitude toward the
NAFTA. Their impact on positions toward the NAFTA can be seen in
President Clinton's own evolving views. As governor of Arkansas, Bill
Clinton was a strong supporter of free trade with Mexico. However, in
his presidential campaign, Clinton's interests shifted to a national
audience, leading him to pursue the votes and financial resources of
the Democratic Party's core constituencies, especially organized
labor. As a result, he conditioned his support of the NAFTA on the
negotiation of supplemental agreements on environmental and labor
issues.

<P>
NAFTA: AN ENGINE FOR SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH
<P>
     Small and medium-sized businesses are critically important for
generating new jobs in America. Over 80 percent of new job growth
during the 1980s was seen among small and medium-sized businesses.
Moreover, Mexico is a very important market for small businesses
because its proximity and its existing trade relations with the U.S.
make doing business in Mexico less costly for small businesses. 
<P>
           Saniserve Corporation is a typical example of the
importance of Mexico for small and medium-sized businesses. Based in
Indianapolis, Saniserve is an ice cream machine manufacturer that
employs 130 people. Last year Saniserve sold $490,000 worth of
equipment to Mexico, and expects sales to grow to $650,000 this year.
According to Saniserve's CEO Gabriel Aguirre, seventeen of his
employees would lose their jobs if not for exports to Mexico. Says
Aguirre, "If this continues I know I'll have to hire more people."
(Statement from Gabriel Aguirre, April 21, 1993.) Aguirre plans to
increase plant capacity in Indianapolis to keep up with rising exports
to Mexico.
<P>
          On a smaller scale, Air Hydraulics Incorporated, based in
Jackson, Michigan, employs seventeen workers in the manufacture of
presses and impact machines. President Michael Clark has worked
closely with the Michigan state development office to boost his
exports to Mexico. Says Clark, "NAFTA will make it possible for the
average Mexican-owned facility to purchase machines and industrial
products from the United States. Without NAFTA, only the large Mexican
multinational corporations would be real prospects." Within three
years Clark expects sales to Mexico to comprise 25 percent of his
output. "Without NAFTA we will not have a strong export program into
Mexico or Latin America. Without NAFTA we stay domestic and stagnate."
(Statement from Michael Clark, April 29, 1993.. )
<P>
          Chicago-based Summit Industries, a small producer of x-ray
machines, has expanded exports to Mexico by 500 percent since 1987.
Another small business dependent on exports to Mexico is Snider Mold
Company of Mequon, Wisconsin. Snider Mold employs 45 people in high-
paying jobs manufacturing moldings. It has tripled in size in the last
six years, largely because of its increases in exports to Mexico
(today 25 percent of their products are sold in Mexico). (Statement
from James Meinert, Director of International Marketing, Snider Mold
Company, April 30, 1993.) At present, Snider faces a 20 percent
Mexican tariff, which will be eliminated by the NAFTA. Thus, the free
trade pact will be a boon for this small company's sales to Mexico.

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Senator Bill Bradley has termed the passage of the NAFTA
President Clinton's most important foreign policy priority. This
centerpiece of U.S. policy toward Latin America and international
trade, however, has encountered tough and increasing opposition on
Capitol Hill. A panoply of interest groups opposed to free trade --
labor unions, environmental organizations, and leftist activists --
have mounted an aggressive, no-holds-barred campaign to defeat the
agreement or so radically alter it as to erect new and imposing
barriers to U.S.-Mexico trade.
<P>
          The climate of fear which has been successfully and
skillfully cultivated in the Congress, now constitutes the single
greatest obstacle to congressional approval of the NAFTA. The
individual legislator faces political pressures from environmental,
labor, and other interest groups. This pressure is distracting
Congress from its duty to protect the general welfare not only of the
nation, but if pro-NAFTA sentiments are to be believed, the individual
states as well. The undoing of what was once regarded as virtually a
done deal would represent a triumph of special interests over the
general welfare of the American people.
<P>
          As far as the NAFTA's impact on the economy, the facts speak
for themselves: No independent study supports the endlessly varied
contentions of NAFTA's opponents that the removal of the artificial
and cumbersome trade barriers with Mexico will harm the U.S. All of
the non-partisan public and private studies agree that the benefits
will be overwhelmingly positive and that not armies of unemployed
workers but hundreds of thousands of new jobs will be created.
<P>
          This is why nearly all of America's governors endorse the
NAFTA. Democrat as well as Republican governors have experienced first
hand the powerful impact of Mexico's opening markets on their state's
economy. Moreover, having seen the results, they want more of the same
as soon as possible. More attentive to and informed about their
states' welfare than any member of Congress could be, America's
governors are frustrated and mystified by Congress's opposition to the
NAFTA. 
<P>
           In a very real sense, NAFTA is a victim of the continuing
erosion of federalism -- of the steady transfer of power from the
states to Washington. How else to explain the precariousness of an
agreement which the states solidly support? How else to account for
the astonishing influence of lobbyists who represent a collection of
marginal interests?
<P>
          The NAFTA has not yet been defeated. But to save it, members
of Congress must begin listening not only to their lobbyists, but to
the people of their states and the governors who speak for them.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Clinton Claims Undeserved Credit for Cutting FY 1996 Deficit<br>
<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

The statement that "If you like laws and sausages, you should never watch either one being made" is attributed to Prince Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Germany during the late 19th century. Were he alive today, he might want to add "government management" to that list. It also is not a pretty sight, and no one seems much interested in cleaning up the mess.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fact is that, notwithstanding all sorts of promises to the contrary by elected officials of both parties, in Congress and in the White House, egregious instances of costly waste continue throughout the government and all too often survive the budget ax while important spending plans are scrapped. Consider the following recent examples drawn from the government's own studies and reports:
<p>
<b>Beach Blanket Boondoggle</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The invitation to the 1995 convention of the National Tenant Organization (NTO) at the San Juan, Puerto Rico, Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort reads like any vacation brochure: "We promise you a vacation that will be unforgettable!!  Casino's for Dads. Beaches, Swimming, Snorkeling, Dancing, & Touring etc... for youths. Exotic Shopping, Beauty Salon for complete pampering for Moms. Appetizing, Savory, Delicious foods for the Family Meals."
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only problem is that this boondoggle occurred in the guise of a training session for 260 public housing tenants, public housing officials, and employees of the <a href="http://www.hud.gov">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> that was both sponsored and funded by HUD. It cost the U.S. taxpayer an estimated $325,000, according to HUD's own Inspector General in a February 29, 1996, report to Congress.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although HUD officials denied any agency involvement when first questioned by Congress, the department's independent Inspector General subsequently concluded that "HUD officials played a key role in planning and conducting NTO's 1995 National Convention in Puerto Rico."<sup>2</sup>  And although conference sponsors contend the event was educational in nature, the Inspector General found otherwise, concluding that "The video recordings of actual convention events show the poor organization and lack of programmatic substance at the convention."  The official watchdog further commented that "The videos of convention events also show the political nature of the convention," noting that the government employee who was translating from English to Spanish withdrew in the middle of a session because he believed that it was inappropriate for a federal employee to be involved in such a partisan event. It seems that his superiors did not show the same good judgment.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Kevin E. Marchman, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, (202) 708-0950.

<p>
<b>Crash Test Dummies</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although the ValuJet crash focused the public's attention on the <a href="http://www.dot.gov">Department of Transportation</a>'s questionable enforcement of air safety standards, a recent report by DOT's Inspector General found similar failures in the Federal Transit Administration's Bus Testing Program. This program is operated for DOT and FTA by university faculty and graduate students at two Pennsylvania test facilities. The IG's report concluded that "FTA procedures were not adequate to ensure new bus models were tested as required; deficiencies existed in tests for structural integrity, performance and fuel economy."<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Specifically, as noted in the report, "at least ten new bus models, involving $44.5 million in federal funds, were operating without having been tested."  The report also suggested that the government might be able to recover $350,000 due to questionable personnel costs. These costs included salaries paid to eight graduate students who were not working on the project, payments to the principal investigator after he was replaced, and salary paid to a facilities manager after he was reassigned to other duties. This report has been available to the DOT and to Congress for more than two years. But according to the Inspector General, DOT has not yet resolved the allegations raised in the report; nor has it recovered the money.

<P>
<b>Dialing With Your Dollars</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Each year the <a href="http://www.usda.gov">Department of Agriculture</a> spends more than $50 million to provide telephone service for its 105,000 employees, but a costly portion of that spending represents employee phone abuse that Department officials ignored despite earlier warnings from the U.S. General Accounting Office.<sup>4</sup>  The GAO also discovered that the USDA continued to pay for telephone service for field offices that had been closed for more than a year.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How bad is the abuse?  During a four month period examined by the GAO, about half of all collect calls received by USDA employees, amounting to more than 600 calls costing $2,600, were from inmates at 18 jails or prisons. Many of these calls were rerouted illegally by USDA employees to other USDA long-distance lines.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to the GAO, the USDA had been aware of the inmate abuse since 1994 but did nothing to stop it. The same GAO review found that numerous calls were being made from Agriculture Department phones to adult chat lines that offer sexually explicit entertainment, and that a number of these involved expensive international calls, many to the Dominican Republic. The GAO was unable to determine to what extent these sex-related calls were made by rerouted, collect-calling inmates.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, (202) 720-3631.
<p>
<b>You Can Dance If You Want to, You Can Leave Your Friends Behind.... </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The notion that the government should fund self-sustaining, indigenous culture and art like the North Dallas Square Dance Club or the Out of Town Blues Band at Washington's New Vegas Lounge probably would strike most Americans as both silly and wasteful. Yet this is exactly what the National Endowment for the Arts has been doing -- but only if the artistic activity is indigenous to foreign countries -- at a cost to the American taxpayer of hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in the dance category alone.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Should taxpayers subsidize Mexican folk dancing?  The NEA thinks so. It gave $40,000 in 1994 (the most recent year for which spending details are available) to Floricanto Dance Theater, Academia de Danza y Folklore Mexicano, Raices de Mexico, and Los Lupenos de San Jose. It seems that even Japanese folk dancing needs taxpayer help. The NEA gave $10,000 to the Tokunagu Dance Ko. and the Jo Ha Kyu Performance Group.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The list goes on and on, including the New York Chinese Cultural Center, Dancing and Drums of Africa, and $20,000 to the Capoeira Foundation (Brazilian dance). Traditional Philippine dance was supported through the Samahan Philippine Dance Company and Kulintang Arts Inc., while groups pursuing dance cultures of undetermined ethnicity such as the Najwa Dance Corps, Sharir Dance Company, and Zivili Kolo Ensemble reflect the dozens of dance clubs that received taxpayer support.
<p>
<b>Who's in Charge:</b> Jane Alexander, Chairman, National Endowment for the Arts, (202) 682-5414.

<b>A Knockout Punch to the Taxpayer</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Faced with imminent fiscal collapse, the District of Columbia government has cut back on many vital social services and has been forced to surrender much of its executive authority to an independent control board as a pre-condition for any taxpayer bailout, now averaging $3,898 for each and every District resident. But these reforms have not extended to D.C.'s Boxing and Wrestling Commission -- a money loser thanks to mismanagement and a limited number of poorly attended professional fights. Sharing responsibility for D.C.'s few professional fights with the D.C. Sports Commission, the Boxing Commission normally is supposed to be funded by an excise tax on gate receipts and revenues from pay-per-view boxing matches shown over local cable television. But the District of Columbia Auditor found that the Commission generally fails to collect the required taxes and operates at a loss: more than $26,000 over the past two years.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Commission has failed to collect the necessary taxes in every year between 1991 and 1995. Much of the shortfall reflects both the Commission's inability to collect taxes owed by the local cable TV monopoly and its mismanagement of live fights. This occurs despite the fact that the financially pressed District government spends more than $2 million per year on the Office of Cable Television, whose duties include monitoring the company's compliance with the terms and conditions of its franchise agreement. Last year, the unauthorized distribution of complimentary tickets to the "Million Man March Fights" by one of the Commission's officials led the promoter of the event to withhold his tax payment. Had the District collected the boxing fees it was owed and operated the Commission on a break-even basis, it would have had enough money to repair dozens of its growing inventory of disabled police cars.

Americans are increasingly aware of well-documented failings within the <a href="http://www.faa.gov">Federal Aviation Administration</a>-operated air traffic control system, which is responsible for safely guiding airplanes in flight, as well as through takeoffs and landings.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's government-operated air traffic control system lurches from one costly equipment failure to another, most recently with a new sophisticated radar system designed to detect dangerous wind conditions. Expected to cost $373 million when installed at 47 airports, the new system has suffered frequent shutdowns and failures at the 16 airports where it already is in place. At Washington's National Airport, for example, the new system has failed nearly once a week since it was installed in January 1996, and its failure to detect unsafe wind conditions contributed to a potentially dangerous situation where strong winds caused a plane's wing to hit a runway light on takeoff.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Persistent failure of costly equipment is nothing new with the FAA. Other recent occurrences include a power surge blamed on a squirrel, which took down the Cleveland airport's radar for a week; a new system in Pasco, Washington, that could track cars in driveways but sometimes missed planes; Tampa controllers who complained of "black holes" on their screens, with planes disappearing for two or three miles; and lost power in the New York City area system that grounded 200 planes while another 37 were in the air -- one pilot used on-board telephones to contact the New York ground controllers. Also occurring over the past year were multiple radar failures in Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, Florida; Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Washington, D.C.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Gardena, California; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Between May 1993 and June 1995, the Long Island control facility that guides planes over the North Atlantic suffered 16 significant outages; the nearby New York center that handles planes flying close to the city has experienced 52 significant computer failures since 1993.

F.Y.I No. 92<br>
March 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Office of Management and Budget last week announced that the FY 1996 deficit is forecast to be $145.6 billion, or one-half of the FY 1992 level of $290.4 billion.<sup>1</sup>  Although the Clinton Administration claims credit for this significant deficit reduction, in fact it has had very little to do with it.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Before President Clinton took office, three factors already were beginning to bring down the deficit:
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>1) Reductions in defense spending. </b> A significant part of the decrease in the deficit is the result of much lower defense spending.  Defense spending in FY 1996 will be $266.3 billion, which is $36.3 billion less than in FY 1992.  In real, inflation-adjusted terms, defense spending is the lowest since the Carter years, and as a percentage of GDP it is lower than before World War II.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has testified to Congress about the dangerous neglect of military procurement, which is now at the lowest level since the Korean War.  Since FY 1992, military procurement has been reduced by 44 percent.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>2) The reform of deposit insurance.</b>  The most deceptive part of the "deficit reduction" between FY 1992 and FY 1996 is simply the way in which the budget accounts for federal deposit insurance for banks and thrift institutions.  During the Bush Administration, the S&L bailout made the budget deficit much greater, requiring $57.9 billion in FY 1990 and $66.2 billion in FY 1991.  But in FY 1993, before Clinton's economic policies were enacted, the federal government actually began to make a profit of $28 billion from selling assets.  In FY 1996, the deposit insurance funds will bring in $13.5 billion to make the deficit appear even smaller.  The Clinton Administration has enjoyed a large windfall.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Defense spending cuts and the distorting effects of deposit insurance account for 36 percent of the change in the deficit between FY 1992 and FY 1996.  While the Administration claims credit for deficit reduction, its domestic spending has surged 23 percent since FY 1992, from $857.1 billion in FY 1992 to $1,058.4 billion in FY 1996.  Domestic spending now is equal to 14.5 percent of GDP, the highest proportion since the 1980 and 1982 recessions, which pushed up the ratio because the economy slumped.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>3) Economic growth and tax revenues.</b>  As the economy grew out of the 1990-1991 recession, federal tax revenues began to increase significantly.  Indeed, one of the largest contributing factors in the huge deficits during the Bush years was the drop in revenue growth during the recession.  Historically, tax revenues have grown at about 7.9 percent per year, but during 1990-1992, government revenues grew at half that rate.  When the economy recovered from the Bush recession in FY 1993, revenue growth rebounded strongly to 9 percent, and FY 1994 saw a 7.8 percent growth.  Government revenues have grown from $1,090.5 billion to $1,426.8 billion, or 31 percent, since FY 1992.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This significant growth in taxes, combined with the cut in defense spending and the shift of deposit insurance from a net cost to a profit center in the budget, accounts for all of Clinton's deficit reduction.  Not a dime of this deficit reduction is from controlling spending.  The "era of big government" is not over; it is just hiding behind the business cycle and post-Cold War defense policy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Just as incoming Presidents are unfairly blamed for economic slowdowns, they also receive unwarranted credit for economic growth even when it is more sluggish than it should be.  A look at what has happened to federal tax revenues collected since the first Clinton budget suggests that the deficit should have been falling faster.  The Clinton Administration's 1993 tax increase has been followed by a significant slowdown in the rate of growth in tax revenues.  In FY 1996, federal revenue is projected to be only $71.6 billion greater than it was in FY 1995, while in FY 1995 it was $97.5 billion higher than FY 1994, and in FY 1994 it was $104.2 billion greater than in FY 1993.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the Congressional Budget Office, tax revenues from the Clinton 1993 tax hike increased from $26.4 billion to $51.5 billion between FY 1994 and FY 1996.<sup>2</sup>  But the total increase in tax revenues from all sources decreased from $104.2 billion to $71.6 billion.  Most of the drop in the deficit from new revenues occurred before the new 1993 tax increases could be collected. The tax data suggest that Clinton's economic policies actually may have sapped the economic recovery and produced a deficit larger than it otherwise could have been.

CBO's September 1993 estimate of new tax revenues from Clinton's economic program might have been too large, but such an error would hardly be to the credit of the political leadership that pushed through the largest tax increase in history on a strictly party-line vote.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Heritage Foundation will soon release a report analyzing the impact of the Clinton Administration's tax and spending policies from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) on the nation's economic performance.  Using one of the nation's leading models of the U.S. economy, this study will examine how the economy would be performing today had the Clinton Administration and Congress not raised taxes as the U.S. was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.  This analysis will show that President Clinton's 1993 economic plan actually has deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the congressional budget process is notorious for missed deadlines, this fiscal year's effort to craft a budget for the federal government has set records for delay. At a time when both Congress and the President should be well along in developing a budget for FY 1997, they have yet to agree on spending for FY 1996. Nearly halfway through the current fiscal year, in other words, Congress and the White House must try to complete two budgets in a time frame that has proved inadequate for one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last year, the congressional budget process, with its complicated procedures, proved to be woefully ineffective in securing enactment of the ambitious agenda of the 104th Congress. But it did prove to be a highly effective weapon in the hands of a President determined to protect the status quo. Observers and participants concede a first-round victory to President Clinton, who has attempted to postpone the second round by arguing, along with some of his allies in Congress, that a national debate on last year's budget issues should be deferred until the upcoming presidential campaign, which should serve as a referendum on Congress's agenda.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should ignore this suggestion that it relinquish its constitutionally mandated fiscal responsibilities. Instead, it should rejoin the budget struggle with a strategy that takes advantage of the impressive legislative accomplishments of the first session and the original intentions of the congressional budget process. This means focusing more intensely on timely completion of the appropriations and authorization process, and any necessary enabling legislation, as the primary mechanisms for crafting and enacting the budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By doing this, Congress could divide its far-reaching agenda into functional components, debating each issue on its individual merits rather than as part of a larger package in which important reform issues are lost in controversy over out-year deficit targets. This approach also would allow Members to separate components of the budget that are controversial from those that are not, thereby limiting the President's ability to hold government hostage to his own political agenda. In addition, recognizing that Congress must complete both the FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets in a very limited period of time, Congress should adopt a biennial budget that embodies the key reforms developed during the last session. 

<p>
<b>A SIX-POINT PLAN FOR BUDGET VICTORY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following six point strategy would allow Congress both to adopt two-year budgets and to enact its reform agenda in the limited time available.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) </b>Adopt a biennial budget strategy during this session. This would allow Congress to complete both the FY 1996 and FY 1997 budgets, meet dual spending targets in those authorization and appropriation bills either vetoed or not yet signed by the President, and pass the legislation needed to change entitlements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2.)</b> Place greater reliance on individual authorization and appropriations bills and other necessary legislation, completed on schedule, as the primary vehicles for fiscal and legislative reform. This contrasts with the current strategy of depending on continuing resolutions or omnibus reconciliation bills. By constructing a budget using authorization and appropriation bills, and if necessary segmenting the 13 individual appropriations bills into an even greater number of functional accounts, Congress would focus the debate more sharply on the profound policy differences involved and prevent the President from using these disagreements to block reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>3.)</b> Build upon last year's considerable legislative accomplishments in such areas as welfare, Medicare and Medicaid reform, and discretionary programs. Last year, Congress enacted major reforms in several policy areas to improve the operation of federal programs. When folded together in giant budget bills, these accomplishments were blocked by President Clinton. These same bills should be split into separate bills. Along with existing but unsigned appropriations bills and related legislation, they should be amended to extend spending authority and program changes over a second year and sent separately to the President.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>4.)</b> Use the breathing room available under this budget strategy to remedy deficiencies in budget-related House and Senate bills either now being considered or already passed but not signed into law. Congress should use the current impasse as a second chance to reconsider its performance in such areas as transportation, housing, privatization, and devolution -- areas in which last year's authorization and appropriation bills often fell short of promised reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>5.)</b> Lawmakers must keep focusing on why they were elected -- to cut the budget and reform government. Talk of "CBO scoring" for "front-loaded glide paths," "growth from baseline," and "reconciliation" is the language of staff, not leadership. Americans want the budget cut because they know their hard-earned money is financing waste, redundancy, and obsolescence.  Lawmakers must take every opportunity to explain their programs and accomplishments in the same vivid terms that convinced voters to entrust them with the job.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>6.)</b> Adopt an appropriate division of labor within the leadership. This is needed to ensure that individual committee work products are timely and conform to overall congressional objectives. It is needed also to make sure that leadership is not so thinly spread over every issue. 
<p>
<b>The Need to be Better Prepared</b>
<p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Heady with success from passing key elements in the <a href="http://www.berkeleyic.com:80/conservative/contract.html">Contract With America</a> and adopting a balanced budget while fundamentally reforming welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare, Congress was caught unprepared by the President's veto strategy to defend the status quo. Congress relied too heavily on an omnibus reconciliation process and on comprehensive continuing resolutions as substitutes for a set of separate authorization and appropriations bills. Congress presented the President with an all-or nothing package covering so many significant issues that it was devoid of meaningful policy content. The President accepted the challenge by holding the government hostage, thereby allowing the news media to reduce the debate to sound-bite-friendly statements about Yellowstone sleigh rides and tickets to the Statue of Liberty. Lost was any serious discussion of the need to restore the viability of Medicare, reform the destructive welfare system, and boost the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The three-time failure to achieve success with the all-or-nothing strategy has left many in Congress demoralized and confused, with lawmakers assuming they can achieve little this year. But this need not be the case. A different approach to budget process could allow Congress to turn its impressive collection of legislative initiatives last year into law this year.
<p>
<b>Building on Last Year's Accomplishments</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The key to restarting the process is to recognize that the first session of the 104th Congress was remarkably successful in passing legislation that would fundamentally reform many of the government's most troubled programs. After decades of empty promises, it was this Congress that finally confronted the welfare and Medicaid mess, passed the necessary legislative remedies, and sent them to the President. Similarly, the financially collapsing Medicare program was overhauled to give seniors far more choices than any previous Congress or President had even considered. These reforms did not become law. The only reason: because President Clinton refused to sign them. Likewise, in many of the discretionary accounts, scores of wasteful and obsolete programs were terminated or cut back substantially, and some of these terminations were signed into law by the President.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This agenda should be pursued aggressively during the second session of the 104th Congress in a debate which sets out clearly the choices that must be made -- a focus lacking during the latter part of 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To do this, Congress should move immediately to construct a biennial budget resolution for the combined 1996 and 1997 fiscal years, using last year's resolution as the base and including whatever corrections might be needed to reflect spending, taxing, and economic patterns already underway. With this accomplished, Congress should move swiftly to complete the drafting (mostly by refining earlier bills) and passage of the authorization and appropriation bills and other legislation needed to turn the hundreds of decisions embodied in the budget resolution into law. Most of these authorization and appropriations bills, like the budget resolution, should cover at least two years.
<P>
<b>Speed Up the Process</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should stop using omnibus reconciliation bills and continuing resolutions as its primary vehicles in advancing fiscal and policy objectives. Instead, as intended by the Budget Act, it should rely on the timely completion of authorization and appropriations bills and other necessary legislation to implement spending decisions contained in the budget resolution. Under the Budget Act (as amended by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990), the House Appropriations Committee must report out all of its bills by June 10, and the House must complete action on them by June 30. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Last year, however, the House passed only two of 13 appropriations bills by the June 30 deadline. Eight more were passed in July, and the remainder in August and September. Similar delays occurred in the Senate, and the first appropriations bill was not sent to the President until eight days before the start of the new fiscal year. By the time the new fiscal year had begun, only two appropriations bills had been cleared for the President's signature. Legislation to reform major entitlements also was not completed until after the fiscal year began.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When passage of spending bills is delayed until after the start of the fiscal year, the need to avoid a government shutdown forces Congress to rely on a single omnibus reconciliation bill or comprehensive continuing resolution to enact its agenda. This, in turn, allows the President to hold the entire government hostage to his own plans and avoid an open debate on the issues.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the recent past, the reconciliation process and related legislation often were used as a substitute for the appropriations process, partly because it is easier to deal with a single omnibus bill than with 13 or more separate pieces of legislation. While this approach may work when Congress and the President are in general agreement on key issues, however, the process tends to exacerbate differences when they are not. Reliance on premature reconciliation bills also is a factor in keeping Congress from completing action on appropriations bills in advance of the relevant fiscal year, forcing it to pass continuing resolutions or some other form of omnibus legislation to keep government open while budgets await approval. Indeed, persistent delay in getting these bills completed before the start of the fiscal year was one of the many reasons Congress passed the Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974.
<P>
<b>Rely on the Appropriations and Authorization Process, As Improved and Intended</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By avoiding omnibus reconciliation bills and ambitious continuing resolutions, Congress places the burden of fiscal responsibility where it was intended to be placed and where it resided for nearly two centuries before enactment of the 1974 Budget Act:<sup>2</sup>  on the authorization and appropriations process. By relying on the timely completion of appropriations bills and necessary legislation within the schedule mandated by the Budget Act and avoiding dependence on a single bill to effect substantive policy and fiscal changes, Congress would follow more closely the original intent of the Act.3  But, as noted above, such bills seldom have been completed and signed into law by the start of the fiscal year. With just a month to go before reaching the mid-point of FY 1996, only eight of the 13 bills have been signed by the President, and the one covering the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services has not even been completed, thanks to a threatened Senate filibuster.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House and Senate leadership promise that this year's appropriation committee performance will be swift and timely. Such promises have been made at the start of every session in living memory, but with little result. This year, they actually could mean something. Paradoxically, one reason for optimism is that with so few of last year's appropriations bills and related legislation signed into law, subcommittees of the appropriations and authorizing committees need only rewrite and edit the bills that already have been completed, adding an additional year of spending so that they cover two years instead of just one.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To accelerate the process, out-year spending projections in the FY 1996 budget resolution could serve as a preliminary basis for the FY 1997 portions of the appropriations bills until the new FY 1996/FY 1997 budget resolution is passed on or before the April 15 deadline. This process also would include all of the authorization bills and companion legislation needed to accomplish fundamental reform of the entitlement programs. The bills covering Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform are just as necessary and as valid today as they were last year when rejected by the President as parts of a single omnibus bill or as separate pieces of legislation. They should be separated into individual bills, then modified as appropriate and resubmitted to the President in a process designed to draw clear distinctions between Congress's reforms and the President's embrace of the status quo.
<p>
<b>Conduct a National Debate on Separate Issues</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The main advantage of swiftly following the budget resolution with separate authorization and appropriations bills and legislation to alter entitlements is that Congress and the President then could conduct a clear debate in each policy area. When everything is lumped into a reconciliation bill or continuing resolution, issues of fundamental change, and the reasons for them, get lost in an angry debate over lines on a chart and out-year deficits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By separating the budget into 13 or more appropriations bills and any number of other bills needed to reform program operations, Congress can engage the President directly in a debate over differences in policy on a program-by-program basis and challenge the President more effectively in his defense of the status quo. Instead of creating an environment where the President can talk about hungry children while rejecting a reform of Medicare, separating bills into their functional components would permit Congress to compare what it wants to achieve through welfare reform with existing inner-city squalor in federally funded public housing projects. Further, separating bills in this way would allow lawmakers to talk about the reforms themselves, rather than about back-loaded baselines and seven-year CBO projections. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 This strategy would allow lawmakers to draw vivid and clear distinctions between abuses that exist and the reforms they know the nation both wants and needs. The successful strategy used in the House last January to pass comprehensive regulatory reform can serve as a model to involve the public in a debate that otherwise might become obtuse and technical. Medicare, Medicaid, federal job training programs, deplorable conditions in public housing projects, and obsolete agencies are just some of the costly targets of opportunity that should be brought to the attention of a public still eager for reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 In implementing this strategy, there is no reason why Congress has to limit itself to its traditional 13 appropriations bills. Without challenging any committee's current jurisdiction, appropriations bills could be subdivided more finely into functional areas that lead to clearer debates on policy differences, at the same time denying the President and a minority in Congress the opportunity to hold one program hostage to another. For example, the National Park Service, the Naval Petroleum Reserves, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, and any other programs likely to trigger intense debate could be brought forward as separate bills rather than as subsections of a single "Department of Interior and Related Agencies" bill. Likewise, the single appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, and State could be sliced easily into three or more components, while separate bills covering each of the major entitlement reform initiatives could be brought forward and debated on their merits.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Added to this agenda should be similarly comprehensive reform legislation for areas of government which last year were not subject to nearly the degree of reform that many of the social welfare programs and independent agencies experienced, leaving the majority in Congress vulnerable to charges, for example, of ignoring costly "corporate welfare" programs. Only limited changes were imposed on the troubled public housing industry or on the transportation, public power, and agriculture interests, to name just a few. These costly deficiencies should be remedied during the second session and within the combined FY 1996/FY 1997 resolution and related authorization/appropriations process.
<p>
<b>Managing the Process</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By promising to complete the appropriations/authorization process in a timely fashion, Congress has set for itself an ambitious goal -- one it has failed to fulfill during much of the recent past, including the last session of Congress when so much was at stake. Is Congress up to the task of performing this well?  It may be able to do so, but only if changes also are made in the management of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Specifically, the House and Senate leadership should stick with issues more appropriate to leaders and leave the complicated technical details to others. By defining duties and responsibilities more clearly, the leadership could take full advantage of the efficiencies that arise from an effective division of labor by organizing members into issue teams, drawn from the relevant committees, and assigning to these teams the responsibility of advancing each of the key policies. These teams would focus on such cross-cutting issues as welfare reform or the termination of wasteful programs, championing them in debate on behalf of the majority. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, because it has yet to complete its work on many of the appropriations bills and most of the entitlement reforms for the FY 1996 budget, Congress also will need to produce and defend a series of interim continuing resolutions to keep government operating, at the same time advancing whatever incremental reforms can be brought along for the ride. Perhaps another task force, drawn from the leadership and the budget, tax, and appropriations committees, could be formed to fulfill this duty while the leadership and key committee chairmen develop and implement a comprehensive biennial budget with promised reforms.

The practice of using reconciliation bills as the chief vehicle for change began in 1981 with the enactment of President Reagan's program for economic recovery, but has proven to be not very effective when there are major policy differences between Congress and executive branch.

<h3> A Personal Report from the Education Summit: What Does It Mean For Education Reform? </h3>
<b>By Denis P. Doyle<br> 
Senior Fellow in Education </b>
<p>
A Heritage Foundation Symposium, given May 21, 1996.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Allow me to share with you my impressions of the recent Education Summit, sponsored jointly by IBM and the nation's governors. As an invited guest representing The Heritage Foundation, I was impressed by the tone and temper of the meeting. There was a clear reaffirmation of the principle that the job of public education is a state and local task; it is not the job of the federal government. And while the governors and the representatives of corporate America have a direct interest in the best education of America's children, including real standards, tests, and results, the ultimate engine of reform is dedicated parents. They are most interested in their children's education. While school choice, the most vigorous and far-reaching education reform measure available to us, was not on the summit agenda, we all know that market-based reform like school choice enforces accountability to parents. It is the natural ally of high academic standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It was an extraordinary first. Forty-three governors encamped to the IBM Palisades, New York, conference center March 26 and 27, 1996, to talk about -- and act on-- education standards. A gathering of eagles, each governor was accompanied by a home-state CEO of his or her choosing. To round out the invitation list, IBM CEO Louis V. Gerstner and co-host Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson invited 30 education "resource people."  More than the usual suspects, the resource people were a motley crew of special-interest pleaders, state education leaders, foundation executives, think tank intellectuals, and policy analysts. Indeed, the most distinctive resource person was Secretary Riley, invited neither as a participant nor as a speaker. His silence spoke volumes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Governor Thompson and CEO Gerstner jointly presided over the two-day meeting, and were joined at the head table by a bipartisan steering committee made up of Governors Terry Branstad (R-IA), John Engler (R-MI), Jim Hunt (D-NC), incoming NGA head Bob Miller (D-NV), and Roy Romer (D-CO). CEOs Robert E. Allen (AT&T), John L. Clendenin (BellSouth Corporation), George Fisher (Kodak), John Pepper (P&G), and Frank Shrontz (Boeing) shared the spotlight.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the meeting's larger purpose was to reinvigorate the standards movement and highlight education technology, its real function was to solemnize the fact that the federal role in education is virtually at an end. Governor Thompson made one thing crystal clear in his opening remarks: The meeting was addressing a problem that was national in scope but that did not call for a federal government solution. The governors and CEOs could handle it themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b> HAIL TO THE CHIEF</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The harmonious picture was completed when President Clinton addressed the group just before lunch on Wednesday, the second day of the conference. Even seasoned Washington watchers were impressed by the security; in addition to the usual complement of Secret Service agents and countless members of the New York highway patrol, each governor was accompanied by a phalanx of plainclothes officers. There were many more people with earpieces and distinctive lapel pins than there were participants.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the putative purpose of the meeting was to get the education standards train back on track, the first afternoon's plenary session was followed by small group meetings with no press present, chaired jointly by a governor and a CEO; resource people were present but largely seen, not heard. Cocktails and dinner were followed by a six-person panel featuring Al Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT); Governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina; Chester Finn and Lynn Cheney, conservative appointees and education specialists in the Reagan and Bush Administrations; and Governors John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. The next morning, small groups of governors, CEOs, and resource people were moved at a forced march through more than a dozen technology exhibits (ten minutes per exhibit). The technology exhibits were carefully scripted and were a great success, not least because of a striking example of enlightened despotism: The majority of the technology displays were running on Apple software. Moreover, the CEO of Apple was at the summit as the guest of the governor of North Dakota.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>PRIVATE INITIATIVE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two things stand out. First, the original idea was Lou Gerstner's. As Chief Executive Officer of IBM, he has had a long-standing interest in education. It was not a government conclave, and it certainly was not a typical business meeting. One of the nation's most vigorous business leaders, Gerstner gained the confidence of Tommy Thompson (concurrently the head of National Governors' Association and Education Commission of the States, the first governor to chair both organizations since Bill Clinton) and Roy Romer, Governor of Colorado and as liberal as Thompson is conservative. While no summit could escape political overtones, this one was neither politically conceived nor politically motivated. It achieved a status often talked about but only infrequently realized: It was bipartisan. (The issue of school choice was not on the table; had it been, the bipartisan aura would have evaporated quickly, as a brief public colloquy between Governors George Allen of Virginia and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin revealed as the summit was wrapping up. Even more was apparently said in private.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Limiting the agenda to issues about which bipartisan agreement could be achieved was no small feat. Indeed, two years ago, when the 103rd Congress was still sitting, there could not have been widespread agreement about standards. That such agreement is emerging is a commentary on the temper of the times. And while Gerstner is a political animal within the corporate world, he does not approach education as a political issue. It was his insight to take the issue to the governors. Gerstner is no newcomer to the issue; he has been worried about the quality of the nation's schools for a very long time. I know about his interest first hand as the co-author of a book with him (and two other colleagues) several years ago: <i>Reinventing Education: Entrepreneurship in America's Public Schools </i> (New York, E. P. Dutton). Among other things, it tells the story of the RJR Nabisco Foundation's Next Century Schools program, in which Gerstner oversaw the investment of $32 million in 43 schools across the country -- not an insignificant amount, even by Washington standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interestingly, governors, highly political in their own states, are strikingly nonpartisan with each other. They are as courtly with other governors as members of the U.S. Senate are with colleagues; but unlike Senators, their show of bipartisanship is real. In part this is because they do not see other governors as competitors. They have much in common and much to learn from each other, and they know it. They genuinely enjoy each other's company as well, which is one of the reasons they gave former Governor Clinton such a warm welcome; regardless of party affiliation, he's a member of the tribe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton, for his part, gave a speech calculated to please--as it did--and demonstrated that what he is ideally suited to be is "governor" of the United States. The President, as many know, can charm the birds out of the trees. And if he believes what he says--or if he acts as though he does--American education could be in for a big change. This is always a challenge for those of us who tend to be skeptical of the President's diplomatic relations between his language and his actions. In his 1996 State of the Union speech, Clinton had proclaimed that the era of big government was at an end. From his federal budget submissions, however, this is not at all clear to the rest of us. In his Palisades education policy speech, he repeated that promise. Not surprisingly, like much of his State of the Union Address, it was a speech 95 percent of which any Republican could have delivered with complete conviction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The high points were few and memorable. Clinton opened with the claim that what matters in education is effort. Not talent or IQ or luck; effort. How quaint. And how on the mark. Nothing is more patronizing--or damaging--to poor or minority children than to tell them that nothing they do matters, that whatever might happen to them is the luck of the socioeconomic draw. About this point the President is right. He went on to say that standards are essential, just as state-developed assessments are. The pivotal point, however, was his use of the word "consequences."  Only one other public figure regularly uses that word, AFT President Al Shanker, and it is no accident that he has been heavily lobbying the President and his senior staff about this issue for months. Clinton gave "consequences" operational significance when he attached a liberal sacred cow: social promotion. No more, he intoned. Right again.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
C-SPAN carried the full proceedings of the summit. President Clinton mentioned that he had watched the panel discussion from the comfort of the White House. His folksy references to panelists' comments--particularly Al Shanker's--offered another striking example of his command of the subject of his speech.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton closed with a paean about discipline: No one can teach or learn in an undisciplined and unsafe environment. As Checker Finn noted, it was a speech which Ronald Reagan could have given. There was not a single reference to the federal government, no talk about federal standards, and nary a word about Goals 2000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what was true of Clinton's comments was true of the governors and CEOs. The idea that standards are a state and local issue was supported unanimously, or at least with no public dissent. In the case of governors like Jim Hunt and Roy Romer, their willingness to go along may be simple political prudence. They know that the federal role will soon be <i>de minimis</i>, and they are reconciled to this new reality. They might wish that it were otherwise but made no public complaint or statement to that effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>NEW, NEW FEDERALISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For my part, I am convinced that whatever their private reservations or reluctance might be now, they will grow to like their new role. Governors actually enjoy governing, and education is typically the biggest single item in their budgets. While they know that freedom from Washington will have a price (federal spending reductions), they are likely to find that life is both simpler and more interesting without Uncle Sam looking over their shoulders.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Presidents from Nixon to Clinton, of course, have flirted with the idea of "new federalism."  Indeed, it is a Nixon coinage, but has made little substantive headway over the years. It is one of those ideas that is good in principle but very difficult to put into practice. Part of the problem is the sheer weight of habit, part is fear of the unknown, part is the heavy lifting required to change the contours of massive programs. Changing what Washington does is hard work, just as changing what the states do is.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The creation of the U.S. Department of Education in 1978 by Jimmy Carter is a case in point; it was a major Democratic campaign promise to the NEA, but Carter could barely marshal the votes to get the bill out of the House of Representatives. It was a "ho-hum" issue in Congress, eliciting only weak support and unenthusiastic opposition. Undoing the department falls in the same category, as President Reagan discovered to his chagrin: He couldn't find an author to carry his promised legislation to abolish the department in his first term in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In any case, the real strength of "new federalism" will depend precisely on the extent to which its practitioners prefer it to the old federalism. And the assembled governors gave every indication that they will actually welcome it. Time will tell.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A second noteworthy point is that the summit was not dominated by the otherwise ubiquitous special interests. True, many of the resource people were members of the special-interest crowd; the AFT's Al Shanker and NEA President Keith Geiger were both there, but they were among a silent throng at the back of the hall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In an era overwhelmingly dominated by politics--indeed, in an era in which "politics" has become a dirty word -- it is hard to overestimate the importance of the simple fact that the summit was the product of private, not public, interest. That may account for the relative isolation of the special-interest groups at the summit itself. Ironically, there was concern in some conservative circles that the summit was no more than a new generation of "robber barons" working their will on a malleable and hapless populace. Perhaps, but a more realistic analysis is to take Gerstner of IBM and his fellow CEOs at face value. They are genuinely worried about the future of America and are convinced that, left to their own devices, schools will not spontaneously reform. If not CEO pressure, then whose?  If not now, when?  To suspect them of sinister motives is a bit much, particularly when their professed motives are manifestly reasonable. Parents, whose children have the most to lose in a failing educational system, need their help and should enlist them as allies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fact is that CEOs are interested parties, not parties-at-interest, and they come as close to being disinterested as any reformers can. They are the ultimate consumers of the schools' product and have a real stake in school performance. Equally important, they don't want problems; they want solutions and have no desire to tell anyone how to do it or what to do. They just want results. The CEO point of view is captured in David Kearns's comment when he was head of Xerox before joining the U.S. Department of Education as former Secretary Lamar Alexander's Deputy Secretary: "If the schools educate, business will train."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MANY A SLIP BETWIXT CUP AND LIP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is the ostensible and what is the likely outcome of the summit?  In this case, they are likely to be the same. There is actually reason to believe that something will happen as a result of the summit. No one in America is more results-oriented than CEOs; they are serious, and about this they mean business. The governors too; they are now in it so deep that it would be hard to pull back. Indeed, the issue is not withdrawing, but just what it is they will do and when they will do it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The communiqu produced by the summit was reasonably clear about the next step: the creation by the governors of a national--not federal--clearinghouse (or "war room," as Governor Thompson called it) that would be going full-bore within two years. Designed to serve the states, it would keep everyone up to date on standards, but its more important function would be to set the stage for meaningful comparisons among states. Then we -- and the governors--would know who is "world-class" and who is not. Discussions about the clearinghouse have already begun; to be sure, there are numerous practical decisions to be made, not least who will pay for it and will "it" be a new or existing organization?  While logic would suggest that an existing organization should assume that role, candidates are not so obvious as they might at first appear.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most logical is the Education Commission of the States (ECS), created three decades ago by then North Carolina Governor Terry Sanford and James Bryant Conant, former Harvard president and author of <i>The American High School Today</i>. ECS's mission was to keep Washington at bay, a task at which, to no one's surprise, it failed utterly. A sort of <i>estates general</i>, its membership included governors, chief state school officers, state legislators, and sundry interested citizens. ECS quickly became a part of the establishment and today is a flaccid institution. If ECS was too broadly conceived to maintain any focus, the National Governors' Association (NGA) suffers from the opposite problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In any case, the summiteers seemed to have no interest in passing the standards baton to either ECS or NGA. In the closing comments at least, the governors asserted their interest in a wholly new organization, one that would exist for the sole purpose of promulgating standards and comparisons. Time will tell.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the communiqu did not call for a state "wall chart," it is hard to imagine state comparisons without one, and we may soon witness states actually participating in comparisons, the one with the other.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>THE DOG THAT DIDN'T BARK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What was missing at the summit?  Ironically, two points of view were virtually absent. One is the national (not federal) perspective that Diane Ravitch, a sensible conservative reformer, ably represents. In her post-summit wrap-up, she laments the absence of this view. Who needs fifty sets of standards?  Diane asks. Who indeed?  For better or worse, it is my strongly held view that we do need state, even local, standards and that the issue of "fifty standards" is moot. We will not have Nevada math and Maryland math, Oregon English and Florida English; Americans in each state and locality will quite naturally gravitate to similar standards, and insofar as differences may emerge, they will probably emerge for good reason.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real danger of national (not federal) or state (not local) standards is that they will be forced to a lowest common denominator by political pressures. True, the absence of national or state standards would permit lackadaisical school districts to continue in their feckless manner, but the presence of high standards in neighboring districts will have a salutary effect. It may put some starch in slackers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Be that as it may, the most important point of view not represented at the summit (except in a brief reference by Lynn Cheney) was old-fashioned localism or, as it is characterized in education circles, local control. That governors and CEOs would not be naturally drawn to this point of view is no surprise; modern CEOs are as likely to think in global as local terms, and governors by virtue of their jobs, think in statewide terms. This is not to say that either is opposed to local control, just that the terms of the discussion were cast as state-level concerns.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, there is a powerful statewide dimension; in all the states, education is a state constitutional responsibility, and education typically consumes more than half the state budget. Only in a few outliers like New Hampshire is the state role tiny; less than ten percent of New Hampshire's education spending comes from state sources. At the other end of the scale is Hawaii, the nation's only statewide school system (though, thanks to the interaction effects between Proposition 13 and the <i>Serrano</i> school finance case, California is virtually a statewide system). Even in these situations, however, education is quintessentially a school-based (even schoolroom-based) enterprise, and the role of the state in standard setting should be approached with the utmost circumspection. The obvious danger is standardization, a fate to be avoided at all costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts and school buildings must be on the front lines of standard setting for several reasons, not least because they must live with them. Governors, chief state school officers, and state legislators have an understandable interest in setting standards, but they should resist the temptation to impose them on school districts. Standards cannot be parachuted in; schools must "own" them if they are to have any lasting effect. Equally important, the process of setting standards at the local level is a powerful trainer and community builder. If teachers and parents are involved in setting standards from the beginning, they both learn about them and support them. Knowing what they are and how they are to be put in place lends reality to the idea that standards will have consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most powerful and useful role for the state will be in developing standards "advisories": model standards, templates even, for local school districts to use as they engage in the standard setting process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The logic of local standard setting is not "let a thousand flowers bloom," though there will be some of that. The logic is ownership, because as each community works through the standard setting process, each community's standards will be substantially like each other's. So too, each state's set of "advisories" will be like every other's. There are two reasons for this. First, there exists among Americans a high degree of social consensus about what young people should know and be able to do. For example, most Americans would agree that to earn a diploma, all students should be able to read and understand a news story in a national news magazine, a national newspaper, and their local paper. They should be able to count and compute; understand plane geometry and algebra; read, write, and speak standard American English; and so on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There will be differences, to be sure. The citizens of Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example, may want their graduates to know solid geometry and trigonometry, not just algebra. The citizens of Seattle, Washington, may want their graduates to master marine biology and vulcanology, while their counterparts in Arizona may be more interested in desert ecosystems. Citizens in Texas will want graduates to know Texas history and geography to a level of detail that other communities will not. And so on. So much the better. This is not a difference to be ignored or suppressed, but one that should be applauded.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, even insofar as there are regional differences in subjects like history and literature, the foundations are much the same. A high standard requiring mastery of historical material and methodology can be satisfied using very different content. The study of literature is made richer and more rewarding by attending to local writers. So too with science standards. It would be altogether sensible for each area of the country to emphasize its strengths; Arizonans might master the scientific method and meet high science standards by emphasizing Canyon geology and water erosion, just as residents around the Great Lakes might emphasize the impact of glaciation. Finally, there is no California algebra or Illinois chemistry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>TEACHING TO THE TEST</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the assessment and consequences parts of the standards agenda are attended to with enthusiasm, the issue of who sets the standards is less important than who asks the test questions. Ultimately, that is what standards are all about. If the tests and measures are carefully crafted and calibrated, they will do a world of good, for the assessments actually set the standard. Indeed, that is what the old bromide about "teaching to the test" is all about: If it is a bad test, so much the worse; if it is a good test, so much the better. One way to think about it is this: The test is the interrogatory form of the standard; the statement of the standard is the declarative form. What this means in practice is that the test must be a solid instrument, because many people--employers, school board members, taxpayers, students, teachers--will come to rely on it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The questions must seek and measure "world-class" knowledge and skills, and they must do so in a world-class way. Which is to say, the tests must de-emphasize the true-and-false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blanks format. The only reason for such a format is low-cost, high-speed scoring -- administrative convenience. It is noteworthy that adults are not tested this way in the real world. The tests we must meet are performance-based: Do we measure up?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Schools--and the institutions that test them and their students--will need to reintroduce the written and spoken word: essays, declamations, auditions, performances. Again, that is how we are measured after school. School measures should be no different.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>BENCHMARKING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The issue of assessment raises the most important aspect of standards--seeing that they are met, holding people accountable. To do this sensibly requires tests and measures that are reliable. Put simply, standards and the tests used to measure them must permit comparisons, both among schools in a district and among districts in a state as well as among schools in different states and between states. Governors must be able to boast (or complain) about their states' academic standings as readily as they do state university football scores. Without the capacity to compare each other with some precision, the whole standard setting exercise will be worse than moot; it will be an exercise in futility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interestingly, the German Republic provides an example of this in action. A federal system, the German states, or <i>Lnder</i>, are entirely free of federal control, and federal funding as well. Like their American counterparts, who have a Council of Chief State School Officers housed in Washington, D.C., the Germans have a similar council housed in Bonn (soon to move to Berlin). But there the similarity ends. The German council meets and confers to keep the national government at arm's length; they will not tolerate national intrusion in <i>Land</i> affairs. At the same time, the German council members use their forum to compare themselves to each other, which they do with gusto. America's governors can--and should-- take a page from the German book. At the turn of the old century, we borrowed <i>kindergarten</i> from the Germans; as the new century approaches, it is time for another learned borrowing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What remains is for the governors to push hard on the assessment front. Their task, difficult but within reach, is to see that state assessments permit both intrastate and interstate comparisons. Without the capacity to do so, standard setting will be for naught. Ironically, the place for them to turn is the federal government and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Overseen by the National Assessment Governing Board, the operation has gained the respect of most observers of the passing scene. It has been genuinely bipartisan, and its members have acted responsibly and prudently. The NAEP is almost all we have to go on as a nation, and it would be wise both to strengthen it--for national-level data and analysis--and to permit states and school districts to tap into the data stream so they can learn more about themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, that is the crux of the matter: When schools and school districts want to learn more about themselves, when they actively want to know how they compare where they are strong as well as weak, then the momentum for change will grow. Whether or not the summit will ignite that spark remains to be seen.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GRASSROOTS REFORMERS?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the final analysis, the summit was wonderful theater, but the heavy lifting of school reform remains to be done. Who will do it and where will the work be carried out?  It will be accomplished school-by-school, district-by-district, by involved citizens. They will make it happen. To be involved, they must know what is going on and what needs to be done. First, citizens across the country should welcome CEO and gubernatorial interest; it is genuine and may even be useful. Certainly, governors like Thompson, Romer, and Engler, who were central to the summit planning process, are serious about reform. So too were the CEOs. And while their perspectives will differ to some degree, all will respond to citizen interest and activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are three things that should happen at the grass roots, then. Citizens everywhere should take the pledge to support:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
High academic standards;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Realistic tests and measures to see that students are meeting those standards; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What does this mean in practice?  Standards must be set and met locally. The state is not much better than Uncle Sam when it comes to local control. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty as regards both the state and federal governments. To be sure, states can play a more constructive role than Washington, but they should not engage in a command-and-control relationship with local school districts. It is not only bad politics; it is worse pedagogy. The freer schools are to do their own thing, the better off they are. Standards templates, or advisories, can be designed at the state level and made available to local districts but should not be imposed on them. If the standards are realistic and useful, local districts will flock to them. If they are not, they will not. And properly so. So too with tests and measures. To see that the standards are met, school districts must adopt tests that fit their standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this connection, there are two interlocking issues. Local districts should adopt tests that are consistent with the standards they have adopted. Not every district will want to (or be able to) design and adopt tests unique to it. In this case, the state can offer technical assistance and advice but should not impose its will on local districts. Again, to do so would be bad politics and worse pedagogy. The state does, however, have a reasonable and proper interest in knowing how much its students know, and should support statewide testing to provide both state and district information. Such tests should be developed cooperatively with local schools, but should permit the governor to brag about the state's overall performance. Without such information, the cause of school reform will falter and eventually founder. And the information--once it is available -- will be invaluable to local schools. If anything, they need it more than the state does. No business could do without high-quality performance data, and schools are no exception to this general rule.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is one final note that everyone must attend to, and that is the one issue that was not on the table at the summit: <i>education choice</i>. Its absence was duly noted by several governors in attendance, but the ground rules made it impossible to bring it up. No such ground rule works at the local level. Bring choice up, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is crucial to the standards debate. Indeed, without choice the standards debate is almost sure to become an empty exercise. There is simply no reason to believe that every school in every district in every state will hold itself to the same high standards; it can't be done politically, and it can't be done logistically, at least not in the next two decades. Only highly centralized school systems like those of France and Japan even attempt such an approach, and it is not clear that it works in those countries. And the American commitment to local control rules out any centralized solution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>THE BLESSINGS OF THE MARKET</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The alternative to command and control is a market, whether it is purely private, as many of us would like it to be, or regulated, a mix of public and private providers. Markets have two overwhelmingly important characteristics. First, they are exquisitely calibrated communications systems, letting willing buyers and sellers know what good or service is available at what price in what quantity and quality, and letting each know what the other would like; second, as Schumpeter declared, they permit "creative destruction."  Inefficient, corrupt, and ineffectual organizations disappear. That's what markets are all about. That is why in a market the consumer is sovereign. That is why cost doesn't determine price.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To create a system of high academic standards, and schools which are safe and disciplined, there must be choice among schools. Schools themselves must be able to choose to have high standards and to deliver on them. Just so, parents and students must be able to select schools that measure up and select out of those that do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Attempting to push standards down from the top will not work any better than the endless skein of failed reforms that already litter the education landscape. But double-joining standards and choice can work. Indeed, it is the last, best hope of school reform.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	School superintendent Thomas J. Doluisio was puzzled. His Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, district had an elaborate program of Spanish-language classes for its large population of Spanish-speaking children. Proponents of bilingual education said this would help Hispanic children adjust when they moved on to English-only classes -- which they were supposed to do after three years. But it wasn't working. Hispanic students lagged behind their peers in test scores, reading levels, and graduation rates. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Our college-track courses were lily-white," Doluisio says. "Our remedial classes were filled with Puerto Rican kids. And the ability to speak English explained most of the difference." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What went wrong? <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Doluisio found out in a 1992 meeting with his district's elementary-school principals. The short answer: seven years. That's how long it was taking a typical student in the bilingual program to move into regular classes taught in English. Bethlehem had effectively established an English-second policy, thanks to educators who considered native-language training of primary importance. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"I was flabbergasted," Doluisio says. More than that, he was angry. And then he got busy. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Within a year, Doluisio led a stunning transformation of Bethlehem's language policy. His district became one of a handful in the country to reverse course on bilingual education. Today, Bethlehem's Spanish-speaking students are immersed in English-speaking classrooms, where they hear almost nothing but English. The school district switched policies only after a bitter struggle had divided the community along racial and ethnic lines. But thanks to Doluisio's leadership, the benefits of English immersion are starting to show, and the naysayers are starting to change their minds. Today, Bethlehem provides a stirring example of how other school districts can challenge the bilingual-education orthodoxy -- and win. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since 1968, the federal government has spent nearly $4 billion on bilingual education. In 1995 alone, it spent $206 million. (President Clinton wanted to increase the annual appropriation to $300 million, but was halted by the budget crunch and House Republicans.) But federal money has been less important than federal power to the consolidation of bilingual education. During the 1970s and 1980s, bureaucrats in the U.S. Department of Education coerced hundreds of school districts around the country into adopting native-language instruction for their non-English-speaking students. They based their tactics on a 1974 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right for non-English-speaking children to receive some sort of special language assistance. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Court did not prescribe a particular pedagogical approach, but its federal enforcers did. Through a confusing array of regulations, court orders, and consent decrees, they insisted that school districts provide a curriculum with a heavy emphasis on the students' native tongues. In this political climate, Bethlehem's program was born. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Bethlehem Area School District, serving 13,000 children, is Pennsylvania's fifth-largest. About 10 percent of its students cannot speak English well, and of these, 86 percent speak Spanish in their homes. Most of these children are Puerto Rican, but immigrants from Central and South America make up a growing part of the Spanish-speaking population.  <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Before the 1993-94 school year, Bethlehem was fully committed to bilingual education and its goal of teaching students in their native language before they moved into regular classrooms. English-speakers and immigrant children who didn't speak Spanish attended their neighborhood schools. But the school district essentially segregated its Spanish-speaking students, busing them to two elementary schools. There was little time for English at these segregated schools. Spanish was the language of the classroom, the lunchroom, and the playground. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most bilingual educators say that native-language instruction is the surest road to English fluency, since it makes for an easier transition. But Doluisio believes this defies common sense. "You can't teach kids how to swim by giving them a lecture at the side of the pool," he says. "They've got to get wet, and maybe even take in a little bit of water. Our job as educators is to keep them afloat, to make sure they don't go under." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After learning about bilingual education's dismal exit rates in Bethlehem, Doluisio began to investigate the program more intently. He quickly uncovered more outrages. "There were kindergartners -- five-year-olds who were at the perfect age to start learning a new language -- who did not hear a single word of English all day long," says Doluisio. "I probably should have known that this sort of thing was going on, but nobody told me. I had to discover it for myself." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The more he learned, the less he liked. "I really believe in my heart that we were hurting these kids," he says. "I started to see a connection between bilingual education and Latino dropout rates. Not a total connection, to be sure. But definitely a connection." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As soon as Doluisio decided that bilingual education was a problem, he set out to find a solution. He asked the district's bilingual-education director to assemble a committee to study the issue. But the majority of its members were advocates of the status quo. When it reported back to the school board in the fall of 1992, the committee said that the bilingual program was healthy and even suggested expanding it. Doluisio flew into a rage. "For the first time in my career, I rejected a report that had come out of my own administration," he says. 	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The superintendent launched a personal crusade against complacency. He studied the literature on bilingual education carefully. "I soon learned that in this field you can find research to back up just about any political point you want to make," he says, "especially if you support bilingual education." But some of the scholarship raised significant doubts.  <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Rosalie Pedalino Porter's scathing expose, <I>Forked Tongue: The Politics of Bilingual Education</I> (1990), particularly influenced him. In this book, Porter draws upon her 15 years of experience as a bilingual-education teacher and administrator in Massachusetts. "I came to feel that I was going about things the wrong way around, as if I were deliberately holding back the learning of English," she writes. Porter is a strong proponent of "time on task," the idea that the amount of time spent learning something is the best predictor of educational achievement. In other words, students must practice English constantly if they are to learn it well. "Nothing in my 15 years in this field -- from first-hand classroom experience to concentrated research -- has begun to convince me that delaying instruction in English for several years will lead to <I>better</I> learning of English and to a greater ability to study subject matter taught in English," writes Porter, who now heads the READ Institute in Amherst, Massachusetts. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Doluisio examined this and other research, and decided that Bethlehem's language policy needed a complete overhaul. He convinced the school board to schedule a series of public meetings devoted to bilingual education  -- and to discuss its possible repeal. Community interest was so great that the board had to hold its gatherings in the Liberty High School auditorium, the district's largest. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The issue immediately split along ethnic lines. Many Latino parents felt that the removal of bilingual education would jeopardize their children's education. Some of Doluisio's supporters undercut him when they stepped up to the microphone and made derogatory comments about Puerto Ricans. "These meetings were very heated," Doluisio recalls. "They were very emotional. I had to have cops in the back of the room to make sure that there was no trouble." At one point, a group of Latino activists physically surrounded the school board and, led by a priest from out of town, engaged in a prayer to save Bethlehem's bilingual-education program. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Pennsylvania Department of Education also frowned on Doluisio's efforts. Myrna Delgado, the state's bilingual-education coordinator, urged the school board to vote against the superintendent. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The rancor of the hearings weighed heavily on Doluisio, especially the ugly way in which race and ethnicity intruded. It appeared that all the Latinos were on one side, all the Anglos on the other. "This was an extremely unpleasant time for me, and for everybody," says Doluisio. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	About midway through the controversy, however, a group of sympathetic Hispanic parents contacted him. They were professionals, led by Luis A. Ramos of Pennsylvania Power and Light. "We hoped to make it clear that Latinos want their children to learn English, and that the superintendent was heading in the right direction," says Ramos, whose two children have attended Bethlehem schools. "Their support really gave me the courage to forge ahead," says Doluisio. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In February 1993, the school board voted to abolish bilingual education and adopt a district-wide plan for English immersion. The board clearly stated its goal that "all language-minority students in the district become fluent in the English language in the shortest amount of time possible to maximize their opportunity to succeed in school." All students, including Spanish-speaking children, would attend neighborhood schools, and students who required special help would receive instruction in English as a Second Language (ESL) several times a week. Spanish-speaking kids would spend the bulk of their time in regular classrooms listening to teachers who, in most cases, spoke virtually no Spanish. "It was our belief that if the Chinese and Russian kids could do well in a regular classroom without bilingual education, then so could the Spanish-speakers," says Rebecca Bartholomew, the principal of Lincoln Elementary. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Lincoln was one of several schools that suddenly had to confront a sizable population of students who did not speak English very well. The school board insisted that the immersion program be in place by the following September, leaving just seven months to implement a completely new plan for teaching children with limited English skills. The move upset bilingual teachers, who believed wholeheartedly in the theory of native-language maintenance. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But immersion met with resistance from non-bilingual teachers as well. They were accustomed to dealing with children who would understand their most basic instructions. "In the first week of the new program, we had homeroom teachers who would tell their class to line up, and half the class wouldn't understand," says Ann Goldberg, who runs the immersion program for Bethlehem. "It was really tough going at first." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"A lot of regular classroom teachers felt really incompetent, since the switch to immersion was so rapid and so complete," said Carole Schachter, an ESL teacher who had previously taught in the bilingual program. "They could barely communicate with many of their students," she said. A number of teachers remain critical of the switch and of Doluisio, but they prefer anonymity. The school district will publish its first academic evaluation of the program this summer, and the results are sure to be watched closely by educators both inside and outside of Bethlehem. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Hispanic parents are gradually beginning to approve of the new policy. One who likes the switch to English immersion is Margarita Rivas. A native of Puerto Rico, she was concerned at first that her four children would not succeed in school if they did not hear much Spanish. But then she changed her mind. "It's very important that they know how to speak English well in this country," she says. "Now they speak English better than Spanish, and they are helping me and my husband improve our English." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After the immersion program had been in place for one year, Bethlehem surveyed the parents of its Spanish-speaking students. The forms went out in two languages, since many of the parents speak no English. The results were remarkably positive. Eighty-one percent of the respondents said that their children had "progressed well academically" in the English-immersion setting. Only 7 percent said that they "did not make progress." Another 82 percent rated the new program as "good" or "very good," 12 percent called it "adequate" or "satisfactory," and only 1 percent deemed it "poor." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The approval ratings appear to remain high today. "My daughter is getting a good education here," Sayda Castaneda, an immigrant from Honduras, says through a translator. "I don't want my daughter to forget her first language, but English is spoken in the United States." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The teachers have started to come around as well. "I was against immersion in the beginning, but I'm not nearly as critical now," says Jean Walker, a 4th-grade teacher who has taught in Bethlehem schools for 24 years. "I didn't think I'd be able to communicate, but these kids learned English faster than I thought they would. I like immersion now. It's not perfect, but I like it," she says. A survey shows that Walker is not alone -- 62 percent of Bethlehem teachers say that students were making "substantial progress" in learning English after being in the program for one year. Only 13 percent said students made "little" or "no" progress. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Rita Hatton, a Cuban-born teacher with 20 years' experience in Bethlehem, still has some reservations about immersion. A veteran of the bilingual program and now an ESL teacher at Freemansburg Elementary, she worries that her children will lose their Spanish fluency. But she also sees rapid gains among her students learning English. "At the start of the school year, some of them only spoke two or three words of English," she says. "Now they can speak it, read it, and write it pretty well." In fact, English is by far the predominant language in her classroom. Donna West, an ESL teacher, came to Bethlehem after it adopted the immersion program, but she had taught previously for six years in a Brownsville, Texas, bilingual program. "I like the immersion model much better," she says. "In Brownsville, the kids simply weren't becoming proficient in English. They started a lot of kids in Spanish, but they need English when they're young." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Doluisio was officially condemned at the 1994 convention of the National Association for Bilingual Education. His detractors accuse him of being driven by politics, even of riding a tide of anti-immigrant sentiment. He says his goal is to help immigrants succeed by raising expectations for their performance. "For years we expected our Latino kids to learn differently. We didn't think they could cut it in mainstream classes with the native English speakers or the kids from Asia or Poland," says Doluisio. "The results were like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Today we're saying that Latino kids are just as capable as any other group of students." <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

America's students still are not performing at a satisfactory level, and Americans are not getting a solid return on the investment of their tax dollars in the nation's schools, according to the latest assessment of achievement. After 15 years and $328 billion in federal spending, the U.S. <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a> is contributing little, if anything at all, to student success in reading.<sup>1</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The recently released findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) final 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States show most of America's students are not meeting a proficient achievement level in reading.<sup>2</sup>  The 1994 NAEP reading examination is the nation's report card in reading. The 1994 test was administered to nearly 140,000 students in public and private schools nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NAEP report reveals student reading and comprehension achievement levels in grades 4, 8, and 12 between 1992 and 1994, as well as achievement levels within various subgroups of the student population. The report uses three achievement levels to rank the results: basic, proficient, and advanced.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While 4th and 8th grade students showed slight declines in performance, there was a significant decline in the reading performance of students in grade 12 (see <a href="fyi94c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Between 1992 and 1994, notes the report:
<p><ul>
<li> There was a significant decline in the proportion of twelfth graders <I>at or above</I> the proficient level;<p>
<li> There was also a significant decline in the proportion of twelfth graders <I>at or above</I> the basic level; and<p>
<li> There was a significant increase in the percentage of twelfth graders performing <I>below</I> the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regionally, the results were equally discouraging. According to the report:
<p><ul>
<li> Every region (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West) had significant declines in the number of twelfth grade students achieving <I>at or above</I> the proficient level; and<p>
<li> Every region had an increase in the number of twelfth grade students achieving <I>below</I> the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1994 NAEP final report also accounted for the reading performance of six population subgroups: white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian.<sup>4</sup>  Consistent with previous NAEP reports, there were large differences in performance by race and ethnic subgroups (see <a href="fyi94c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). In nearly every ethnic and racial subgroup there were significant declines in reading performance. While there were significant decreases in the reading performance levels for white, black and Hispanic twelfth grade students, white students had the largest decreases. Fewer white twelfth graders in 1994 achieved at least <I>the basic level of reading performance</I> than achieved that level in 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Breaking down student performance by gender, the 1994 NAEP results show that female students generally outperformed male students in all three grade levels (see <a href="fyi94c4.gif">Chart 4</a>). According to the report: 
<p><ul>
<li> Between 1992 and 1994, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of twelfth grade males <I>at or above</I> both the proficient and basic levels. There was also a significant decrease in the percentage of twelfth grade females <I>at or above</I> the basic level. There was also a significant increase in the number of male and female twelfth graders who performed at or below the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps the most discouraging results are the differences in the performance levels between poor students participating in the Title I program, the Federal Education for the Disadvantaged program "(formerly called Chapter One)," and non-Title I participating students (see <a href="fyi94c5.gif">Chart 5</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Although there were no corresponding data on Title I participation for 1992, the 1994 results show that the low-income students enrolled in the Title I program are being left behind the rest of America's students. According to the report:
<p><ul>
<li> Across all three grade levels, of those students participating in the Title I program, there were significantly fewer students performing <I>at or above each of the reading achievement levels.</I> 
<p>
<li> Of all students performing <I>at the below basic level</I>, Title I students are performing below the basic level at a larger proportion than non-Title I students. The percentages of Title I students who performed <I>below basic</I> ranged from 59 percent at twelfth grade to 80 percent at fourth grade.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Clinton's Secretary of Education, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/04-1995/naepwrd.html">Richard W. Riley</a>, argues that congressional efforts to dismantle the existing federal bureaucracy and channel funds back to the states, localities, teachers and parents would set back efforts to improve education.<sup>6</sup>  The results of the 1994 NAEP reading examination are yet another indicator that the current approach to education is not working. More money, more bureaucracy, more regulation, and more federal intrusion clearly are not improving America's academic performance.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the great debate about affirmative action that is about to begin, opponents of racial quotas and preferences must be prepared to offer a better way of opening opportunity for racial groups that have historically been victims of discrimination. The answer is high academic standards for everyone, a solution that the Clinton administration is, unfortunately, resisting.<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics. The prevailing assumption among teachers and principals in all too many poor neighborhoods seems to be: "These kids can't learn, and even if they do, society is so racist that there's no opportunity for them anyway."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why study hard if your teacher doesn't think you can learn? Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending the message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that, when much is expected of them, black and Hispanic children can achieve at a very high level. Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores for blacks and Hispanics are artificially raised to compensate for their racial status.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider the track record of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School in Los Angeles, near the site of the 1992 riots. Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American. Three-quarters have single parents, and many come from alcoholic families. But by the end of the sixth grade, his students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight of Shakespeare's plays. His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company. Their performance of Measure for Measure will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class? The same way outstanding teachers always do. He sets high standards, and gives his students the help they need to meet them. "I put my heart and soul into my teaching, and the kids know that. I demand the same from them." Esquith begins teaching his class of 40 students at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.) By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile, while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile, and the district in the 47th percentile. On the English test, they scored in the 92nd percentile, while the school overall scored in the 47th percentile, and the district in the 35th percentile. His sixth-grade class produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language, and, but for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Esquith's devotion to his students doesn't stop when they graduate from elementary school. On weekends he gathers his former students to prepare them for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The walls of his classrooms are filled with banners of colleges and universities like Harvard and Berkeley, institutions his students have gone on to attend; their names appear next to their respective schools. Most of these students are the first in their family ever to attend college.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Esquith's story is compelling, not only because his students do well, but because he proves that high expectations and hard work produce results. His students may be poor, but they will be able to compete in the marketplace on a level playing field because they are well educated, and Esquith -- the recipient of the Walt Disney Outstanding Teacher of the Year award in 1992 -- can trump most private-school teachers any day. Esquith's secret -- which seems to be well kept from most of the education establishment -- is his conviction that poor, inner-city kids can learn, and that the keys to educational success are high standards and hard work.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another example of the "aim high and achieve" model is Holy Angels Elementary School, described as an "oasis in the middle of the desert" by Jolene Pearl, a professor of education at Spring Arbor College. Every year, Pearl takes her students to Holy Angels to show them that a successful school need not be housed in a safe, affluent white neighborhood. Nor does it take a fortune to keep its door open. The 108-year-old South Side Catholic institution sits in the Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood of Chicago, where three out of four people live in poverty and violent crime is the rule rather than the exception. Holy Angels's enrollment includes 1,256 students -- all of whom are African-American -- from preschool to eighth grade, each paying a tuition of $40 to $45 per month. The school's motto: "Where Proud Black Youngsters Produce and Achieve." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I feel like I'm in a war zone," replies Sister Helen Struder, the school's principal, when asked how she feels about the location of her school. You'd never guess that from the students' performance. A comparison of scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills published by the Chicago Public Schools shows that, in 1994, the number of Holy Angels eighth-graders scoring above the national norm in math was quadruple the average number of eighth-graders at the three area public schools on the same test. The data also show that twice as many Holy Angels eighth-graders scored above the national norm in reading as did the average of the three area public school eighth graders. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How did this happen?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Sister Helen, who has been on the school's staff since 1960, before reaching her post as principal a year ago, believes that the secret to the school's success is threefold: its basic curriculum (mathematics, English, reading, science, and social studies), its strict discipline (it teaches respect for self and others and holds students responsible for their actions), and its high academic expectations for its students. Instead of making excuses for the children, Sister Helen and Holy Angels teachers expect them "to paddle their own canoes." Instead of offering an array of extracurricular classes or dumbing down its curriculum to increase the "self-esteem" of its African-American pupils, Holy Angels offers a strict diet of math and reading and expects students to get the job done. The principal believes that "by success you build self-esteem."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a school like Holy Angels or a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grass-roots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math. Lawyers from the Center for Law and Education at Harvard and a bevy of other "experts" tried to convince the federal courts that this requirement was unconstitutional because in Florida -- the first of many states to adopt such a test -- 80 to 90 percent of African-American students failed it on the first few tries. Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra P. v Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Lerner noted in a 1991 article in Commentary, children who mastered the basics went on to improve their scores on more advanced tests like the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) too, because "[m]inimum competence is the entry ticket in the race for advanced competence and, as in any race, increasing the number of entrants increases the number who cross the finish line." That, she argued, is why the SAT scores of African-American students rose by more than 47 points between 1980 and 1989. Lerner believes that the only way to expand the success of the minimum competence exam is to make it the standard for grade-school graduation, and also to require children to pass an advanced competence test like the SAT to graduate from high school. Such a test would go beyond literacy and numeracy to measure abstract reasoning and problem-solving ability with both words and numbers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Minimum competence tests have repeatedly been challenged in the courts by legal-services and civil-rights groups that contend, in Lerner's words, that the test "would hurt minority students the most, as a disproportionate number of them would fail the test and be denied high-school diplomas. That would stigmatize them for life, do severe damage to their self-esteem and motivation, and close off all further academic and career opportunities, locking them into a permanent underclass. The result would be a widening of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in American society, deepening our racial divisions and moving us away from equality and justice." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration makes a similar argument. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education investigated Ohio's policy of requiring students to pass a ninth-grade proficiency test to see whether it violated the civil rights of minority students. Thanks to pressure from Republican congressman William Goodling, who depicted the Department of Education's involvement in Ohio as an "unwelcome intrusion into a state's education practices," the investigation was halted. But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- mainly because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests. Currently, according to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test. Michigan, New York, and Tennessee offer state-endorsed diplomas, and New York, Ohio, and Tennessee offer honors diplomas.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;New York is one of the few states that has made huge strides in this area. Last year, thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City. Cortines mandated Regents-level classes in mathematics and science for most incoming high-school students-to be phased in for sophomores, juniors, and seniors in the following three years. (Regents are college-level courses recommended by the state's education department and overseen by the Board of Regents. Students who take the achievement tests that correspond to the classes qualify for a Regents diploma.) Cortines's plan immediately eliminated many "bonehead" courses -- as he characterized them -- which typically had large minority enrollment. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a report by the Hudson Institute, Education Reform 1994-1995, the results of the first year reveal that the course-failure rates rose among African-Americans and Hispanics, but also that the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly. The enrollment of African-Americans in college-preparatory science rose by 129 percent and Hispanic enrollments by 265 percent. Compared with the previous school year, more than 6,500 additional African-Americans and 7,000 Hispanics passed the Regents science courses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly 50 percent more Hispanics took the test in 1995 than in 1994, and 2,033 passed it (280 more than the year before). About a third more African-American students took the exam, and 2,532 passed it (184 more than the year before). Cortines's bold efforts received a boost last year when State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills required that all New York City students not enrolled in Regents courses do so. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regents courses put pressure not only on students, but also on teachers. Many of the complaints about Cortines's and Mills's efforts come from educators unfamiliar with teaching Regents-level courses. But as Kay Toliver, an award-winning math teacher from East Harlem Tech puts it, the pressure to perform pays off.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;She should know. For 30 years, Toliver has been teaching elementary school and junior-high-school math at Public School 72/East Harlem Tech, a school for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with 792 students, 88 percent of whom are Hispanic. She teaches pupils in grades four through eight in a program called the Challengers, designed for teaching mathematics in an integrated curriculum that emphasizes communications skills, history, and problem solving. She says she considers high expectations vital to success, "especially for students who are constantly being told they are 'disadvantaged' and who may have the impression that mathematics in particular is a subject beyond their abilities."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Every student can succeed in mathematics, even if [he or she has] never before been successful," Toliver wrote in the Journal of Negro Education. "I let my students know two things from the beginning: (1) I am with them to teach, and (2) I expect to be met halfway." She's determined to eliminate the stigma attached to poor minority students as underachievers. "I believe [that] the greater the problems surrounding the students, the more important it is that they triumph in their education and thus receive the key to a better life." Last spring, her fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-graders averaged above the 50th percentile on New York City's annual standardized math test, while the school scored in the 30th percentile.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1993, an award-winning PBS documentary, Good Morning Miss Toliver, brought her efforts to a wider audience. Since then, she has given many teacher-training workshops, and the Foundation for Advancement in Science and Education, in Los Angeles, has underwritten two sets of teacher-training videos featuring Toliver.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No wonder a good portion of her students end up in such elite schools as the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics. Perhaps forcing students to take Regents-level courses will result in the creation of many more teachers like Kay Toliver. Yet until more states decide to follow New York's lead in devising and mandating courses and exams like the Regents, teachers like Toliver will need to take on the challenge by expecting more from their students.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Brother Bob Smith, the principal of Milwaukee's private Messmer High School, sets similar standards of excellence. "We won't allow students to perform poorly because they are poor, black, or from single-family homes and have often suffered years of neglect," he says. "Our kids are evaluated and reviewed in the middle and at the end of each quarter. Our kids see themselves as students, not as black and white or members of a group." Messmer has 320 students, of whom 65 percent are African-American, 10 percent are Hispanic, and 25 percent are white or of other ethnic background. And how does Brother Bob's "no-nonsense" recipe fare? Forty of his 52 juniors taking the PSAT last fall scored in the top 30th percent nationally, his African-American students hold the same grade-point average as the school's white students, 98 percent of his students graduate, and 80 percent move onto college. All this at a per-pupil cost less than half that of any of the public high schools in the Milwaukee school system.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of race-based affirmative action are constantly challenged to offer viable alternatives. Their answer often includes myriad empowerment ideas, such as school choice and vouchers, each of which has been carefully crafted to address specific aspects of the problems affirmative action has failed to solve. As the accomplishments of Rafe Esquith, Sister Helen Struder, Ramon Cortines, Kay Toliver, and Brother Bob Smith demonstrate, promoting high standards is an idea that will boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These educators refute the fears of the civil-rights establishment that high expectations will forever tarnish the spirit of minorities, and are proof that the best kind of "affirmative action" is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.<p><I><b>Nina H.

<title>Abraham Amendment Would Give Hope to Failing Education System -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>ABRAHAM AMENDMENT WOULD GIVE HOPE TO AMERICA'S FAILING EDUCATION SYSTEM</i></h3>

By Denis P. Doyle and James F. Hirni<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 433<br>
October 16, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><P>

The year-old Goals 2000 legislation, President Clinton's most important education program, has been a failure.  Instead of "revolutionizing, revitalizing and reforming" America's schools, as President Clinton promised, Goals 2000 actually has slowed the process of change.1  It has created suffocating new government bureaucracies, increased federal regulations, and boosted federal spending.  Worse still, it threatens to undermine progress to improve American education performance by encouraging schools to ignore academic "outputs" -- real results -- and focus instead on obtaining federal dollars by showing Washington that more money is being spent on "inputs."  The program also threatens the relationship of students and their families to the education process.
<p>
Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000 will only strengthen the federal government's power to control local reform efforts and so hamper grass-roots reform.  It is time for Congress to terminate the program and divert the money to real reform.  A proposal by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI) would do this through the appropriations process.
<p>
Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two important ways:
<p>
<b>1) Building Bureaucracies.</b> Under Goals 2000, three new government bureaucracies were created: the National Education Goals Panel, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National Skills Board.  These bureaucracies continue the old, outdated traditions of "command-control" organization that continues to keep control of schools in the hands of education "producers" rather than "consumers."
<p>
<b>2) Federalizing Education.</b> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to local control, the legislation comes dangerously close to mandating a watered-down national curriculum designed in Washington.  The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying national history standards met bitter criticism that the standards were diluted and politically correct.  Indeed the proposed standards so clearly distorted American history that the Senate rebuffed them by a 99-1 vote on January 18.2 This episode indicates one of the inherent dangers in the Goals 2000 approach. If NESIC's members were appointed, it would become a <i>de facto</i> national school board whose 19 members would approve or disapprove all state-developed plans to meet goals set by the Education Goals Panel.  Continuing attempts to "federalize" state and local education discourages real innovation and inhibits the most important school reform initiative of the decade: the movement toward privatization and school choice.
<p>
The states, on their own initiative, already have begun to reject federal interference in schooling.  "Outcomes Based Education" (OBE), a favorite idea of the education establishment, has offended and alienated thoughtful teachers and parents across the country and has mobilized opposition to the federal role.  Four states -- Montana, New Hampshire, Virginia, and, most recently, Alabama -- have turned down Goals 2000 funding, refusing to permit more federal intrusion.
<p>
It is clearly time to end Goals 2000.  In debating the FY 1996 Labor/HHS appropriations bill, Members of Congress have an opportunity to do this.  They could do so by adding Senator Abraham's proposal to Senator Dan Coats's (R-IN) amendment to the appropriations bill, the Educational Choice and Equality Act of 1995.
<p>
Senator Abraham's proposal is direct and straightforward.  It eliminates Goals 2000 outright.  The $310 million appropriated in the Labor/HHS report for FY 1996 under Goals 2000 would be transferred into two innovative education approaches to school reform:
<p>
	1) A "school choice" demonstration program and<br>
	2) Charter schools.
<p>
Under the Abraham proposal, federal funds would be available for new and innovative approaches to school reform.  Moreover, the Abraham proposal puts the federal government on record as supporting students and their families rather than institutions, using the GI Bill as its precedent.
<p>
In all other aspects of American life, choice among providers is a priceless asset, putting power in the hands of consumers. Only in elementary and secondary education is choice reserved for the well-to-do.  If enacted, the Abraham proposal would put school choice within the reach of countless poor youngsters who are now held hostage to a public school system in disarray.  It also would stimulate the development of charter schools, a promising avenue of locally generated reform that could help revitalize faltering public school systems.
<p>
Most important to those Americans committed to the principles of federalism and school reform, under the Abraham proposal funds would go directly to reform programs already supported by a majority of the nation's governors.  That means the money would bypass the institutions and agencies largely committed to the status quo and special interest groups.
<p>
Unlike President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and many Members of Congress, who are wealthy enough to send their children to the private school of their choice, poor and middle class parents are left with the public school monopoly.3  In many instances, this means that children are condemned to schools that can no longer teach simple reading and math adequately yet are expected to grapple with reform under the constraints and the restrictions imposed by Goals 2000.
<p>
Senator Abraham's proposal would end the federal government's ability to impose new mandates on schools, teachers, and parents. Instead, the proposal gives states the ability to enact school choice programs which allow every child in the American education system the opportunity to step out from under the shadow of the federal government.
<p>
Goals 2000 fails America's schools and America's school children.  Reforming America's education system cannot be achieved with more federal intrusion.  Existing funds must be spent more wisely and academic priorities established state by state.  No one in Washington -- certainly no employee of the U.S. Department of Education -- knows more about education priorities than parents and teachers or the nation's governors.

<p>
Since the publication of "A Nation at Risk" in 1983, Americans have become increasingly alarmed about the dismal results and soaring costs of their public schools. No group of citizens has a closer view of these problems or a more immediate stake in addressing them than the parents of the country's 48 million schoolchildren. Here and there, parents have won minor battles to influence curricula or oust mediocre school-board members. But as individuals, parents are no match for the forces that favor the status quo.<p>
Parents' most promising forum to agitate for reform and hold their local educators accountable for failure already exists: the venerated National Congress of Parents and Teachers, commonly known as the PTA. Unfortunately, parents cannot count on either their local PTA or its national leadership to advance parental interestsor even air diverse viewpoints. As it operates today, the PTA is useless to parents who want to play a meaningful role in educational reform. <p>
The mission of the PTA has always been to "work on behalf of the best interests of all children on issues that affect their health, education, and welfare" and "to encourage parent involvement." With almost seven million members, the PTA offers great potential for promoting parental involvement in the educational welfare of children. But in the 1990s, that mission requires of the PTA something it has been unwilling to do: demand accountability for performance and spending at every level of the educational system.<p><center><b>Local Control</center></b><p>
Decades ago, parents had significant influence over their neighborhood schools. Over the years, however, school districts consolidated, teachers and administrators came to see themselves as credentialed professionals, and state laws standardized educational practices and curricula. Today, many parents are less likely to get involved in their children's educational environment. Nevertheless, the impetus for reform will have to come from parents active at the grass roots.<p>
The PTA ought to be helping such parents overcome the considerable barriers to holding local educators accountable. For instance, it should be of great concern to parents that student grades tend to be as high in low-achieving as in high-achieving schools, but the PTA deliberately avoids such educational issues.<p>
In the annual battles over allocating financial resources, the PTA should play a major role in deciphering complicated budgets for the benefit of interested parents. Instead, PTAs rally with teachers unions for tax increases, seldom questioning the effect on parents or the educational outcomes for students.<p>
Parents also deserve greater consideration of their  interests in the contract negotiations that determine pay and working conditions for teachers. For instance, teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, refused to write recommendations for their college-bound students because such "extra" duties weren't in their contract. In some areas, a parent who wishes to lodge a complaint about a teacher must navigate a bureaucratic process established by contract. Parents may have to submit a written account of the grievance in order to secure a meeting with the teacher, who has the right to bring along a union representative. Some parents find such time-consuming and intimidating conditions a clear subordination of parental interests to teacher rights.<p>
It is indisputable that teachers are already well represented in negotiations. Therefore, an effective local PTA that works on behalf of parental interests should insist on more than the current minimal accord paid to parental concerns. Working through the PTA, parents could ensure that their schools:
<ul><li>Demand pro-parent scrutiny of teacher contracts;<li>Justify their annual budgets;<li>Air alternative views to the pro-union positions on privatization, teacher tenure, tuition-tax credits, school choice, and teacher standards;<li>Establish expeditious complaint procedures so that parents could challenge decisions and actions of teachers or administrators;<li>Make certain that student grades provide parents with adequate information about the educational progress of their children, or lack of it.</UL>	
<p>
Nowadays, local matters are greatly affected by policy at higher levels. State governments now have a hand in everything from funding to curricular standards. President Clinton's Goals 2000 legislation, enacted last year and under review by the new Republican-controlled Congress, may bring down the heavy hand of the federal government, too (see sidebar, page 88). Similarly, PTA members who wish to be active at the local level must take account of PTA policies set by the state and national hierarchies and imposed on individual chapters.<p>
At the least, the PTA has the power to keep parents informed of academic issues, from educational policies set at the national and state levels to the curriculum and employment practices of their local schools. At its best, the PTA could help frame the national debate over educational reform, lobby for some of the reforms that debate has already produced, and work to change the restrictive collective-bargaining statutes that tend to shield teacher unions and teachers from accountability and limit parental involvement.<p>Why the PTA Is Weak
<ul><li>PTA's ineffectiveness can be attributed to six inter-related areas:<li>Misdirected resources. At the local level, the PTA has become a fundraising auxiliary for school districts, while its child-advocacy efforts have focused on social, non-educational issues.<li>Stifled debate. Many PTA officials stifle open discussion of controversial issues and discourage parents from questioning the PTA's official positions.<li>Ignorance. Most PTA members have no idea of the policies advocated in their name by the PTA hierarchy at the national and state levels.<li>Careerism. The PTA's national officers are elected by a restrictive process that requires a national PTA presidential candidate to make a commitment of nearly 10 years to rise "through the chairs." Consequently, many PTA national leaders serve long after their own children have left school.<li>Transient membership. Parental interest is often high at the elementary-school level, tapers off in middle school, and all but disappears in high school. As a result, PTA officers and professional staff have inordinate influence.<li>Teachers-union influence. National PTA policies, which often are automatically adopted as state and local PTA policies, reflect the dominant influence of the teachers unions, especially the National Education Association (NEA). </ul>
<p>
Of these factors, by far the most important is the last. Parents and teachers in the PTA both claim to share the same goal: promoting the educational welfare of children. But the PTA's governance structure, in which unionized teachers play a major role, is fatally flawed. Fundamentally, parents and their children are the consumers of education; teachers are part of the producer complex. Elevating the interests of the producers above the interests of the consumers is a formula for irrelevance. In the last 12 months, I have attended two national PTA meetings and five state conventions, and I cannot recall a single instance in which any policy contrary to the interests of teachers unions was given a proper hearing.<p>
Ever since the 1960s, the NEA and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) have lobbied vigorously for state legislation requiring school boards to bargain collectively with teachers unions over the terms and conditions of employment. Teachers have the statutory right to bargain collectively in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Many school districts outside of those states engage in de facto collective bargaining with the teachers unions. By its refusal to challenge the teachers unions in collective bargaining, the PTA has eliminated itself as an independent advocate for parents. The PTA claims to "seek to participate in the decisionmaking process establishing school policy." But whenever school boards sacrifice parental interests to union interests as often happens in these negotiations, the PTA cannot and will not object.<p>
Such impotence has been apparent at least since the PTA's 1968 position statement on "teacher negotiations, sanctions, and strikes." The PTA resolution, reaffirmed in 1987, identifies the "dilemmas" that teacher militancy and union negotiations impose on PTA members:<ul>
<p>
"1. If the PTA provides volunteers to man the classrooms, during a work stoppage, in the interest of protecting the immediate safety and welfare of children, it is branded as a strike breaker.<p>
"2. If the PTA does not take sides in issue[s] being negotiated, it is accused of not being interested.<p>
"3. If it supports the positions of the board of education, which is the representative of the public in negotiations, the teacher members of the PTA have threatened to withdraw membership and boycott the local PTA activities." (Italics added.)</ul>
<p>
Collective bargaining is used in most school districts to resolve such issues as teacher compensation for extra curricular activities, class size, parental grievance procedures, and the frequency and scheduling of parent/teacher conferences. In effect, the PTA does not take sides on issues subject to bargaining, regardless of their impact on students, parents, or the public. That position constitutes a major victory for unions and a setback for parents.<p>
How are PTA members supposed to respond to this dilemma? The 1968 resolution urges them to be alert to symptoms of teacher dissatisfaction (abnormal turnover, complaints, and "teacher-supported legislation defeated by state legislature") before a strike and to promote the public airing of issues. At no point does the PTA suggest that teacher dissatisfaction may be unwarranted. The PTA's statement acknowledges that the teachers' threat to withdraw membership and boycott the organization greatly concerns the scores of PTA's professional staff members at the state and national organizations.<p>
This surrender may have the cost the organization anyway. The PTA does not keep track of the ratio of teachers to parents among its membership. But we do know that membership peaked in 1966, when more than 12 million teachers, administrators, and parents were members of the National PTA.<p>
The organization then lost more than six million members from 1966 to 1982, years when collective bargaining by teachers unions increased to unprecedented levels. With the withdrawal of parent activists who refused to accept the PTA's subservience to union interests, the PTA has evolved into an NEA front on non-educational as well as educational issues.<p>
To be sure, the PTA sponsors many worthwhile programs and activities. Few of them, however, relate to education. The PTA doesn't merely waste its potential for constructive action; it may even hinder reform. In recent years, the teachers' unions' formidable influence over the PTA has been seen in the following issues:<p>
Opposition to school choice. In addition to its refusal to challenge union positions in collective bargaining and teacher strikes, the PTA opposes vouchers and tuition-tax credits that would empower parents to choose private schools. Thus the PTA has capitulated to the NEA/AFT insistence on maintaining the public-school monopoly at all costs.<p>
Delegates to the 1994 state convention of the California Congress of Parents, Teachers, and Students (the California PTA) broke into thunderous applause when a speaker congratulated them on defeating the school-choice ballot initiative known as Proposition 174. "You were the voice of the California children!" she shouted. More than one million California PTA volunteers defeated Proposition 174, she said, and "all the California Teachers Association did was put up the money." <p>
In fact, the PTA provided a large bloc of foot soldiers in the campaign against Proposition 174. At one workshop, a PTA official reminded delegates that "we will pull the PTA Charter if any unit goes beyond the PTA agendaas we would have with any PTA that supported vouchers."<p>
No matter how modest a voucher plan might be, the PTA can be expected to oppose it. In 1994, New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman was expected to introduce a pilot program for school vouchers in the ailing Jersey City school system. Nevertheless, state and national PTA officials called the plan a "threat" to public education. As a result, New Jersey PTA delegates voted to "[t]ake an active role in opposing" private-school vouchers. Not surprisingly, the PTA and the New Jersey affiliate of the NEA joined a coalition to defeat this and all other voucher proposals. <p>
Opposition to privatization. State PTAs structure their conventions to reinforce the national organization's opposition to privatization of school services. At Maryland's state PTA convention last year, the state vice president for legislative activity expressed hostility for privatization. Several delegates stomped out of a standing-room-only session on the topic when the state chairwoman refused to permit a balanced discussion of audience views on this issue. She instead rebutted criticism of PTA's opposition to contracting out school services. The reason for PTA opposition? Allegedly, some unionized employees could lose their jobs.<p>
Focus on non-educational issues. PTA programs are designed to diminish dissatisfaction with poor school performance. Instead of conducting hearings to address the causes of academic deficiencies, PTAs sponsor events presenting students' work in the most favorable light. Much time and effort goes into women's auxiliary or support services: trip chaperoning, bake sales, and other fundraising activities. Clearly, good PTA parents are supposed to be passive supporters, not active critics, of schools and teachers. <p>
Last summer, PTA delegates from 53 states and territories met in Las Vegas for the 98th annual national convention. Convention delegates received two days of workshops to learn how to produce materials that generate positive public reaction to PTA, respond to extremist groups challenging health/sex education curricula, implement the PTA's HIV/AIDS awareness programs, and rebut right-wing groups favoring school choice.<p>
Delegates considered resolutions on violence in video games, inhalant abuse, the quality of indoor air in portable classrooms, and the sale, resale, and destruction of confiscated firearms. These are typical of the non-educational, social issues on which PTAs focus their time and money.<p><center><b>The PTA Stifles Dialogue</b></center><p>
In its 1983 position statement in support of public education (revised and reaffirmed in 1991), the national PTA pledged to ensure that "adequate, objective, and language-appropriate information be available to parents so that they can make informed decisions." Unfortunately, the PTA is ignoring this directive.<p>
Given the way PTAs are governed, it is virtually impossible for parent members to develop parent-friendly policies that may conflict with the interests of teachers unions. Parents ought to have a forum for advocating the adoption of reforms like school-choice programs and the privatization of school services, ensuring that teachers are available for frequent conferences with parents, challenging teacher tenure, and assessing the value of report cards, grades, and standardized tests for measuring student performance. Unfortunately, many PTA parents are finding it increasingly difficult to articulate their needs and lodge their complaints within the PTA.<p>
Taking such action within the PTA would require parents to challenge teachers and teachers unions at meetings where both are present. Many parents fear teacher retaliation if they aggressively advocate parental over teacher interests. PTA parents also feel intimidated by the overwhelming pro-union bias in PTA publications and programs, as seen in the selection of convention issues and speakers.<p>
When one speaker after another proclaims the dangers of school choice, for example, it is difficult for rank-and-file members to challenge the PTA's position on the issue. PTA convention programs and publications ought to include balanced discussion of the issues.<p>
Indeed, open discussion of parental concerns is virtually absent at state and national PTA meetings. In practice, parents who seek accurate, unbiased information on educational issues are expected to fall in line with PTA positions.<p>
"The PTA severely limits the opportunity for dialogue and dissent," says Jo Cooper, an Oklahoma parent and 19-year PTA veteran. In 1994, the state legislative chairman of the Oklahoma PTA warned her not to publicly oppose national PTA positions. Cooper's offense? In a public meeting in her suburban Oklahoma City school district, she opposed the national PTA's enthusiastic support of the Goals 2000 legislation and HR 6, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Cooper believes both pieces of federal legislation will undermine local control.<p>
In 1992, Kathy Moran, a PTA official in Villa Park, California, received a letter from the state organization demanding that PTA leaders "do everything possible" to block the gathering of signatures for the 1992 state ballot initiative on school choice. When she tried to organize a debate on the merits of choice, she was told that PTA chapters must present only the anti-choice perspective. <p><center><b>What's a Parent to Do?</center></b>
<p>
Is it any wonder that a backlash is developing? Small groups of concerned and sometimes angry parents are challenging the status quoincluding the PTA's deference to the teachers unions. Among their options:<ul>
<li>
Withhold support. Withholding dues to the state and national organizations can be an effective way to protest. At its recent board meeting, the Indiana State PTA lamented that it had to amend its annual budget after losing 3,000 members and their dues.<li>
Reform from within. Parents who believe the PTA can be reformed from within should form a "parental-control" caucus. Parents committed to pro-parent policies could bring about basic changes in the PTA. With a functioning caucus, they might find the strength to make their voices heard at state and national conventions. They could push to reform cumbersome procedures and restrictive election requirements in order to elect national PTA officers committed to pro-parent positions.<p>
Of course, for such internal reform to succeed, more parents now dissatisfied with PTA operations would have to become involved. Like-minded parents need to serve as officers of local chapters and as delegates to state and national conventions.<li>
Assert leadership locally. In Greenwich, Connecticut, local PTA president Kay Wall questioned the state's implementation of a misnamed "outcome-based education" program in June 1992. Without the support of the PTA, she organized a protest group, the Committee to Save Our Schools (SOS), which contributed to the collapse of Connecticut's plan. <p>
Within her local PTA chapter, Wall has organized and chairs an Academic Challenge and Excellence Committee (ACE) that focuses on restoring high academic standards for all children. "They don't really want parents involved in the way I want to be involved," Wall says, "which is knowing the details of the curriculum, knowing what is being tested, and questioning the new standards." Wall is also encouraging members to challenge the PTA's official support of Goals 2000.<li>
Revise PTA membership policy. As long as unionized teachers employed under collective bargaining are members of the PTA, it may be futile for parents to criticize educational policy. The NEA's own experience is instructive here. Before the enactment of collective-bargaining laws, the NEA included administrators at the local, state, and national levels. As a result, local NEA chapters were usually unable to promote teachers' interests, and actions of school administrators were seldom criticized.<li>
Encourage competition. If parents feel that their PTA cannot represent their interests, they should form alternative organizations. Some active parents are requesting disaffiliation from the national PTA. Janice Thompson, a parent in North Carolina who calls herself a "keeper of the home," ardently opposes the PTA's social agenda and its close association with teachers unions. Thompson emphasizes the need for parental involvement in academic issues, and feels that PTA affiliation is a hindrance, not a help, to parents who wish to raise academic standards.<p>
To build her case for reverting back to a local parent-teacher organization (PTO), she called the North Carolina State PTA office in Raleigh and asked, "What is the last thing the PTA accomplished in the classroom?" Says Thompson, "They didn't even have an answer." Last March, parents at her elementary school voted to revert to a PTO. "At the local level," Thompson says, "we know the issues, and here we can work with parents and the school for the benefit of the students." <p>
The PTO is organized locally, with no allegiance to state or national associations. Local parents, teachers, and administrators direct the activities, which are not unlike those of the PTA. Governance is usually through simple bylaws, determined by all parents who attend the meetings. It's true, as PTA literature points out, that a PTO does not emphasize lobbying effortsbut such efforts might contradict local standards and parental positions. Members of PTOs have found they can work through the local education maze more easily without the national-policy prohibitions and teachers union allegiances of the PTA. <p>
Activist PTO parents direct their energy toward improving their own schools and their own children's educational opportunities. While many appreciate a PTO's autonomy, some recognize its lack of organizational training and support.<li>
New opportunities for involvement. Current educational reforms are introducing new ways for parents to become involved in schools. For instance, charter and magnet schools within public-school systems often include provisions for parental involvement similar to requirements at private and parochial schools. School-management companies and for-profit businesses that offer services to public schools often stress active parental involvement. Parents should encourage this trend by insisting that school districts and schools retain the utmost flexibility in contracting for services.</ul>
<p>
At a time when special-interest groups are increasingly viewed in a negative light, the PTA is already well placed to act as a respected advocate for the educational interests of children and parents. As the struggle intensifies, the teachers unions will do their utmost to preserve the PTA as their subservient ally. The good news is that parents concerned about education want to do more than attend monthly PTA meetings. They are forming groups and creating procedures that will empower them as consumers of government services.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">P</FONT></B>arents and politicians tend to blame the education establishment for the sorry 
state of learning in American public schools. The educrats are not taking this lying down. 
They've found their own scapegoat: parents. Public-school boosters have decided that lax 
parental involvement is the reason children fail. And so some have begun turning the 
schools into Big Mother.</P> 
<P>	The newest trend in education "reform" is the inclusion of parental-education 
programs and curricula that require parental involvement in student activities. President 
Clinton's Goals 2000, enacted last year, includes an entire section on "parental 
assistance," also called "parent training." Some schools even require parents to sign a 
pledge that they will perform assigned, pseudo-educational tasks, which could include 
playing "Simon Says" or rolling cookie dough with their third-grader.</P>
<P>	Of course parents should be involved in their children's education. And, of 
course, problems at home--messy divorces, absent fathers--can cause problems for 
children at school. But the "parent education" movement seeks to blame all parents for 
academic failure, not just parents who are neglecting their kids or destroying their own 
families. The movement does not seek to make parents more demanding of their children, 
nor, no surprise, of the schools. To the contrary, new curricula urge parents to be 
nurturing and uncritical--sort of the way public-school officials would like parents to 
treat them.</P>
<P>	This philosophy is becoming institutionalized in California. Consider the math 
curriculum rated most highly--a perfect 100 percent--by a state education panel that 
chooses which textbooks should qualify for state subsidies. "Investigations in Numbers, 
Data and Space," from the Dale Seymour Publications Series, appealed to the panel 
because it included home assignments that require parental involvement.</P>

<H3>New New Math</H3>
<P>	Under this curriculum--call it New New Math--which eschews rigorous 
memorization of multiplication tables, teachers send home periodic "Dear Family" 
missives to third-grade parents with the following advice:</P>
<UL><LI>  "Don't worry if your child doesn't use a ruler accurately yet--it's a skill that will 
develop over time, with more and more opportunities to measure."<BR>
<LI>  "Children have very interesting ways to figure out these problems. You can help by 
asking your child to tell you how he or she got an answer. There are many ways to do 
these problems--and no single `right' way. What's important for your child to know is 
how his or her own way works."<BR>
<LI>  "When your child has an assignment to do at home--such as collecting data about the 
ages of pets and oldest relatives--offer your help, and ask your child about what he or 
she is doing in class."<BR>
<LI>  "There is one thing we ask you not to do. We won't be using some of the step-by-step 
methods of addition and subtraction in this unit that may be familiar to you--nor will we 
be teaching borrowing or carrying. All too often, we have found that children this age 
memorize these step-by-step procedures and do not learn how to apply the processes of 
addition and subtraction. This year we will support students in developing several 
strategies for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, and we prefer that they do 
not memorize a single set of procedures."</UL>

<H3>Educational Relativism</H3>
<P>	This New New Math adds up to a new way of letting schools off the hook for not 
teaching children. It's not enough that we have moral relativism in English and Social 
Studies. Now we have it in math, too.</P>
<P>	The Dale Seymour third-grade program instructs parents to "make roll-out 
cookies with your child" to explore shapes, include children in family math decisions 
(such as how many floor tiles to buy) and explore "fair shares," which is politically-
correct educratese for "sharing food." Clearly the intent of these instructions is to force 
parents to spend quality time--at least as defined by educrats.</P>
<P>	So what's wrong with that? Supporters argue that parents, especially single 
parents, may not spend enough quality time with their children and would benefit from 
programs that nudge them to do so. But not all parents need this nudge, and some object 
to the schools' sledgehammer approach. And many may object to a pervasive touchy-
feely, there's-no-such-thing-as-a-wrong-answer attitude being foisted upon parents.</P>
<P>	In Petaluma, California, a mandatory high-school course called Human 
Interaction, or HI!, has provoked an angry reaction from some parents.</P> 
<P>	They resent take-home assignments that tell them how to be parents. The 
program's take-home and in-class "teen/parent" worksheets have included these queries 
for ninth-graders:</P>
<UL><LI>  Whether "how much money your parents make" is a private issue or can be discussed in 
class.<BR>
<LI>  Whether any "close relatives" has ever suffered "alcoholism" or "mental illness."<BR>
<LI>  Whether students "feel OK about crying" and "allow" themselves to do so.<BR></UL>
<P>	Other questions explore whether students recycle, eat fast food, use public 
transportation and "accept the way [they] feel about things."</P>
<P>	According to administrators, the course is a hit with kids. You can see why. No 
boring memorization or flexing of the gray cells here. Student assignments encourage 
teens to go with their feelings. "Denying" them, they are told, is passive behavior. A class 
worksheet on "family systems" assures teens that "open" families are "`pure' 
democracy," while "closed" families are "hierarchal."</P>
<P>	Federal law prohibits schools from asking children for highly personal 
information without parents' permission. The district explains that teens are meant to fill 
out the worksheets for their own private use, but at least two teachers in Petaluma told 
students to turn in signed worksheets. And Stephen Collins, the assistant superintendent 
of the Petaluma School District, admitted last fall that, once such worksheets are passed 
out, it is very likely that these topics will be discussed in class.</P>
<P>	Petaluma parents Jay and Tura Avner pulled their two children from HI!. "They 
want to be surrogate parents," Tura Avner complains. She especially resents the district's 
assumption that "unless the schools taught me how to manage my kids, they'd be running 
wild in the streets."</P>
<P>	But the Avners' efforts to liberate their children have not been easy. The district 
would not assign the Avners' son to an alternative, academic class. Instead, he was forced 
to be a counselor's aide for that period. Worse, the district dragged its feet for months 
before granting a "waiver" from this program. So much for "voluntary" parental 
education.</P>
<P>	District administrators sometimes insinuate that dissenters are right-wing religious 
fanatics. These days, that is a standard response to complaints. State law allows parents to 
pull their children from classes for reasons of religious belief or moral conscience. The 
Petaluma district, however, wouldn't let parents remove their children without a fight. 
Last year, the superintendent's cabinet, the district counsel, and HI! officials crafted a 
waiver form requiring parents to list their "reason(s) why they did not want their children 
to attend, and declare that they would provide appropriate alternative educational 
experiences" on HI! topics. This tactic clearly was designed to prompt parents with 
religious objections to proclaim themselves, giving administrators potential grist for the 
anti-fundamentalist mill. Yet California law clearly protects parents' right to keep private 
their reasons for objecting to a class.</P>
<P>	The kicker: Until the Rutherford Institute, a religious-freedom advocacy group, 
threatened a lawsuit, the district proposed that parents sign the waiver forms "under 
penalty of perjury." The penalty for perjury in California is a jail term of up to four years. 
Was the district planning to arrest parents who don't teach their children recycling? "I 
don't know that we were going to do anything," assistant superintendent Collins 
explained at the time. "We knew that when we went into this it was going to be revised."</P>
<P>	Collins was forthcoming in his defense of HI!'s "individual growth, physical 
growth, and social growth" curriculum. It is "pretty generally believed," he said, that 
most parents don't communicate with their children. Then there's the if-schools-don't-
teach-this-children-will-die argument. Collins explained that the board determined that 
HI! "was a matter of life and death." "If students don't have the tools to deal with the 
pressures" and destructive elements in life, he said, the board feared teens "would make 
the wrong choices and it would be fatal."</P>
<P>	This thinking betrays a strong anti-parent bent. Parents, apparently, fail to instill 
their children with self-esteem or AIDS awareness, so the schools must fill the void. 
Educrats have concluded that children who ignore their oafish parents' words on, say, 
safe sex will miraculously heed their teachers. Worse, HI! assumes that teens will build 
more self-esteem by talking about their feelings than by learning to speak a foreign 
language or play a musical instrument.</P>
<P>	Similarly, New New Mathmeisters seem to have a Rousseauesque view that 
children will grasp math intuitively if not distracted by narrow-minded parents or 
teachers. For example, the California math-curriculum panel disapproved of exercises 
that are "generally under the direction of the teacher." That Californian teachers' unions 
have supported this shows how far they have moved from their support of traditional 
pedagogy.</P>

<H3>Why Have Schools?</H3>
<P>	Maureen DiMarco, Governor Pete Wilson's education adviser and a critic of the 
New New Math, is baffled by this natural-learning approach. If kids learn so well by 
themselves, she asks, why have schools? "The assumption that, if children wander 
aimlessly they will automatically find all the prizes that are out there educationally is 
totally ludicrous," she says.</P>
<P>	Despite the rhetoric about parental involvement, administrators favor things that 
parents don't like. A poll by Public Agenda found that 86 percent of respondents want 
students to learn arithmetic "by hand" before they use calculators. But a 1993 survey 
found that 82 percent of math educators thought that "early use of calculators will 
improve children's problem-solving skills and not prevent the learning of arithmetic."</P>
<P>	If educators want parents to be involved in public education, it certainly isn't 
because teachers and administrators value their views. Parents in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and elsewhere complain they have been systematically frozen out of 
power in school-based councils. The message: Be seen and not heard.</P>
<P>	And maybe cough up some money for a field trip, books, or computers.</P>
<P>	New New Math programs effectively freeze parents out in another way. Even as 
New New Math mavens ostensibly increase parental involvement, many new curricula 
don't even include textbooks. "The concept of what they mean by parental involvement 
in these materials implies the parents should be involved," says DiMarco, "but then tells 
parents not to impose their own math learning styles and knowledge on their children. 
And worst of all, when the student doesn't get what is going on in class and the parent 
has to help with the homework, too often the parent will be confronted with only a 
worksheet. There is no textbook that explains the work to be done--leaving the parent 
and the student without another alternative than just the teacher's explanation."</P>
<P>	Sadly, parents are often the first to embrace parental education, even if their 
parents rarely helped them. A generation ago, it was believed that children learned best 
by working through their studies on their own. Somewhere along the way, educrats 
abandoned that notion and began to insist that parents assist with the homework.</P>
</P>	In addition, the proliferation of AIDS, teen pregnancy, and single-parent families 
have led many to demand that schools take on responsibilities that parents 20 or 30 years 
ago would never have dreamed of giving up. Today, the generation that believed in 
questioning authority is asking the authorities to raise their kids.</P>

<H3>Wrong Target</H3>
<P>	Brace yourselves--things may grow worse. Petaluma has begun a pilot program 
for grade-school counseling called SUCCESS, an acronym for "Self Understanding Can 
Create Everlasting Secure Selves." Counselor Susi Brodie told the <I>Petaluma Argus-
Courier</I> that counseling children often involves counseling parents.</P>
<P>	Big Mother's attention wrongly falls upon functioning families. Neglectful 
parents aren't going to roll out the cookie dough to teach shapes; only families who 
already bond with their children will. Troubled students largely lack structure, not 
attention.</P>
<P>	Two years ago, I rode in a van operated by the San Juan Unified School District, 
in Sacramento. The 35-foot van housed the district's mobile Student Attendance Review 
Board (S.A.R.B.). According to Carolynn Salter, the district's child welfare and 
attendance counselor, the district purchased a van for S.A.R.B. hearings because parents 
frequently failed to show up for their children's truancy hearings.</P>
<P>	The four students the van visited that day were in elementary school. One 
kindergartner had missed 57 days, while his second-grade sister had missed 66. Their 
prognosis was frightful: They were both to be kept back a grade. The boy couldn't even 
use scissors.</P>
<P>	Schools and government should intervene in such clear-cut cases of severe child 
neglect. But Big Mother does not have the stomach to deal with these messes. A bill 
sponsored by the late B.T. Collins, a GOP assemblyman, that would have ended welfare 
benefits for parents with truant children never made it out of committee.</P>
<P>	Instead of getting tough with parents who don't provide their children with basic 
needs--nutrition, shelter, education, stability--the schools have turned their attention 
where it is needed least. </P>
<P>	They target parents who provide for their children and are well-meaning and 
gullible enough to be taken in by faddish curricula. The parental-involvement movement 
seeks to teach parents to  value self-esteem over academics. This is a clever ploy by a 
system that is shortchanging American children. </P>
<P>	As happens in so many areas these days, the government is treating good people 
like bad people, while letting the worst problems fester.</P>

     Latest Blow to Spending Myth <P>
     Another Success for Reform in Milwaukee 
<P>

SCHOOL REFORM SWEEPS ACROSS NATION 
<P>
     Advocates of serious education reform are taking heart at the
recent explosion of state-level initiatives.  Many measures have been
enacted and more soon will be put to legislators or the voters.  Some
of them are:
<P>
California.  
<P>     One of the most closely watched reform initiatives is Proposition
174, a referendum on the November ballot in California.  If passed, it
would enable the parents of nearly 5.3 million California
schoolchildren to begin receiving vouchers worth $2,600 in state
funds, or 50 percent of the average per-pupil public school
expenditure, to help pay for their child to attend a private school 
(sectarian included) if they wished. 
<P>
     Leading the opposition to Proposition 174 is a broad coalition of
elected officials, newspapers, civil rights organizations, and the
California education establishment.  With the National Education
Association (NEA) leading the way, opponents of Proposition 174 have
raised $8.9 million, compared with the $718,000 amassed by supporters
of the proposition.  The NEA's affiliate, the California Teachers
Association, recently assessed all members $63 to help fund the anti-
Proposition 174 effort.
<P>
     The pro-voucher forces have tried to make the central issue of
the proposal the fierce opposition of teacher unions and bureaucrats. 
Ken Khachigian, the voucher campaign's chief strategist, believes that
this is the key to success in November.  "I love these kinds of
battles.  It's going up against people who have arrogantly accumulated
power and arrogantly wield it."
<P>
     With the election fast approaching, the outcome appears close. 
An October 21 Los Angeles Times poll has the measure losing, 56
against to 26 percent in favor, with 18 percent still undecided. 
However, in an off-year election, with no more than 35 percent of the
voters expected to show, opponents are not confident of victory.
<P>
Puerto Rico.  
  <P>   Another sweeping measure has already made it to the statute book. 
Puerto Rico's Governor Pedro Rossello, on September 3,  signed into
law a bill creating an education voucher system potentially as radical
as that about to be voted on in California.  The vouchers, which are
limited to $1,500, allow families the opportunity to choose which
public or private school their child will attend.  The new law also
offers high school students the chance to take university-level
courses.
<P>
     Governor Rossello claims that the idea behind the program is to
broaden the educational choices for students.  As he made clear
shortly after signing the bill, "This is not a matter of good schools
versus bad schools.  Who will decide which is which?  Who will have
that power?  That's very simple -- the family."
<P>
     The $10 million pilot project went into effect immediately after
it was passed, despite the fact that the administrative unit which
will review applications has not yet been set up.  About one percent
of the public school population will be eligible during the first
year, with plans to expand later.  The state legislature will review
the project in September 1997, when it will "determine whether it
should continue, modify, or amplify the program."
<P>
Michigan.  
 <P>    Governor John Engler and the legislature recently eliminated all
state property taxes earmarked for schools, or about two-thirds of the
state's public education money.  As Governor Engler noted, "We've been
trying to do something about property taxes and school reform for two
decades.  It was time to do something drastic."  Engler is now
proposing to raise the sales tax and give each child's parents $4,500
to spend on their current schools, on other public schools, or on one
of the "charter public schools" that he would authorize any public
authority or group of teachers to create.
<P>
     The Governor hopes that the tax revolt will end the political
power of the most powerful teacher's union in the state, the Michigan
Chapter of the National Education Association.  With almost 70 percent
of school funding eliminated by the new law, Michigan has only until
fiscal year 1995 to come up with a new means of funding education. 
School reform proponents hope that the crisis will force a
consideration of revolutionary cost-saving measures and reforms. 
<P>
     Michigan certainly needs a shakeup in its school system.  The
state ranks 16th in school spending but 39th in students' SAT scores. 
Engler, who has already ruled out an income tax, hopes his plan will
put some competition into the Michigan public school system.  The
Michigan constitution currently prohibits public aid to private
schools.  Thus, the constitution must be amended before a private
school choice program could be implemented.
<P>
Georgia.  
  <P>   School choice advocates recently uncovered a 32-year-old statute
which permits any child between the ages of six and nineteen to
receive an "education grant" to pay all or part of the tuition at a
non-sectarian private school. 
<P>
     The law, approved by the Georgia legislature in 1961, originally
was passed to enable white students to flee desegregated public
schools.  Ironically, Atlanta lawyer Glenn Delk, who stumbled onto the
law by accident, now hopes to use the law to help poor, inner-city
children go to the private school of their choice.  Delk and the
Georgia Public Policy Foundation are urging parents to go to their
local school boards and demand funds for private schools.  Despite the
law, the Georgia education establishment has refused to provide these
funds, claiming that it will ruin public education.  State school
Superintendent Werner Rogers says he will ask the legislature to
repeal the law in January, when it next meets.  If the state does not
comply with the law and hand out the funds soon, Delk says parents
will file a lawsuit against the state.  School choice enthusiasts
estimate that each student would be entitled to as much as $3,800
under the law. 
<P>
Wisconsin.  
  <P>   Low-income families in Wisconsin, with the help of the Kansas
City-based Landmark Legal Foundation, are asking a federal court in
Milwaukee to declare unconstitutional the Milwaukee Parental Choice
Program's ban on religious school participation.  These low-income
families have been turned away from the plan, which provides a $1,600
voucher for children to attend the private non-sectarian school of
their choice,  because the participating private schools have limited
space.
<P>
     The lawsuit is being brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Land-mark's attorneys claim the prohibition on the use of a voucher at
a religious school is a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional
rights to the free exercise of religion and equal protection under the
law.  Landmark President Jerald L.  Hill declares that "The Milwaukee
school choice plan has been a tremendous success for those fortunate
enough to participate, but the plan's unconstitutional exclusion of
religious schools deprives hundreds of children access.  We want to
remove that barrier to educational opportunity for low-income children
in Milwaukee."
<P>
     Wisconsin State Representative Polly Williams, who steered the
Milwaukee plan through the legislature, enthusiastically endorses the
lawsuit.  "I am thrilled that Landmark Legal Foundation has returned," 
says Williams, "to help us empower more low-income families with
school choice opportunities.  Landmark's representation gives low-
income parents a fighting chance against the mammoth education
establishment." 
<P>
     The lawsuit will have important repercussions throughout the
school reform movement.  With California and other jurisdictions such
as Jersey City, New Jersey, including religious schools in their
proposals, the Milwaukee case could be crucial in finally clarifying
"church and state" issues in the politics of education choice.  This
could be the case that will finally bring genuine reform to the
American educational system.

PROFILE:  BUSINESSMEN LEAD CHOICE MOVEMENT
<P>
     As many business leaders struggle in their efforts to reform
America's failing schools, two business leaders, Joseph Alibrandi and
Bret Schundler, are having a profound impact on the education reform
debate.
<P>
     Joseph Alibrandi is CEO of the Los Angeles-based Whittaker
Corporation, a $190 million aerospace supplier, and is spearheading
Proposition 174, the California school choice initiative.  Formerly
chairman of the California Business Roundtable's Education Task Force,
Alibrandi believes that the biggest problem in education is the system
itself.  He is convinced that it will not be long before other top
business leaders will come to exactly the same conclusion that he did: 
school choice is the only hope for America's education system. 
Alibrandi maintains that until parents have the power to choose the
best school for their child, and can move education dollars to their
chosen school, the system will continue to fail the children. 
<P>

     Alibrandi emphasizes that school choice means the most to poor,
inner-city youngsters since they cannot afford to write out a check
for a private school or easily move to another neighborhood to find a
better school.  The only way to help these young-sters, he says, is to
allow an effective marketplace in learning to emerge through parental
choice.  Alibrandi is state chairman of A Better Choice, the state
organization behind Proposition 174, which will be on the November
ballot in California.
<P>
     Another businessman taking an active role in reforming the school
system is newly reelected Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler.  A 34-
year-old former executive at Salomon Bro-thers, the Wall Street
investment firm, Schundler overcame the city's long-entrenched
Democratic machine in November 1992 to become Jersey City's first
Republican mayor since World War I.  In May 1993, 68 percent of Jersey
City voters reelected Schund-ler to a full four-year term in a city
that is only 6 percent Republican. 
<P>
     One of Schundler's top promises is to put into place a radical
school-choice plan for Jersey City.  Like Alibrandi, he now believes
the key to reform is to allow parents to choose the school that best
fits their child's needs.  Schundler argues that "The root of our
problem is how government is spending our money -- the tremendously
low productivity of government spending because of its fixation on
bureaucratic approaches."
<P>
     Schundler hopes to introduce his school choice bill to the New
Jersey legislature early next year.  He will need a majority in the
legislature -- and possibly two-thirds -- if Governor Jim Florio wins
reelection in November and vetoes the plan.  If the bill passes,
Jersey City will be the first American city to have a city-wide school
voucher system 
<P>
     Alibrandi and Schundler are giving new hope and direction to the
many business leaders who have grown frustrated with
business/education partnerships that cost a great deal of corporate
dollars and yet often do not lead to tangible improvements.

FORTUNE HOLDS SIXTH ANNUAL EDUCATION SUMMIT
<P>
     In September, Fortune magazine sponsored its sixth annual
education conference in Washington, DC.  Participating were over three
hundred leaders in education reform, drawn from government, business,
and academia.  The conference, entitled "How Far Have We Come?" 
evaluated business efforts to reform education.
<P>
     Speakers at the conference included Secretary of Education
Richard W.  Riley, Massachusetts Senator Edward M.  Kennedy,
Pennsylvania Representative William F.  Goodling, Michigan Governor
John R.  Engler, and David T.  Kearns, Chairman and CEO of the New
American Schools Development Corporation.
<P>
     Many speakers pointed out the education reform achievements of
the business community, but both speak-ers and participants agreed
that these have only been modest.  As Fortune Managing Editor Marshall
Loeb said, "Education reform is clearly not happening fast enough. ..
.. ..  In this increasingly competitive global economy, our students
must be more than adequately prepared for the challenges that the
rapidly changing market demands." 
<P>
     Although school choice and other innovative reform ideas were not
discussed as much as they had been in some past summits, Governor
Engler urged business leaders to push for structural changes in the
education system.  Engler discussed the elimination of school property
taxes in Michigan, charter schools, and school choice.  He claimed
that most present-day reforms have been "tinkering around the edge of
the system" and failed to make a real difference.
<P>
     The November 1 issue of Fortune will cover the Education Summit.
<P>
     
ONCE AGAIN, SPENDING ISN'T EVERYTHING
<P>
     A state-by-state analysis, issued September 9 by the Washington,
D.C.-based American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the nation's
largest private, bipartisan membership association of state
legislators, is the latest blow to the notion that increased school
spending is the key to better education.  The ALEC survey, A Report
Card on American Education:  A State-by-State Analysis 1972-73 - 1992-
93, is the first extensive study since the U.S.  Department of
Education ceased publishing the State Education Performance Chart in
1990. 
<P>
     Since 90 percent of all school funding accrues at the state and
local level, ALEC's state-by-state figures are a better guide to
spending and results than the more frequently used federal funding
figures.  School spending has increased by 390 percent over a twenty-
year period (47 percent in constant 1992 dollars) while school
enrollment has decreased by 7 percent during the same period.
<P>
     The study compares state rankings in each of the following
assessments:  scores from the National Assessment of Education
Progress (NAEP), the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), and the American
College Test (ACT), as well as the school graduation rate. 
Consistently among the top ten in three or more of these assessments
were nine states:  Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.  With the exception of
Wisconsin and Wyoming, all these states were in the bottom half in
school spending.  And all of them spent at least 40 percent less than
the state with the highest amount -- New Jersey -- which was $10,561. 
<P>
     The two states showing the great-est overall improvement of test
scores in the past twenty years in the SATs were Mississippi (up 151
points, to rank 16th in the nation) and Alabama (up 146 points, to
rank 14th).  In terms of current annual school spending, they rank
50th and 40th, respectively.
<P>
     Although a few states with high spending levels do achieve high
academic rankings, there are just as many -- if not more -- states
scoring high while spending less (See BEI #29).  This shows that money
does not correlate with better quality. 
<P>
     For further information or a copy of the report, contact Noel
Card at ALEC, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C.  20002,
or call (202) 547-4646.
<P>
     
SURVEY SAYS PAVE PROGRAM A SUCCESS
<P>
     According to a survey released by Family Service America, Inc., a
nonprofit organization headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
Milwaukee's Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE) private
voucher program has successfully involved parents of low-income
students in their child-ren's education.
<P>
     PAVE is a non-profit volunteer  organization established to
provide families equal access to educational opportunities.  In 1992,
PAVE established a scholarship program designed to help low-income
families attend private and parochial schools in Milwaukee.  The
program funds half of the yearly tuition of children whose families
qualify to receive federal lunch programs. 
<P>
     The survey of 955 low-income parents whose children received
scholarships from the PAVE program found that parents are pleased and
that a majority of the parents are involved in school functions.  Some
96 percent of parents participate in school conferences while 67
percent regularly attend school meetings and 63 percent attend school
activities.
<P>
     According to the survey, parents of students in the PAVE program
also take an active role in their children's education at home.  The
survey found 94 percent of the parents read to their elementary school
children, the same percentage help with math problems, and 85 percent
assist with penmanship and writing assignments each week.  As one
mother of a PAVE scholarship student noted, "PAVE has dispelled the
myth that poor parents don't care about their children's education."
<P>
     Besides being involved in their children's education and school
activities, the parents are overwhelmingly satisfied with their
school, teachers, principals, and the amount their child is learning. 
Among the respondents, 90 percent of PAVE parents are satisfied with
their school choice.  Even the few parents (10 percent) who were
dissatisfied with their school choice were careful to point out in
their written comments that they were satisfied with the PAVE program
itself.  In addition, 96 percent were satisfied with the teachers in
their child's school, and 93 percent were also satisfied with the
principals.  The survey found that 96 percent of the parents were
satisfied with the amount their child was learning.
<P>
     Overall, the survey indicates that after the first year of the
PAVE program, it is well on its way to accomplishing the mission of
"providing the financial means for low-income parents to choose the
school best suited to their child's needs, just as more affluent
parents have done for years."
<P>
     For more information, write PAVE at 1434 West State Street,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53233, or call (414) 747-1580.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT></B>peaking in Galesburg, Illinois, in January, President Clinton proposed a federally 
funded job-training program "to keep the American Dream alive in the 21st century." 
Cost to American taxpayers: $3.5 billion a year.</P>
<P>	If he had driven about an hour north, Clinton could have visited a college campus 
that proves his program is unnecessary. DeVry Institute of Technology, headquartered in 
Oakbrook, Illinois, makes a handsome profit by offering a first-rate technical education to 
working-class students. This little-known school shows how private businesses 
outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Spend a little time in virtually any city in America and you'll see them -- in doorways, under bridges, poking through trash cans, begging for loose change. They are America's homeless. They no longer wear the face of the 55-year-old alcoholic man; they look more and more like young crack addicts, battered women and children, prostitutes, gamblers, and AIDS sufferers. On any given day, about 600,000 people are living either on the streets or in shelters trying to stay alive.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Americans are a compassionate people. But traditional approaches to the problem--promoted through government initiatives and many private charities -- have been so ineffective at treating the fundamental causes of homelessness that we must reconsider what it means to help our neighbors in need.
<p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">M</font>ost homeless programs fail because they protect lifestyles that produce homelessness and neglect the moral and spiritual means to overcome it. </h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Many government programs assume that homelessness is simply the absence of four walls and a roof. Usually it is not: The lack of affordable housing, though a problem, is not why most of these people have no permanent address. Most people in trouble economically have friends and families whose homes they could share temporarily if they choose to. The level of government spending on the problem likewise leaves deeper issues untouched. There are more than 60 separate federal programs that provide some form of help. The federal <a href="http://www.hud.gov/">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD) now operates homeless shelters and drug rehabilitation programs in every major city in the United States. But the rates at which the able-bodied homeless graduate to independence from these programs rarely rise above single digits. </td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	America need not settle for this level of failure. If anyone can testify to that, we can.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.iugm.org">International Union of Gospel Missions</a> -- whose staff members often emerge from the ranks of the formerly homeless -- has been helping the destitute break the cycle of dependence since 1913. Last year, our emergency services and long-term rehabilitation programs helped 14,000 homeless men and women achieve self-sufficiency. These were not "easy" cases. Thousands walked into our doors addicted to alcohol, heroin, crack cocaine, and other drugs. Many have been prostitutes, or veterans who couldn't adjust to civilian life. Many have committed crimes, served time in prison, and failed other rehabilitation programs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our experience teaches us that America needs nothing less than a reformation in the way we think about homelessness. Many traditional and government-funded approaches fail not for lack of money but for a deficit of vision: They do not treat the whole person. They neglect the familial and moral aspects of a person's life. They refuse to challenge the homeless person's fundamental way of thinking. Says Rev. Mickey Kalman, the executive director of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma City: "The philosophy of government homeless programs is to respect and protect lifestyles that produce homelessness."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most significantly, these programs ignore the central dimension of the problem -- the spiritual. After more than 35 years of trying to help homeless people with every imaginable problem, I cannot escape this fact: Men and women who walk away from their jobs, their families, and their homes do so because, fundamentally, they are turning away God and His claim on their lives. But government-funded policies, by definition, must exclude this vital dynamic from the discussion. It is a prescription predestined for failure.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Not only are government approaches not working, but government regulations continue to impede or thwart the most innovative programs. Labor laws, zoning issues, licensing requirements are all getting in the way of private, religiously based efforts to deliver effective care. Authorizing block grants and returning power to the states will not by themselves make much of a difference, because it's state and local governments that throw up some of the most egregious obstacles to our faith-based shelter programs. Moreover, much of government's regulatory itch is aggravated by blindness to the moral and spiritual causes of homelessness.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What follows are some of the dynamics of change: We make sure that these elements are present in all of our 245 rescue missions in the 210 cities in which we operate nationwide. Though our missions offer various educational, job-training, relational, and other skills, these three principles establish an ethical and religious foundation without which all our other efforts would amount to nothing. <p><center><b>The Faith Factor</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is very difficult to overstate the importance of the spiritual aspect of this problem. <i>Spiritual renewal is the fountainhead for personal transformation</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Enoch Walker was married and had a child he loved, a job he enjoyed, and a house in Washington, D.C. Then he began abusing alcohol and drugs, what he calls "the great removers" in his life, because they became more important to him than his family and friends. Soon his wife left him, taking their child. He became so abusive that even his dog left him. He lost his job, smashed his car, and started living on the streets.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Walker went through several rehabilitation programs. He doesn't know the precise number because he doesn't even remember some of them. Yet each time, he slipped back into addiction. "When I was functional, I would put on a nice three-piece suit and go and get the good jobs," he says. "But it was like putting a three-piece suit on a fish. Nothing would happen on the inside."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then he checked himself into the Gospel Rescue Ministries of Washington, D.C. There, he received not only mental and physical counseling, but something else -- spiritual guidance. As he says, "They reached my heart and . . . gave me an awakening." He has now been clean for three years, and is a self-employed carpenter with two other men working for him.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Walker's story is important because his background is so typical of America's homeless population. Homeless advocates are quick to point out that many of the homeless suffer serious or acute mental illness. They are correct. There are no easy answers for how to help heal these people and restore balance and normality to their lives. Many of them may never leave an institutionalized or group-home setting. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mentally ill, however, do not make up the majority of the people who walk into our centers. About 80 percent of the homeless who enter the City Mission in Cleveland, for example, show symptoms of substance abuse. At our Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, Michigan, perhaps 90 percent struggle with addictions that have helped spawn and sustain a whole set of destructive attitudes and behaviors. There is simply no way to get at those behaviors without first helping the addict break his or her addiction for good. Most government and traditional shelter rehabilitation programs are notoriously poor in curing addictions. Many do not even try.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But those that do suffer from a crucial flaw. Although grounded in the best of intentions, federal programs by law can only administer to mental and physical maladies, not the spiritual. Any homeless programs that receive federal funds "must provide shelter and other eligible activities in a manner free from religious influence," writes Michael Stover, HUD's assistant general counsel for the Rocky Mountain region, in a 1995 legal brief. "It may not provide religiously oriented services to persons using the homeless shelter and must not hire only persons from a particular religious persuasion." There it is: an explicit rejection of faith as the crucial component of change. This is why the overwhelming majority of our mission directors steer clear of government funding.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We've seen countless people wander into our shelters with a mind-wrenching addiction to crack cocaine, for example, and it's obvious to us that it takes more than physical and mental counseling to break that grip. Simply telling that addict to eat his vegetables and study the multiplication tables just isn't enough. Ask any of our mission directors, many of whom have 20 to 30 years experience helping the homeless: The spectrum of addictions and difficulties from which the homeless suffer have no long-term cure outside of a heartfelt commitment of faith. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Skid Row is not a geographical location," says Kalman, a former drug addict. "It's a heart condition. Unless you change a homeless individual's heart -- not just his mind and body -- he will remain homeless."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For this reason, all of our missions instill in homeless people the reality of a God who loves them, cares for them, and wants to help change them. In our view, based not only on our theology but on our experience, it is Jesus Christ, not any program, who transforms a man's or woman's life, who gives them the strength to summon the courage to break their destructive habits.<p><center><b>A Moral Incubator</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Hand in hand with faith commitment is the sustained determination -- both from shelter staff and the homeless themselves -- to stay clean, hold down a job, or save a marriage. <i>The homeless need an environment in which they are challenged to acknowledge and consistently renounce unhealthy behaviors; otherwise, they won't acquire the practical or emotional skills they need to succeed</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mouthing a religious commitment is not enough; there must be actions to match. Our shelters insist not on perfection, but on repeated, good-faith efforts to change. And with God's grace, and a disciplined environment, they do. "We not only place responsibility on our clients," says Rev. Carl Resener, the executive director of the Nashville Union Rescue Mission, "we demand that, as a condition of living at the mission and participating in its programs, these men and women change their destructive habits."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is one reason our shelter programs span several months. It gives the homeless time not only to rid themselves of their addictions, but also to build a foundation of faith, education, and social skills necessary to succeed in life. Consider our Regeneration Program at our Miami Rescue Mission. Rev. Frank Jacobs, the executive director, oversees an eight-month recovery program for 130 men. Bible study is mandatory. The men commit to memory biblical passages--they call them "arsenal verses"--that address behavioral problems such as drunkenness, laziness, and theft. The mission also offers a three- to four-month period of daily instruction on coping and social skills, with a heavy emphasis on relapse prevention.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Listen to Raymond Nastu, a drug addict arrested more than 80 times for offenses ranging from drug possession to brawling. He checked into the Bridgeport Rescue Mission in Connecticut. "I should have been dead so many times I can't keep track of them," he says. But the mission's strict regimen and climate of tough love turned him around. "I never had people care about me the way they do here, and that gave me the hope and courage to believe I could change." Today, Nastu is drug free and works as a carpenter. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now compare that to some of the larger shelters in the country that place virtually no conditions on their residents. The results have not been pretty. Take the Mitch Snyder Shelter, in Washington, D.C. It is named after the homeless activist whose 1983 hunger strike prompted the Reagan administration to renovate a federal building so that it could be used as a homeless shelter. As documented by a <i>60 Minutes</i> expose, this shelter has been a haven for the selling of crack cocaine and liquor, as well as misuse of charitable funds and general corruption.<P><center><b>Friends and Family</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Our missions place a heavy emphasis on rebuilding relationships -- to one's family, friends, and religious community. <i>Positive relationships are a vital link between the homeless and lasting rehabilitation</i>.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We don't always want to put our clients back with their old friends because sometimes the old friends are the problem," says Rev. George Verley of the Union Gospel Mission in St. Paul. "However, the worst thing in the world is for them to be alone, so we teach them to establish relationships. It's vital that they have this support structure when they leave us."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is probably one of the most overlooked elements of most traditional and government-funded shelter programs. The homeless typically are treated in utter isolation; little attempt is made to reconnect them to family members. Yet when caregivers don't know a person's family background, it often becomes much more difficult to discern the most effective ways to help. <p><table>
<tr width=80>
<td hspace=5>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many shelters, fearful of crossing church-state lines, do not even introduce the homeless to religious communities that could offer support. The Salvation Army shelters are a noteworthy exception here, but the majority of shelters have no process for helping a recovering addict plant roots in his or her community.</td><td><hr width=75><h3><font size="+3">T</font>he Department of  Housing and Urban Development says any shelter receiving federal funds must operate "free from religious influence." </h3><hr width=75></td> </td></tr></table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There may be no more important step for a formerly homeless person, however, than to be grounded in a community of caring, committed individuals. Listen to Enoch Walker again: "If you do not have people surrounding you who care about you and give you unconditional love and give you the time that it takes to work yourself through it and work with you, I do not really see too many people who can make it." The pressures of life, the temptations of the street, the siren call of old habits -- all can easily prove to be too much for the men and women struggling to get back on their feet.<p><center><b>The Government Albatross</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We know that these and other principles are crucial to effectively helping the homeless help themselves. Though we don't expect the people we serve to pay us a dime -- most couldn't -- that doesn't mean we have no expectations of them. "There are two root causes of homelessness," says Rev. Mike Edwards from the Los Angeles Mission. "Lack of relationships and lack of responsibility. Re-establishing a sense of both is key to our long-term success."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Success for us means much more than feeding people and keeping them safe, as important as those objectives are. Our aim is to help people break their addictions, learn basic life skills, and become honest, productive members of their communities. Over the last few years, we've conducted internal studies of our programs and the results are truly encouraging: The vast majority of our missions achieve success rates of more than 50 percent, with many achieving success rates of 70 or 80 percent. That means that most of the people who graduate from one of our programs become independent; a few slip back into old habits, but most remain addiction free, employed, and connected to family and friends.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Our success is also reflected in support from our communities. Eight years ago, the cumulative budgets of the 210 U.S.-based member missions in the International Union of Gospel Missions totaled $50 million. Today, IUGM counts 245 missions as members, and their cumulative budgets add up to more than $300 million. The overwhelming majority of our programs are funded privately, through individual donors, churches, and corporate sponsors. We don't require or expect government to lend a hand -- and it hasn't.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nor do we expect government to get in the way of our efforts -- but it has. There are several areas where government bureaucrats have been unsupportive or downright hostile to rescue ministries' efforts. These include labor laws, zoning issues, licensing, surplus food distribution, and disaster relief. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;v	Most of their objections stem from their reading (misreading, actually) of the First Amendment's religion clauses, designed to ensure citizens' basic religious freedoms. To which we respond: If we want a person to be truly free, that person must first be free of drugs. This is the promise rescue ministry fulfills.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Consider the following trouble areas:<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Labor.</b> For years, rescue missions have struggled with the issue of whether homeless men and women who do work in the missions as part of rehabilitation qualify as employees under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/206.html">Fair Labor Standards Act</a>. In September 1990, the Labor Department determined that the <a href="http://w3.salvationarmy.org/saweb/home.htm">Salvation Army</a> had to pay the minimum wage to clients performing work as part of rehabilitation, unless the Army's location registered as a "sheltered workshop." (Sheltered workshops historically have been places handicapped people went for training, not live-in facilities.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After much political and legal wrangling, the Labor Department suspended enforcement pending further study. The policy remains in suspension, but has not been formally revoked.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Zoning.</b> City and county boards have stopped or interfered with mission programs across the nation. The Denver Rescue Mission is located in an area known as Lower Downtown or "LoDo." This was formerly Denver's Skid Row, an area where the destitute congregated. In recent years, however, the area has been redeveloped and now supports a burgeoning night life.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That welcome development has had a most unwelcome side effect: City officials have ratcheted up their efforts to curb the mission's work. For example, on cold nights, the 110-bed mission used to set up about 40 cots in the chapel to meet the increased need. City officials never raised any objection because it took people off the street. Today, city officials flatly prohibit this practice.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;City officials in Daytona Beach, Florida, have not allowed the Daytona Rescue Mission to locate within the city. The mission has gone to federal court. In Albany, New York, the Capital City Rescue Mission has been trying to relocate in order to expand its services. Recently, the city rejected the mission's request to move to a previously agreed-upon property. Other missions that have encountered significant roadblocks include the Union Gospel Missions of Dallas, Spokane, and Yakima, Washington.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Licensing.</b> The licensing of faith-based programs, beyond issues of health and safety, has become a major impediment to many missions' spiritual integrity. Licensing has brought regulations such as a "client's bill of rights" in Tennessee, which originally included the right not to be presented with religious teaching. (That's somewhat like organizing a football team and including the right not to be touched!) <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Then there is the case of the City Mission in Schenectady, New York. It was cited by New York's Department of Social Services because it prohibited pornographic materials from its facilities. Only after three months of negotiation did the mission and state authorities reach agreement that the mission was within its rights to prohibit pornography. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We determined that on health and safety issues, we would submit to government regulations," says Eivion Williams, the mission's executive director. "But this was an issue of morality -- what was right and what was wrong -- and we stood firm. And in the end, we wound up getting what we asked for."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Food Distribution.</b> For many years, rescue missions accepted federal surplus food and distributed it to the needy without excessive oversight or regulation. In December 1993, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture mailed a memo to missions in its Western region that stated that USDA commodities were not to be used in meals where individuals were required to attend religious services. This caused confusion among many mission directors who were uncertain how to interpret the new rules. On advice of counsel, some missions have turned down USDA commodities because they believe accepting the food would subject them to federal regulations that compromise religious teachings.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, one of the interesting contradictions of federal policy is that schools, day-care programs, and early childhood development classes operated by churches may serve surplus food -- even though their programs are grounded in religious beliefs. The government seems to believe that children in religious programs need good food, but homeless in religious programs do not.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tonight 27,000 people in America are staying in rescue missions. Each is being fed, sheltered, and assisted. Last year, rescue missions served more than 28 million meals to the poor and homeless. That's enough to provide a meal to every resident in the state of California. Yet each person is also being challenged with hope and opportunity. Our rehabilitation programs involve over 11,500 men, women, and children. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Rescue missions are poised to continue their dramatic growth and success. Drug rehabilitation programs are expanding to meet the increasing need. Computer training and educational programs are now staples at many missions, providing GED preparation, core curriculum classes, drivers education, and job training. Missions are also setting up joint ventures with local businesses to give reformed addicts on-the-job training. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, our optimism at the progress of our missions is tempered by the cold realities of the street. The face of homelessness in America is changing. It is getting younger and more female. Children, once a rarity at shelters, are showing up with increasing frequency -- and this cannot bode well for American society.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There are other problems. As Rev. Tom Laymon, the executive director of Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, observes, "There is an aging population in our prisons that will eventually be given back to society. Many will have spent decades in prison. This means a whole new generation of 'older homeless' will be out on the streets and in need of our services."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Amidst this trend, federal and state homeless and anti-poverty programs -- devoid of moral, spiritual, or religious counseling -- will continue to fail. The answer is not for government to get into the religion business, but, at the very least, to get out of the way of religiously based groups that are making a decisive difference in people's lives.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We have identified more than 100 American cities with populations of over 40,000 that are without a rescue mission. In 10 years, IUGM wants to have programs in each of these. Our hope and prayer is that missions around the country will demonstrate the power of a well-rounded program that nourishes mind and body, spirit and soul.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Rev. Stephen Burger</b> is the executive director of the <a href="http://www.iugm.org">International Union of Gospel Missions</a>. Also contributing to this article were Rev. Mike Edwards of the Los Angeles Mission, Rev. Del Maxfield of the Denver Rescue Mission, and Rev. Lee Schmookler of Goodwill Home and Missions in Newark, New Jersey.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those involved with rescue missions know the difficulties and dangers of inner-city life. Many, like Mickey Kalman, spent years on the street -- drifting, stealing, begging, and doing drugs -- until they reached out for help. Kalman, now the executive director of City Rescue Mission in Oklahoma City, was invited to speak at the 1996 Republican National Convention, in San Diego.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mickey Kalman's young life centered around alcohol. "I grew up with drunks and learned to drink," he says. He joined a gang. When he wasn't travelling and getting into mischief, he found trouble locally. At one point he pulled a gun on his teacher, threatening to "blow his brains out." By the age of 12, he was on probation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Later Kalman got involved with drugs. "Once I ran away with a shipment of dope, sold it, and hid out in Wyoming," he remembers. "When I didn't have money for gas, I siphoned it out of construction trucks."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One day he found himself in Stockton, California, alone and hungry. He'd been living on the streets for the better part of two years. He walked up to the door of a rescue mission and said, "Hey -- I'm hungry." The man at the mission offered Kalman some food and some work. He didn't usually get offers for work, but he agreed. Kalman decided to enter the rehabilitation program, where he found faith in God and the power to turn his life around.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, Rev. Mickey Kalman oversees a mission budget of $1.4 million, with a staff of 21. Thousands are helped by his mission every year. "Rescue mission work isn't easy," he says. "It's hard to love some of the people who come to us . . . [but] when they knock, I say, 'Come on in. My name is Mickey Kalman. How would you like to stick around and do a little work?'"

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>The Fresh Start Program (Los Angeles Mission).</b> Fresh Start has become a beacon of hope for addicts on L.A.'s Skid Row. Designed at the Los Angeles Mission, this 12- to 18-month program offers personal counseling, work therapy, a computerized learning center, physical education, and Bible study. Approximately 200 men are enrolled. Graduates of Fresh Start have set up an Alumni Association to assist with the transition back into the community. Over the last four years, 68 percent of graduates have left the streets, have established a residence and gotten involved in a local church, and have gained employment and stayed with that job for at least one year. Cost: $35 per person per day.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>New Life Rehabilitation (Denver Rescue Mission).</b> New Life Rehabilitation is a 6- to 24-month program for approximately 100 men and women. This five-stage program focuses on setting and meeting goals -- personal, educational, and behavioral. To help with the transition to the outside, the mission has a manufacturing business, Harvest Industries, in which recovering addicts earn money assembling musical products for a local corporation, Ultimate Support Systems. For single mothers and children, there is Champa House, which teaches educational and parenting skills while allowing each mother to work through her own personal issues. Cost: Less than $30 per person per day.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Harvest Home (Haven of Rest Ministries in Akron, Ohio).</b> Harvest Home is an emergency shelter for homeless women and children. In addition to food and clothing, it provides a variety of rehabilitative services including computer-enhanced education classes, parenting and life-skills training, individual counseling, expressive art therapy, and Bible study. Roughly 80 percent of Harvest Home's clients are chemically dependent when they arrive. Cost: About $35 per person per day.

<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Poor battered <a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com">baseball</a>. It's got more problems than the Detroit Tigers pitching staff. Among Generation X's favorite sports, it ranks somewhere between beach volleyball and Mortal Kombat. Its TV ratings resemble Greg Maddux's earned-run average, and you can count its marketable superstars on one of Ken Griffey Jr.'s fingers.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
But baseball is tops in one dubious category. There are unquestionably more boors in baseball than in any other sport. As the game battles to repair its tattered image, its legion of louts just battles--their fans, reporters, opposing players, even themselves. They rebuff autograph-hunters. They berate sportswriters (when they aren't hiding from them). They charge the mound whenever a pitcher dares to throw inside. And some even abuse themselves with alcohol and drugs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Fortunately, this isn't the whole story.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	There are many players who are doing much more than keeping tabloid reporters gainfully employed. They are as committed to their performance off the baseball diamond as on--old-fashioned role models for kids hungry to see even one adult stand by his word.	These players are using their resources and influence to help some of the neediest in their communities. Though most promote charitable causes, they are not merely mannequins on display for some local charity. Performance-based contributions--a homer for the heart association, a save for the Salvation Army, a grand slam for Goodwill--are fine as far as they go. But they do little to connect players with real people.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The players profiled below have found causes they believe in and turned themselves into vigorous and effective advocates. And they do not do so in the Hollywood style--joining a cause-of-the-month club, strutting into congressional offices or the White House to plead for a new government program or grant. It doesn't seem to have occurred to these men to ask government agencies or politicians to lend a hand.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	No, these celebrities are founding scholarship programs to give needy children a shot at college. They are small businessmen determined to create jobs where they live. They are mentors walking into inner-city classrooms and playgrounds and turning dust and debris into dreams. They're committed husbands and fathers for whom the word "sacrifice" means more than a way to advance a base runner.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	They are, in short, productive citizens.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"We're not all jerks," says pitcher Jeff Montgomery, of the <a href="http://www.kcroyals.com/">Kansas City Royals</a>. "A lot of us know that we have a responsibility not just to our teammates or to the fans at the games, but to the entire community."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Here are nine prominent baseball players--call them "all-stars in citizenship"--that constitute an impressive lineup of caring athletes:<p><b>Jim Eisenreich</b><br><a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/nl/phi"><I>Philadelphia Phillies</I></a>	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
It was 11 a.m. on a game day. On the upper floors of Montreal's Le Centre Sheraton hotel, "Do Not Disturb" signs hung outside the rooms of most Philadelphia Phillies. At that moment, Jim Eisenreich was a long way from his sleeping teammates. He was sitting in a home in a distant Montreal suburb. There, a nine-year-old victim of Tourette's Syndrome, his face and body twitching violently, listened as the ballplayer tried to comfort him.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"I've got a mission with these kids," says Eisenreich, his own Tourette's symptoms harnessed by medication. "I try to show them they can dream too."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The illness, which now afflicts about a million people a year, is a genetically transmitted neurological disorder that causes vocal tics and muscle twitches. This particular youngster's problems were so pronounced, he had stopped attending school. Not long after Eisenreich's lengthy visit, he returned.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Frustration, pain, and depression had infected his entire family," says Sue Levi, medical and scientific director for the Tourette's Syndrome Association. "Jim spent 90 minutes with that child and, according to the mother, the discussion literally changed her son's life. He was able to talk about his problems openly afterward and was a happier, more relaxed kid."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It is a story repeated wherever the Phillies travel. Eisenreich, whose own childhood was marred by the disorder and whose baseball career was interrupted by it, meets kids with Tourette's in every National League city. He escorts the youngsters and their families into baseball's inner sanctums, answers their questions, and, most importantly, concludes each session with a message.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"My job is to be a good ballplayer who helps his team win. But it's equally important that I help these kids," says Eisenreich. "I believe that's God's plan for me."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Phillies outfielder has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Tourette's causes and touched thousands of lives. Each week, he personally responds to as many as a hundred letters from victims of the disorder.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Sometimes, on the road, I'm up till 2 or 3 in the morning writing letters," says Eisenreich, who stands among baseball's most dependable utility players. "But I'd be in my hotel room anyway. I don't go out. I'm not a party person."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Now among the sport's most admired and well-liked players ("If you can't get along with Eisy, you're the one with the problem," says Phillies coach John Vukovich), Eisenreich had few friends growing up in Minnesota. "Other kids couldn't understand why I was making these strange noises and movements," he says. "They used to make fun of me. Their parents didn't like them playing with me."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But Eisenreich could play baseball, and by 1982 he was a Minnesota Twins rookie hitting above .300. The pressures of big-league baseball aggravated his problem, though, and in three big-league seasons he appeared in only 48 games. One night in Boston he actually walked off the field; after only 12 games in 1984, he walked away from baseball.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Everyone assumed psychological problems drove Eisenreich from the game until a Minnesota specialist diagnosed Tourette's. Three years later, armed with new medicine that gave him some respite from the twitching, Eisenreich began a comeback. He was traded to the Phillies in 1993 and ended that season by homering in Game 2 of the World Series. By then, when his story was well known, he had committed himself to helping others with the disorder.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"If I could ask one thing of people, it would be acceptance of us," he says. "They need to understand that we have no control over this."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Eisenreich and his wife, Leann, recently began the Jim Eisenreich Foundation for Children with Tourette's Syndrome, based in Kansas City, Missouri, his winter residence. Their goal is to establish a nationwide network of clinics where the afflicted can get counseling, support, and medical assistance.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"I don't want these kids to have to go through everything I did," Eisenreich says. "This work I do is my responsibility to them."<p><b>Dave Valle</b><br><a href="http://www.texasrangers.com/"><I>Texas Rangers</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Dave Valle's life changed 13 years ago amid a crowd of ragged youngsters at a ballpark in the Dominican Republic.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	As a 23-year-old playing winter ball in the hopes it would hasten his rise to the major leagues, Valle and his wife were met one night by a crowd of youngsters as they exited Santo Domingo's ballpark. It was hardly the Nike-clad, autograph-seeking crowds that big-league players encounter outside American stadiums.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"These kids had no shoes and very little clothing. They looked malnourished and they were begging for food," says Valle. "Right then I told my wife that if I was ever in a position to do so, I would come back here and help."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Two years ago, Valle and ex-Mariners pitcher Brian Holman decided that time had come. They founded Esperanza International (from the Spanish word for "hope"), solicited money, and sought advice on how the nonprofit agency could best deploy the funds in the Dominican Republic. "What we decided on was a program of microlending to women in the poorest of areas," says Valle. "We knew that to help the children, we had to help the women. In that culture, it's the women who are really involved in the nurturing of children. And the way it was there, unless they begged, stole, or sold their bodies, the children didn't eat."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Dominican women borrowed about $110 apiece. "That goes a long way there," says Valle. Holman, Valle, and other volunteers helped them start small businesses. Some sold chickens, a few did laundry, still others made articles of clothing. "We charged them 2.3 percent interest and they were required to save 10 percent of the loan's value while they were repaying it," says Valle.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The women borrowed money in groups of 15 to 20. Before any of them could get a second loan, they all had to repay the first. "It was a way of providing a little peer pressure, and it worked," says Holman. "More than 200 women have received loans and there has not been a single default. It has borne unbelievable fruit. Most of them are realizing profits of 300 to 400 percent on their loans."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Holman, retired for two seasons now, does most of the administrative work for the organization, which is based in Bellevue, Washington. Valle raises money and encourages other major-leaguers, like Seattle's Edgar Martinez, to join their cause. In the off-season, the 35-year-old Rangers catcher returns to the Caribbean nation to monitor Esperanza's work.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"I just believe that people as fortunate as us have to help," says Valle. "I just wish there was more I could do." Soon there might be. Valle's wife, Vickie, is Cuban; should the Castro regime tumble, Esperanza plans to set up a similar program there. "We'd like to help in the United States, too," Valle says, "but the problem is, $110 doesn't go very far here."<p><b>Mo Vaughn</b><br><a href="http://www.redsox.com/"><I>Boston Red Sox</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Boston educators will tell you that Mo Vaughn literally spends more time in the city's schools than some of the truants he's trying to reach. And his programs for inner-city kids go far beyond money and public-relations efforts. Vaughn, they say, has developed relationships with troubled teenagers, homeless mothers, terminally ill children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
"He has made a difference in the lives of many Boston youngsters," said Bob Elias, the director of Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD).<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Vaughn's parents were teachers and they instilled in their son two traits that linger still--a spirit of caring and an appreciation of education. The American League's Most Valuable Player in 1995, Vaughn is passionately involved in several education programs to help Boston's impoverished youth.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"These kids need to learn the value of an education," says Vaughn, a Seton Hall graduate. "Lots of times there is no one in their families who has been to college, maybe even no one who finished high school. They need to hear, in a personal-story kind of way, how it could change their lives."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Three years ago, he helped establish the Mo Vaughn Youth Development Program, an inner-city center where children gather safely for recreation and academic prepping. Volunteers tutor kids in classwork and in real-world work--they learn how to compose a resume, interview for a job, and open a bank account. "The main things we teach here are the value of education, self-esteem and learning a skill," says Roosevelt Smith, a program counselor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Baseball is my job," says Vaughn. "But my most satisfying day was the day we graduated eight kids to the next level in my program and I could see how it changed their lives. Some of these kids get a bad rap. They are facing tough situations every day and sometimes they don't make the right decisions. I try to spend time with them, to talk with them, because they want to know how life really works."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	ABCD director Elias says more kids are making the right decisions because of Vaughn. "He has had a definite influence for good. And the most impressive thing is that he wants to do more."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Vaughn, 28, also works closely with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston, paying for equipment and activities and escorting groups to Red Sox games. He also is a visible spokesperson for the Greater Boston Food Bank and Catholic Charities. "Mo Vaughn," says Red Sox coach Frank White, "can't say no. He is just a great young man. Baseball needs more like him."<p><b>Jim Abbott</b><br><a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/al/cal"><I>California Angels</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	If you peeked into the bedroom of an American child born with a physical deformity, there's a good chance you'd find some reference to Jim Abbott--a signed photo, an autographed baseball, perhaps even a framed letter from the Angels pitcher.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Born without a right hand, Abbott pitched the U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal in 1988, reached the major leagues a few years later and, in 1993, threw the first no-hitter by a New York Yankee in a decade. He is, in a way, the Jackie Robinson of handicapped athletes, a pioneer who changed his game and the perceptions of others.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"He has become an idol, an inspiration, a tremendous figure in the lives of these kids," says an Angels spokesman. "You wouldn't believe how much mail he receives from them. And he makes sure that every one of them gets some kind of response with a hopeful word."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Abbott works with numerous children's agencies, particularly Amigos de Los Ni&#241os (Friends of the Children), an organization that assists disabled, abused, and handicapped children. He frequently lectures, raises money, and signs autographs for the organization. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	But that's just the tip of the iceberg: Disabled children constantly seek out Abbott, and if they can't get to him, he'll track them down. The pitcher once showed up at a game between two teams of disabled kids in an Orange County  (Calif.) Little League. He walked unannounced onto the field, shook each youngster's hand, talked with them, and then pitched an inning.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"The kids didn't come back to earth for weeks," says league president Kim Weingarten.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	It's also not unusual for Abbott to spot a disabled child in the crowd after a game and bring the youngster onto the field. Several of Abbott's game balls now reside in these children's trophy cases. But he has something more to offer them than an autograph or a baseball. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Someone has to convince these kids that they can accomplish whatever they want in life and their disability won't stop them."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Like Johnny Appleseed, Abbott planted those seeds of hope and inspiration throughout Southern California in his first stint with the Angels. Now, after playing in New York and Chicago, he is back in Anaheim.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"When Jim was traded away it was like Orange County had lost one of its treasures," says Cindy Eigenhuis of Amigos de Los Ni&#241os. "He was so involved in activities for the kids. Now, thank God, he's back."
<p><b>Jeff Montgomery</b><br><a href="http://www.kcroyals.com/"><I>Kansas City Royals</I></a><br><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Even the most devoted baseball fans admit that the game lacks the action and pizzazz of basketball, football, or hockey. For Jeff Montgomery, that's the point: He contends that the slow pace of baseball makes it an ideal setting for a father to interact with his son or daughter. The rhythm of baseball--with its foul balls, pitcher substitutions, pickoff throws to first base, and so on--creates a great climate for father-child quality time. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Montgomery thinks a lot about fathering--so much so that he has become an important spokesman for fatherhood in Kansas City. "All the evidence suggests that kids need some kind of fathering input in their lives," he says. "For me, as someone who has a lot of visibility, I think it's important to be out there identifying good fathers and informing young men about the joys and responsibilities of being a parent."The pitcher has joined with the National Center for Fathering, a nonprofit agency based in Kansas City that is aggressively promoting the virtues of fatherhood. And in a nation in which nearly 40 percent of all children under 18 live apart from their biological fathers, the cause of fathering needs all the relief help it can get.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Montgomery recently recruited his entire family to star in a public-service announcement for the center. He appears at NCF fund-raisers and has persuaded other Kansas City athletes to publicly support the cause of fathering. He is the prime force behind an NCF-sponsored essay contest, in which children are asked to explain why their fathers are important to them.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"We're always looking for fathering advice," he says. "So I've been encouraging kids to write a brief essay on what their fathers mean to them. Some are not only touching and well written, but are of enormous benefit to the fathering center. They look at these essays and turn some of the messages into recommendations on how to be a successful father."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
When the four-year-old agency sought a prominent spokesperson for the virtues of fatherhood, Montgomery, it seemed, was recommended by everyone in Kansas City. "Jeff is extremely active in this community," says Peter Spokes, an NCF official, "and the work he has done for us has given our organization tremendous visibility."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Montgomery's life is indeed packed with charitable causes. The 34-year-old pitcher also helps the K.C. chapter of the American Heart Association, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the City Union Mission, the YMCA, and the Boys and Girls Club.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Montgomery was due to reveal the winner of the fatherhood essay contest on Father's Day, during a ceremony at the Royals' Kaufmann Stadium. The lucky youngster will walk to the mound, shake hands with the pitcher, read his or her essay over the microphone--"and, hopefully," says Montgomery, "every father at that game or watching on TV will go away a better parent having heard it."<p><b>Steve Finley</b><br><a href="http://www.padres.org/"><I>San Diego Padres</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Twenty-five teenagers from San Diego's worst neighborhoods stood nervously with 25 professional ballplayers on the first-base line at Jack Murphy Stadium. The players, all Padres, were there to help award the youngsters $5,000 academic scholarships. Center fielder Steve Finley stood there alongside Berenice Alcantara, a student at Palm Middle School.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Alcantara and her peers might never have gotten there without Finley's determination.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Shortly after a 1994 trade sent him from Houston to San Diego, Finley learned of the team's plan to start a scholarship program for impoverished, academically talented students. Though short of a tuition-waiver, the money could help put college within reach of needy kids. Great idea, he thought, but he had a suggestion.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Both my parents were middle-school teachers back home" in Tennessee, says Finley, 31, the National League's Gold Glove center fielder last season. "They were loving with their students but they could be tough too. In fact, my dad, who was a principal, had a plaque on his desk that said, 'Attila the Hun.' But they always insisted that the time to reach out to kids, to get involved in their lives in a positive way, was when they were in middle-school."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Steve Finley remembered what "Attila" had told him. He convinced the Padres to aim the program at kids in middle-school, not high school, because "that's when kids are most susceptible to the lure of drugs and the streets," Finley says. "By high school, it might be too late. With a program like this, we'd be able to identify them as young teenagers and say, 'Hey, don't worry. You are going to college.' " <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Padres liked the idea and after much locker-room arm-twisting by Finley, the Padres Scholars program was launched. Finley guaranteed that he could raise $60,000, and the club said it would match the total. "You never saw anything like it," says Charles Steinberg, the Padres' director of community development. "There was Steve, carrying a yellow legal pad, walking slowly from locker to locker in the clubhouse, soliciting donations from his fellow players and convincing them of the worthiness of his cause."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Almost immediately he signed up Tony Gwynn, Ken Caminiti, Brad Ausmus, and other Padres stars, as well as manager Bruce Bochy and his coaching staff. He was so convincing that many of his teammates soon became as active in the program as Finley. When San Diego traded pitcher Andy Benes to Seattle late last season, his final act as a Padre was to walk into the front office and write a check to the program for $10,000. And when Finley collected a bonus for winning the Gold Glove, he turned over a big chunk to the Scholars fund. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"This is something we should have been doing for a long time," says Finley. "Players and owners should be working together in their communities. And education is a common denominator."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Finley and Alcantara have grown as close as teammates through the Padres program. The ballplayer keeps an eye on her academic progress and is often the first one the teenager calls when she scores well on a test.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"This is definitely a two-way street," he says. "We're helping these kids, but we feel as if we're doing something for ourselves and the community, too. Sometimes as players, we get asked to help so many different causes that it's hard to see the benefits. But with this program, we sponsor individual kids and we see them. . . . We can see first-hand their progress and how this affects their lives."<p><b>Don Mattingly</b><br><a href="http://www.yankees.com/"><I>New York Yankees </I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Don Mattingly wants to play baseball again. And if, later this season, a team decides to call the 34-year-old former Yankee first baseman, he's easy to find: He has a couple of businesses to run.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	A native of Evansville, Indiana, Mattingly operates two small businesses in his hometown. He lends his sweat, not just his name and money, to Mattingly's 23, a restaurant and sports-bar downtown, and Diamond Five Farm, his horse farm in the Indiana countryside. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	His roots in Evansville mean a lot of people are watching to see how well his businesses perform. And that means he must spend a lot of time not only building up his operations, but the network of locals who will help them to thrive.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
"I'm from Evansville," says Mattingly, speaking from his farm. "What happens here affects everyone who lives here and that includes me--especially since I'm not playing this year." 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Mattingly opened the restaurant, named for his uniform number, a decade ago, and bought the horse farm in 1993. "He would be in the kitchen cooking something up, or in the office checking on some numbers," says Kevin Edmonds, the restaurant's general manager. "He even got involved in some of the hiring himself. He was a very hands-on owner." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The restaurant-bar, which can seat 350 and serves traditional American fare, employs about 40 people. Mattingly drifts in often, making sure people are getting seated, looking over the menu to see what's hot with customers, and checking on new employees. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"There are a lot of players who, having made their fortune, will move to a sunny beach somewhere and build a wall around themselves," says Ray Shulte, the player's agent. "Some get involved in business, invest some money, let someone use their name and then wait for the checks. Not Don. He feels a responsibility to Evansville. And by being a successful businessman there, he is giving people work and giving something back."<p><b>Jeff Brantley</b><br><a href="http://www.majorleaguebaseball.com/nl/cin"><I>Cincinnati Reds</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Jeff Brantley hails from Jackson, Mississippi. To grow up in a poor city in one of the nation's poorest states is to know something about poverty. Brantley watched how a welfare system helped to ensnare families in ramshackle neighborhoods, creating places where there were too many kids with too little to do.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Those kids had nothing," he says. "No opportunity. No hope."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Not even baseball. "Even if they wanted to play baseball, they had no equipment."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	So three years ago, Brantley, 32, decided to start a baseball league in Jackson's largely African-American west side. The Calvary Youth Baseball League began with eight teams and roughly 60 boys, ages 9 to 12. Today it has grown to 150 boys and 10 teams.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"He didn't just lend his name to that project," says Cal Wells, a close friend. "It was an eight-team league, a great project, and he got the whole thing together. He provided the money and the equipment. He got the ballpark and personally got involved in finding the coaches."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
To Brantley, the coaches are crucial. They help set a tone, an attitude. "He wanted to make sure that the coaches were people of character, people the kids could look up to. He was as hands-on as you could possibly be, and yet he wanted his involvement kept real quiet," says Wells, a Jackson attorney.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	For every good thing you know about Jeff Brantley, Wells says, there are 10 good things you don't know. One day last winter, the pitcher heard that a child dying of cancer had asked a shopping-mall Santa for a ball autographed by Jeff Brantley. "A few days before Christmas there was a knock at that family's door," Wells says. "There was Jeff, delivering the ball himself."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
 A religious man, Brantley said the combination of his Christian ideals and his professional good fortune compelled him to get involved in the lives of disadvantaged youngsters. "It's not so much a sense that, 'Well, I've done real well, I've got to help others,' " says Brantley. "I have a strong faith and I saw a need out there for kids to have some direction in their lives."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Mississippi State graduate got the idea for his hometown league early in his big-league career, when he was a Giants reliever. Brantley worked with a youth baseball league in a drug-plagued section of San Francisco. "There I just sponsored the team," he says. "But even at that level of involvement you could see the potential for good."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Brantley knew that to alter conditions in Jackson he needed to touch the parents as well as the children. League rules stipulate that the parents of players must attend a certain number of games and lend a hand in league activities. "The way I look at it," says Brantley, "the league is a little evangelism, a little baseball, a little fun."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	And a lot of Jeff Brantley. <p><b>Craig Biggio</b><br><a href="http://www.astros.com/"><I>Houston Astros</I></a><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	A Sunday afternoon game concludes at the Astrodome. Half-dressed Houston players linger at their lockers, talking with reporters or each other, picking at plates of postgame food, waiting for treatment in the trainer's room. Craig Biggio is dressed and heads for the door.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Told the kids I'd take them out for ice cream," explains the all-star second baseman.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Baseball separates families for most of the year and, more than other sports, confronts its players with constant temptations on lengthy road trips. "Anybody who thinks it's easy to maintain a normal family life in baseball is fooling themselves," says Pittsburgh Pirates manager Jim Leyland. "Just look at the number of second and third marriages in the game. It requires real effort and commitment on everyone's part."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	And, according to many in baseball, no one works harder at his family life than Biggio.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"Like it or not, we are seen as role models by kids," Biggio says, "and if they can see an athlete they admire in a healthy family relationship, maybe it will have some sort of influence on their lives." So, while many ballplayers shelter their personal lives, he and his family--wife Pattie and sons Connor, three, and Cavan, one, make it a point to live much of theirs in public.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	Biggio believes that a family is not unlike a baseball team. Its members function best when they function as a unit. So it's not unusual to see the Biggio clan at a black-tie charity affair--with high chair and baby nestled among the diners--or in the children's unit of a Houston hospital.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Biggio family's activities add a new meaning to the expression "family planning." "Craig's schedule is a very carefully orchestrated affair," says Gene Pemberton, the Astros' community-development director. "He leaves ample time for baseball, of course, but they make sure there is time for their causes."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	"The all-American family is a clich," Pemberton says. "But in Craig's case it really applies. He and his wife and two kids do everything together. And he gets a lot of requests for his time, naturally, but he won't do anything without clearing it first with Pattie. A family man is what he's all about."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	A pet project of the Biggio family these days is the Houston chapter of the Sunshine Kids, an organization that tries to fill the needs of terminally ill youngsters and their families. Whenever the Astros are at home, Biggio and his family visit sick children, either in local hospitals or in their homes.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	You could say they belong to a sort of extended family--and no one's family is extended more than Biggio's. Which is just the way he wants it.<p><I>Frank Fitzpatrick is a sportswriter with the Philadelphia Inquirer.</I>

<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the late 18th century, Catherine the Great's favorite field marshal and reputed lover, Grigori Potemkin, built phony villages one block deep throughout Russia's Black Sea provinces to give the tsarina a false sense of the region's prosperity. Two hundred years later, cynical denizens of Atlanta's poorest communities might wonder if the Olympic stadium and the surrounding Olympic village amount to a modern Potemkin village.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like any Olympic host, Atlanta is putting on its best face for its visitors. The Atlanta Committee for the <a href="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org">Olympic Games</a> is spending $1.7 billion and employing 99,000 workers to show the world the best of Atlanta and America. Indeed, the underwriting of Atlanta's expenses by home-grown corporate powerhouses such as Delta Airlines and Coca-Cola demonstrates one of Atlanta's greatest strengths: As one of America's entrepreneurial capitals, Atlanta is a thriving commercial center. A bastion of black enterprise, the city also boasts many distinguished universities and the world-champion Braves baseball franchise.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like most American metropolises, however, Atlanta also suffers from staggering urban blight. With 27 percent of its overall population, and 43 percent of its children, living in poverty, Atlanta rivals cities like Newark, New Jersey, as a center of decay and degradation. Forty-two percent of its households are headed by single women. Of America's 100 largest cities, Atlanta ranks second in its rate of violent crime.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many of the organizations charged with battling these social scourges have bungled. Take <a href="http://www.emory.edu/CARTER_CENTER/urban.htm">The Atlanta Project</a> (TAP), the multi-million-dollar nonprofit founded by Jimmy Carter four years ago to organize and stimulate 20 of Atlanta's most depressed communities. An internal audit of the organization's activities, released in January 1995, criticizes TAP for cultivating little input from the communities it serves, imposing cookie-cutter solutions from a bureaucratic central office, and focusing too much of its resources on small feel-good events like community clean-ups. TAP has faltered so badly that it recently eliminated all of its 89 full-time positions as part of a major restructuring effort. TAP's greatest achievement to date: consolidating application forms for social services from 64 pages to 8. All of this for $33.6 million.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If TAP typifies the flashy, top-down approach to community renewal, what follow are stories about the squads of private agencies engaged in a bareknuckled bout with poverty, homelessness, and crime. Unlike many nonprofits serving America's cities, these are not publicly funded extensions of government agencies. Nor do they receive the fanfare of an Olympic event. A tour of some of these ragtag, innovative organizations, each the product of dedicated citizenship, reveals what works in easing urban pathologies--one person, one family, one neighborhood at a time.<p><b>Victory for the Homeless</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Homelessness is one of Atlanta's most persistent social problems. Task Force for the Homeless, an Atlanta nonprofit that runs a hotline for the homeless, received requests for shelter from about 24,000 individuals last year alone--a thousand more than in the previous year and two thousand more than in 1993. "We need folks who come at the homeless problem from a tough-love approach," argues Russ Hardin, of the Atlanta-based Joseph B. Whitehead Foundation, which gave $3.9 million last year to organizations fighting homelessness.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;They don't get much tougher than the church-based Victory House at 979 Boulevard SE, run by pastor Craig Soaries. Though it's the only shelter in Atlanta, according to Task Force, that admits people while they're still high--most of its residents are alcohol or drug abusers--they don't stay that way for more than an evening. The pastor's detoxification program is simple: Anyone who expects to receive Victory House's assistance must quit cold turkey.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The men's regimen has the feel of a boot-camp. Residents must wake by 7 a.m. and be at work by 9 a.m. Because ready cash is a quick ticket back to drug use, residents cannot work for money their first 30 days. Soaries gives them maintenance work on Victory House property and has them help with the shelter's fast-food, used-furniture, and used clothing businesses--all excellent incubators for learning job skills. After 30 days, those who are ready seek full-time employment while still at the shelter. They pay $50 in rent and place one-third of their salaries in a mandatory savings account. The men must observe a curfew, forswear smoking and cursing, and seek permission to leave the premises.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Last year Victory House took in about five hundred men and provided fifteen hundred with food and clothing. It has helped 12,000 men since it opened in 1992. Hundreds are off the streets and in the workplace: According to an internal study, 75 percent of the men who participate hold down a job and stay drug- and alcohol-free at least six months to a year after leaving the three-month program.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Soaries credits the program's spiritual content more than its regimen for its long-term success. Though men are not required to make a faith commitment to stay at the shelter, all must attend worship service Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday. They must also participate in group prayer and counseling on Thursday and hold daily devotionals.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I do not apologize for who I am," says Soaries. "I have no other answer to addiction than the Scriptures."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ed Lindsey is 40 years old and had failed at drug rehabilitation three times before coming to Victory House. Says Lindsey, "Soaries was the first person to tell me that I didn't have a drug or alcohol problem but a problem with my inner spirit." Lindsey has been clean for eight months. To Soaries the message is clear: "Without a spiritual element, we would not be successful."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Soaries' Bible-based approach to helping the homeless compels him to avoid most government funding. Most government contracts, for example, would prohibit his program from requiring attendance at worship services. As a result, Victory House gets 85 percent of its $152,000 budget from corporate and individual donors. The remainder comes from government contracts that do not infringe upon the spiritual content of the pastor's program--such as funds for certain capital expenditures.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A sign in front of Soaries's nondenominational church reads "Tired of Just Going to Church? Expect a Miracle Tonite!" Miracles seem to be happening in the inner lives of the residents of 979 Boulevard SE.<p><b>Four Walls and a Dream</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many advocates for the homeless insist that a lack of affordable housing is the principal cause of long-term homelessness. The success of groups like Victory House demonstrates that, for those literally "on the streets," drug and alcohol addiction is often the culprit. But there are many low-income families, living in cramped yet expensive apartments and run-down housing projects, who know first-hand how little decent, affordable housing there really is. For these people, homeownership is a dream out of reach.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Just ask Constance Vining, a working divorced mother of six struggling to make ends meet. "I never thought I'd be a homeowner," Vining says. "I never thought I'd be able to scrape together a down payment."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;She didn't have to. At 46, Vining has become the first member of her family ever to own a home. It wouldn't have happened without Charis Community Housing, a nonprofit urban-development program helping Atlanta's working poor (families earning $18,000 a year on average) become homeowners.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Charis helped Vining finance and build a new house in Atlanta's Summerhill neighborhood in exchange for an in-kind down payment: her "sweat equity" in helping to construct her own home. Now Vining pays $296 a month on a zero-interest loan for a one-story, three-bedroom, one-bathroom house. Previously, she had rented a run-down, two-bedroom apartment that cost her $550 a month and left her nothing to show for it. "Now I have something to leave my children. My dream has come true," she says.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Charis is a subsidiary of a community-development corporation called FCS Urban Ministries, which coordinates the ideas and resources of local and suburban churches. (FCS stands for Family Consultation Services, although the organization is recognized only by its initials.) Charis has built 128 such homes since 1982. It is supported by three thousand volunteers, and 99 percent of its funds come from the private sector.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Candidates for Charis housing are put through a rigorous screening process. Charis reviews credit reports, scrutinizes character references, assesses current living conditions, and interviews candidate families--twice. It chooses only eight out of every 100 applicants. Those selected must participate in seminars on everything from home maintenance to budgeting, and receive financing deals similar to Vining's. In many ways, Charis follows the model of Habitat for Humanity, the low-income homebuilder based in Americus, Georgia. But there are a few interesting twists. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Charis builds houses in mixed-income bunches called "subdivisions." Only one-third of the homes built on Charis-bought property are targeted for the working poor. Charis volunteers and future homeowners build these homes. But Charis invites outside contractors to develop the rest of the property, building one-third of the remaining homes for lower middle-income families and one-third for middle-income families and above. "We don't want to recreate low-income neighborhoods," says executive director Nancy Flippin.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, Charis's commitment to its beneficiaries doesn't end when the last door is hung. "You don't change somebody's life just because you put them in a new house," says Flippin. Charis homeowners make a commitment to maintain their homes and are subject to surprise inspections and foreclosure if they don't keep their end of the bargain. Charis relies on an informal network of volunteers living in the communities it serves to help Charis beneficiaries tackle the challenges of homeownership and make sure Charis homeowners succeed.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The overwhelming number do succeed. Program officials have had to foreclose on only five homes. "I was even happy to file a tax return when I could first file as a homeowner," laughs Vining. Charis homeowners in Summerhill once banded together to shut down a crack house. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Aretha Smith, a 36-year resident of Summerhill, sums up what homeowners like Vining mean to her neighborhood: "Most of them are working people over there. They're bringing the neighborhood back. Whatever they do, I just hope they keep building."<p><b>Alternative to Failing Schools</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As in many big cities, Atlanta's public-school system is costly, yet not terribly successful. It spends $6,495 per student--more than school districts in Detroit, Chicago, and Los Angeles--and its students on average score just 760 on the  combined SAT, below the 30th percentile on both the math and verbal sections.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mirroring organizations in Indianapolis, San Antonio, Milwaukee, and other cities, the Children's Education Foundation (CEF) gave scholarships to 128 Atlanta school children this year to help them escape this system. CEF students now attend 45 private, mostly religiously affiliated schools and one suburban public school. Each scholarship covers half of a student's tuition up to $3,000; the average stipend is about $2,000.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;CEF was founded with a $1-million grant from an anonymous private philanthropist, who has donated an additional $300,000 to cover the foundation's operating expenses and to ensure that his original investment goes directly to foundation scholarships. Families of four earning less than $28,000 per year and families of two earning less than $18,500 are eligible for scholarships, and students are awarded stipends on a first-come, first-served basis.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"My two oldest children were in public schools for two years and they had a very hard time," says Sandra Carter, a 16-year teaching veteran and mother of five, of her children's experience at Dodson Drive Elementary School. "My son was beaten up almost every day, and my daughter wasn't learning." Jason Grandison, a sixth-grader who attended West Clayton Elementary School, in College Park, recalls similar experiences. One boy even brought a gun to school. "I didn't learn much," says Jason, who had homework only one night a week and complains that his classes were too large for teachers to afford him much attention.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now Jason attends St. Anthony's Catholic School, in Atlanta's West End. Jason, who isn't Catholic, trots to school every day in his uniform--a yellow polo shirt and blue slacks. With class size averaging 15 students, Jason and his fellow students receive plenty of individual attention. He is kept busy after school with tutoring sessions and extracurricular activities--opportunities missing at his old school. There is no violence at St. Anthony's; rules are strictly enforced. And Jason gets homework every night. "Even Fridays," Jason says.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result: Jason's grades are up, he is more engaged in school, and he has stayed out of trouble. CEF president Chuck Johnston reports that every recipient has improved his or her performance while on scholarship. None has ever had a scholarship terminated for poor grades or bad behavior.	But the attention, discipline, and academic training that students receive at CEF schools only partly explain these academic achievements. Scholarships normally cover only about half of a student's tuition costs because parental involvement is considered critical to the program's success. "We have found the success rate is considerably higher when the parent is making a sacrifice," Johnston says.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Jason Grandison's mom, a single parent earning just $12,000 a year, has moved them into a single-bedroom apartment so they can afford Jason's $3,200 tuition. With that kind of love, it's hard to imagine that Jason will pass up his opportunity, or that his mother will let him.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Parents don't seem to mind. "Education is a partnership, which means parents must do their share," says parent Quinette Igherighe. And with that attitude, one man's philanthropy is becoming a winning investment. Says parent Gladys Porter, "For the future, in return for his money, he's going to get a lawyer, a teacher, and an engineer--my three kids."<p><b>Altruism for Credit</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In any large city, hundreds of children drop out of school each year and get into trouble with the law. Metropolitan Atlanta's juvenile courts monitor 4,200 children on any given day through detention, probation, and counseling services. Most of these young offenders graduate neither from school nor from crime-ridden streets: Nearly 60 percent of them become repeat offenders, and 30 percent eventually move on to the adult court system.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clayton County's experience with juvenile offenders is typical of the metropolitan area. In 1995 alone, juvenile court there received about 3,400 youth offenders for misdemeanor and felony offenses. Clayton County probation officers are each responsible for as many as 250 juvenile offenders.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So when local karate instructor Debbie Swank approached the juvenile court, offering to work with young offenders, harried veteran probation officer Suzanne Igler recalls saying, "This is a waste of my time. Let me go back to my work." Now Igler volunteers for a private agency that Swank founded to help the county's youngest delinquents.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Swank founded Hearts to Nourish Hope, based 20 minutes southwest of downtown Atlanta, to provide troubled teens with unconditional love and a sense of family. A labor of money as well as love, Debbie started Hearts with funds from her karate school, American Tang Soo Do. Now Hearts takes in 60 to 75 juveniles on probation a month. The centerpiece of its program is a food pantry operated totally by the kids.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Working the pantry gives the teens valuable job training. They must report to work on time, maintain the facility (which doubles as Swank's karate studio), manage finances, take inventory, and solicit donations.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;They also abide by a strict set of rules. Time earned toward their community-service requirements can be canceled if they shirk business responsibilities, disrespect their elders, wear gang clothing, or stir up mischief.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Anyone who has received food more than once is required to volunteer at Hearts. "We don't want to just give out food," says Amber, 15. "If you're trying, okay. But if you're just going to sit around, then you're not going to get our food."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the pantry is much more than just a job-training program for wayward youth. The experience transforms the children, many of whom come from broken families. "Sometimes I'll come here feeling gloomy and mad at someone or something," says "T," a 15-year-old who came to Hearts after committing five burglaries. "But when someone comes for a basket [of food], it makes you feel good to have helped somebody. " 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Hearts's success is best gauged by the number of teens who participate in the program but don't have to. More than one-third of the teens who perform their community service through Hearts come back after their time is up.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider Kristy Brown, who has been incarcerated six times. On January 31, she completed 95 days in prison for totaling an uninsured car while drunk. Since her release, she has remained clean, is working as an apprentice in a hair salon, and has just taken her GED exam. She attributes her recent victories to Hearts. "This place has made a real difference. Now I want to own my own hair salon and work with teens who have had problems like mine--to give them the help I've been given here."<p><b>Hammering Home Citizenship</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A consortium of construction firms is employing some of the entrepreneurial energy that has made Atlanta famous to build--literally--a better city.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A few years ago, FCS Urban Ministries wanted to convert GlenCastle, a three-story, 18th-century stockade, into affordable housing for the working poor. Atlanta's 11 largest building contractors--normally fierce competitors--collaborated on the project. They charged no overhead, no fees, and earned no profit. And they engaged in what project organizer Chris Humphreys half-jokingly calls "competitive begging": They convinced lumber yards, lighting stores, and other suppliers like Georgia Pacific, Home Depot, and Lithonia to donate materials or sell them to the contractors at cost. FCS trimmed its project expenses from an estimated $3.5 million to $2.5 million, a savings of nearly 30 percent.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now GlenCastle, with its three-foot-thick stone walls and an imposing watch tower, houses 125 people in 68 efficiency apartments. The residents include the mentally ill, the physically handicapped, recovering addicts, the elderly, and single-parent families.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"When we finished GlenCastle, no one expected it to keep going," says Humphreys. "But under their own initiative, the contractors got together and said, 'let's keep it up.' "	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In honor of its first project, the consortium calls itself GlenCastle Constructors, Inc. Over the last six years, it has built some of the most important nonprofit social-service ventures in Atlanta.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On land donated by Georgia Pacific, for example, they built Camp Twin Lakes--a 250-acre wooded summer oasis for kids suffering from chronic illnesses like cystic fibrosis, cancer, asthma, and kidney disease. They equipped the camp with a mini-hospital (including dialysis machines), and a wheelchair-accessible pool. GlenCastle delivered the project for $1.2 million less than it would have cost at market rates. Now about 2,000 children and 500 volunteers enjoy this privately operated and funded camp each summer. "Kids literally survive to get to their week at camp," says one camp counselor. "For some of them, it's the last fun thing they do."GlenCastle can finance its projects as cheaply as it does in part because it will not work for groups that receive government funds. If it did, federal law would mandate that it pay "prevailing union wages"--that is, above-market wages. Instead, union and nonunion workers labor side by side for the same wages. They also avoid mountains of paperwork. "We really don't do reporting," says Humphreys. "We don't want to explain how we bought paint when we got half of it for free."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These companies can also afford to divert their manpower and resources to GlenCastle projects because participation on a project by all 11 companies minimizes the burden incurred by any single company.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some still marvel to watch the city's leading construction firms collaborate on nonprofit projects. "I would have run over half these guys before the GlenCastle project," says Jimmy Humphries, the chairman of Humphries and Co. The 11 GlenCastle contractors beat each other up each day for 80 percent of the Atlanta construction market. But when it comes to helping the city's neediest, they have put their differences aside and their bulldozers together for nine major projects, with more planned.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The list of Atlanta's successful nonprofits doesn't stop here. There is Birthright International, which persuades 85 percent of the two thousand women who visit its Atlanta office annually for free pregnancy tests to bring their children to term. There is also Genesis Shelter, which provides transitional housing to homeless families with newborns and teaches 60 percent of them to achieve independence once they leave.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of these agencies share three keys to success. First, they are dedicated. They have to be, because they operate on shoestring budgets and rely heavily on volunteers and the 80-hour work weeks their leaders put in. Second, they are demanding--of their beneficiaries as well as themselves. And third, they are independent. Unencumbered by the regulations that come with government social-service contracts, they are free to be innovative and flexible.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Much of Atlanta's nonprofit community, however, rejects these lessons of effective social outreach. The Open Door Community, a co-operative of Christians dedicated to serving the homeless, is philosophically opposed to helping the poor help themselves, says resident volunteer Todd Chioffi. With Task Force, it protests violations of "homeless rights," such as ordinances against aggressive pan handling and loitering; and it rallies for the city to install public urinals so that, as one man living in the Open Door Community sloganizes, the homeless can "pee for free with dignity."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Metropolitan Atlanta Community Foundation, which hands out $12 million a year to groups like Task Force, Atlanta Legal Aid, and Georgians for Choice, refuses to give money to faith-based charities because "no one has the right to tie social services to religion." Says executive director Alicia Philipp, "In my mind that's preying on people."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whatever their rationale, much of the city's corporate and foundation philanthropy remains disconnected from the real gold-medal winners of Atlanta's nonprofit sector. This gap is costly both in human terms and in spiritual terms: It allows social ills to persist and prevents needy Atlantans from sharing in the dreams of achievement the Olympics inspire. But should these nonprofits accept the torch that organizations like Victory House, Charis, and GlenCastle hold out for them, they will be able to tackle the truly Olympian task of building not a Potemkin village but an Atlanta of flourishing, vibrant communities.<p><I>Christopher Garcia is the assistant editor of</I> Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.<p></blockquote><P>Subscribe to <A HREF="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html"><i>Policy Review: The Journal of

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Over the past few months, the V-chip has quickly become the most celebrated piece of computer circuitry in America. In swift succession, President Clinton championed this little byte of technology in his State of the Union address, Congress passed legislation mandating its use, and the major networks grumbled loudly about challenging the law in court. The drama finally culminated in February at a summit at the White House, where the TV industry's chieftains grudgingly accepted the president's challenge to do more for America's parents and create a ratings system compatible with the V-chip.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The story of the V-chip unfolded so fast, and its potential impact is so great, that the media has spent most of its time struggling to answer a host of basic questions: How does this signal-blocking technology work? When will it be available? How much will it cost? Will it live up to its billing? Some are still not even sure what the "V" actually stands for. (It originally stood for "violence," but it seems everyone has their own interpretation. I hope it comes to mean "values.")
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a Senate cosponsor of the V-chip bill along with Democrat Kent Conrad, I know these details matter, but I also believe the media's focus on them has obscured a larger point. Far more important than what the "V" stands for is what the coming of the V-chip tells us about the public's plummeting regard for the product that television delivers to our homes. Although this invention may merely be an irritant to those in the television business, to millions of Americans the V-chip is a surrogate for their anger at the entertainment industry for degrading our culture and our society.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	That anger is clearly reflected in any number of public opinion polls, which uniformly show that the public is fed up with the rising tide of sex, violence, and vulgarity in the entertainment media. These surveys are useful, but based on my conversations with people in diners, schools, and small businesses back in Connecticut, I believe they barely begin to measure the public's intense feelings toward television.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	My experience tells me that beneath the surface of the Telecommunications Revolution bubbles a revolution of another kind -- a "Revolt of the Revolted," as <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> and I have taken to calling it. It is being fueled by a growing sense that our culture is not only out of touch with the values of mainstream America, but out of control as well. Many people believe that there are no standards that television will not violate, no lines television will not cross. Broadcasters may see the V-chip as a threat to their independence and financial well-being, but many average citizens see television as a threat to their children and their country. In the V-chip, they perceive a modicum of protection for their families. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Why are people afraid of television? Much of the news media has focused on the violence, but that is only part of the problem. Millions of Americans are fed up with explicit sex scenes and crude language during prime time and with the pornographic content of those abysmal talk shows and soap operas during the day. They feel television is not only offensive, but on the offensive, assaulting the values they and most of their neighbors share.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	People are angry because they cannot sit down to watch TV with their children without fearing they will be embarrassed or demeaned. And they are angry because they feel our culture has been hijacked and replaced with something alien to their lives, something that openly rejects rather than reflects the values they try to instill in their families. In the world they see on TV, sex is a recreational pastime, indecency is a cause for laughter, and humans are killed as casually and senselessly as bugs. It is a coarse caricature of the America they love.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	David Levy, the executive producer of the Caucus for Producers, Writers, and Directors, aptly describes this situation as "television without representation." Some critics tell me that, in the zealous pursuit of the prized demographic cohort of young adults, the industry has shut out the rest of the public, and let the tastes of a few dictate the menu for all.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Average viewers may not be aware of market dynamics at work, but they certainly understand the consequences. They have a growing sense that the anything-goes mentality permeating our electronic culture contributes to the moral crisis facing America. I believe this notion -- that the contemporary entertainment culture is affecting our values in a deeply troubling way -- is at the core of the brewing cultural rebellion.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a very anxious time in our history. The bonds of trust that people once took for granted in their neighborhoods and schools and workplaces are withering, and the social order that once anchored their lives and their communities is breaking apart. Stability is giving way to an increasingly chaotic and threatening world in which a snowball fight can quickly escalate into fatal shotgun blasts, as happened recently on a major thoroughfare in the city of Hartford.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The source of this social breakdown, many people believe, is the collapse of fundamental values. A critical connection exists between the erosion of morals and the explosion of social pathologies around us -- brutal violence committed more and more often by strangers, the disintegration of the family, the epidemic of illegitimacy. In much the same way, many of us see a critical link between this erosion of values and the plummeting standards of decency on television and in our culture.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some in the entertainment industry continue to argue that they are merely holding up a mirror to our culture, and scoff at the notion that the entertainment culture is responsible for all our social ills. The time has come to take a torch to this straw man. Neither President Clinton nor <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> nor I nor anyone I know is suggesting that any individual entertainment product, or even the whole of the entertainment industry, has single-handedly caused the rise in juvenile violence or illegitimacy. We are saying that the entertainment culture is immensely powerful, more powerful than any lawmaker in Washington, and that this power is wielded in ways that make our country's problems worse, not better.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider a few facts. There are 95 million households in America with televisions, which means more households own TV sets than telephones. Sixty-five percent of those homes have at least two TVs, which on average are turned on seven hours a day. The typical child watches 25 hours of television every week. That is more time than most of them spend attending religious services, talking to their parents, reading books, or even listening to their teachers. Many kids spend more time watching television than any other activity except sleeping.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No one can seriously deny the potential influence that kind of constant exposure carries with it. And because of that power, those responsible for television programming do not just mirror, but also mold, attitudes and behaviors. Whether they want the responsibility or not, they are influencing our values. And whenever they air degrading programs, they contribute to -- not cause, but contribute to -- the moral and social breakdown we are suffering.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	So many studies have documented the threat posed by steady exposure to violence on television that the point should not even be subject to debate. But to add yet another voice to the mix, consider this passage from a stunning article Adam Walinsky wrote last year in the Atlantic Monthly, in which he warned of a coming generation of "superfelons" who when they mature will likely make the cities of today look peaceful:
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media violence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may feature scores of killings in two hours time, vying to show methods ever more horrific. . . . Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their listeners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill police. . . . These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you read."
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The media's messages are not transforming these young people into killers, Walinsky says, but they are feeding into a cycle of violence that is getting harder and harder to break and that has dire repercussions for our country. Much the same could be said about the effect of sexual messages sent to our children. No single show is corrupting America's youth, or creating the epidemic of teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases. But television as a whole says over and over to our children that sex is as devoid of consequences as a game of charades, and they are missing out on something great if they don't have sex right away. It is hardly surprising, then, that a recent poll of kids aged 10 to 16 found that nearly two-thirds believe TV encourages them to become sexually active too soon.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you still doubt the influence that television wields, just listen to America's parents. I cannot tell you how many times I've heard mothers and fathers say that they feel locked in a struggle with the powerful forces of the electronic culture to shape their children's values -- and that they're losing. They feel that television and the culture undermine their fundamental duty as a parent -- teaching right and wrong, instilling a sense of discipline -- and that their kids' lives are increasingly controlled by careless strangers a world away.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is why the concept of the V-chip is so appealing to parents. It offers them a silicon hard hat to protect their kids from television's falling standards. The implications of the V-chip's popularity are remarkable. The public feels so strongly that their children need to be shielded from words and images in the entertainment media that they are turning to the government for help -- not censorship, but help. Considering the low esteem with which Americans today regard Washington, this should tell us something about the public's faith and trust in the TV industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The public's fear and anger is understandable when you consider the industry's thoughtless response to its concerns. For instance, after hearing a growing chorus of complaints last year about the quality of prime-time programming, capped by last summer's debate in Congress over the V-chip, the major networks reacted by unleashing what critics widely assailed as the crudest, rudest new fall season in history. All too typical were scenes like the one from <I>Bless This House</I> on CBS, broadcast during the old Family Hour, when a female character said she was so sex-starved that she wanted to "do it on the coffee table." To that another character responded, "Don't you ever get your period?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This rash of vulgarity is only the latest step down in an ongoing trend. A study done by a research team at Southern Illinois University recently found that the frequency of indecent and profane language during prime time had increased 45 percent from 1990 to 1994.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the most disturbing thing about this fall's "slow slide into the gutter," as the <I>Hartford Courant</I>'s TV critic called it, was that much of it was happening in the 8 p.m. time slot when millions of children are watching. As the Media Research Center documented in a recent report, this crossover marked the death knell of the traditional Family Hour. Among other things, this study found that in 117 hours of programming reviewed over a recent four-week period, 72 curse words were used, including 29 uses of the word "ass," 13 uses of "bitch" and 10 uses of "bastard."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If these developments are not enough to drive parents to embrace the V-chip, then consider how several network executives responded recently to criticism of the decline in prime-time standards. One top official's justification was that "sexual innuendoes are part of life." Another said, "Society has become crasser, and we move with that." And yet another said, "It is not the role of network TV to program for the children of America."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After hearing these comments, I can't help but ask how these industry leaders would feel if I came into their home and used some of this kind of foul language in front of their children. I doubt they would stand for it. But why then do they feel it is perfectly acceptable and appropriate to use that kind of language in my home, in front of my child? That is essentially what is happening when they decide to send these shows into my living room -- they are speaking to me and my family, which includes my eight-year-old daughter.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The same question could be asked of the major syndicators who produce and distribute the daytime "trash TV" talk shows. I recently joined <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> and Sam Nunn in a public campaign to focus attention on these degrading, offensive, and exploitative programs. The point we are trying to make is there are some things that are so morally repugnant that they should not be broadcast for mass consumption, least of all by the eight million children who watch these shows regularly. The examples we cite, such as the teenage girl who slept with more than a hundred men, or women who marry their rapists, were unequivocally beyond the pale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Yet, although we have received comprehensive public support for our efforts, not one of the major communications companies that own the shows we raised concerns about -- such as Gannett, Tribune, Sony, Time Warner, Viacom -- would publicly acknowledge that their products were problematic in any way. Nor, to our disappointment, has the leadership of the broadcasting industry stepped forward to talk about this genre's excesses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Those same corporate leaders tried to kill the V-chip in its legislative crib, and for a long time they seemed prepared to pursue a court challenge at all costs. But to their credit, the networks and the National Association of Broadcasters dropped their opposition following the president's appeal in his State of the Union address and agreed (albeit reluctantly) to create a comprehensive, self-enforced rating system. Regardless of how it came to pass, this was a historic breakthrough. The tools offered by the V-chip and a ratings system will go a long way toward empowering parents to keep overly violent and offensive programs out of their homes and out of reach of their children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the industry must realize that these tools will not eliminate the fundamental problem that is fueling the deep-seated anger felt by so many Americans: the deterioration of the industry's programming standards. The V-chip is no panacea; the harmful messages abounding on television are still going to reach many young kids. Moreover, the V-chip is no substitute for network responsibility, for recognizing that the programming they send into our homes carries with it enormous influence. Simply put, the American public wants more from television than just good warnings on bad programming.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	There is some reason for hope. A growing chorus of voices within the industry is calling for fundamental changes in the way television does business. For instance, in a recent high-profile speech, Richard Frank, the president of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, recently said, "Why do you think people such as C. Delores Tucker, William Bennett, Tipper Gore, Reed Hundt and many others are attacking music and the media? Because <I>the reality is frightening</I>" (emphasis added). Frank went on to urge the industry to use the enormous power at its disposal to take some risks and set higher standards. "We cannot and will not ignore the important issues facing television," he said. "We must deal with them responsibly."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the most important steps the industry can take now to address the concerns we have raised, and to begin to restore public confidence in its programming, would be to adopt once again a voluntary code of conduct. I know that some in the creative community will charge that such a code is an attempt to chill their free speech, but the truth is that self-regulation is common sense, not censorship. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The time has come to recognize that not every aberrant behavior or hostile voice has the right to be featured on television on a daily basis, especially at times when large numbers of children are watching. That means asking the industry to draw some lines which programmers cannot and will not cross, something Court TV has already done by adopting a code of ethics for its own programming.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	I hope that the industry will include in any voluntary code they develop a commitment to bring back the Family Hour and to recreate a safe haven for children during prime time. The major broadcast networks would not only be helping parents by taking this step, they would also be helping themselves. There clearly is a market for high-quality, family-friendly material, as evidenced by the fact that Nickelodeon was the top-rated cable network in the nation last year. This channel has viewers that ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox could win back.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Lastly, we must not just focus on what is bad about television, we must also talk about what could be good and even great about television. One of the most revealing studies I've come across recently showed that at-risk children who watch <I>Sesame Street</I> score significantly higher on math and verbal tests than peers who do not. Just imagine what we could do for the nation's children if there were 20 variations of <I>Sesame Street</I> to choose from after school instead of 20 <I>Jerry Springers</I>. While that is not likely to happen any time soon, it's a safe bet that the president and many others will continue to push the industry to increase the amount of quality educational programming for kids.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These are just a few suggestions. The devil here is not in the details but in the big picture -- or rather, in all the troubling pictures and words the TV industry is pumping into our homes, and in the damage that the sum of those messages inflicts upon our society. The people who run television have a choice before them: Respond to this Revolt of the Revolted, or face the Sentinels of Censorship. The last thing I want is the government setting standards, but I fear the public will soon turn again to Congress to take stronger actions if the TV industry continues on its path downward.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	We must avoid that outcome at all costs. To do so, the TV industry must see the V-chip for the powerful symbol of discontent it is, and treat it as a beginning and not an end. More and more these days television is becoming a pariah in America's living rooms, and no slice of silicon can block out that reality.<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<h2>Mum's the Word in British Day Care</h2>
<b>by George W. Liebmann</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In 1961, a mother in London wrote a letter to the Manchester <I>Guardian</I> that resonated with families all over Britain. Belle Tutaev related her predicament as a working mother of limited means who wanted to spend more time with her young daughter and also wanted a safe learning environment for her child while she was at work. She described how she and her friends had set up a "playgroup" in her neighborhood, in which mothers working part-time took turns supervising and providing a structure of educational games for each other's children. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Tutaev's letter inspired an overwhelming response from mothers wanting to know how to set up similar playgroups. So, after borrowing a typewriter and setting up a duplicator in her garage, Tutaev created an educational charity to give practical guidance to British mothers. Today the Pre-school Learning Alliance helps organize 20,000 playgroups for 800,000 British children ages three to five, including more than 40 percent of the country's three- and four-year-olds.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The typical British playgroup has 40 children, with a supervisor (usually paid) and two or three volunteer mothers (or other relatives) at all times. Parents usually serve in rotation for half a day every week. Most children attend playgroups for two or three half-day sessions per week, though a growing number of playgroups offer extended hours for working mothers. The typical playgroup rents space from a neighborhood church or other community institution within walking distance of the childrens' homes. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The active participation of volunteer mothers keeps costs low. Fees per child typically run less than half the cost of nursery schools. But the real benefit of parental involvement is educational. "Our evidence," says Lady Plowden, a former president of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, shows that "it is generally undesirable to separate mother and child for a whole day in the nursery." According to the Alliance's official literature:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Children learn better when their parents are involved. Seeing their own families validated and powerful gives them a secure base from which to progress, and parents are in a better position to reinforce at home the learning which has occurred in the group . . . becom[ing] confident partners in the world of education rather than mere consumers."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Netherlands and Ireland also have strong playgroup movements, and the idea is beginning to catch on in America. What is most distinctive about the British movement is the nationwide dissemination of practical information and curricula, so that parents forming a new group do not have to reinvent the wheel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Pre-school Learning Alliance puts out a monthly magazine, <I>Under Five Contact</I>, for member groups and parents, and has produced three television series on the organization and operation of playgroups. Its catalogue of publications includes session outlines, suggested rules, course materials, and workbooks for such "learning through play" activities as gluing, woodwork, wordplay, finger exercises, math, language, science, and music. Courses on playgroups are offered not only to group leaders but also to parents; 40,000 parents each year take them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like many British charities, the playgroup association has the imprimatur of the Crown. Diana, Princess of Wales, is the official patron of the Pre-school Learning Alliance. But the playgroup movement is otherwise a model of voluntary activity independent of the state. Individual playgroups raise their own money, mostly from fees from parents. And though playgroups in London are granted substantial subsidies from that city's government, British playgroups overall have received less than 5 percent of their revenue from taxpayers. All playgroups must register with government authorities, and meet certain regulatory standards under the Official Children Act. However, the standards of the Alliance are even higher than those of the government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Britain's Parliament is now considering pre-school vouchers for four-year-olds that could be used either at a playgroup or at a nursery school. But since parents would decide which playgroup to attend, the playgroups could still maintain their independence from government control.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The British playgroup movement is an attractive model for American parents looking for an alternative both to institutionalized day care and to nursery school for three- and four-year-olds. One of the most important attractions is the opportunity for parents to be more involved with their children and with friends in the neighborhood. In addition, the British model also offers a wealth of experience and model practices, so that parents can learn from the successes and mistakes of those who have gone before.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h2>Drumbeats for Divorce Reform</h2></a>
&#160; &#160; &#160;<b>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</b>
</center>
<p>
<b>Lighting the Match</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	On September 5, 1969, with a stroke of his pen, California governor Ronald Reagan wiped out the moral basis for marriage in America.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Within five years, 44 states had followed California's lead in instituting some form of no-fault divorce reform. (Oklahoma and Maryland already had no-fault laws on the books, but the Golden State is credited with igniting a national wildfire.) Today, every state in the nation permits at least one of two no-fault mechanisms for dissolving a marriage: (1) one or both spouses can sue for divorce because of "incompatibility," "irreconcilable differences," or "irretrievable breakdown of the marriage"; (2) a couple can request a divorce after obtaining a legal separation and waiting a certain period of time. No longer must a spouse prove cruelty, desertion, or adultery, the traditional grounds for divorce.<P>
<img src="home.gif" align=center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At the time, such legislation seemed humane and enlightened. It was hailed as an overdue reform of a wink-wink, nudge-nudge system rife with hypocrisy and lurid accusations. Under the fault-based system, the suing partner had to prove the fault of the other and show themselves to be blameless; otherwise their respective culpability canceled each other's claims. Because the assessment of guilt determined the division of assets between spouses, the stakes were high. Even when both partners desired the divorce, they were often reduced to perjury and collusion, sometimes staging "adulterous liaisons" to be captured in grainy photographs by lurking private eyes. And the definition of cruelty in a marriage was stretched to ludicrous lengths.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Although attorneys and women's-rights advocates argued vigorously for reform, most Americans disagreed. In 1968, just before the wave of no-fault reforms, less than 20 percent of the general public wanted to make divorce easier, and nearly two-thirds wanted to make divorce laws even stricter.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It turns out that the public's instincts were right. With the advent of widespread no-fault divorce, the United States saw a dramatic surge in the number of divorces granted each year. In 1960, 16 percent of first marriages ended in divorce; today, the figure is closer to 50 percent. In the five years following the enactment of no-fault in California, the national divorce rate increased almost 40 percent.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	The causal connection between the unravelling of divorce laws and the unravelling of marriages is admittedly debatable. But it seems clear that the states' drive to make divorce more humane inadvertently denuded marriage of any meaning. In her forthcoming book, <I>The Abolition of Marriage: How We Destroy Lasting Love</I>, <a href="#maggie">Maggie Gallagher</a>, a scholar with the Institute for American Values, writes, "From a formal, legal standpoint, marriage is no longer an enforceable commitment." With no-fault divorce, wrote David Wagner in a paper for the Family Research Council, "marriage becomes nothing more than notarized dating."<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	 Last year in <I>National Review</I>, Robert Plunkett, the vice dean of the Southern California Institute of Law, eloquently described the legal case against no-fault divorce: "The wedding vow has devolved from being the most serious and solemn oath a typical person ever made into being less than a contract. An oral contract made with a two-year-old is more binding than the contract of marriage; it at least binds one party, the adult. A marriage contract is binding on no one."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Equally clear is the harm to innocent parties under the no-fault regime: They have been stripped of their legal protection. Even when one spouse desperately wants to keep the marriage together, he or she has no legal recourse, and may have to shell out thousands of dollars in legal fees for an unwanted divorce. All the power belongs to the initiator.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition to its unintended consequences, no-fault divorce hasn't necessarily fulfilled its goal of attenuating the acrimony of divorce proceedings; the conflict has merely shifted from the allocation of blame to conflicts over child custody and division of property. It still gets ugly when families break apart. In divorce, the scarlet letter no longer stands for adultery -- it now can refer to malicious accusations of child sexual abuse. <p><b>Repairing the Damage</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As the moral consequences of America's soaring divorce rate have become clear, even leading Democrats are voicing their support for stricter divorce laws. In her syndicated newspaper column, for instance, First Lady Hillary Clinton recently wrote, "I think getting a divorce should be much harder when children are involved. . . . Divorce has become too easy because of our permissive laws and attitudes." She goes on to say, "The good news is that attitudes about marriage and divorce seem to be changing. Some states are beginning to examine whether their divorce laws are too lax. Grass-roots campaigns to help preserve marriage are flourishing around the country."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	William A. Galston, a professor at the University of Maryland and a former domestic policy advisor to President Clinton, offered a more concrete view in a <I>New York Times</I> editorial last December: "For couples with dependent children, we should eliminate unilateral no-fault -- where one person can readily obtain a divorce without the other's consent -- and return to an updated fault-based system, with the alternative of a five-year waiting period. And even in cases where both parties consent, there should be suitable braking mechanisms: a mandatory pause of at least a year for reflection, counseling and mediation."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although prominent liberals are joining the rhetorical battle, Christian and other conservative family groups and lawmakers are leading the policy debates within state legislatures: 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Michigan.</b> State representative Jessie Dalman has put forth a package of marriage and divorce reforms, most notably abolishing unilateral no-fault divorce -- whether or not children are involved. Her plan would still allow no-fault if both parties agree to the divorce, but if one party objects, the person filing would need to demonstrate fault -- namely adultery, desertion, physical or mental abuse, drug or alcohol addiction, or incarceration for more than three years.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Dalman also wants to encourage premarital counseling for marriage-license applicants, improve enforcement of child support, and require couples with children to receive divorce counseling before filing for divorce and to submit a "parenting plan" to the court. The bill, vigorously supported by Republican governor John Engler, is scheduled for a vote in late April.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Michigan Family Forum, a nonprofit research group in Lansing, laid the intellectual groundwork for the legislation. It recently published "Breaking up Is Easy To Do," a short but useful guide to the history of divorce reform in Michigan and across the nation. Full of statistics and references to important resources, it's a great tool for educating activists and lawmakers.
<p><I>The Michigan Family Forum can be reached at 517-374-1171. </I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Idaho.</b> Representative Tom Dorr has introduced The Justice in Family Law Act, which would require mutual consent in all divorces filed on grounds of irreconcilable differences -- most states' version of no-fault divorce -- whether or not children are present. Because Idaho does not recognize legal separation, however, critics voiced concern about spouses caught in abusive relationships. Dorr has added a bill that establishes legal separation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although both bills are expected to die in committee this session, they will probably become a top conservative caucus issue for the 1997 session.
<P><I>For information, call Dennis Mansfield, the executive director of the Idaho Family Forum, at 208-376-9009.</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Georgia.</b> Representative Brian Joyce's bill to remove "irretrievable breakdown" as grounds for divorce was killed in committee this March, but he intends to introduce it again next year. (No-fault would still be permissible if both parties agreed and no minor children were involved.) After talking with representatives from the Georgia chapter of the National Organization for Women, Joyce added provisions that would allow a unilateral no-fault divorce for spouses involved in physically abusive marriages. 
<p><I>Brian Joyce can be reached at 404-656-0265.</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Iowa.</b> Despite the support of Republican governor Terry Branstad, a bill similar to Michigan's  was killed in the house in March. Lawmakers vow to reintroduce the legislation next year. 	
<P>
<I>For more information, contact state representatives Charles Hurley and Danny Carroll at  515-281-3221</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Colorado.</b> Although no divorce-reform legislation is now in the pipeline, just watch. Tom McMillen is executive director of the Rocky Mountain Family Council, a politically savvy think tank that has helped to devise a three-year plan: in the first year, educate the public on the ill effects of divorce; in the second, work with churches to develop community marriage policies to support existing marriages; in the third, introduce legislation. <p>
<I>Tom McMillen can be reached at 303-456-9285.</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Legislatures in several other states, including Illinois, Pennsylvania, Florida, Indiana, and Kansas, are considering reforms of no-fault divorce this year, but these are given little chance of passing. Earlier this year, pro-family legislators in Virginia tried to pass a law to prevent unilateral no-fault divorce when children are present. It was shot down quickly in committee.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Still, the issue is here to stay. Larry Huff of the Family Research Council reports that more bills are expected to be introduced next year in Maine, Washington, and several other states. Meanwhile, a recent poll shows that more than half of all Americans think that divorce should be more difficult; support for reform is especially strong among adults under the age of 30 -- the generation that suffered widespread divorce as children.<p><b>Fallout Shelters</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When mothers and fathers decide to divorce, their children get caught in the litigation crossfire. In order to shield these youngest of victims and to reduce the caseload of post-divorce litigation, family-court lawyers and judges across the country are now mandating that couples seeking a divorce first learn how their decision affects their children.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	One of the largest and most widely emulated programs can be found in Cobb County, Georgia, where parents must complete a four-hour seminar within 31 days of filing for divorce. Operated by a nonprofit social-service agency called Families First, the seminar teaches parents how to tell their children about their decision and how to ease the disruption and sense of loss that divorce brings to children.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	
Since 1988, the program, known as "Children Cope with Divorce: Seminar for Divorcing Parents," has taught ex-spouses how to handle visitation and parenting issues and avoid using the children as messengers or weapons. The $30 fee can be waived for those who cannot afford it, but the program is mandatory.<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's a good reason for that: Court administrators and judges have found that when such education programs are voluntary, parents rarely attend. Their daily lives are already collapsing, and they seldom see the need for any outside counseling. Family law officials also have found that the attendance of both parents is vital. If only one parent learns about the effects of divorce on the kids, he or she is usually willing to concede more in order to protect the children -- a distinct disadvantage in negotiation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although parents are often reluctant or openly resentful when they begin, more than 95 percent leave the program feeling it was useful and that it will improve their behavior. And that's not just talk. In Cobb County, the rate of court appearances for post-divorce litigation such as custody and support has dropped to 15 percent of divorcing couples.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Other programs boast similar results. Before Jefferson County, Kentucky, established its Families in Transition program, one in three families found itself back in court within a year fighting over child-related issues. After the mandated program began, the rate dropped to 10 percent. Many jurisdictions without a similar program report a rate of 25 to 35 percent.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "Children Cope with Divorce" curriculum has been exported to other jurisdictions in Georgia and around the country, and counselors and court officials from all over the United States and Canada are going to Families First's offices to learn the program.

<b>The Abolition of Marriage</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maggie Gallagher, an affiliate scholar at the Institute for American Values, says in her upcoming book <I>The Abolition of Marriage</I> that we have falsely framed the divorce debate as "one between choice and coercion, individual liberty and state control. . . . The bad marriage haunts us in part because we have reduced the marriage commitment to a single, grim, frightening phrase: Couples should 'stay together for the sake of the children.' The vision it conjures -- of loveless, bitter, tight-lipped martyrs living in hell with their equally miserable kids -- is impossible to uphold as a moral ideal. . . ."<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"'You can't force two people to stay married,' we tell ourselves and turn the page," she writes. "Divorce, however, is not usually the act of a couple, but of an individual. Eighty percent of divorces in this country are unilateral, rather than truly mutual, decisions. Rather, the divorce revolution can be more accurately described as a shift of power, favoring the interests of one party over others: the interests of the spouse who wishes to leave over those of the spouse who is being abandoned and over those of the children whose consent is not sought."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Her research about the state of marriage leads her to conclude, "Reforming no-fault divorce is more than a tactical necessity. Simple decency requires that the law retreat from relentlessly favoring the spouse who leaves in no-fault divorces and place some minimal power back into the hands of the spouse who is being left. Imposing a five- to seven-year waiting period for contested no-fault divorces (as do many European jurisdictions) would serve the ends of both justice and prudence: raising the number of marriages that ultimately succeed, while at the very least ensuring that those who want a quick and easy divorce will have to negotiate with their marriage partner in order to get it."

<b>By Matthew Spalding</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the fall of 1881, Father Michael J. McGivney gathered a small group of men in the basement of St. Mary's Church in New Haven, Connecticut, to start an association to help his Irish immigrant parishioners in their new homeland. No one could have imagined that he was founding what would become one of the largest and most successful private philanthropic service organizations in the world.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a young assistant pastor, McGivney was not only the spiritual but also the civic leader of his church community. Like many clergymen during the great 19th-century wave of immigration, he was deeply concerned about the unique social burdens and heavy economic pressures faced by his ever-growing immigrant flock. He was equally troubled by the rise of American "secret societies" that tended to be both anti-foreigner and anti-religious. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The son of poor Irish workers, McGivney believed that, to be successful, immigrants had to assimilate into American society without weakening their religious identity and strong sense of family. He had long been active with the youth of his parish, and had earlier organized a total-abstinence society to combat alcoholism.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At the age of 29, McGivney set out to establish a Catholic men's organization that would draw immigrants into American society while strengthening their Catholic faith and pride -- a transforming institution that would loosen Old World ties and build new civic bonds informed by a Catholic heritage. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The result was the Knights of Columbus. McGivney named the organization after Christopher Columbus, the Catholic discoverer of the New World, to emphasize the Catholic contribution to America. Members called themselves "knights" to emphasize their service to God and country. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The economic backbone of the organization was a program for life insurance and sick benefits that helped meet the basic expenses of families overwhelmed by illness or the death of the breadwinner. Early membership dues supported a benevolent fund that paid members $5 a week during illness, and a levy of $1 a head funded an endowment that paid $1,000 to a member's family upon his death. These benefits attracted new members and provided financial stability for the organization. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Knights of Columbus were built upon four principles -- Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism -- that are reflected in their activities to this day. They defend their faith in a pluralistic nation while welcoming all nationalities and building fellowship by means of their religious, social, and educational activities.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Over the years, the Knights have promoted American and Catholic history, and have supported Church activities and programs throughout the world (such as Pope John Paul II's recent trip to the United States). They encourage patriotism and loyalty to the country that defends their liberties. At the same time, they will fight for religious freedom (leading a 1922 battle to overturn Oregon's ban on private and parochial schools) and civic piety (spearheading a petition drive in 1954 to add the words "under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance).<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the heart of the organization, as McGivney intended, has always been charity: supporting members and the community through private benevolence. In 1884, the Knights had 429 members and a budget of $168.60. Today, the Knights number more than 1.5 million members in 10,000 local councils and assemblies, mostly in the United States but also in Canada, the Philippines, Mexico, and several Central American and Caribbean countries. In 1994, the Knights gave more than $100 million in charitable contributions and 48.8 million hours in volunteer service. Over the last 20 years, their philanthropy worldwide has totaled $1.2 billion in contributions and 438 million hours of service. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The vast majority of charitable activities and community projects -- from food distribution, blood drives, and helping the elderly and retarded to pancake breakfasts and bowling leagues -- are designed and led by the local councils and assemblies and tailored to local needs. All this is accomplished without government aid.	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;McGivney insisted that the organization be business-like and financially stable. "Make all returns regularly, promptly, and correctly," he directed. "Invest all surplus funds profitably, safely, and legally." Today, the once-meager insurance program is a thriving enterprise with $6 billion in assets and $30 billion in policy coverage. The profits from invested assets provide a solid base ($20 million in 1994) for annual charitable programs. The rest -- $80 million in 1994 -- is raised each year.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Born in Waterbury, Connecticut, McGivney was the oldest of 13 children, six of whom died in childhood. He was never of strong health, and died of consumption at the age of 38.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	His 13 busy years as a priest have resulted so far in 114 years of good works and community service. "He was a man of the people," wrote one close associate. "He was ever zealous for the people's welfare and all the kindliness of his priestly soul asserted itself most strongly in his unceasing efforts for the betterment of their condition."

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Flush with a handful of money he had just won at a bowling 
tournament, Joe Koslowski invited some friends to celebrate with him at the nearby Atlantic City casinos. 
Joe, then 16, and all his buddies were allowed in despite the age limit of 21. Once inside, Joe's good 
fortune continued; he parlayed his bowling winnings into a couple of thousand dollars.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After his initial success, Joe returned to the casinos frequently. 
His winning streak eventually ended, but his taste for the thrill of gambling did not. Once out of cash, he 
opened credit accounts under family members' names, using cash advances from the credit cards to 
gamble.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The whole scheme finally came crashing in on Joe last year, 
after he had amassed $20,000 in debt. Now at age 20, Joe, who had no prior criminal record, is serving 
time in a Pennsylvania federal prison for credit-card fraud. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Joe is one of tens of thousands of young people who fall 
victim to America's gambling obsession every year. At least three-quarters of the nation's teens engage in 
some form of gambling. Much of it, of course, is fairly innocuous and occurs among peers: weekend poker 
games, betting on football, the annual NCAA basketball tournament pool. Adolescents have become 
increasingly adept, however, at gaining access to state-sanctioned gambling -- lotteries, casinos, electronic 
poker -- which often becomes a bridge to compulsive or addictive behavior. In 1995, University of 
Minnesota researchers reported that more than half of underage Minnesota teens surveyed had participated 
in some form of legalized gambling. An earlier survey of Atlantic City high-school students revealed that 
nearly two-thirds had gambled at the city's casinos. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is becoming painfully apparent that the only jackpot 
awaiting many of these young people is a life out of control: More than a million adolescents are already 
addicted to gambling, according to Durand Jacobs, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Loma Linda 
University Medical School and an expert on youth gambling. Further, Jacobs says, the gambling addiction 
rate among teens is three times that among adults.  In a recent review of major youth-gambling studies in 
North America, Howard Shaffer, director of the Center for Addiction Studies at Harvard Medical School, 
concluded that roughly one in six teens experiences gambling-related problems, while about 6 percent are 
actually addicted, or pathological, gamblers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The New Jersey Council on Compulsive Gambling, which 
operates a national toll-free hotline (1-800-GAMBLER), reports that callers under 21 phoned the hotline 
4,300 times in 1994, accounting for 11 percent of total calls. Ed Looney, the council's executive director, 
says many of these young people find themselves in desperate straits. He tells of a call regarding a 16-year-
old who had slit his wrists after losing $6,000 -- four years of newspaper delivery earnings -- on the lottery 
in a single day. He tells of the college student from the Midwest who dropped out of school because he lost 
his tuition money gambling; of the 19-year-old New Jersey youth who sold his car for a fraction of its 
value so he could get back into the casinos; of the numerous calls from kids too scared to go back to school 
because they can't pay back their bookies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 The phenomenon of youth gambling is not entirely new, but 
its rapid growth and startling magnitude is alarming. Says Valerie Lorenz, head of Baltimore's Center for 
Compulsive Gambling, "We never saw a teenage gambler 10 years ago. Now we see them regularly." 
Moreover, the most addictive forms of gambling -- eagerly promoted by more and more state governments 
in search of tax revenue -- can produce ripple effects in young lives that undermine families, communities, 
and civic order. As we move into the next century, Shaffer says, "We're going to have major issues with 
youth gambling that will equal or eclipse the problems that we have with substance abuse." 
<P>
<b>A Slippery Slope?</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Experts draw a distinction between the "problem" gambler 
and the "pathological" gambler. According to Shaffer, pathological gamblers exhibit three basic 
characteristics: an inability to stop gambling despite massive losses, a sense of lost control, and a 
compulsion or craving to gamble. Problem gamblers can be affected in less severe ways, including 
difficulty concentrating, failure to fulfill family, school, or work obligations, general irritability, and 
sleeplessness. The two, however, are closely connected. Shaffer refers to problem gamblers as being "in 
transition," either moving toward or away from pathological gambling behaviors. Individuals may 
frequently move in and out of these designations. It is estimated that 1 to 3 percent of the adult population 
are pathological gamblers, but nearly twice that number are problem gamblers.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Probably 90 percent of the population can gamble 
"recreationally," but a significant minority cannot. Moreover, all forms of gambling can be addictive for 
teens, as well as adults, though they vary in their potency. The most addictive, such as electronic poker, 
contain the element of rapid "action" and occur in relative isolation, Shaffer says. Video gambling and slot 
machines are inherently more dangerous than bingo or the lottery. But the lottery frequently serves as a 
gateway to other gambling activities for teens. Once exposed to even a relatively benign form of gambling 
such as the lottery, many find themselves craving greater excitement. Studies bear this out: Participation in 
other forms of gambling is higher in those states that have lotteries.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many problem and pathological gamblers -- adolescents or adults 
-- become debtors. Once they get in over their heads, teen gamblers follow the cue of their elders: They 
turn to crime. Jacobs contends that at least one in 10 juveniles has used illegal means such as stealing, 
shoplifting, selling drugs, or prostitution to obtain money to pay off gambling-related debts. A 1994 study 
of Massachusetts youth found that 5 percent had been arrested for gambling-related problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite the extent and impact of youth gambling, Jacobs says, 
the level of public awareness is "absolutely abysmal." A few recent high-profile press reports, along with a 
meeting last spring of the North American Think Tank on Youth Gambling Issues at Harvard, have begun 
to bring the issue to the public's attention. Teens themselves remain largely unaware of the dangers 
associated with gambling. Shaffer found that only one-quarter of Massachusetts youth surveyed rated 
gambling as potentially dangerous, compared with 60 percent or more who perceived the dangers in 
alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Gambling in all its forms is proving to be nearly irresistible to 
a rising generation that frequently tells pollsters of its apprehensions about a bleak economic outlook. 
Traditional forms of gambling such as church bingo have generally  been able to restrain compulsive 
betting. Government promotion of gambling, including the $350 million states spend advertising the 
lottery, has been more pernicious. It communicates to young people the subtly destructive notion that the 
work ethic is pass, that all they need is "a dollar and a dream," as one lottery advertisement puts it. 
Perhaps that's why an average of 200,000 minors have been turned away from Atlantic City casinos every 
year for the past decade, according to figures from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Another 
24,000 underage gamblers are escorted from the casino floor annually. Many more gamble in the casinos 
undetected. Ironically, many state lotteries are pitched to the electorate as a honey pot for public education. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"By sending young people the message that they need to 
gamble to get ahead," Shaffer says, "we're telling them not to study calculus, not to study science, and we 
shouldn't be surprised that America is now falling behind other cultures in terms of intellectual pursuits."
<p>
<b>A National Compulsion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If young people follow the lead of the adult gambling culture 
around them, they'll squander much more than their intellectual energy. Americans will legally wager 
more money this year than they will spend on groceries -- some $500 billion. That number represents a 
3,000 percent increase since 1976. Utah and Hawaii are the only states that prohibit all forms of gambling, 
though Hawaii is considering casinos. Casinos are now legal in about half the states and constitute nearly 
half of total gambling revenues, which are growing at the rate of 15 percent annually.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"America is on a gambling binge," says Congressman Frank 
Wolf, who is pushing legislation to establish a national commission to study the effects of legalized 
gambling. The growth will undoubtedly continue, at least in the short run, as state and local governments 
scramble for an even bigger slice of the gambling revenue pie. In 1994, governments received $1.4 billion 
from casinos alone. Lotteries contributed another $10 billion to state coffers. That same year, revenue-
hungry state legislatures considered more than 1,600 gambling-related bills.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, government's addiction to gambling has been 
transmitted to the public. Nationwide, it is estimated that about 10 million Americans have a gambling 
habit that is out of control. A recent surge in the number of problem and pathological gamblers is strongly 
correlated with the explosion of legalized gambling opportunities. An unlikely source for a case study is 
Iowa. A 1989 survey indicated that 1.7 percent of Iowa residents were problem or pathological gamblers. 
Shortly thereafter the state added riverboat casinos and casinos on Indian lands and also expanded 
parimutuel wagering. A subsequent survey last year showed the percentage of Iowans with a serious 
gambling problem had ballooned to 5.4 percent. An additional 78,000 Iowa adults had become hooked on 
gambling in that six-year period.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Iowa study is consistent with other findings. John Kindt, a 
professor of commerce and legal policy at the University of Illinois, says that when gambling activities are 
legalized and made accessible to new jurisdictions, increases in the numbers of addicted gamblers range 
between 100 and 550 percent. These newly created addicts are turning in overwhelming numbers for help -
- help that the mental-health community is ill-equipped to supply. According to the National Council on 
Problem Gambling, there are fewer than a hundred treatment programs nationwide for pathological 
gamblers, as compared with some 13,000 such programs for alcoholism and other substance-abuse 
problems. Tens of thousands are seeking help through local Gamblers Anonymous groups; GA has added 
four hundred new chapters in the United States in the last five years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee last 
September, American Gaming Association (AGA) president Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. claimed that the 
gambling industry is making substantial efforts to address the problem. So far, however, little has been 
done. "The casino industry is heavily dependent on the revenues of psychologically sick people," says 
Earl Grinols, an economist at the University of Illinois, who calculates that more than half of a casino's 
take comes from problem and pathological gamblers. University of Minnesota researchers found that a 
mere 2 percent of gamblers in that state accounted for nearly two-thirds of all money spent on the state's 
casinos, charitable pulltab games, lottery, and the like.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Experts warn that the number of gambling addicts has yet to 
crest. In fact, Jacobs predicts that it will be the nation's fastest-growing addictive behavior. In addition to 
greater availability of traditional gambling venues, the emergence of hi-tech video gambling machines, 
gambling on the Internet, and interactive telephone and television gambling will undoubtedly contribute to 
the problem. These addictions will come with enormous social and economic price tags, as social scientists 
and researchers -- and millions of families -- have already discovered.
<p>
<b>Gambling with the Family</b> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In August 1993, Mike and Sharon James (not their real 
names) and their two preschool children left a successful business in East Liverpool, Ohio, for promising 
job prospects in Charleston, S.C. The couple had been in Charleston one month when Sharon received an 
overdrawn notice from the bank. Puzzled, she contacted the bank to clear up the "error"; the couple had 
several thousand dollars in their checking account set aside for a down payment on a house.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Sharon discovered that her husband of 10 years had made 
several withdrawals in recent weeks, many in the neighborhood of $1,000. When she questioned Mike, she 
learned that he had spent the money on South Carolina's ubiquitous video poker machines. Despite 
Sharon's pleas and attempts at treatment, Mike couldn't kick the habit. He squandered the family's 
remaining savings, hocked many of their possessions, even cashed in the children's savings bonds, and left 
the family $20,000 in debt. Finally, Sharon filed for divorce. Mike wound up in the county jail for 
delinquency in child-support payments and for writing bad checks.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"This man was a wonderful person, a very caring father," 
says Sharon. "I really believe he didn't realize what he was doing, because he was never like that before. 
This addiction just grabs you and twists you. It destroyed him and us."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similar stories abound in gambling communities across the 
nation. Yet the scope of the problem is tragically underestimated, largely because so little research has been 
undertaken regarding gambling's impact on the family. The meager available data comes primarily from 
surveys of small groups of compulsive gamblers seeking treatment. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Last year the Illinois Council on Compulsive Gambling 
surveyed nearly 200 Gamblers Anonymous members and found that 16 percent were divorced due to their 
gambling addictions; another 10 percent had separated as a result. In an earlier study of spouses of 
compulsive gamblers, Valerie Lorenz discovered that 78 percent had threatened separation or divorce, and 
half had carried through on their threats. Jacobs surveyed 850 high-school students in Southern California 
and found that children of compulsive gamblers were almost twice as likely to experience the trauma of a 
broken home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Harrison County, Mississippi, the hub of the state's casino 
industry, the number of divorces rose from 440 in 1992 to nearly 1,100 in 1993, the first full year after 
casinos. Judge William L. Stewart, who has served on chancery court along Mississippi's Gulf Coast for 17 
years, says he knows gambling to be a factor in about a third of the divorce cases he now oversees. "Other 
than the general decline of morality in society, I don't believe there has been a single factor [affecting 
divorce rates] like this. It's just not a normal thing. This thing is huge. It has a tremendous effect on a 
community." 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Spousal and child abuse and neglect are other problems 
attendant to gambling addictions, as reports from social-service agencies in gambling communities 
consistently attest. The Gulf Coast Women's Center in Biloxi, Mississippi, has averaged 400 additional 
crisis calls per month since the advent of casinos there. Central City, Colorado, reported a six-fold rise in 
child protection cases in the year after casinos arrived. Jeffrey Bloomberg, former state's attorney for the 
Deadwood, South Dakota area, cited a similar increase in his September 1994 congressional testimony, and 
described how children were being left in cars all night while their parents gambled. Earl Grinols points out 
that Nevada led the nation in deaths of children attributable to abuse from 1979 to 1988, a period when 
casino gambling was illegal everywhere else except in Atlantic City. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Children of compulsive gamblers also suffer in other ways. 
Jacobs found that such youth have a greater propensity for substance abuse, lower academic achievement, 
juvenile delinquency, and poorer mental health. They are also far more likely to develop gambling 
addictions themselves. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Compulsive gamblers are at much greater risk for other 
harmful behaviors. According to Henry Lesieur, about half of compulsive gamblers experience problems 
with alcohol and substance abuse. Lesieur also notes that compulsive gamblers are five to 10 times more 
likely to attempt suicide than is the general population. The National Council on Problem Gambling states 
that 20 percent of compulsive gamblers attempt suicide. Many succeed. A 19-year-old Iowa college 
student, a St. Louis-area housewife and church volunteer, and an Illinois businessman are a few of the 
recent self-inflicted casualties that have received press attention, but hundreds of others go relatively 
unnoticed year after year. Nevada has the highest suicide rate in the nation. In Gulfport, Mississippi, 
attempted suicides rose more than 200 percent in the first two years of casinos, while suicide attempts 
soared from six to 66 in nearby Biloxi in the first year alone. Family members of compulsive gamblers are 
also at greatly increased risk for suicide, according to Lesieur.
<p>
<b>Showdown in River City</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Over the last decade the gambling industry has done a 
phenomenal job of selling itself as an economic elixir to communities strapped for revenue. Inflated 
promises of jobs, tourism, and additional tax monies have seduced politicians and citizens in dozens of 
states and communities. The numbers, however, are beginning to catch up with the gambling forces. As 
Americans become more aware of the societal devastation wrought by legalized gambling, the industry is 
finding it increasingly difficult, and ever more expensive, to peddle its wares. In recent elections, gambling 
interests have outspent opponents by margins of 10, 20, even 50 to one, and are still losing far more often 
than not.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Jefferson City, Missouri, which voted for casino riverboats in 
1992, voted them out last November. Fledgling efforts are underway in Louisiana, Wisconsin, and 
elsewhere to repeal legalized gambling. Even the industry's own polls show that gambling's acceptance 
appears to be waning.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The issue, however, is far from decided. Gambling interests 
have targeted several key states again this year -- California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, and Texas, among others - for expansion. In New York, the gambling lobby last year helped 
introduce a form of keno called "Quick Draw." It puts casino-style gambling right in front of teens, 
appearing in bowling alleys, supermarkets, and even candy shops to lure kids into shooting high-tech craps. 
If these and other efforts are successful, it will be a sure bet that millions more Americans -- many of them 
children -- will slip into addiction, and the destitution and darkness that go with it.

<p>
<b>Crimeland </b>
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The gambling industry has launched a major offensive to try to 
convince Americans that they don't know what they know: Gambling breeds crime. The industry has hired 
a handful of law-enforcement officials and academics to assert that gambling is no more conducive to 
crime than Disney World. It's a Mickey Mouse argument.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Data from gambling communities points to an overwhelming 
link between legalized gambling and criminal activity. Three years after the arrival of casinos, Atlantic 
City rose from fiftieth to first in the nation among cities in per capita crime. Nevada continually ranks near 
the top in crime per capita.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The experiences of newer gambling communities mirror those 
of Nevada and Atlantic City.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Within five years of permitting limited stakes casinos in 
Deadwood, South Dakota, serious crimes jumped 93 percent. Mississippi's Gulf Coast welcomed casinos 
in August of 1992. After a year, bank robberies had increased from one to 13, and armed robberies tripled. 
In Ledyard, Connecticut, home of the nation's richest casino, rape, robbery, car theft, and larceny all 
increased more than 400 percent in the first three years after Foxwoods opened.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The fact is in every city that casinos have been introduced in 
any significant way, crime in the streets has gone up, and there has been a marked rise," says 
Massachusetts attorney general Scott Harshbarger. Frank J. Kelley, Michigan's attorney general for more 
than 30 years, told the International Conference on Gambling in 1994 that "there has never been an issue 
that has disturbed me any more than the proliferation of gambling in our state."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Last October, Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran 
Jr., issued a notable report on the gambling-crime link. Curran concluded: "[C]asinos would bring a 
substantial increase in crime to our State. There would be more violent crime, more crimes against 
property, more insurance fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug and alcohol-
related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse, and more organized crime."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The gambling industry insists that the crime link is solely a 
factor of more people visiting these communities. The testimony of the law-enforcement community, 
gambling's demonstrated ties to organized crime, and the millions of gambling addicts who become 
criminals as a result of their addictions attest otherwise. One might say the gambling industry's denial of 
these facts is just plain Goofy.
<p>

<b>Cashiering Casinos</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite shoestring budgets, grass-roots groups in dozens of states 
are doing a surprisingly effective job of stalling the gambling juggernaut:
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mirage Casinos finally cut its losses at more than $10 million 
and left Bridgeport, Connecticut, late last year after failing in its four-year push to construct the nation's 
largest casino. With support from the media and the governor, and a non-stop public-relations barrage, the 
casino deal looked like a sure thing. But the dogged persistence of various anti-gambling groups prevailed.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion (PAGE) has 
employed a two-pronged strategy to thwart riverboat casinos. PAGE gathered about 44,000 petition 
signatures, which it presented to the governor at a widely publicized press conference. PAGE has been 
working behind the scenes with key legislators, from both the Democratic and Republican parties, to keep 
gambling bills from reaching a vote.
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eleven different casino companies hired lobbyists last year in 
hopes of squeezing casinos into Maryland. They had planned to close the deal by this spring. Maryland's 
No Casino group derailed the plan largely via a series of anti-casino rallies held around the state last fall. 
Gambling lobbyists have now forsaken their attempts to get casinos in Maryland.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Last November, voters in Washington state trounced Initiative 
651, which would have allowed unrestricted gambling on Indian lands.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fifty gambling lobbyists descended on Virginia last year to 
push for riverboat casinos. Virginians Deserve Better blunted their efforts by joining with dozens of 
minority pastors in targeted areas of southern Virginia.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Florida's No Casinos is preparing to repel the gambling 
industry's fourth casino initiative, expected this fall. No Casinos has built a broad coalition including 
liberal and conservative religious groups, law-enforcement officials, business and political leaders, and 
tourism interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Rev. Tom Grey, coordinator for the National Coalition 
Against Legalized Gambling, says state-based affiliates prevailed -- via referendum, the legislature, or the 
courts -- in 21 of 23 contests over the last couple of years.
