<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The recent conclusion of a <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Bosnian peace accord</a> is a welcome development in a brutal conflict that has raged unchecked for four years. However, there are very serious questions that need to be answered about the political viability of the accord and the effectiveness of the American military intervention to implement it.
<p>
In his nationally televised address on November 27, President Clinton stated that he will request congressional support for the deployment of over 20,000 <a href=" http://www.dtic.dla.mil/bosnia/">American ground troops</a> to Bosnia. The President will also have to convince a very skeptical U.S. public that the sacrifice of American lives and resources is worth the short-term results he hopes to achieve. Most important, the President will have to convince both Congress and the American people that he has not committed American troops to an open-ended and ill-defined military mission in the midst of a volatile civil war.
<P>
To assess fully the tough political and military issues involved, Congress should be prepared to ask the President specific questions about the practicalities of the Bosnian peace plan and about the risks and costs associated with an American military intervention that would implement such a plan.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICAL VIABILITY</b>
<p>

<b>Q. Is a bifurcated Bosnian state a realistic and sustainable political entity? </b>
<p>
The <a href="http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/bosagree.html">Bosnian peace accord</a> proposes a Bosnia-Herzegovina that has the appearance of a single state, but is in fact based on two separate political entities -- the Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic. For the central organs of Bosnia to function as intended, the two separate entities will have to show the most extraordinary goodwill and cooperation toward each other, qualities that have never been in evidence in Bosnia. 
<p>
Many experienced diplomats have expressed skepticism about the political viability of this Bosnian state and the realistic chances of its survival as a centrally governed and coherent nation. Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski has stated that the accord is a contrived peace that actually creates "two and a half states."<sup>1</sup><p>Much of this skepticism is rooted in the fact that the accord does not address fundamental issues of sovereignty and ethnic self-determination. Instead, it freezes those unresolved issues in place and offers up an elaborate power-sharing agreement for a Bosnian central government. However, it will be difficult for a contrived central government to replace the bonds of loyalty, authority, and legitimacy that currently exist between Bosnian Croats and Croatia and Bosnian Serbs and Serbia. These bonds are rooted in centuries of political, ethnic, and cultural identity and are sure to prove stronger than bonds to a hastily fabricated central government. 
<p>
This central dilemma was noted recently by Swedish diplomat Thomas Gur, who wrote that this "peace plan has many built-in contradictions and weaknesses. Many of the proposed arrangements lay the groundwork for possible new conflicts between different minorities, and for future interventions by Serbia as well as Croatia. If the arrangements for peace in Bosnia are carried out according to the peace plan, new conflicts will be triggered by old ones."<sup>2</sup><p>If history is any guide, this agreement stands little chance of lasting. In Cyprus in 1964, international negotiators reached a similar agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Much like the Bosnian agreement, the doomed Cyprus accord attempted to replace bonds to the "parent entities" for both sides (Greece and Turkey) with an unworkable central executive and ethnically aligned parliamentary blocs. This ensured continued intractability. This structure never worked because it never addressed the fundamental fears and aspirations of the warring factions and was predicated on a diplomatic fantasy:  hopes for a degree of cooperation that had never been present in Cyprus. After 10 years of sporadic fighting and instability under this makeshift arrangement, Turkey invaded the island in 1974, partitioned Cyprus, and put an end to the ephemeral peace -- an imposed peace that was never locally supported. United Nations peacekeepers have been in Cyprus for over 30 years. 
<p>
The same pattern can be expected in Bosnia. How can an imposed peace that does not reflect political realities or the basic concerns of the warring factions hope to survive except by the continued enforcement of thousands of NATO and American troops?  The recently concluded Bosnian peace accord is inherently weak because it fails to address the fundamental issues that caused the parties to go to war in the first place. It is, at best, a cease-fire that can work only under the continued stewardship of 60,000 heavily armed NATO combat troops.<sup>3 </sup><p><b>Q. Is the Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation itself a politically sustainable arrangement? </b>
<p>
The entire peace accord is predicated on the notion that the Muslim/Croat Federation is a solid political entity that can be endowed with more political and military resources and that will continue to grow in cohesiveness as an uneasy counterweight to the Bosnian Serb Republic. There is considerable doubt about the solidarity of this alliance, which came about as a marriage of convenience in 1994.
<p>
Before that federation was formed, the Croats and Muslims fought a brutal war for control of cities such as Mostar in Bosnia. Contentious territorial and refugee issues remain to be settled between the two groups. Many observers believe that the Muslim/Croat Federation started to come apart as soon as there was no imminent Serbian threat to hold it together. A U.N. official in Zagreb recently noted that "the American plan rests on the assumption that the Muslim-Croat federation is solid. Maybe that plan is built on sand."<sup>4</sup><p><b>Q. Is this peace accord locally supported? </b>
<P>
While Slobodan Milosevic purports to speak for the Bosnian Serb leaders, local support is far from guaranteed. Since 1992, the Bosnian Serbs have reneged twice on deals backed by President Milosevic. If anything, initial signs have been distressing. All three Bosnian Serbs present at the Dayton peace talks refused to sign the peace accord, and Bosnian Serb leaders denounced the accord within hours of its initialing. Since then Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo have staged protests and their leader, Radovan Karadzic, has insisted that the Sarajevo provisions of the peace accord doom that city to the fate of Beirut and must be renegotiated. The leader of the Bosnian Serb Parliament stated that "the agreement that has been reached does not meet even the minimum of our interests."<sup>5</sup>  In addition to these and other signs of a possible split between Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leaders, there are many different factions within the Muslim and Croat camps, all with local ambitions and aspirations. It must be remembered that there is very little central control over many paramilitary elements ostensibly connected with one of the three sides. These include, among others, the 1,000 Mujahideen militia fighters from Iran, Afghanistan, and elsewhere who recently have attacked British forces in Bosnia and are suspected of murdering an American working for the U.N. near Tuzla.<sup>6</sup><p><b>Q. What issues remain unresolved, and how does the Bosnian peace accord address those problems? </b>
<p>
It is not a good sign that some of the thorniest issues raised at <a href="http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/bosagree.html">Dayton</a> were left unresolved. In particular, the dispute over the Serbian corridor around Brcko was left to be submitted to binding arbitration by a panel made up of Muslims, Serbs, and Europeans. The content, character, method, and authority of the arbitration were not specified. Also not addressed were specifics about how to integrate the two (or possibly three) rival armies into one that would serve the foreign policies of the central government, and specific measures to ensure that indicted war criminals would be brought to trial.
<p>
<b>Q. What long-term commitment has the U.S. made to the continued security of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in its planned form? </b>
<p>
Even if the bulk of U.S. ground troops leave within 12 to 18 months, the United States will incur some form of continuing security obligation to Bosnia. President Clinton not only must define clearly the exact nature of that commitment, but also must identify the strategic resources he intends to allocate to that commitment and the contingency plans he will ask the military to prepare. The commitment of the United States to the continued existence of this state of Bosnia-Herzegovina will certainly go beyond the initial use of American troops on the ground in Bosnia. This was very much the case, for example, after the liberation of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. Since 1991, the United States has been heavily engaged in defending Kuwait, undertaking operations such as "Vigilant Warrior" in October 1994, which sent thousands of American soldiers to Kuwait on almost no notice. In addition, President Clinton just announced an extension of the U.S. military presence in Haiti. A similar commitment to Bosnia needs to be factored into the strategic, operational, logistical, resources, and fiscal planning of the military.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION FORCE</b>
<p>
There also are serious questions about the military feasibility of <a href="gopher://marvin.stc.nato.int:70/11/yugo">NATO's</a> Implementation Force (IFOR).
<p>
<b>Q. What are the defined and measurable military objectives for this peace implementation mission? </b>
<p>
The military mission in Bosnia will be so-called peace implementation. This is a term invented by the Clinton Administration to describe a dangerous and ambiguous mission that will be improvised on the ground and made up as it goes along. In 1994, after an intensive study of the dynamics of post-Cold War peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, the <a href="http://www.army.mil">U.S. Army</a> released a comprehensive doctrinal manual entitled <i>Peace Operations</i>. This manual describes how the U.S. military will operate in various peace support missions, including support for diplomacy, peacemaking, peace building, preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement. "Peace implementation" is not addressed.
<p>
When the U.S. military is given a task, it must be one which it understands and one for which it has trained. Clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives must be identified, and these objectives must contribute directly to the political goals of the operation. There are significant doubts about the existence of such objectives in the Bosnia peace implementation force. The United States must be able to measure the success of operations and formulate an exit strategy that leaves something sustainable behind. It brings to mind the confusion felt by Marines in Lebanon when they were asked to go ashore in 1982 and "establish a presence."  That is not a defined military mission. It is merely a deployment of troops without a realizable mission.
<p>
<b>Q. Why will American forces work under self-imposed restraints? </b>
<p>
Peacekeeping, peace enforcement, or even peace implementation are missions that depend ultimately on the goodwill of the warring factions in order to succeed. There is no question of trying to coerce all factions into a pattern of behavior with only 60,000 NATO troops (of whom fewer than 20,000 will be "trigger pullers"). The bottom line for the American armed forces is that they will be in a mission that places U.S. troops in a strategically passive posture. 
<p>
After the Vietnam war and the 1983 disaster in Lebanon, American political and military officials formulated a comprehensive doctrine ensuring that when U.S. troops are deployed into imminent hostilities, it is with a coherent strategy and every conceivable operational advantage. One condition guaranteed to the military is that they will receive a mission that allows American forces the operational freedom and resources to keep the initiative of action -- to dictate the terms of battle to their advantage. This allows American military forces to create the conditions they need to succeed. It is a formula that worked brilliantly in Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm, and even in peace operations like the initial U.S.-led humanitarian relief effort by President Bush in Somalia. 
<P>
The Bosnia peace implementation plan does the opposite. It strips any advantage from American ground forces and places U.S. troops in a passive and reactive posture. It gives the initiative of action to the warring factions and ensures that, regardless of U.S. action, the warring factions will be the sole determinants of mission success.
<p>
Secretary of Defense William Perry has tried to pre-empt the inevitable criticism of this static and passive military role for American forces by insisting that the U.S. will be "the meanest dog in town."  This gives the U.S. the opportunity to respond to tactical attacks, but still within a strategically passive mission. It raises again the specter of strategic incoherence that was so prevalent in U.S. strategy during the Vietnam war. While the U.S. may "win" all the little fights on the ground in Bosnia, the entire effort may have nothing to show for its "victories" at the end of the mission. 
<p>
Being the "meanest dog in town" is no advantage in Bosnian terrain that negates the U.S. superiority in armor and maneuver. It is no advantage against a foe who, in the words of strategist Andrew Krepinevich, will be more likely to attack U.S. forces as "fleas, and not another dog."<sup>7</sup>  It is no advantage when the U.S. is kept chained by a passive and static strategy that deprives the U.S. of the operational advantages of effective military doctrine. This mission will give the U.S. forces all the political constraints and liabilities of traditional peacekeeping, but with all the dangers and expenses of an enforcement operation -- and with no control over the results. Peace implementation combines the worst of both worlds, with no guarantee that the benefits of American intervention will outweigh the costs.
<p>
<b>Q. How will American forces know when they have accomplished their mission and are ready to leave? </b>
<p>
In order for the U.S. to avoid "mission creep" -- the unintended and unanticipated acceptance of new missions and new mandates -- it must stick to a comprehensive and clearly articulated strategy that lays out military objectives and a clear exit strategy. President Clinton stated in his national address that the mission in Bosnia would be clear, limited, and achievable. For that to be true, clearly defined and easily measurable military criteria must be identified at all levels of the military effort:  strategic, operational, and tactical. The prospects and costs of achieving these criteria also must be clearly stated. 
<p>
The <a href="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/bosnia/">American and NATO forces</a> deployed to Bosnia have very broad powers that extend to disarmament, refugee resettlement, election security, and even nation-building. A workable military campaign plan must reconcile those sweeping and comprehensive powers with the President's wish to keep the mission clear, limited, and achievable; it is inconsistent to state that the mission will be limited and at the same time plan for the forces to accomplish something politically sustainable. President Clinton has maintained all along that this deployment will be limited in scope, but the peace accord opens the door for NATO peacekeepers to perform many nation-building activities such as ensuring the free movement and resettlement of refugees, aiding humanitarian workers, resolving boundary disputes, creating secure conditions for free elections, and responding to violence against civilians.
<p>
Having multiple missions requires the military to have different criteria for success in these many tasks. In addition, the criteria for success at lower levels must add up to success at higher levels. The U.S. should not repeat the mistakes of the Vietnam war, in which criteria for success such as body counts and ammunition expenditure were ultimately irrelevant to the strategic and political outcome. Criteria should be easily measurable and must lead ultimately to an exit strategy. The exit strategy for a successful Bosnian peace implementation force must be driven by events, not by time as the President has suggested. It also cannot just reflect a "checklist" of tasks for American forces to accomplish. The exit strategy must be constructed with the intention of leaving behind a locally supported peace that does not require an open-ended commitment of American troops. In addition, in the very likely event that something does not go according to plan, several different exit strategies must be included in contingency plans. All possible eventualities must be planned for in military  operations.
<p>
<b>Q. How do American forces intend to avoid "mission creep?" </b>
<p>
Even with clearly defined, limited, achievable, and measurable objectives, U.S. forces can be subject to mission creep and escalatory fighting. The broad authority granted to NATO troops is a well-intentioned attempt by military planners to give the passively postured U.S. troops some measure of control over their environment and to help them minimize their risks and casualties. However, it also plants the seeds for mission creep and open-ended commitments. Ironically, the dynamics of mission creep and escalation will be most likely to take root when U.S. soldiers do the smart thing in response to aggression.
<p>
For instance, responding to attacks with "robust" rules of engagement will necessarily mean offensive combat operations. Vice President Al Gore noted recently that "if challenged, [American troops] will respond with brutal and overwhelming force... not just to provocations, but to evident intent."<sup>8</sup>  This aggressive attitude is in keeping with successful military doctrine, but it also presents a hazardous dilemma to American forces. If U.S. forces respond only to the immediate source of low-level attacks or threatened attacks (snipers, mortal teams, small paramilitary units), they run the risk of expending considerable resources in an attempt to swat a fly with a sledgehammer. If, however, as the Vice President implies, the U.S. commander chooses the far more effective option of responding to the primary source of the attack (local command headquarters, larger units, or leaders), then the action could easily deepen U.S. involvement. Robust rules of engagement are truly a double-edged sword in an intervention that is supposed to remain "limited."  By being tough and going after the "source" of the attack, the U.S. could escalate the conflict and lead to retaliations which require even harsher responses from the U.S. side.
<p>
The most poignant example of this occurred in Somalia. In June 1993, 24 Pakistani peacekeepers were killed by a mob of Somalis that included women and children. Instead of attempting to ferret out the responsible parties from within a surging street mob, the U.N. commander asked the U.S. to help him hit the source of the attack -- General Mohammed Farah Aideed. The U.S. then launched a series of limited offensive attacks to cut down Aideed's military power base and capture Aideed himself. This drew the U.S. deeper into the Somali conflict and gave American troops a new status as one more local faction in the Somali wars. All of this was brought on by robust rules of engagement. Although President Clinton talked tough in his November 27 speech, there are considerable risks and costs involved with "fighting fire with fire, and then some." As James Webb, former Secretary of the Navy and a highly decorated Vietnam combat veteran observed, the Bosnia rules of engagement are "a formula for confusion once a combat unit sent on a distinctly noncombat mission comes under repeated attack."<sup>9</sup><p>American troops will want to respond with disproportionate force in order to deter or discourage further attacks. However, the use of force always tends to draw all sides into further confrontation. Recent history provides unambiguous evidence of this. Attempts to undertake coercive disarmament or use robust rules of engagement in a peacekeeping-type operation failed in U.N. operations in the Congo in 1960-1964 and the former Yugoslavia and in U.S. missions in Lebanon (1982-1983) and Somalia (1992-1994). NATO's Implementation Force will be caught in a dilemma:  The more aggressively it operates, the better its chances of success and force protection, but also the more it will get drawn into the conflict and be seen as yet another warring faction.
<p>
<b>Q. Will the early withdrawal of American forces be supported by European allies, or will it cause the mission to collapse? </b>
<p>
Clinton has anticipated that American troops will be withdrawn within one year. In fact, the peace accord opens the possibility that the redeployment of American forces could begin as early as six months into the operation. European allies have universally condemned President Clinton's proposed timetable for American forces in Bosnia. President Chirac of France has predicted an armed NATO presence that could last up to 20 years. The United States intends to leave within 12 months because American public support would never tolerate a protracted and costly intervention in an area of marginal strategic interest to America. However, this action could damage U.S. credibility even further. 
<p>
In addition, local belligerents from all three factions who stand to gain by a continued American military presence are very likely to try to prevent U.S. withdrawal. In the past two years, U.N. units in Bosnia have been attacked by "friendly" factions opposed to their withdrawal or redeployment. The history of peacekeeping or peace enforcement does not offer many instances in which heavily involved forces have been able to make a quick and graceful exit. This brings to mind the Duke of Wellington's classic admonition that "Great nations do not fight small wars."  This reflects the fact that great powers cannot skip blithely in and out of conflicts. Once the prestige, honor, blood, and treasure of the United States are engaged, the U.S. will have to see the intervention through to its conclusion.
 <p>
<b>Q. What are the American contingency plans to deal with resistance to the efforts of the Implementation Force? </b><p>

Military commanders with experience in the Balkans have emphasized that U.S. forces are certain to encounter resistance from armed elements in Bosnia.<sup>10</sup>  President Clinton has stated that should the peace accord break down, U.S. troops would withdraw rather than stay in the midst of renewed civil war. A complete breakdown is not likely to happen because all parties benefit in the short run from the opportunity to rest and re-arm. It is far more likely that there will be sporadic and local levels of resistance and intransigence, in which case the United States will have only three bad options:  the "Northern Ireland option," in which the U.S. struggles on with the original mandate of the mission, accepting the casualties and continued commitment to the operation with no easily achievable end-state in sight; the "Vietnam option," in which the U.S. reinforces its forces and expands its mission and rules of engagement in order to try to force a solution through a more significant military effort; or the "Lebanon or Somalia option," in which the U.S. simply gives up and goes home. Any prolonged resistance could force the U.S. military in Bosnia into one of these options. There is no easy way out in Bosnia, especially in light of the resistance that can be anticipated. 
<p>
<b>Q. How does the U.S. plan to assume a peacekeeping role, train and arm the Bosnian Muslims, and supervise or enforce a "build-down" of Serbian armaments all at the same time? </b>
<p>
The implementation plan calls for the Bosnian Serbs to "reduce their military potential to the level where it is no longer a threat to the federation. If the Bosnian Serbs do not disarm, the United States has given assurances to the Bosnian government that it will level the playing field by equipping and training the Bosnian army."<sup>11</sup>  There are many questions still to be answered about the modalities of this mission and what role U.S. forces will play. The IFOR has broad powers under the agreement, including the power to remove or relocate certain units or weapons that it feels may threaten the mission. This will entail an active and most likely coercive role for IFOR. In addition, it remains to be seen how Bosnian Serb military potential will be measured, who will do the measuring, and exactly what types of coercive action will be taken against factions that refuse to disarm. 
<p>
In Somalia the U.S. discovered that the same force cannot act as a neutral peacekeeper and conduct coercive disarmament at the same time. It is a proven formula for disaster. Another lesson was that coercive and comprehensive disarmament very rapidly draws the coercer into the conflict. The initial American-led operation in Somalia gave American forces circumscribed and localized rules of engagement that allowed U.S. troops to disarm Somalis who immediately threatened U.S. operations. However, the nation-building mandate of the U.N.-led operation in Somalia greatly increased the mandate for disarmament, and in 1993 U.N. forces began aggressively to seek out the arms caches of warring factions in Mogadishu. This led directly to the disastrous street battle of October 3, 1993, in which 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and over 75 wounded. 
<p>
The only other option for a disarmament plan such as the one written into the Bosnian peace accord is to ignore those factions that refuse to disarm and hope that they choose to remain passive. This is what the United Nations did in Cambodia in 1992-1993. When the Khmer Rouge refused to honor the disarmament provisions of the Cambodian peace treaty, the U.N. commander knew it would be folly to try to coerce over 50,000 Khmer Rouge guerrillas into disarmament. The U.N. commander's plan instead was to "ride his luck"<sup>12</sup> and hope the Khmer Rouge did not disrupt the Cambodian elections or peace process. He knew that to pursue reluctant belligerents could draw his troops into a long, bloody, and fruitless contest. The same dilemma will confront the IFOR in Bosnia:  Pursue disarmament at great cost and risk escalating the fighting, or ignore intransigent belligerents and "hope" for their goodwill and cooperation.
<p>
In addition to these problems, any perception of American evenhandedness will be compromised by the plan to arm the Bosnian Muslims or Croats. European allies have strongly resisted the U.S. plan to arm and train the Muslims. However, the key to lasting peace in the Balkans is a local balance of power, and it is doubtful that this can be achieved without lifting the arms embargo (scheduled to be lifted 90 days after the peace accord is signed in Paris) and training the Muslims. Either way, the mission to "level the playing field" is fraught with difficulty for an outside party trying to create and sustain the subtleties of a local standoff in Bosnia.
<p>
<b>Q. Will the command and control structure worked out with the Russians stand up to the pressures of the mission? </b>
<p>
Command and control structures must be responsive, authoritative, rehearsed, and legitimate. Most important, they must be organized to handle the stress and strain of a "worst case scenario."  An authoritative command and control structure can offer a framework for action and response when military missions are faced with dangerous and contentious situations. The arrangement worked out with Russia looks reasonable on paper, but is likely to break down under pressure. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has stated that the Russian commander and the national authorities in Moscow have veto power over orders issued to the Russian contingent by the U.S. commander. This sort of arrangement can elevate tactical disagreements to a political level and exacerbate friction between the U.S. and Russia. The Administration would do well to heed an old military aphorism:  "If you cannot explain the command and control structure in less than 10 seconds, it isn't going to work."
<p>
Because goals and objectives are hard to define in a peace enforcement operation of this sort, European, American, and Russian policy could diverge to a great degree, as it has in the recent past. Much the same happened in Somalia. In the absence of clearly defined and measurable military goals, peace enforcement forces from different nations approached their mission in very different ways. This divergence caused the U.S. to insist on the removal of the Italian commander in Somalia. Imagine the imbroglios that could develop among the U.S., Russia, and the Europeans after NATO and Russian troops start dying in Bosnia. Peace enforcement is yet to be proven as a viable military concept, and its lack of conceptual and practical clarity means that when the shooting starts, everybody interprets the mandates in different ways. Failure to address these issues within a workable command and control framework could cause a further deterioration of alliance solidarity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Very serious questions remain about the recently concluded Bosnia peace accord. The political plan is admittedly tenuous, as evidenced by the fact that its implementation requires some 60,000 NATO combat troops. The fact is that this accord cannot succeed without clearly evident local support. Among the many questions that remain to be answered are those concerning the political viability of a hastily cobbled-together Bosnian state whose planned structure does not clearly address the fundamental political aims and concerns of the previously warring parties. A peace accord does not necessarily make the peace, and it must be remembered that some Nobel Prize-winning accords, such as the 1974 Vietnam peace settlement, have collapsed in ignominy because they did not address the basic issues at hand.
<p>
In addition, the military strategy of the peace implementation plan must undergo a rigorous examination to determine whether the objectives and modus operandi of the Implementation Force represent a sound and coherent plan for NATO. There is an inherent contradiction between the President's stated desire to keep the mission "clear, limited, and achievable" and the sweeping authority given to the NATO force in areas such as disarmament, refugee resettlement, and nation-building. In addition, contingency plans to address all manner of resistance must be addressed categorically. Calculations about costs, benefits, and the probability of success must be applied to all possible circumstances and discussed fully. 
<p>
The Bosnian peace plan is a tremendously risky enterprise. All of the factors involved in its implementation must be fully understood and debated before American lives and prestige are put on the line in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<h3>COMMENTS ON DEPLOYMENT OF 25,000 U.S. FORCES<br> 

IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA</h3> 
<P>
<B>TESTIMONY OF JEANE J. KIRKPATRICK</B> 
<P>
<B>before</B> 
<P>
<B>THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE</B><br> 
<B>UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</B> 
<P><i>NOVEMBER 15, 1995</i> </center>
<P><hr><P>
<B>Introduction</B> 
<P>
I thank the Committee on National Security for inviting me to
testify today on this important subject. I will try to restrict
my remarks to subjects directly relevant to the Committee's concerns.
<P>
I welcome the Committee's hearings on U.S. troop deployment. Obviously
it is difficult no, impossible for the Committee or its witnesses
to decide whether it will be necessary or desirable to support
and to implement an agreement which does not exist, whose terms
are unknown, and about which there remain large differences among
the parties.
<P>
We do not know whether defensible borders will be drawn for Bosnia
Herzegovina, whether the arms embargo will be lifted and a Bosnian
army trained to defend its country from well-armed neighbors.
We do not know who else will be participating in a multinational
peace force, nor how they will be integrated and commanded, nor
under what rules of engagement they will operate, nor what kind
of exit strategy is planned.
<P>
It is impossible, therefore to decide now that the United States
should or should not participate in a hypothetical force to defend
a hypothetical agreement, but it is possible to address questions
relevant to the deployment.
<P>
<B>II. United States National Interests in Bosnia</B> 
<P>
The Committee asks: Are there important national interests at
stake in Bosnia? My answer to this question is yes, Americans
have many important interests in this conflict.
<P>
I have believed from the onset of the war in former Yugoslavia
that important moral, political and strategic interests are at
stake in the Balkans. Recall that two world wars have spread from
the Balkan tinder box wars which engulfed the European continent
and eventually involved the United States as well. Because we
are a part of the Western world, we cannot be indifferent to brutal
aggression and mass murder in the heart of Europe.
<P>
More than two and one half million Bosnians have been displaced
from their homes in this war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration
camps, torture, mass rape and mass murder have become familiar
again in the region. The methods used against the people of Bosnia
slaughter, starvation, forced population transfers and other instruments
of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; dehumanize the victims. Indifference
to these dehumanizes us.
<P>
The Committee requests a description of the &quot;precise connection&quot;
between stability in Bosnia, the Balkan peninsula and the balance
of power in Europe. But &quot;precise connections&quot; are known
only after events have developed. Often they come as a surprise.
<P>
But we know violence is contagious. And that conquest is contagious
as well. Former Yugoslavia is centrally, strategically located.
Location is not everything in international affairs, but the centrality
and ethnic-diversification of former Yugoslavia give developments
there greater geostrategic significance than if those countries
were more isolated or remote. Moreover, the countries of Central
Europe recently released from the Soviet Empire have new regimes
and new borders which leave them more susceptible to destabilization
than established regimes.
<P>
In the current conflict, violence sponsored by the Serbian government
has already spread from Kosovo to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina.
It has already extended across Macedonia's borders. We cannot
know where it might end if permitted to continue. Russia, too,
has a stake in the region, and Ukraine, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania,
Greece, Turkey, Italy.
<P>
We should not forget that Benito Mussolini and his Black Shirts
inspired Adolf Hitler and others, nor that Mussolini's aggression
against Ethiopia presented the League of Nations and its members
a challenge they could not meet and the League collapsed, that
Hitler was encouraged by the Italian's success to consolidate
his own powers, and that Hitler's success in occupying the Rhineland
encouraged him to move again into Austria, Czechoslovakia and
beyond, to the ovens of Auschwitz and the graveyards of Normandy.
<P>
Through it all, our European Allies watched, never dreaming that
Hitler's appetite would extend so far or with such consequences.
They had vital interests and no prescience. Much the same combination
has guided the European response to Serb expansion.
<P>
The harm done by violent tyrants in this century always comes
as a surprise.
<P>
The United States and the whole of democratic Europe have a large
stake in ensuring that extreme nationalism, instability, xenophobia
and Serb conquests do not whet the savage appetites of would-be
tyrants and conquerors in the Balkans and among their neighbors.
<P>
<B>III. The Proposed Deployment: Is it Necessary?</B> 
<P>
To say the United States has an interest in ending violence and
conquest in Bosnia and an interest in promoting and preserving
stability and democracy in the region is not to say we must send
25,000 U.S. troops to take part in a 60,000 man peace operation
much less that such an operation would succeed.
<P>
No new style peacekeeping operation undertaken by the United Nations
and the Clinton Administration in an area of conflict has secured
peace. U.N. peace operations conducted in Somalia and Bosnia over
the last three years have achieved virtually none of their goals
although Phase I of the Somalia operation, undertaken by President
George Bush, succeeded in delivering large quantities of food
to prevent mass starvation in Somalia.
<P>
These &quot;peace operations&quot; have suffered from disorganization
and disagreement among participants, lack of coordination and
political will, military incompetence and ineffectiveness. Some
of their shortcomings were a consequence of the United Nation's
lack of skill and experience. Some were a consequence of the diverse
interests, priorities, goals and perspectives of participants
which are common to multilateral operations.
<P>
But it is not clear that a multinational operation involving many
governments, languages and organizational habits can succeed in
coping with difficult military problems. Clearly, however, an
operation under NATO command has a better chance of success than
one under U.N. command. That is what is now proposed.
<P>
A) Does American credibility requires 25,000 U.S. troops on the
ground?
<P>
U.S. credibility is at stake only if the Clinton Administration
made commitments to supply such a force without consultation or
consent of the Congress. But America's allies understand that
the Congress plays an important constitutional role in U.S. foreign
policy. Failure to provide ground troops might do superficial
damage to America's credibility, but committing troops and failing
to achieve our goal would constitute a devastating blow to the
credibility of the U.S. government at home and abroad. <I>The
worst outcome would be an effort that first committed U.S. forces
to the task and then failed as in Vietnam and Somalia.</I> 
<P>
Moreover, it is not clear that the Clinton Administration understands
how to use force and the threat of force to establish and maintain
credibility, and achieve goals.
<P>
B) Is deployment of U.S. troops necessary to preserve NATO? We
do not know what kind of commitment was made by the Administration
to NATO. Neither do we know how many NATO countries have committed
to participate, nor on what terms.
<P>
Several NATO countries Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey,
the United States and France (the French are still not members
of NATO) have had troops in and around former Yugoslavia for two
or three years operating as part of a United Nations force, under
U.N. command and as part of a NATO force as well. Much effort
and billions of dollars have achieved almost nothing.
<P>
U.S. forces have participated in the conflict in Bosnia through
air and sea missions conducted under the auspices of NATO. U.S.
ships have monitored enforcement of economic and arms embargoes.
U.S. planes and pilots have relieved pressure on UNPROFOR forces
under attack, carried out air drops of food and medicine to populations
under siege, monitored the &quot;no fly&quot; zones established
in U.N. Security Council Resolution 781, monitored the installation
by Serb forces of air defenses, rescued Capt. Scott O'Grady, conducted
the first non-lethal air strikes ever, and provided high altitude
surveillance of Serb activities including confirmation of the
movement of Serb tanks across the border to participate in the
assault on Srebrenica and of mass murder of Bosnian males following
the fall of Srebrenica last July.
<P>
Until now NATO's participation in former Yugoslavia has been carried
out under a &quot;double key&quot; command system which requires
United Nations' authorization for each operation authorization
that was granted slowly and with reluctance.
<P>
NATO air power has not been used effectively and has not been
successful. More serious is the fact that these arrangements have
reflected the preferences of the United States' NATO allies.
<P>
<I>Our NATO allies</I> the British, Dutch, Belgians and French
(the French are still not members of NATO) <I>preferred peacekeeping
under U.N command.</I> The United States, stung from the Somalia
experience, did not place U.S. forces directly under U.N. command
in former Yugoslavia, but closely coordinated U.S. and NATO operations
with and recognized the authority of the U.N. Secretary General
and his Representative over NATO operations. <I>The result was
to undermine NATO's credibility and effectiveness.</I> 
<P>
So, is it true that U.S. refusal to participate with ground troops
in a new phase of peacekeeping in Bosnia would weaken NATO? I
find it unpersuasive that U.S. refusal to send 25,000 ground troops
for peacekeeping duties on the ground would further weaken an
already weakened NATO.
<P>
Deployment of 60,000 troops may simply bring inside NATO disagreements
among allies on tactics that have so far taken place outside the
NATO framework.
<P>
<B>IV. Taking into account these factors, should the United States deploy 25,000 troops in former Yugoslavia?</B> 
<P>
Not unless President Clinton makes a persuasive case for this
deployment.
<P>
Not if there are alternative strategies that could contain aggression.
<P>
So far the alternatives have not been authoritatively tried or
even considered at least publicly. They should be. Bill Clinton
should make his case to the people and take his case to the Congress.
<P>
Not unless there is clear understanding and agreement among NATO
members concerning command it should be an American and rules
of engagement they should authorize the use of overwhelming force
in response to attacks on people.
<P>
Not unless there is a realistic prospect that the peace in the
region can be maintained after the departure of U.S. troops.
<P>
That requires 1) <I>defensible borders for Bosnia Herzegovina</I>,
and 2) <I>lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia Herzegovina
and helping equip and train Bosnian armed forces</I> so that they
can defend themselves as Croatia can now defend itself.
<P>
I continue to believe that there is promise in a &quot;lift and
strike&quot; policy in which the United States (and NATO if so
inclined) accepts responsibility for the arming and training of
Bosnian military forces. I think such a policy could prevent recurrence
of aggression and the spread of war if it were reinforced by an
active American diplomacy and a substantial U.S. presence in the
area.
<P>
I do not know why the Clinton Administration has not tried a &quot;lift
and strike&quot; strategy to create a peace which could last.
I suspect it is because of the reluctance of our allies to &quot;take
sides.&quot; But only a policy which faces facts, takes sides,
punishes aggressors, and leaves defensible borders can meet American
standards and American goals.
<P>
I fear the same reluctance of the same Allies may encourage the
Administration to design a strategy that does not provide a solution,
but requires 25,000 U.S. ground troops. That would be a great
mistake.
<P>
We need realistic plans, realistic means, and goals consistent
with our ideals.

<title>Clinton Fails to Make Case for American Troops -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3>CLINTON FAILS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR AMERICAN TROOPS IN BOSNIA</h3>

By John Hillen<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 437<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>

	The Clinton Administration's plan to use 25,000 American troops to implement a Bosnian peace accord is being exposed as a haphazard and risky enterprise.  In hearings on Capitol Hill last week, members of the Senate and House questioned the political and military rationale behind the Bosnia peace plan deployment.  These questions focused on the mission's political goals, its military objectives, the probability of success, the risks entailed, and the support of the American people.  Robert McNamara recently noted in his memoirs that the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations failed to address these fundamental issues in the early debates over Vietnam.  It appears that the Clinton Administration is ready to fall into the same trap.
<p>
	The Clinton plan puts the cart before the horse.  Instead of making a troop commitment that is tailored to support a specific and workable peace accord, President Clinton made a commitment for 25,000 U.S. ground troops before he knew what the peace accord would entail -- an arbitrary pledge over two years ago. This backwards strategy forces a political plan onto an abstract military force requirement.  Members of Congress were correct to question why the Administration is attempting to force 25,000 U.S. ground troops onto a plan that does not yet exist.  In addition, the congressional hearings last week made it clear that the Clinton troop request is a mission looking for a purpose.  These hearings raised many prescient questions and issues that remain neither answered nor resolved:
<p>
	<b>1)  What are the objectives, and how does America know when they have been achieved?</b>  The American "Implementation Force" has no clearly defined and attainable military goals and no specific criteria by which the U.S. commanders can measure their success.  The Clinton plan fails to address military objectives and commits American forces to static picket duty in an interpositional buffer zone.  The American forces are supposed to sit there and "monitor" infractions of the peace accord.  General Lewis MacKenzie, a Canadian who commanded the first United Nations troops in Sarajevo, told Members of Congress last week that, of all the various national contingents, U.S. troops would be the primary targets for disgruntled belligerents.  He also told the House National Security Committee that while the Administration may try to portray the Implementation Force as a neutral "peacekeeping" presence, the United States will be perceived as the enemy by one side in the conflict.  He re-emphasized the danger to U.S. forces by adding that if he were an American military officer, he "wouldn't touch this mission with a ten-foot pole." 
<p>	<b>2) There is no exit strategy.</b>  Precisely because American forces do not have well-defined and achievable military goals, "mission creep" is inherent in the Clinton peace plan.  With the Administration under enormous pressure to succeed after deploying 25,000 troops, President Clinton will be sorely tempted to escalate American military efforts when faced with the inevitable resistance of the warring factions. To forestall this, the Administration plan calls for a time-driven scenario in which the American forces will be pulled out in twelve months.  Almost all the Members of Congress recognized that this is a purely political decision and were extremely skeptical when General John Shalikashvili defended this timetable for unexplained "operational reasons."  This is shameless political grandstanding on the part of President Clinton, and Congress rightly called his bluff.  As former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle testified, "An exit date is not an exit strategy."
<P>	<b>3) The Clinton team has anticipated and planned for a best-case scenario.</b>  Military planning, down to the lowest levels, always takes into account worst-case scenarios.  Military leaders must plan for what to do when anything and everything goes wrong.  Because this plan represents an ill-defined mission taking place in the volatile Balkans, there is every reason to believe that unexpected events will be a fixture. Senators were rightly astounded when Secretary of Defense William Perry stated that he "could not conceive of circumstances where troops would stay longer" than the one-year target date. This comment exposed the political and military naivet that permeates the Clinton Administration. There are no contingency plans to address a scenario other than the fanciful best-case scenario anticipated by the Administration.  Should there be anything less than cooperation by the Bosnian parties, America would be forced either to cut and run or to reinforce troops in Bosnia and escalate military efforts to make the peace plan succeed.  The testimony of General MacKenzie made it clear that, despite Secretary Perry's optimism, American troops will have a rough time of it in Bosnia.
<p>	The Administration plan to deploy American ground forces has much to answer for, especially in regard to the fundamental questions that policymakers must address when contemplating the deployment of American combat troops into dangerous environments.  The Clinton team did not provide satisfactory answers to Congress, either on these fundamental issues or on a host of other questions about the mission.  The Administration has not clearly articulated its political and military goals in Bosnia. As Secretary of State Warren Christopher himself admitted after the hearings, "No, we haven't yet made the case." Most important, the Administration has not explained why the U.S. needs to send 25,000 ground troops to Bosnia and how a 12-month deployment can make a decisive contribution to a lasting peace in Bosnia.

<title>Conditions for Sending U.S. Troops to Bosnia -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><i><h3>CONDITIONS FOR SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO BOSNIA</h3></i>

By John Hillen, Policy Analyst <br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 66<br>
October 11, 1995<br></center>
<p>

	The President has promised to send 25,000 U.S. troops to Bosnia to police a peace settlement. He should not do so without the approval of Congress. Any operation as risky and potentially long-reaching as this one demands the full participation and approval of the House and Senate, and Congress should ensure that certain conditions are met before American troops are sent to Bosnia. While affirming the principle that all American forces, including ground troops, can be used in lesser regional conflicts and peacekeeping operations in Europe, Congress also should note the special risks and dangers associated with the Bosnian peace plan and ensure that specific criteria are met before American troops are deployed.
<p>
	As Congress debates whether U.S. troops should be committed in Bosnia, it should remember that:
<p><ul>
<li>America must lead in NATO, but sound leadership demands that the U.S. question a mission with ambiguous goals and ill-defined objectives. Washington should commit to NATO operations in principle but should not support losing propositions.
<p>
<li>The promised 25,000 American troops would cost two to three times more than the $1 billion - $2 billion estimated by the Clinton Administration.
<p>
<li>The Administration has not spelled out a coherent military plan that specifies the exact mission of the troops, the criteria to determine the success of that mission, timetables, rules of engagement, or command and control arrangements (especially concerning Russian participation).
<p>
<li>The plan to send 50,000 - 70,000 heavily armed NATO troops is clear evidence that this mission is an exercise in peace-enforcement, not peacekeeping, as the Administration claims. NATO troops will be authorized to undertake limited offensive operations against warring factions that violate the conditions of the peace accord. 
<p>
<li>Because of this, "mission creep," the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into this plan. As in Somalia, there will be pressure to increase operations and reinforce troops in order to "succeed."
<p>
<li>U.S. forces will not be accepted as impartial peacekeepers. The U.S. recently launched a comprehensive air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs and announced plans to train the Bosnian Muslim Army during the Bosnian deployment. The U.S. is no longer neutral in this conflict. This phenomenon also occurred in Lebanon in 1983 and Somalia in 1993, where the lives of American Marines and soldiers were needlessly lost because America failed to appreciate that belligerents viewed the U.S. as a combatant.</ul><p>

<b>THE ROLE OF CONGRESS</b>
<p>
The Congress should:<p><ul>

<li>Insist on full congressional approval for any deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia;
<p>
<li>Hold hearings to determine the feasibility of U.S. participation in a Bosnian peace force; and
<p>
<li>Insist that the President meet the following conditions prior to any deployment of U.S. forces:
<p>
<li>Establish that U.S. national interests are threatened in Bosnia-Herzegovina;
<p>
<li>Publicize exactly what military commitments the Administration has made to both NATO and the Bosnian government;
<p>
<li>Establish that the peace accord is not merely another transient cease-fire, but a politically sustainable agreement;
<p>
<li>Confirm that all parties have withdrawn to clearly recognizable lines of demarcation that can be policed efficiently by a NATO force;
<p>
<li>State strategic and operational objectives for the U.S. force that are clearly defined, attainable, and sustainable; 
<p>
<li>Describe the exit strategy and clear criteria for determining mission success, including an "escape clause" in case the peace accord proves ephemeral;
<p>
<li>State the deployment, rotation, and redeployment timetables, as well as whether they are event-driven or time-driven;
<p>
<li>State clearly the mission cost and the effect on U.S. strategic readiness posture;
<p>
<li>Present a well-defined command and control structure that clearly addresses the role of Russian forces;
<p>
<li>Ensure that there is no overlap of responsibility and authority with the United Nations Protection Force, which should be entirely separate from the NATO chain of command;
<p>
<li>Present contingency plans for various scenarios that realistically address additional resources, cost, and operational feasibility;
<p>
<li>Submit a multinational force structure and command and control plan that ensures unity of command and effort among the many nations taking part; 
<p>
<li>Demonstrate that there are clear rules of engagement that are compatible with U.S. training and doctrine, with American forces not to be given static and passive missions that allow them only to react to initiatives of the warring belligerents;
<p>
<li>Ensure that U.S. troops will be deployed in sufficient strength to guarantee force protection and fully supported operations (no "token" force should be deployed in a dangerous theater); and
<p>
<li>Explain how past U.S. actions in Bosnia are consistent with a "peacekeeping" role.	   
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
There is clear evidence that American ground troops could imperil a Bosnian peace force by discrediting its impartial standing. Instead of committing large numbers of ground forces, the U.S. should play to its strengths by supporting this mission with capabilities that only the U.S. can contribute. These include strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and combat air support if necessary. American ground troops offer no tactical or operational advantage to a Bosnian peace force. They offer only political advantage for reluctant European allies.
<p>
	The U.S. should agree, in principle, to deploy its military forces (including ground troops) to assist in peacekeeping operations in Europe. But the Bosnian peace plan is not peacekeeping; it is peace enforcement. As yet, there is no reliable or sustainable peace settlement in Bosnia. When there is, the U.S. should consider sending in any forces necessary, but only if the foregoing conditions are met.

<title>The Risks of Clinton's Bosnia Peace Plan -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<i><h3>THE RISKS OF CLINTON'S BOSNIA PEACE PLAN</h3></i>
By John Hillen, Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 262<br>
October 10, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder Update</i> No. 250, "Clinton's Bosnia Folly," June 2, 1995, and <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1012, "Don't Let Bosnia Destroy NATO," December 28, 1994.)
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	The impending diplomatic breakthrough in the Balkans has raised the prospect of a substantial American and allied military operation to police a Bosnian peace accord. Such an operation undoubtedly would entail an exercise in "peace-enforcement," with United States and allied troops using limited and selective enforcement measures to ensure the compliance of warring factions. 
<p>
	Knowing that this will not present U.S. forces either with a clearly defined, attainable military mission or with a decisive political objective, the Clinton Administration will try to sell the plan as a temporary and innocuous "peacekeeping" operation. The Administration maintains that this would involve only the limited deployment of approximately 25,000 American troops at a cost of $1 billion. But some experts have concluded that the operation would cost two or three times this much and that it probably would involve more than 25,000 American troops over a period of several years. 
<p>
	In much the same way, the Bush Administration tried to sell the Somalia operation as a limited humanitarian enterprise. In fact, the Administration's initial pronouncements even suggested that the troops would be home in seven weeks, by Inauguration Day. But American troops did not leave Somalia until some 16 months later, their good work obscured by the Ranger debacle in Mogadishu, the incoherence of a United Nations-managed peace-enforcement operation, and the renewal of clan warfare in Somalia. The Clinton Administration's planned deployment of American troops to Bosnia is fraught with much greater danger than was faced in Somalia and raises several strategic dilemmas. Some of these, concerning mission objectives, timetables, command and control, and rules of engagement, have been raised by GOP leaders in Congress. Others still need to be addressed:
<p>
<b>NATO Involvement.</b> Because of a rash promise by President Clinton, the U.S. is committed to a major role in implementing a Bosnian peace plan. This in itself should spark a major debate. How did NATO, America's principal security alliance, become a back-door conduit for heavy ground involvement in a conflict of marginal interest to U.S. security concerns? 
<p>
	In 1992, the world heard that this was the "hour of Europe"; in 1995, the U.S. hears once again that its European allies are leery of decisive commitments in the absence of American leadership. The U.S. obviously must lead NATO, but saying no to an ill-conceived peace-enforcement mission with vague and undefined objectives is clearer evidence of leadership than throwing troops into a losing cause. Significant U.S. participation in any NATO enterprise should be contingent on two things:  a clear and present danger to the security and stability of Europe, and a mission with clearly defined political and military goals.
<p>
	Is NATO the proper vehicle for a Bosnian peace force?  Should an alliance starved of credibility and uncertain of its future structure tackle internecine, ethnic conflict in Bosnia?  A NATO Balkan peace-enforcement force could have several unfortunate consequences. For example, it could unleash dissension at the very time NATO is trying to expand. Much as Somalia split the U.N. coalition, the ups and downs of the Bosnian mission could split the European alliance. Faced with the demonstrated intransigence of the belligerents, NATO could experience a resumption of the divergent approaches and internal squabbling that plagued its response to Bosnia in 1993-1994. A Bosnian peace force, under current circumstances, has precious little to offer NATO during a critical phase in its evolution. NATO should not allow a poorly crafted, self-fulfilling prophesy to lure it into accepting this mission.  
<p>
<b>U.S. Troops as "Peacekeepers."</b>  Peacekeeping is an exercise in which the peacekeepers are accepted as honest brokers, neutral and impartial. Because peacekeepers are deployed after an accord has been reached, they operate only in a supervisory role and are forced to rely on the good will and cooperation of the belligerents. President Clinton claims that the U.S. force would be structured for a "peaceful" and "uneventful" mission. 
<p>
	But as currently planned, this would not be a classic peacekeeping operation. So far in Bosnia there is no peace to keep. If U.S. ground troops are sent into Bosnia without a firm peace settlement, they will not be going in as neutrals. The United States, for better or for worse, has just completed a sustained air offensive against one side in the Bosnian conflict. While America may see itself as the impartial hand that "leveled the playing field," the Bosnian Serbs most certainly do not. They were on the receiving end of hundreds of airstrikes from NATO aircraft and American cruise missiles. In addition, the Clinton Administration plans to train the Bosnian Muslim forces while simultaneously acting as peacekeepers. Does the Administration really think the Serbs will accept American ground troops as impartial and neutral peacekeepers? 
<p>
	The U.S. has made this hazardous assumption twice before in recent years:  In Lebanon, in 1983, U.S. air and naval forces attacked Druze and Shiite militia positions while maintaining a "neutral" peacekeeping force in Beirut. Within days of the strikes, over 240 U.S. Marines were dead after a terrorist suicide strike against their barracks. 
<p>
	In Somalia, the U.S. also chose to attack one belligerent party while professing neutrality. The actions against Mohammed Aideed's party drew American troops into the conflict as if they were yet another local faction -- the only one without the political will to slug it out in the bloody back streets of Mogadishu.
<p>
<b>"Mission Creep."</b> Mission creep, the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into the Clinton plan for a Bosnian peace force. A force of 25,000 American soldiers is the absolute minimum needed to give the U.S. the security it needs to operate in Bosnia. A smaller force would be hopelessly exposed and unable to accomplish much of anything.  
<p>
	Since 25,000 troops are the minimum for protection alone, the question becomes how a peace plan will be imposed on the belligerents. The answer could be:  Call for more troops. This is exactly what happened in Somalia after the street battles of October 3, 1993. Within weeks, Clinton was forced to deploy an additional 15,000 troops to Somalia to ensure the security of a few thousand American soldiers operating with the U.N. mission. A force of 25,000 American troops for Bosnia anticipates a best-case scenario. Any deterioration of this scenario must lead to greater American participation. 
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The President's idea of peacekeeping in Bosnia would not be peacekeeping at all.  As yet, there is no peace to keep. The Clinton plan amounts to peace-enforcement in a dangerous and hostile environment. This is why NATO is planning for 50,000-70,000 heavily armed combat troops and not the lightly armed observers more common to peacekeeping missions. 
<p>
	Should a truly conclusive peace settlement be reached in Bosnia, and peacekeeping become possible, America should support a NATO peace force with strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and -- in the case of extreme emergency -- combat air support and possibly some ground troops. There is nothing to gain, either for America or for the peacekeeping force, by deploying substantial American ground forces in this risky adventure. American ground troops offer no operational advantage to the force. They are merely a political backstop for reluctant European allies. Based upon America's experiences in Lebanon and Somalia, it is obvious that participation by American ground troops could damage mission credibility and undermine the peace America and its allies are attempting to preserve. 
<p>
	While the U.S. should agree in principle to support NATO peace-enforcement operations when they make sense -- in other words, when the mission and political objectives are clear -- it should not commit itself to a deal that is bound to fail. In order to honor U.S. security commitments, America should be willing to deploy troops for lesser regional conflicts, and even for peacekeeping. However, it should do so only in cases where the benefits of success outweigh the risks of failure. The Clinton "peacekeeping" plan is not one of those cases.

<h1><center>Medical Innovation Project</center></h1>
<p>
Civilization is poised to make major strides in medicine and health. These
advances have the potential to dramatically increase both life spans and quality
of life, while at the same time reducing the cost of health care. Yet all of this
progress and our ability to realize fully the benefits of these advances is
threatened by an outmoded regulatory framework.<p> 

The Foundation's Medical Innovation Project seeks to replace the current process
by which new drugs and medical devices are brought to market in the United
States. Under the leadership of Dr. Louis Sullivan, former Secretary of Health
and Human Services, the Medical Innovation Project is well advanced in its
efforts to develop a much more privately focused system to make sure that
beneficial drugs and medical devices are brought to the market while still
ensuring their safety and effectiveness. <p>

The MIP is currently designing, in complete and comprehensive form, ready for
implementation, a new process by which new drugs and other medical technologies
are tested and made available to consumers for the early part of the 21st
century. A major thrust of the project is to explore avenues for dramatically
increasing the role of the private sector in the testing and certification
process and, accordingly, shifting the government's role to one of oversight of
the process rather than operations per se. <p>

<H1>Finding Defenses Against Parasitic Bureaucracies</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>More young Americans believe in UFOs than believe they'll receive Social Security.  Only 25% of Americans trust the federal government.  30 years ago it was 75%.  No wonder -- the federal government now runs trillion-dollar deficits, dedicates 15% of its budget to pay interest on the national debt, and spends two-thirds of what remains on entitlements programs.  One entitlement to <A HREF="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa241es.html">Archer Daniels Midland Co.</A>, the nation's leading ethanol producer, costs taxpayers $30 for every $1 of ADM profits.  </P>

<P>Behavioral ecology helps explain these findings.  Governments become parasitic; they get their hooks into and drain productive individuals and groups.  </P>

<P>The authors of the U.S. Constitution well understood the problems of political parasitism.  They knew that the default position is for government to become a parasitic agent that feeds off involuntary hosts without providing commensurate benefits.  Constant vigilance is required to forestall this outcome.</P>

<P>Our government is a social arrangement legitimized by the consent of the governed.  The constitution sets the rules for making laws and regulations.  Citizens sacrifice certain rights to guarantee predictable, social order.</P>

<P>In principle, nearly all sane people find these sacrifices preferable to anarchy.  It makes little difference whether we drive on the right or left side of the road, as long as we all drive on the same side.  Having government select and enforce one side benefits society immensely at little cost.  In many ways, great and subtle, government is a social lubricant.  </P>

<P>But there is a profound tension inherent to political management.  The key social lubricant, government, is also the ultimate source of coercion.  Government can make life easier by establishing courts and minting currency, but can it stop there?  </P>

<P>When government becomes the Welfare and Nanny State its major functions are to redistribute wealth and opportunities.  Government bureaucracies generate no wealth on their own.  Unlike private, independent actors who must rely on mutually beneficial, voluntary agreements, federal bureaucracies depend on taxation and forced transfers.  Their lifeblood is siphoned from successful individuals and organizations.  There are huge temptations for government to expand its activities and become an economic parasite.</P>

<P>Michael Rothschild, in his book <A HREF="http://www.bionomics.org/text/resource/biobook.html"><CITE>Bionomics</CITE></A>, describes economic parasites as organisms that &quot;use secrecy, deception, brute force, and legal authority as their 'hooks'.&quot;  No doubt active government agencies use all of the above tactics, some more than others.  The <A HREF="http://www.fs.fed.us">U.S. Forest Service</A>, quietly loses a billion dollars a year managing lands it got for free.  It relies on an oblivious public who loves Smokey but is largely ignorant of how Forest Service operations deplete our forests, divide our communities, and depreciate our economies.</P>

<P>Federal subsidies to ethanol producers, championed by Bob Dole (&quot;Senator Ethanol&quot;, according to his own press release), are predicated on the deception that they save energy and improve air quality.  They epitomize corporate welfare and gross economic inefficiencies.  The <A HREF="http://www.fws.gov">Fish and Wildlife Service</A>, in forcing landowners to provide habitat for endangered species, is one of many agencies who implement brute force as its hook.  These parasitic agencies drain their host (taxpayers, landowners) usually without their consent.</P>

<P>Society needs defenses against parasites, just as our bodies do.  When economic parasitism comes from criminals, government is expected (and funded by taxes) to intervene.  What happens when government IS the economic parasite?  The Founders' question, &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot; (who will monitor the monitors themselves) has no satisfactory answer.</P>

<P>Behavioral ecology can offer great insight here.  Humans, their pets, fruits, and other organisms have been plagued by parasites throughout history.  Society has devised many treatments to mitigate harm, especially when cures are not available.</P>

<P>Traditional treatments often include some form of quarantine.  Parasites need a host.  By isolating parasites from potential new hosts, the parasite will eventually die.  Quarantining fruits, pets, and the infirmed is an example of this.  Similarly, the Bubonic Plague was tackled by implementing waste management practices which separated rat habitat from human habitat.</P>

<P>Successes against biological parasites can be translated to political economy.  Imprisoning criminals effectively quarantines them.  Likewise, by quarantining an activist, parasitic government, its many bureaucratic tentacles will wither.  </P>

<P>This is what the Framers of the Constitution had in mind:  a limited government, based on a system of checks and balances and a Bill of Rights which protects individuals and states from incursions of a parasitic Big Government.  The limited, quarantined government could still do its essentials (like protect from invasions and select which side of the road to drive on), but couldn't engage in the parasitic behavior that is epidemic today.</P>

<P>Free speech and press are essential to stopping parasitism by secrecy and deception.  &quot;Just compensation&quot; and the Fifth Amendment prohibition on forcing citizens to house soldiers during wartime are examples of efforts to prevent parasitism of a police state.  And the Tenth Amendment's oft-neglected mandate that &quot; powers not delegated to the United States... are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people&quot; was meant to curtail parasitism of a totalitarian government.</P>

<P>The Constitution was designed to be our first line of defense against economic parasitism.  Yet today we see generalized disenchantment with both major parties.  This is a predictable consequence of parasitic government.  And the costs of lost efficiency are small when compared to those of lost civic virtue among national politicians.  We will not see faith restored in federal government while it's used as an engine of plunder. </P>

<H1>Park Lovers Can Save National Parks</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>As Americans flock to national parks this summer, we can learn a lot from national parks around the world.  Field biologists the world over uniformly confirm the woeful conditions of national parks.  <A HREF="http://www.tnc.org">The Nature Conservancy</A> found many national parks in Latin America are at great risk.  Even closer to home, Canada's experiments with national parks hold important lessons for parks lovers.</P>

<P>Canadian parks are now suffering from their reliance on fickle politics.  The Canadian analog of the <A HREF="http://www.nps.gov">U.S. National Park Service</A>, Parks Canada, just lost $100 million dollars from its budget to operate 38 parks.  The U.S. park system has ten times as many parks and a budget of only $1.3 billion.</P>

<P>U.S. park managers, already short funding, cut popular services such as the Norris Campground in Yellowstone.  Let's consider alternative managerial arrangements in the U.S. before mounting financial pressures in Washington, D.C. force a repeat of Canada's predicament.</P>

<P>Public, nongovernment endowment boards, one for each park, hold great promise.  They successfully manage private schools, nonprofit hospitals, and museums.  Board members have trustee and fiduciary responsibility for their organization's specific mission.  The boards would be charged to manage for highest values: habitat, preservation, primitive recreation, scenery.  An endowment board with regional and national members could ensure sensitive stewardship and freedom from shortsighted Congressional politics.</P>

<P>Petty politics puts national parks at risk.  The 104th Congress is considering eliminating unworthy parks.  Although park budgets rose every year from 1955 to 1977, Congress has cut funding in one out of every three years since.  A quarter of park ranger jobs have disappeared since 1987, and there is a $3 billion maintenance backlog.  Our parks are in terrbile shape, ecologically and operationally.</P>

<P>While not providing adequate funding for existing parks, Congress creates new parks of highly questionable value, like Presidio and Steamtown.  This political trap has caught Canada, which just combined massive budget reductions for Parks Canada with the creation of the Tuktut Nogait National Park, now Canada's fifth largest.</P>

<P>Government support for parks is problematic for many reasons.  Politicizing national parks leads to &quot;park&quot; barrel projects and poor management incentives.  Sound science loses out when special interests can order the Park Service to eliminate Yellowstone's wolves in the 1920s and fires since 1900.  Fuel loads build ever higher and dangers rise.  We can soon expect huge, destructive fires rather than many small, natural ones.</P>

<P>Making park budgets dependent on politics rather than the parks' net revenues also distorts decisions and encourages bureaucratic inefficiencies. Park Service construction budgets routinely include 50% extra for overhead and overruns.  Parks' user fees and concessionaire fees go to Washington.  The resulting underpriced or free access encourages overuse of our parks.  Increasingly, the park system is characterized by low quality new parks and degraded old ones.</P>

<P>Supporters of legislation now before Congress believe corporate sponsorship of national parks holds the solution.  The proposal's main stumbling block is public apprehension about commercialization of our parks.  It's understandable that, as the Olympics draw near, we guard against &quot;Disney-fied&quot; parks, like a Timex Old Faithful or a Ranier Beer Ranier National Park.  </P>

<P>How do we guard against such crass commercialization?  Endowment boards, with their membership, drawn from environmental, community, business, and science leaders have incentives to seek subtle, tasteful sponsorship and public support.  If trustees fail to honor a binding mandate to foster values specific to each park, then they suffer reputational and other losses.</P>

<P>As with other environmnetal issues, we face trade-offs not perfect solutions.  Even cynical observers note that the threat of commercialization is less serious than the current slide in services and sustainability.  Independence Hall is in desperate need of roof repairs and modern fire sprinklers.  Should we let 20th Century Fox put &quot;Official Sponsor of Independence Hall National Park&quot; on its &quot;Independence Day&quot; movie billboards?   What if the alternative is to let this park go up in smoke?</P>

<P>Corporate sponsorship could make a huge difference.  Ford Motor Company recently purchased 20 pages in Newsweek dedicated to the national park system.  Ten were Ford ads, ten were travel brochures for various national parks like Crater Lake and Big Bend.  The ad space alone cost around $1.5 million. While pocket change to Ford, this sum equals the operating budget of the average U.S. National Park.</P>

<P>Corporate sponsorship of the national park system is part of a larger movement to separate Park Service funding from Congress.  Only when park budgets are depoliticized will America have a vibrant and long-lasting park system.  Creating mechanisms for collecting payment from various park beneficiaries is an important step in this direction.  User fees, gifts from membership organizations, concessionaire contracts, and corporate sponsorships all have potential.  Instituting endowment boards to generate and manage these funds will foster the necessary trust, sensitivity, and responsibility.</P>

<P>National parks are failing to deliver the quality or stability park-lovers demand.  Support and management of our national heritage must come from the people who appreciate and benefit from those parks.  When parks must pay their own way through fees and friends, we'll see more responsible stewardship.  The parks are too precious for a precarious dependency on politics.</P>

The Predictable Perversities of Bureaucratic Behavior
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/baden.html">

John Baden     
</a>     
<p>
There is a strong tendency for such organizations to be run for the benefit
of those in charge. This has profound implications for those in the agency
and for those they are to serve.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A bureaucracy is a formal organization that derives all or a substantial
portion of its budget from transfers. When the bureaucracy is a government
agency, these exchanges are not made on the basis of mutual consent. I do
not, for example, willingly give the Forest Service money to subsidize
clearcutting in the Gallatin National Forest. It impairs my viewshed, silts
my irrigation system, assaults my ecological and economic sensitivities,
and lowers the value of my property. Unfortunately, we have no choice but
to pay for these programs that reduce both our welfare and our sense of
what is right.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's worse, the Forest Service cannot go bankrupt. Its programs pay off
too many politicians and special interests to prevent this economically
rational and environmentally preferable outcome. Unlike Apple Computer,
the Forest Service can lose money for 95 years and persist. So long as
their programs reward politicians and their political clientele, they can
mix good deeds with genuine plunder.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Governments have no monopoly on bureaucratic organization. Most
corporations have divisions that derive income from transfers within the
company, e.g. public affairs departments. These units, however, are rarely
if ever dominant. Rather, they are subordinate to the divisions that
generate income by selling products to willing buyers. While research and
public affairs departments are bureaucratic in structure, their pathologies
are smaller and their behavior far more responsive to the organization's
mission than that of government agencies. Deviations are constrained by
those who watch the bottom line.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This point is critical to understanding bureaucratic behavior; however
noble and inspired their genesis, bureaucracies are ultimately run for the
benefit of the head bureaucrats and the clientele upon whom they depend.
There is a historical, near gravitational, pull towards this outcome.
Resistance requires intelligence, integrity, and a continuously reinforced
sense of purpose. Few organizations have it.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When public surveillance is difficult, we can expect bureaucracies'
self-serving tendencies to become more pronounced. For instance, although
both have strayed from their alleged purpose, we would expect the CIA to be
more corrupt than the BIA. Fortunately for their leaders, we will never
know.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Returning to the theme of bureaucratic perversities, compare university
parking with that of shopping malls. In malls, employees, including
managers, park not near the entrance but rather in an out-of-the-way,
inconvenient location. The decision-makers who determine parking rules find
it beneficial to reserve the most convenient parking for customers.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, however, central administrators at universities and government
agencies have preferential, often specifically designated parking spots
marked with titles if not names. Even a former university president, driven
from office by gross improprieties if not criminal violations, retained his
preferential parking privileges. The perfidious president preserved his
privileges.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In general, bureaucrats make rules to maximize their convenience and
control over resources. This logic trumps the purpose justifying their
creation. What does it matter if mere professors, those who do the actual
teaching and research and students who pay the tuition, must park in the
dark and slog through seven months of Montana slush if those who
make the rules are spared these costs? A mall based on such privilege would
soon lose business, but rulemakers in universities are insulated from such
pressures.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
None of this is surprising. And it would be as naive to rail against as to
protest gravity, or the preferential treatment of contributors by
politicians. That is the way things work. While this behavior erodes morale
and causes no end of mischief, the costs take many years to accumulate. By
then, the culprits are often retired and on retainer.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In principle, the specific example is trivially easy to fix. Ration the
parking spaces by price. People who enjoy walking can also enjoy parking in
a cheap or free area. Those who are infirmed or busy, pack heavy loads, or
dislike exercise can allocate more of their scarce resources to
preferential parking spaces and cut back on other luxuries. Truly
handicapped individuals can have reserved parking. I've yet to hear a
reasonable objection to this.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this obvious reform be enacted at universities across the land? Such a
reform would require those who now receive preferential treatment at little
cost to pay for their privilege. It was indeed an aberration when Congress
made itself subject to the rules by which the rest of us must live. This
too will erode. For good or bad, it is one of the verities of life that
bureaucracies are run largely for the benefit of the bureaucrats in them.
To expect otherwise is to confuse hopes with expectations.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This essay is dedicated to the faculty and administration of Montana State
University in the hope that I never again have to sit through a dinner
party where conversation is dominated by the subject of on- and off-campus
parking.

<h2>
Fostering a new west that respects old values
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/baden.html">     
John Baden     
</a>     
<p>
New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.
Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives.
They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and
bring with them an utterly different value system for the land. A value
system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that
matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation. They
demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values. Many
locals are resentful.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation
and cooperation. Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard
labor that traditional Western jobs require. And long-time residents need
to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers. Both must
recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and
values that have long defined the West. Here's a story from a recent trip
to Oregon State University, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames
the debate for me. I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new
West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I used to work in the woods. Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and
Idaho. I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific
Northwest, and in 1977, I finally got the chance. On sabbatical leave from
my regular university post, I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State
University. This left plenty of time to work in the woods.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly 20 years later I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a
few days of meetings. Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks
and other signs of fundamental change. While Ramona worked with her fellow
academics, I rode my bike. One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to
Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber. I
wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and
maintained. In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner. Also, I
needed a new saw.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.
I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop. It spent its declining years on
our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood. That's an easy
life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront
more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy. It's hard-core, a good
place to find recipes for spotted owl. My Lycra was on trespass in
corked-boot territory. Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust
was the same. The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking
old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter. He looked
up from his work as I entered.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hi, Ken," I said. "Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around
1977? Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days
a week? You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd
known he was professor." I took off my Bolles.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Damn! Hi, John." He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand. We exchanged
news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong
reasons. "With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every
farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees," he
said. "Less wood more saws. Not many pros in the woods anymore." He is
looking towards the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut
his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years. The changing values of the
new West aren't for Ken.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out. Will you send me a new
one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me," I said,
"but I have a Visa card."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hell, don't bother. Just send me a check when you get home."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an
extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:
<br>
<center>LEBANON
<center>Saw Shop Lebanon,
<center>Oregon
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I put it on to finish writing this essay. And I thought about trust-about
how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust. Twenty years and
a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work
honorably done.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old. Trust
that comes from working together is high on my list. Its presence in my own
life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of
stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.

<center><h2>William F. Buckley Jr.</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<b>Editor-at-Large, National Review</b>
<p>
<p>
William Buckley, the founder of National Review and its 
editor-in-chief until 1990, covers a wide range of political, 
cultural, and economic issues in his syndicated columns, 
which appear in NR, and in articles and reviews written 
specifically for the magazine.  Although he has handed over 
the editorial reins to John OSullivan, he continues as the 
magazines president and editor-at-large, and he produces 
his "Notes & Asides" column each issue.
<p>
Buckley served in the Army during World War II before 
matriculating at Yale University, from which he graduated 
in 1950.  He had published his first two books, "God and 
Man at Yale" and (with L. Brent Bozell) "McCarthy and 
His Enemies," before founding National Review in 1955.  
He began his syndicated column, "On the Right," in 1962, 
and launched his weekly television show, Firing Line, in 
1966; in between, he ran for mayor of New York City in 
1965, and received 13.4% of the vote on the Conservative 
Party ticket.  He has served on the Advisory Commission of 
the United States Information Agency (1969-72), and as 
Public Member of the U.S. Delegation to the UN General 
Assembly (1973).  His 31 books include political analyses, 
sailing books, and the Blackford Oakes spy novels.  He is 
the recipient of numerous awards, including Best Columnist 
of the Year (1967), a Television Emmy for Program 
Achievement (1969), the American Book Award for Best 
Mystery (paperback) for Stained Glass (1980), and the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom (1991).<p>

<h2>
You Figure It Out
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The most recent objection to the Communications Decency Act was filed 
on Monday by Microsoft, the American Library Association, and the 
Society for Professional Journalists. Their arguments are much the 
same as those of the American Civil Liberties Union filed about eight 
minutes after the bill was signed by President Clinton. And days after 
that, the District Court in Philadelphia estopped enforcement of the 
Act on the grounds that the word &quot;decency&quot; was insufficiently defined. 
Argument will proceed. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here are points to consider in this rerun of the People v. Obscenity, 
in which Obscenity regularly wins.
<ol>
<li>The vote in the House was 414 to 16 in favor of the Act. In the 
Senate, 91 to 5. And of course, President Clinton signed it. That's 
506 out of 527 human beings all of whom swore to uphold the 
Constitution of the United States. Yet learned and experienced men and 
women who oppose the Act merely laugh at any suggestion that they 
actually did believe the Act to be constitutional. Specifically, Ira 
Glasser, the Executive Director of the ACLU, and Susan Estrich, 
Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, who eight 
years ago managed the presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis. What's 
going on here?

<li>By way of background, what sometimes is lumped in under obscenity 
is three categories of material. One is erotica: Literature or art 
intended to arouse sexual desire (American Heritage Dictionary). A 
second is pornography: Pictures, writing, or other material that is 
sexually explicit (AHD). A third is perversity. This is the stuff of 
the Marquis de Sade. 

<li>Perversity is every now and then stopped. A few weeks ago, the 
felony conviction of Robert and Carleen Thomas was upheld. Their gig 
was something called Amateur Action, a computer bulletin board that 
advertised itself as The Nastiest Place on Earth, and featured graphic 
images of children raped by their parents, and other stuff the fingers 
balk at even typing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the ACLU takes the position that the First Amendment protects any 
&quot;speech.&quot; And indeed it does, but the great swindle of the century has 
been the transmutation of obscenity into &quot;speech.&quot; The absolutists go 
a long way: burning the American flag is a form of speech, they tell 
you. This would be understandable if the person protesting American 
policy were blind and dumb and had available to him to express himself 
on Capitol Hill only a box of matches and a few American flags. This 
is not to say that the lines between erotica and pornography or 
pornography and perversion are clearly drawn, but neither is the line 
clearly drawn that demands &quot;reasonable&quot; compliance with various 
provisions of the law. 

<li>Perspectives change, and they have changed during the past fifty 
years in the direction of promiscuity. In the early Sixties reasonable 
people differed on whether Fanny Hill was obscene (Answer: Of course 
it's obscene, and it's a delight). During the Sixties, Simone de 
Beauvoir was pleading the &quot;right&quot; to read the Marquis de Sade (&quot;Must 
We Burn de Sade?&quot;). So that the question became muddled: Ought works 
of obscenity and even perversion be permitted to exist (i.e., should 
they not be burned?); or, as was the case in France for 175 years, is 
the work of de Sade something that should be kept in the libraries for 
the edification of those whose business it is to probe the forlorn 
atolls of twisted minds?

<li>Leaving us with the Internet. There are obscenity laws that apply 
to television broadcasting, though they are lax; and to radio; and, as 
a matter of fact, to telephone lines. The philosophical postulate here 
is that the air is public property and government has custodial 
responsibilities over that which belongs to the people, who can 
through their representatives define toxicity as more merely than 
particulates emitted by asbestos, or whatever. The Communications 
Decency Act is aimed at protecting children, and prosecutions under it 
are supposed to bear the burden of proving that the smut-merchants had 
every reason to believe that children would be tapping in on their 
product. The lawyers call this scienter, knowingly. But the ACLU is 
correct here that whatever one's hopes for Internet-style V-chips that 
would block out noxious web sites, there can't be any assurance that 
the horny 16-year-old isn't going to succeed in tapping in on that 
stuff.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In which event you may have a law that is unenforceable, but does that 
make it unconstitutional?

When such a law is passed,  Congressmen will be arresting each other literally right and left, until  there's no one around to run the country. Rather, the sane solution heads  in the opposite direction: admit that scandal-mongering has become a degenerative  disease of democracy and rewrite our over-regulatory laws to give politicians  some slack. Allow more room for conflicting interpretations of political  &quot;truth&quot; and reduce penalties to a point that a legislator is  not threatened with ruin for a minor failing. Towering cases of real corruption  might be more visible in our system if we did not permit puny underbrush  to obstruct the view. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Representative government accepts that people with different philosophies  and different stakes are going to see things differently. Politics is supposed  to make a virtue of these disagreements so that voters can make up their  own minds at election time. However, what the current ethics laws and regulations  do is change politics from a game where the point is to impress public  opinion at election time to one whose purpose is to destroy the opposition  personally in a legal setting. The problem goes back a generation or more,  but it is getting worse. As we are seeing, even the House Ethics Committee,  which has standing only under House rules and is not a court, can become  so preoccupied with legal-sounding procedural issues that members from  the two parties can hardly speak to each other any more, let alone work  together. Cooperation on any subject is now endangered.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  It needs saying that citizens as well as politicians bring their biases  to these matters. For all of us, there are three mental and moral exercises  that might help bring such bias to the surface and put issues into proper  perspective. The first is to imagine a reversal of identities in the parties  to a given conflict and see if, in that case, one would feel the same way.  For example, if a Democrat, instead of Newt Gingrich, had raised money  for a non-profit organization to finance a college course with what some  people could interpret as a partisan point of view, would that have been  seen as seriously reprehensible? If a Republican member of Congress had  distributed a tape of a cellular phone call to friendly news media, as  Rep. Jim McDermott is accused of doing, would that be have been seen as  materially different?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Secondly, one can ask in these ethics cases how a particular standard applied  to politicians would look if it were applied to critics in the media. It  supposedly is terrible if a politician &quot;misleads&quot; his collegues.  But media commentators mislead the public quite often, for roughly similar  reasons: ignorance, prejudice, stress, time pressure, recklessness. You  could hardly hold a Sunday TV talk show anymore if the shouting heads were  held legally responsible for their veracity. Why, to use another example,  is it reprehensible that Jim McDermott passed along an illicit phone tape  to the New York Times (if indeed he did), while there is no discussion  at all about the propriety of the Times' publishing a transcript of it?  Do we only care about violations of privacy by private citizens and politicians,  never by the media? </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Third, one might explore the practical circumstances and conequences, not  just the formal cause, of the alleged ethical misbehavior. Circumstances  and consequences count. Did someone abuse his office for personal gain,  or was it a mainly political maneuver? Who was really hurt, how much and  in what way? Gingrich's course wound up being non-partisan, in fact, and  was never used for the Speaker's financial advantage. His &quot;misleading&quot;  paperwork submitted to the Ethics Committee, though wrong, related to a  non-crime. Likewise, McDermott's supposed delivery of a telephone tape  to The New York Times was a political blunder more than a crime, an ethics  weapon that backfired.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  If all sides in Congress could declare a temporary truce, they might spend  some time trying to reform the ethics laws and regulations so that petty  infractions are given only proportionate punishment. Under more realistic  rules, the legal payoff for exaggerating scandals necessarily would diminish  (for media as well as politicians) and today's gladiators-to-the-death  would become merely happy warriors, their conflicts ritualized in more  traditional parliamentary forms. The business of government could proceed  on its more or less dignified course. Politics as usual. It actually would  be a relief.<BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based  Discovery Institute.

Poor old Will!</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	     Why, I never knew the old fellow was ill!&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But he is ill, at least in a majority of the universities  of America, where a new report shows that even English majors no longer  are required to take a course on one of the greatest writers--if not the  greatest--in any language.  The report, &quot;The Shakespeare File:  What  English Majors are Really Studying,&quot; produced by the National Alumni  Forum, provides an insight into declining academic standards overall and  the growing failure even to acknowledge standards.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	At Georgetown University, for example, you can still  take a course on Shakespeare, but despite a university administration effort  to cloud the issue, you can graduate as an &quot;English major&quot; without  doing so.  The emphasis now is on &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;a wide range  of literary and non-literary genres such as mass media.&quot;  Within such  &quot;genres&quot; are courses in &quot;Gangster Films&quot; and &quot;Detective  Fiction as Social Critique.&quot;  In the latter course the student learns  what detective novels tell us about &quot;the nuclear family, traditional  masculine values, and capitalist ideology.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	You can understand why a 19 year old would rather take  some temporarily trendy course on gangster films than something he knows  little about, like Shakespeare, but whose worth and universal significance  have been proven over centuries.  But what parent forking over $30,000  a year to Georgetown wants the English major debased by such topical triflings?   Where is the foundation--the &quot;canon,&quot; in academic terms--upon  which a life of reading and reflection is erected?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to the National Alumni Forum's report, the  trend not only is widespread, but dominant.  Out of 70 of the nation's  top colleges and universities (including those listed in the annual report  of U.S. News and World Report), &quot;only 23 now require English majors  to take a course in Shakespeare.  At Duke, Shakespeare yields to &quot;Melodrama  and Soap Opera,&quot; at Oberlin &quot;The Uses of Deviance.&quot;  Other  schools offer English--yes, English--classes in sports, textile trade,  theme parks, third world liberation struggles, mail-order brides, computer  games, advertising imagery and world fairs.  A high sounding course at  Cornell on the &quot;Languages of Community&quot; really involves study  of &quot;innovative cultural texts such as alternative 'zines, Nuyorican  performance poetry, and Internet News groups.&quot; (Note:  &quot;'zines&quot;  means magazines and &quot;Nuyorican&quot; means New Yorker.  Big deal.)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Alumni Forum report comments on the strange &quot;combination  of low culture with high theory (in many courses), as if enough theoretical  jargon made any subject worth study.&quot;  At Bowdoin College, &quot;An  Introduction to Literary Theory through Popular Culture&quot; provides  a &quot;structuralist, deconstructive, feminist, psychoanalytic, new historicist,  African-American, and lesbian and gay theory&quot; on such matters as &quot;best-selling  novels, music videos, Hollywood films, and soap opera.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Why?  It cannot be that Shakespeare no longer is worthy  of an audience or is irrelevant to our age.  The audience is still there.   There have never been so many new films of Shakespeare's plays and adaptations  of them.  Imaginative new versions of Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are just  now opening, for example.  Sneak Previews' critic Michael Medved says that  Shakespeare &quot;is the hottest thing going in film right now.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But Shakespeare may be irrelevant, indeed, to the careers  of English professors who obtained degrees in the riotous 60's.  They seem  unable to identify with an artist who was not at war with his times, whose  genius it was to perfectly express the society of his period even while  brilliantly transcending it.  They prefer the post-modern sensibility that  conceives of the artist's job as confronting and shocking society, even  though the confrontation is a pose and the shocks quickly wear thin.  They  regard the continuing high reputation of Shakespeare outside the university  as the rueful Cassius did Caesar:</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Like a Colossus, and we petty men</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Walk under his legs and peep about</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	To find ourselves dishonorable graves.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	They also may believe that teaching of a long tradition  in literature does nothing to enhance their own stature among their academic  peers.  You don't attract attention by teaching Shakespeare, Chaucer and  Milton these days; you attract it by inventing new forms of literary criticism  that only other colleagues read.  Maybe that's their idea of the business  they are in.  But, again, why would any parent want to pay for such self-dramatizing  mediocrity?  Do we really want to reward Professor Glutz for his marvelous  insights into soap operas, or to teach Macbeth and Midsummer Night's Dream?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Of course, knocking the bust of Shakespeare off its pedestal  is only an indication of the tyranny of levelling in our culture.  A whole  range of great and tested authors, not just Shakespeare, endures the academy's  neglect.  Forget for a moment the divisions of liberal and conservative,  rich and poor.  Some of the worst damage to our cohesion as a people now  comes from supposed experts in education who denigrate lasting achievements  and celebrate the notional.  It is giving us two societies:  a small, remnant  strata that enjoys and benefits from the inspiration of our civilization's  long traditions, and the consumerist, throw-away culture that screams its  adoration of pop idols before discarding them for something still newer.   At peril is the Thomas Jefferson vision of a democratic culture that elevates  all.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is not new that a majority of citizens don't know  much of Shakespeare--or of the great figures of history, economics, philosophy  or science.  What is new is that university graduates--sometimes supposed  specialists, as in English departments--don't know about them either and,  most importantly, are not expected to.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	This latest news about falling academic standards in  English, in particular, has serious implications for the next generation  of teachers of high school, who can hardly introduce children to the glories  of King Lear or Henry IV if they are barely acquainted with them themselves.   It is a sad loss for our culture, where next to the Bible (which terrifies  many colleges as well as common schools), Shakespeare is the well from  which writers of all kinds have drawn deepest inspiration for four centuries--writers  who shared their allusions with the whole reading public.  It's more bad  news for newspapers, for the theater (especially the various Shakespeare  festivals) and eventually even films. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is terrible news for the regents and trustees of our  colleges and universities.  The National Alumni Forum makes it clear that  most university English departments are so lost in political correctness  and intellectual consumerism that they cannot be reformed from within.   They will have to be rescued by the people who have ultimate legal responsibility,  college and university trustees.  Most trustees would rather duck the responsibility,  but ethically they cannot.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	If English departments will not stress the generally  recognized best in English and American literature, Dr. Jerry Martin of  the Alumni Forum says, it plainly is up to trustees to call together a  distinguished national panel of professors to critique such departments  for the trustees' benefit and recommend changes (as the Forum itself did).   But perhaps another panel also could give advice:  Bring in the leading  practitioners of good writing in our society, the men and women who have  won fiction and non-fiction prizes, and the newspaper and magazine editors  and book editors of greatest distinction.  Ask them about these trends.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Conservatives who despair that the problem of lowering  standards in the academy is a disease recognized only by themselves might  be surprised by the broad support--left as well as right--the Shakespeare  report has elicited out in the real world.  Martin Peretz of the liberal  New Republic magazine, for example, praised the Alumni Forum report, as  did Robert Brustein of the American Repertory Theater.  Roger Shattuck,  University Professor, Boston University, stated, &quot;The (current) situation  constitutes a breech of contract.  In fact, parents should sue for breech  of contract.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Some English department chairs probably will assert that  their preferences merely reflect new scholarly understandings, perhaps  accessible only to academics; and under their breath they will rail against  efforts to resurrect &quot;dead white males&quot; like Shakespeare.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Let them read Maya Angelou, the African American poet  who appeared at President Clinton's first inaugural.  Chided for reading  Shakespeare as a youth, Angelou recounts (in <I>I Know Why the Caged Bird  Sings</I>), &quot;...(Y)ears later, when I physically and psychologically  left that country, that condition, which is Stamps Arkansas...I found myself  and still find myself, whenever I like, stepping back into Shakespeare.   Whenever I like I pull him to me.  He wrote it for me.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	I all alone beweep my outcast state</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And look upon myself and curse my fate,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Desiring this man's art and that man's scope.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	With what I most enjoy contented least...'</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Of course he wrote it for me,&quot; Angelou continues;  &quot;that is the condition of the black woman.  Of course, he was a black  woman.  I understand that.  Nobody else understands it; but I know that  William Shakespeare was a black woman.  That is the role of art.&quot;</FONT></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Maya Angelou understands.  The National Alumni Forum    understands.  What is it that keeps over half of the English departments    in America's higher educational institutions from understanding?</FONT></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of the Seattle-based  Discovery Institute and writes a column on this page each Friday.</FONT></I></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE><H1><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><AHREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><BR><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="48" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="image51.gif" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="59" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

Instead of coming up with  a list of New Year's Resolutions for 1997, it appears that our public leaders  are putting together a list of New Year's Irresolutions. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  At the top of the list is Social Security reform. The advisory council  on Social Security recommends that the private investment market be used  to shore up the nation's endangered old age insurance system. Failure to  do so offers the prospect of higher payroll taxes and benefit reductions  in the years ahead, while prompt action to link Social Security to the  private sector and the &quot;miracle of compound interest&quot; offers  nothing less than capitalistic ownership of the means of production by  the entire workforce and a better retirement for everyone. Seldom has there  been a subject where the choices are so clear and where so many are affected  so deeply. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Yet the initial reaction of politicians to the latest call for action is--irresolution.  The typical official response is &quot;cautious,&quot; which in government  lingo means, &quot;Let's punt.&quot; In private, Republicans embrace the  idea and such Democrats as the influential Sen. Patrick Moynihan of New  York acknowledge that it needs to be addressed. Some other Democrats, including  the President, are thought to be supportive of reform. However, excepting  Sen. Kerrey of Nebraska, they are not about to say so. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Social Security reform is only one of the 600  pound policy gorillas officialdom is determined to ignore in hopes that  maybe they will go away. The solvency of Medicare is still more pressing,  so it will take the full concentration of our leaders to pretend that they  are doing something about that problem while doing nothing.<BR>  The same goes for tax reform, upon which the government also has resolved  to be irresolute. The distilled opinion coming out of the election campaign  was that tax cuts could stimulate growth and stabilize the economy. Dole's  proposed 15% rate reduction across the board may never have caught fire,  and neither did Clinton's parade of &quot;targeted&quot; cuts, but everyone  professed to believe that something could and should be done. Now that  talk apparently can be filed under &quot;Campaign Rhetoric.&quot; </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Maybe in the information age it doesn't matter  whether the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation, the tax code punishes  marriage and raising children and discourages investment. Maybe we have  repealed economic cycles and are fated to plug along with low, but satisfactory  growth. Maybe. But nothing in economics is as seductive--and wrong--as  the impression that present trends can be extended indefinitely into the  future. The statesman knows that and looks ahead. So where are the statesmen?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Next on the list of New Years Irresolutions comes the long range foreign  policy of this country. You would think that we had made the world safe  and serene forever and that violence in the Middle East or the Balkans  are simply curiosities on the evening news. Are think tanks and recently  retired generals warning us about reduced fighting readiness in the US  military and demoralization in the ranks over gender issues? Defense can  wait until we discover a breakdown in the course of an emergency. Put it  all on the New Year's Irresolutions List. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  How about the environmental reforms that both liberals and conservatives  supposedly agree need addressing? Liberal environmentalists professedly  realize that the current, mainly proscriptive laws read great, but are  not really protecting the environment. Conservatives continue to complain  that the same laws handicap the economy and actually make sensible conservation  more difficult. It is time to find a pathway to reform--of the Environmental  Protection Agency, for example, and of the Endangered Species Act, for  another--that aims more at consequences than procedural purity. Any takers?  Or do we put the environment also on the Irresolutions list?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Telecommunications mistakes found in the 1996 act? Live with them. Impending  disaster with Amtrak? Hold off hearings until everyone agrees--in the sweet  bye and bye.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The great thing about such a long list of New Year's Irresolutions is that  it frees the body politic to attend to matters that are much more amusing,  if infinitely less important: petty scandals. We already are into the middle  of January and the topic that Congress and the media find most engrossing  is whether Newt Gingrich used non-profit money to organize a partisan college  course, or used political funds to organize a non-partisan college course.  Now, if you don't find that sexy, look to the Paula Jones scandal spread  over the latest issue of Newsweek. What's the future of Social Security,  the solvency of Medicare and the state of America's defenses in comparison  to a soap opera like that?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><BR><B><I>Bruce Chapman, president of the Seattle-based Discovery Institute,writes on this page each Friday.</I></B></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><B><I></I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But that assumption goes almost  wholly uninspected. Few people know what actually was taught in the course,&quot;Renewing  American Civilization.&quot; Media accounts have utterly failed to give  details on it. That is entirely unnecessary, for the classes were video  taped and the tapes have been for sale for three years through a &quot;1-800&quot;  number (none of which profits Gingrich personally).</P>  <P>	Seeing the charge of alleged ethics violations start to develop last  fall I decided to get a full set of the tapes. &quot;Oh, joy,&quot; my  wife said dryly when they arrived in a big box, &quot;twenty hours of Newt  Gingrich!&quot; With a somewhat heavy heart myself, I sat down at the VCR.  But, fortunately, Gingrich at length is far more nuanced and interesting  than the sound bite Gingrich on the TV news.</P>  <P>	At heart, as he told the Ethics Committee, Gingrich is a professor.  Years ago, when he first entered Congress, I visited his office several  times, and before I could get to my business I had to hear all about the  latest four or five books he had read. Then he would wait expectantly for  me to write down the titles. I'm told he still does it.  Sen. Pat Moynihan  of New York, another former academic, will make you listen at length to  his interpretations of history, but at least he doesn't expect you to take  notes. </P>  <P>	Gingrich on camera in front of a class is just the same, only now he  has assembled  his ideas into a public policy tour of grand ambition. The  title, &quot;Renewing American Civilization,&quot; sounds grandiose, but  the product turns out to be well-organized and coherent. It is something  he almost alone in Congress (again excepting Moynihan) could have accomplished.  </P>  <P>	Gingrich argues for American exceptionalism, describing from history  the decisve effects inventors and entrepreneurs have had upon our economic  rise and the moral as well as self-interested grounds  for an internationalist  foreign policy and free trade. His grasp of technology's role in shaping  a better future is masterful. At the same time, he recounts with specificity  the unintended effects of sixty years of welfare state policies onAmerican  culture, leaving us with two societies--the educated and uneducated, the  successful and the unsuccessful. His examination of inner city problems  is one of serious concern. Finally, he analyzes the economic and social  strategies that various individuals have proposed to restore to all citizens'  control over their own destinies.</P>  <P>	 Having once taken the famous college course on American Intellectual  History taught by Professor Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a politically active  Democrat, I found the Gingrich class comparably engaging. There is this  distinction, however: Gingrich's course is less partisan. It displays a  Gingrich conversant with a wide array of knowledge and able to synthesize  it. He is fair-minded and positive. He frequently presents noted Democrats  and other liberals in a favorable light.</P>  <P>	 Many Republicans cannot be thrilled, for example, that Gingrich dotes   on Alvin and Heidi Toffler, authors of &quot;The Third Wave.&quot;  Once  the noted literary couple get off the  familiar theme of the hunter-farming  society yielding to the Industrial Revolution, which  yields in turn to  the Information Revolution, they are given to expressing alarmist environmental  and social concerns that make conservatives gnash their teeth. On the night  before the recent presidential election, Gingrich's class on the role of  volunteers in American public life, carried nationally on Mind Extention  University cable tv, included generous tributes to former President Jimmy  Carter and to handicapped activist Max Cleland, even though Cleland was  on the ballot the next day as a Democratic candidate for the US Senate  in Georgia (he won).</P>  <P>	Maury Kennedy, a businessman who took the Gingrich course a couple  of years ago and now markets the tapes, complains of the ethics charges,  &quot;I manage this course every day of the week and I fail to see what  partisan political benefit he (Gingrich) or anyone else gets out of it.&quot;  The course is not a political recruiting device. About 7500 people subscribe  to a newsletter that follows the course themes.</P>  <P>	This confirms what I suspected all along. Gingrich is accused of using  this non-profit course and the colleges where he taught it on behalf of  his partisan objectives, specifically those of his action organization,  GOPAC. The reality is closer to the reverse: he initially  used GOPAC and  his political connections to start an academic course that refines his  philosophical and academic interests. But there is nothing morally wrong  with that. </P>  <P>	It often is on the side of their virtues rather than their vices that  politicians fail to guard themselves, which is how they fall into the kind  of procedural mistakes with which Gingrich's political opponents would  like to ensnare him now. Particularly when you are dealing with a politician  who also is an intellectual, it often is impossible to separate the man  of action from the man of ideas. From the standpoint of public interest,  it is an error to try too hard to do so. </P>  <P>	There is some danger that Gingrich's college course will be used as  an excuse to further restrict use of tax exempt educational moneys, a move  with potential to throttle, rather than improve, public discourse. It would  be wiser to broaden tax deductibility to include legitimate educational  research  conducted by parties and elected officials. Why should Republicans  and Democrats be denied the advantages enjoyed by the Chamber of Commerce  Foundation or the Sierra Club? Why this cute game where you can call something  &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; and it's okay with the  professional ethicists, but calling it &quot;Repubican&quot; or &quot;Democrat&quot;  makes it unacceptable?</P>  <P>	Newt Gingrich may have been careless as he moved his intellectual pursuits  from the political to the educational realm, and he was right to apologize  for that.  But his was the kind of minor failure you must tolerate in a  leader or sacrifice the First Amendment--which, above all, protects political  speech--and the capacity of representative government to function effectively.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Bruce Chapman, a former Secretary of State in Washington  State and a Reagan Administration official, is president of the Seattle-based  Discovery Institute.

<BR>
<B>His political art appears artless</B>. He is a partisan truly loved by
colleagues in the opposition party, as well as in his own. Fellow politicians
appreciate his unusual habit of giving credit rather than taking it. In
four elected offices over a cumulative 32 years, he remains one of the few
candidates who promised a voluntary limit on the terms he would serve, and
then followed through.<BR>
<BR>
	Lt. Governor Joel Pritchard is retiring from elective politics in January.
He recently conquered another bout with cancer, and &quot;Physically, he
could beat two thirds of the legislators in a foot race,&quot; says long
time aide Maury Hauser. &quot;And,&quot; he quips,  &quot;Joel has always
had excellent mental health, especially for a politician.&quot; But, at
71, Pritchard decided not to see re-election.<BR>
<BR>
	Friends think that if he had run, he would have enjoyed a third term victory
election night. So nearly 600 of them planned a &quot;Victory Party&quot;
for him anyway. Leading officials, including former Speaker Tom Foley, were
set to attend on Wednesday, as were ordinary citizens whose lives Pritchard
has touched in politics, tutoring or civic affairs. But then came the big
snow. The party was postponed.<BR>
<BR>
	Thirty two years ago he already was a standout new state representative
from the Queen Anne-Magnolia area when I first met and interviewed him.
Along with some other young legislators, including Dan Evans and Slade Gorton,
he was the subject of  an article for a magazine back in Washington, D.C.
on &quot;The New Breed in Washington State.&quot; Pritchard told me, and
the article foretold, the strategy that this New Breed--young, label free,
steeped in community work and practical ideas--was following to gain a GOP
majority in the legislature and then the governorship. It all came true.
Dan Evans became governor, elected in '64, and then Slade Gorton became
Attorney General. But what about Joel?<BR>
<BR>
	The logical step up was Congress. Joel and his brother Frank, &quot;The
Pritchard Boys,&quot; were seasoned businessmen at the Griffin Envelope
Company, but in politics they were only successful amateurs. They mainly
had aided older men such as Gov. Art Langley and a string of non-partisan
Seattle mayors. One candidate they had helped was Congressmen Thomas Pelly,
who served the north Seattle and suburban First District  ably, but long.
Joel Pritchard hankered to succeed him. In a daring bid, he confronted Pelly
in the primary election of 1970, failing, but coming too close for Pelly's
comfort. The incumbent moved his retirement plans forward, and Pritchard
was the easy winner of the nomination in 1972.<BR>
<BR>
	Trouble was, in the final election, the upbeat Pritchard faced attacks
from a vigorous Democratic opponent. He never answered the attacks and on
election night his opponent, John Hempelman, finished ahead by 1900 votes
in the regular count. But, in a story whose example echoes down to the belated
1996 victories of Reps. Jack Metcalf and Linda Smith,  Pritchard's manager,
Bob Davidson, had  hopes that a letter sent earlier to each voter who had
applied for an absentee ballot would rescue Pritchard. He needed  a whopping
58 percent of the absentees to overcome Hempelman's lead. He got 60 percent,
and finally emerged victorious, with 2622 votes to spare. <BR>
<BR>
	Back in the capitol, the dean of the state Congressional delegation, Democratic
Sen. Warren Magnuson, invited Pritchard into his office. &quot;Joey,&quot;
he said, &quot;now that you're part of the team we don't intend to take
you on again.&quot; And he--and the rest of the nearly solid Democratic
delegation--did not.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Pritchard in Congress got a lot done, quietly. Everybody's favorite tennis
companion, his self-effacing statecraft was shrewd as well as virtuous.
It enabled him to get far more done than might be expected of a relatively
junior member of a minority party. He still doesn't brag, but former staffers
are pleased to note that he wrote the first drafts of such significant legislation
as the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Park and the Klondike Gold Rush International
Park. As a one man crusader, he overcame the Democratic leadership's plan
to convert the new Library of Congress building, now known as The Madison
Library, into Congressional offices. In foreign policy, he was an ardent
promoter of free trade and a greater foreign policy emphasis on Asia.<BR>
<BR>
	Pritchard had promised to leave Congress after 12 years, and in 1984, he
did so. But back in Seattle he began to recall his happy days in the state
senate. In 1988 he was easily elected Lt. Governor, in another of his low
cost, friendly campaigns. In Olympia, too, he was a force for civility and
quiet persuasion. He worked effectively against legalized gambling and for
campaign finance reform. With Frank Schronz, Chairman of Boeing, he became
a major player in the Partnership for Learning project that is trying to
assure that the state's law on education reform is implemented thoroughly.
It would not be a surprise to see Pritchard continuing in that crucial effort
after January.<BR>
<BR>
	But on the last day of the recent session, presiding peacefully over the
Senate for the final time, he received a shock. A new and supposedly routine
resolution was working the senators into an uproar. The Republican and Democratic
staff attorneys upon whose advice Pritchard--in typical bi-partisan fashion--relied
jointly for technical advice, suddenly were nowhere to be found. Conservative
Sen. Jim West of Spokane was shouting that liberal Sen. Dwight Pelz of Seattle
was a &quot;commie pinko!&quot; A horrified Pritchard demanded order. Then
Pelz called West &quot;a right wing nut,&quot; and Pritchard was beside
himself, watching his record of fostering good will fall into ruin. Eventually,
out of the corner of his eye he saw Secretary of State Munro and Governor
Lowry in the chamber and heading toward him. The place was in a strange
agitation. Lowry took the gavel away, quite illegally, from the astonished
Lt. Governor and called for a vote. He was answered by a sea of  laughing
&quot;ayes&quot;. It turned out that the mock donnybrook was staged on behalf
of a heartfelt resolution expressing respect and affection for Pritchard.<BR>
<BR>
	Wednesday night Joel was down at the Port's International Conference Center,
along with brother Frank, &quot;just in case&quot; any of the people expected
at the party his friends were giving hadn't received word of the postponement.
Some hadn't, and after refreshments and schmoozing with Joel, a number said
they thought they would come right back again on December 6. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Never have so many politicians </B>worked so hard and spent
so much to achieve so little change. With the White House still in Democratic
hands, Congress still Republican and exactly the same partisan division
of governors, the nation's politics are roughly where they were a year and
a half ago when history's longest presidential campaign began. What was
achieved? Altogether, marathon fundraising and organizing and advertising
achieved a great record <B><I>low</I></B> turnout, 49 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The result of the voters' collective mixed message was, give us more of
the same. What each voter was saying was more complex, of course. But surely
there is one point on which we each might agree: This thing went on far
too long. <BR>
<BR>
Fourteen months ago I wrote in this space that bunching the presidential
primaries together and &quot;front loading&quot; them in the winter and
early spring of 1996 would prolong the campaign agony for citizens as well
as candidates. No wonder the mood by election day was one of embarrassment
approaching nausea in many voters, and stunned apathy in the rest. By the
end my neighbors were muttering that they wished they had gone away on vacation.
Friends said they were tempted to lock themselves in their houses, disconnect
the television and take up meditation--or worse. Some may have been driven
mad; they haven't been seen in weeks, and certainly didn't show up at the
polls. <BR>
<BR>
It customarily is said that the voters don't start paying attention to campaigns
until Labor Day. This year they worked hard to avert their eyes through
the whole show. Thus the paradox: The longer the campaign, the less the
public pays attention. To be charitable, it wasn't so much a lack of interest
as the gagging lack of oxygen one encounters in the air of unreality around
a campaign. You can take the atmospheric depression for a couple months,
but then you start to pass out. <BR>
<BR>
Nor is the national mental health the only loss. A President was distracted
from his duties for over one fourth of his first term. Not that he minded,
of course. But those days of fundraising and leading rallies were days when
he did not attend to normal business. The same goes for the voters. The
months spent learning--falsely--that Medicare was threatened were months
when long term solutions to the looming entitlement crisis were not addressed
at all. Indeed, it could be said that by avoiding the real issues facing
the country, or exploiting them for demagogic ends, the national campaign
served to decrease the sum of popular knowledge. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. In September, while our campaign ground
on, the Japanese called a national election, and six weeks later, held it.
All the action was concentrated, and therefore bearable. <BR>
<BR>
We have come to the stage of our history where elections no longer provide
political catharsis. Nor do they produce anger or division, necessarily.
They produce exhaustion. <BR>
<BR>
Of course there are no panaceas in public life, but there are some things
that could help prevent a repeat of the Long Campaign of 1996. First, the
President and Congress could agree to prohibit any dispersal of federal
campaign matching funds to abet funds raised by presidential candidates,
unless they were raised after December, 1999. That would tend to dry up
about four to six months of early campaigning, or at least to slow it. <BR>
<BR>
The second contribution to sanity would be to change the election date from
November to October and move the inauguration forward from late January
to early December. In the Information Age we don&iacute;t need several months
to communicate with voters. &quot;The first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November&quot; is a date set in law in 1872; it&iacute;s not the Constitution,
and there is nothing sacred about it. The inauguration date also can be
changed. The third week in January is typically the worst week of winter
in Washington, D.C., while early December is usually cold, but endurable,
and sometimes quite pleasant. <BR>
<BR>
Knocking out a month of campaigning at the end would concentrate people&iacute;s
interest while weakening the present demand for money for television ads.
There&iacute;s only so much air time for sale, and after a campaign starts
buying it during the midnight wrestling matches, you know they are over-spending.
If the First Amendment cannot limit spending, let the calendar do it. <BR>
<BR>
Another reform would be to persuade the political parties to pass a rule
refusing to seat delegates to the national nominating conventions who were
selected in primaries held before mid-March. This apparently is the only
way to force states to repeal the front-loaded schedule and thereby to shorten
the campaign. Unfortunately, this reform needed approval at this year&iacute;s
conventions in order to apply in 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Besides, all of this was known by the parties over a year ago and ignored.
Now that the campaign is over, the lesson also will be ignored by the public
until it is taught once more in 2000. Then it will be too late, again, to
change before 2004. There does not seem to be enough sustained public annoyance
to force Washington, D.C. to fix the problem. <BR>
<BR>
Fellow voters, am I wrong about that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

Character Is Not an Issue (No, Of Course Not!)</CENTER>

<P>	 Let's not hear any more about &quot;character', okay? This country
is moving to a values neutral, non-judgmental consciousness in which such
outdated concepts are irrelevant. &quot;Character&quot; is just another
device by which the power elite seek to instill guilt in the masses and
bring everyone under the control of old fogies and their retrograde values
system.<BR>
	Character is not an issue. Character is not an issue. Character is not
an issue. Got it?<BR>
	What's with these politicians, anyway, trying to inject a concept like
character into a straightforward contest for votes? It's very negative.
Next, they'll be quoting a bunch of dead Greeks, like Heraclitus (&quot;Character
is destiny.&quot;) or Plutarch (&quot;Character is simply habit long continued.&quot;)
We're getting tired of it, burned out. It really brings people down. Talking
about character has become a character flaw itself, when you think about
it. Especially when candidates come right out and say that's what they're
doing. Give us a candidate who has good vibes and sympathetic body language.
If he's going to attack his opponent's character, he can do it on the sly
or get a surrogate.<BR>
	Besides, character doesn't matter.<BR>
	All right, maybe it matters a little bit. But, it has to take its place
at the end of a long line of considerations used to evaluate a candidate.
First, you need someone who is smart. And a riveting speaker. Good looks
help--a lot. No Abe Lincolns need apply. And then you want someone who says
things you agree with.<BR>
	Character? A poor runner up in any relationship. Maybe you are deciding
on a home remodeling contractor, or a banker, or a teacher (if you get a
choice), or a doctor (if you get a choice much longer), or a lawyer. Do
you want a good talker or character? Right: if it doesn't feel good, don't
do it! It's not how you play the game, but whether or not you win that counts.
If someone does something wrong, better to get past it, unless of course
we can sue.<BR>
	Character! Whose character, we want to know? The graybeards that prattle
about &quot;consequences,&quot; &quot;reliability,&quot; &quot;honor,&quot;
&quot;keeping your word&quot;? Talk about quaint; the other day one of them
used the word &quot;duty&quot;! Next, it will be &quot;honesty is the best
policy!&quot; Well, they have their values, we have ours. Haven't they ever
heard about the value of a good story? Or the value of getting away with
it? Their values are yesterday's, the old Eurocentric behavior control that
runs all the way back to Aristotle and the Bible. Well, isn't it time someone
had a kind word for Nicolo Machiavelli?<BR>
	Our hierarchy of character is just different. It is headed by &quot;compassion,&quot;
which is best expressed, for example, by helping  the less fortunate with
other people's money. Next comes &quot;tolerance,&quot; sometimes recognized
as indifference with a wan smile.<BR>
	The old guard are bogged down in particulars--this poor person, that family,
the town over there--while we expand our &quot;concern&quot; to include
whole groups and abstract categories of people; indeed, &quot;The People&quot;
as a whole. So who has the larger view? Their boring politicians talk about
this bill and that amendment; our sprightly leaders talk about  the symbolic
legislation that shows how they feel. The old guard say they care about
results. Well, we are more idealistic; we care about intentions.<BR>
	That's why, as I think I said, character is not an issue.<BR>
	&quot;Right? Wrong?&quot; Very good words, useful words; we use them all
the time, in fact. But let's be serious. Right and wrong depend on the situation--and
who they are used against. What's right and wrong also depends on public
opinion, or, more particularly, on the polls. And, lately, on focus groups
and on approval meters that people can hold in their lap to record their
instantaneous reactions to a speaker's every word. <BR>
	&quot;Leadership?&quot; That's very important, too. It involves finding
out what the folks in the focus group or studio audience believe (or say
they believe) and then advocating it.<BR>
	The old timers prefer principles to values, because they are more permanent,
and they think that human nature really doesn't change over time. We moderns
hope human nature does change because we are trying constantly to change
it. And we ignore principles and prefer values, because values can be anything
you want. They are merely an appendage of a constantly evolving  social
order, a reflection of the power structure at any given moment. As time
goes by, it is smart to abandon some values as they become  inconvenient.
Other values we just give others new meanings; for example, &quot;creative.&quot;
And other values we invent; for example, &quot;energetic.&quot;<BR>
	So character is not an issue.<BR>
	One candidate is a human weathervane? So? His opponent has changed his
mind on several occasions; who is he to talk?<BR>
	One candidate routinely breaks his word? So? His opponent failed to achieve
his whole agenda.<BR>
	They're all the same. It's all relative. Character is not an issue. Really,
it's not.<BR>
	Feel better now? Good. Feelings are what it's all about.<BR>

The Reality of Drugs Belies a Cartoon-style Answer</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Garry B. Trudeau, creator of the comic-strip Doonesbury, is
one of your star Boomer celebrities, a self-appointed guru of perpetual
'60s cool. It was Trudeau who invented the jaunty Mr. Butts character that
mocks the tobacco companies and the politicians who take their contributions.
Today Mr. Butts figures haunt only Republican rallies, despite the annoying
fact from the National Library on Money and Politics that more than half
of the tobacco support of congressional candidates from 1980 to 1994 went
to Democrats.<BR>
<BR>
Real history, in contrast to cartoon history, has that way of interfering
with a good story. In Mr. Trudeau's case, this crusader against the legal
vice of tobacco recently felt obliged to write an essay in Time magazine
regarding his own past use of illegal narcotics. Were RJR Nabisco sleuths
about to expose him? Regardless, his confession is not the mea culpa of
a Newt Gingrich or even the denial of a Bill &quot;I didn't inhale&quot;
Clinton. Instead, Trudeau manages to say only briefly that he no longer
advocates drugs, while telling us at length how much he once enjoyed them
and even sold them. He implies that he only quit once he became a parent,
not so many years ago. &quot;To summarize,&quot; he writes, &quot;at one
time I possessed, consumed and probably distributed marijuana--activities
for which I may feel embarrassment but not guilt.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These &quot;memories of TOKING UP are fondly held,&quot; he coos in capitals.
&quot;Finally, I admit that this has not caused me to lose a moment of sleep,
except as it has pertained to my career.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How&Igrave;s that as a didactic tale for the kids? Tobacco's bad for you,
but dope's a bit of a kick. Cartoonist, draw thyself!<BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration also did not take drugs very seriously for over
three years; indeed, until a political attack appeared on the horizon. Then
the Administration, too, came up with the preposterous attempt to switch
the subject to cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
In the first three years of the Clinton presidency, Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders proposed looking into legalizing drugs and the Justice Department
recommended reducing mandatory sentences for drug crimes. The President
slashed the staff of his drug office by 80 percent and reduced interdiction
of drugs at the border and eradication efforts overseas. Coast Guard seizures
of cocaine fell 45 percent and marijuana, 90 percent. Supply reduction was
deemed a waste of time and money. <BR>
<BR>
When a report was produced for the Pentagon by the Institute for Defense
Analysis (IDA) suggesting the contrary--that interdiction is a &quot;cost
effective operational strategy for increasing cocaine prices and thereby
reducing cocaine use in the United States&quot;--the Administration held
up dissemination. Only insistence by the Republican dominated House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee brought the report to public awareness last
week. The full contents still have not been released.<BR>
<BR>
It apparently was the Administration's expectation that increased funds
for drug treatment would bring about demand reduction. Indeed, <I>The Man
From Hope</I>  told a group of Miami middle-schoolers last spring that drug
use had gone down &quot;every year for the last three years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the hard facts showed the hope was false. The National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse for 1995 revealed that drug use among teens rocketed upward
105% since 1992. Cocaine use among teens soared 166%. Compared to the past,
the drugs themselves have become cheap, &quot;pure&quot; and dangerous.
This would tend to validate the IDA study. Greater drug supply produces
lower prices and wider availability. Lessened drug education, meanwhile,
lowers the threshold for initial usage. Drug treatment for addicts, a Clinton
priority, is a valuable and humane service, but not much of an answer to
expanded drug supply and usage.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration tried to wriggle off the bad publicity--and escape the
merciless Dole ad showing candidate Clinton in 1992 laughing on MTV that
he wished he had inhaled--by pinning the problem on the Bush years. The
numbers in that period, however, don&Igrave;t show anything more than anti-drug
efforts and drug usage reaching a plateau. So another spin was tried, that
Republicans in Congress are responsible because they have not supported
all the treatment funds the president sought. But again, even if true, that
argument begs the question.<BR>
<BR>
That question is, what works? The best answer, so far, is an all-fronts
struggle of the kind launched in the Reagan years, when drug use was cut
in half.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of who is elected president, let&Igrave;s increase drug interdiction
and drug eradication, overseas as well as at home. From my own service as
U.S. representative to the U.N. narcotics agencies in Vienna in the '80s,
I would argue that we should solicit more international cooperation and
financial support for these tasks. Let&Igrave;s also expand assistance for
crop substitution in countries like Colombia, and thereby promote the domestic
stability that gives politicians the courage to stand up to narco-traffickers.<BR>
<BR>
Let&Igrave;s revise the once useful, but now stale, &quot;Just Say No&quot;
educational campaign among youth. Yes, we also should continue to improve
drug treatment for addicts and we should decriminalize medicinal use. And
let&Igrave;s do more to rebut Hollywood and media figures who glamorize
drugs, or, like Trudeau, laugh them off.<BR>
<BR>
As for politicians (or cartoonists), nobody cares what they did as youths.
What matters is whether they set an example as adults who have taken the
drug issue seriously.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Ted Van Dyk is a former Washington State resident</B> and
a Democrat of national pedigree, who once served as an aide to Vice President
Hubert Humphrey, later ran a Democratic policy center and advised Sen. Paul
Tsongas in his 1992  presidential bid. These days he gazes balefully over
developments in the Whitewater scandal as described in the newspapers that
arrive daily in his Washington, D.C. office; and he asks rhetorically, what
is the likely outcome of this seemingly endless mess? <BR>
<BR>
Consider this scenario, he suggests: Bill Clinton, like Richard Nixon in
1972, wins big in November, and next February independent counsel Kenneth
Starr announces an indictment. The country and the Congress are thrown into
an uproar. It's Watergate all over again and the people demand to know why
the facts had not been presented to them when they could have exercised
their own judgment at the polls. <BR>
<BR>
Now picture a second scenario: Clinton wins, but narrowly. Then the independent
counsel announces that he has found, in the familiar term of art, &quot;insufficient
grounds to prosecute.&quot; The White House and Democrats are outraged that
they have had to put up with the character issue hanging over their heads,
when an earlier resolution could have spared the President and maybe Democrats
in Congress a lot of anxiety, and maybe given them a larger mandate. <BR>
<BR>
In scenario three, the current steady erosion of news stories--Mrs. Clinton
cited for failure to report her role in the Castle Grande real estate deal,
talk of pardoning the McDougals, and what have you--take their silent toll.
Dole wins narrowly. Then, the independent counsel reports around inaugural
time that he is indicting the soon-to-be-retired Clintons. More distress,
including Republican indignation that this information was not available
at a time when it could have led to a more substantial GOP victory. <BR>
<BR>
Or, four, a narrow Dole victory is followed by a decision by the independent
counsel not to indict. Outgoing President Clinton is relieved, but angry.
This decision earlier could have saved the election for him and helped the
Democrats in Congress. The process has triumphed over justice once again.
(Van Dyk thinks the chances of indictment overall are 50-50.) <BR>
<BR>
In short, the Whitewater scandal and the investigation attending it have
dragged on so long now that it is hard to conceive of an outcome that truly
serves the nation&iacute;s interest. In 1992 the scandal was new, poorly
reported and had no effect on the election. Later, as Travelgate and other
mini-scandals developed, it was assumed that appointment of an independent
counsel (two, as it turned out) would get to the bottom of the matter and
clear it up, one way or another. Yet here we are, going through yet another
election where Whitewater and related matters whistle around the campaign
like a nasty ditty voters hate but can't get out of their heads. <BR>
<BR>
The assumption has been that because people are fatigued with Whitewater
and related matters, they also are unaware and unaffected. In fact, voters
know that questions of tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury are
serious, but they don't know how to assess them. In surveys, the results
are strange, and Charles E. Cook in the Capitol Hill newspaper, <I>Roll
Call,</I> is not alone in saying that he has never seen such volatility.
Consider this exotic syllogism: a) a majority of people believe &quot;character&quot;
is important in a president; b) a majority thinks Dole is far superior to
Clinton on this count, and c) a majority plans to vote for Clinton. <BR>
<BR>
If that kind of survey is accurate, does it suggest, as some say, that the
American people have lost their moral bearings? Not necessarily. It may
suggest that people have other things on their minds, and, in any case,
prefer to give the Clintons the benefit of the doubt until hard evidence
of wrongdoing is presented. Who can blame them? Theirs actually seems like
a very sensible attitude. <BR>
<BR>
For one thing, who can remember all the chapters in the Whitewater saga
as it courses through Arkansas and Washington, D.C., let alone the details?
Few Democratic leaders in Congress or elsewhere are visibly defending the
Clintons on Whitewater, yet the Dole campaign is staying away from the subject,
too. Maybe no one can follow it all. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are many other, on-the-record reasons for a vote against
Clinton and for Dole (and vice versa), but they are the old, standard liberal
versus conservative arguments that have divided the parties for sixty odd
years. You don't have to have Whitewater splashed in your face. Not on the
evidence so far. <BR>
<BR>
Van Dyk, who over the past few years became a public critic of Bill Clinton's
character (&quot;I believe he is badly flawed.&quot;), is now frustrated
with the failure of the independent counsel to come to a conclusion in a
timely fashion that would allow a political resolution rather than risk
a constitutional crisis. A partisan Democrat, he is foremost concerned for
the country. <BR>
<BR>
Prosecutors, he notes, always think of building as strong a case as possible
before he takes action. Let justice takes its course. But there comes a
point where more is at stake than a trial--like the future of the nation.
Thus, Van Dyk now concludes that if Ken Starr is going to bring charges,
he has an obligation to do it before election day. Otherwise, he should
drop it.<BR>
<BR>
Think about the grave implications of either course. Someone should.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Scott Klug, clean cut and earnest, used to be a reporter
for KING-TV in Seattle. </B>He liked to investigate politicians. You would
not have suspected that he would wind up in Congress himself one day, but
that is what happened. Having returned home to Madison ,Wisconsin, Klug
got elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives. Now in Washington,
D.C.--still clean cut and earnest--he focuses a lot on cutting costs and
privatizing government programs. And he is making some progress. <BR>
<BR>
The Republican House majority, including Klug and his Washington State colleagues,
deserves credit for reducing spending growth and making a balanced budget
by 2002 a realistic goal. It wouldn't have been possible without the Republicans'
sometimes stormy insistence, and if they lose power this fall, that goal
surely will erode. But they got in political trouble when their cuts hit
some highly visible services with broad constituencies. Everybody wants
Congress to combat &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; but one voter's idea
of waste is another's idea of a vital service. <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, almost everybody would like a tax cut, as Republicans propose.
It is, or ought to be, common knowledge that when federal, state and local
taxes are combined, the American family is more heavily taxed than ever
before. But, how do you pay for a broad cut? There will be a supply side
boost to revenues when marginal tax rates are cut, but it will cover only
about a quarter of the tab. <BR>
<BR>
We clearly need greater efficiencies in government. Klug believes that government
monopolies, lacking the discipline of the free market, raise costs directly
and--by not paying taxes--indirectly, too. Privatization, while not a panacea,
can lower government costs and still improve services. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization was a subject of fashionable discussion in the 1980s, but
few actual conversions were undertaken. Selling off Conrail, the government-subsidized
freight railroad that had been picked up when Penn Central, New York Central
and several other lines failed, was one of the stellar successes. That privatization
was led by Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Dole,
and turned a multi-billion dollar public revenue eater into a multi-billion
dollar tax contributor. (The Dole campaign should make more of this story.)
Klug is now among those promoting the current proposal to privatize Amtrak
passenger service. <BR>
<BR>
Klug's efforts led Speaker Gringrich last year to appoint him head of a
House privatization task force that includes, among others, Rep. Jennifer
Dunn of Bellevue, Washington. An initial effort was the abolition, privatization
or partial privatization of some nine programs within the House of Representatives
itself--from beauty and barber shops to food services and recording studios.
As Gingrich recently noted on Meet the Press, the old House still had ice
delivered twice daily to each Member&iacute;s office--80 years after invention
of the refrigerator. Most of these in-House reforms are now completed, with
expected ultimate savings to taxpayers of $44 million, a good example for
the rest of government. <BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has made a few modest moves toward privatization,
of course, such as agreeing with Congress to sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves
(at an anticipated price of $1.6 billion). But Klug is skeptical of any
serious or long term Clinton commitment. Dole is much more interested. Whoever
is president, however, Klug has a long list of privatization targets. They
involve sale or lease of assets, contracting out of services, functional
conversion to the private sector and lifting legal barriers to privatization.
For example: <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI> Klug and his task force want to contract out the debt collection
activities of the IRS. Citing a General Accounting Office report and a survey
by the American Collectors Association, Klug foresees savings of over $10
billion. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>$80 million could be saved by privatizing many activities of the Government
Printing Office. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Money to build badly needed new prisons could be found by turning
some operations over to private companies, which experience shows can construct
and manage prisons for 20 % less than the government. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Contracting out government commercial-style services could save &quot;as
much as $9 billion a year.&quot; Klug cites as examples the Department of
Defense and the Veteran&iacute;s Administration, which compete with the
private sector in grocery distribution. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Privatizing management of federal loan programs could save $2 billion
annually. 
</UL>
<BR>
Some of the GOP proposals Klug is introducing will require more study and
debate. For instance, he wants to move, though slowly, to sell off the electric
power projects built in the '30s and 40s. This would have been politically
unimaginable several decades ago, but, as shown in a report this month by
a bi-partisan task force of governors from the four Northwest states, even
the huge and venerable Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is coming under
increased consideration for privatization, at least for its power transmission
system. The power industry is moving into greater competition these days
and a co-existent government monopoly makes less and less sense. Klug wisely
suggests privatization &igrave;from least to most complex&icirc;power marketing
administrations, starting with Southeastern Power Administration, and reviewing
Western Area Power Administration and BPA last. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it is remarkable that anyone is even able to talk about such matters
these days. Barry Goldwater's proposal in 1964 to sell the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) helped defeat him. But few attack Klug in 1996 for wanting
to bring at least the non-power programs of TVA into the private, tax-paying
sector, at a savings of $140 million a year, and he bravely asks why regulated
private ownership of TVA power would not also make sense for citizen rate-payers
in today&iacute;s environment--as well as earning $28 billion for the federal
treasury. <BR>
<BR>
There, indeed, are few sacred cows in the Wisconsin representative's budget
pasture. He even dares to mention the Postal Service. Barry Goldwater himself
didn't raise such an issue. If he had, it would have been thought a joke.
But that was before private overnight mail delivery, faxes and e-mail. Now
Klug's suggestion that the Post Office evolve into an employee-owned corporation
doesn't strike most people as either ridiculous or extreme. More and more,
it sounds like common sense.<BR>

A Common Sense Test on Contemporary Politics</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="/rob_c/Rob%27s%20files/DISCOVERY/starbar.gif" WIDTH=
"468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Here is a test of Common Sense Opinions on Current Politics. Write true
or false next to each item and, at the end, see how you scored.<BR>
<BR>
1. A presidential candidate, such as Ross Perot, who continually fails to
reach beyond 4 to 8 percent in the opinion polls and never would have been
in the race in the first place if he hadn&iacute;t been rich, is not owed
a position in the televised presidential debates. And he shouldn&iacute;t
get one.<BR>
<BR>
2. If Perot is invited to the debates, anyway, so should Harry Browne of
the Libertarian Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party. At least the show
would be more entertaining.<BR>
<BR>
3. Broad tax relief that allows people to spend more of their money according
to their own priorities is better than &igrave;targeted&icirc; tax breaks
that assume the government knows best how people should spend their money.
Thus, Dole is right in his approach and Clinton is wrong.<BR>
<BR>
4. Regardless, Dole, if elected, is more likely to follow through on his
tax cuts than Clinton is with his. <BR>
<BR>
5. In domestic affairs, the number one issue facing America is entitlement
spending. Both parties know that the rate of growth in Medicare must be
reduced if the integrity of the system is to be preserved, and that little
or no damage will be done to seniors if modest steps are taken now. The
actual legislation that the Republicans tried to pass was responsible and
fair, despite the demagogic spin put on it by the current crop of Democratic
and AFL-CIO ads.<BR>
<BR>
6. Social Security takes roughly 12 and a half percent of people&iacute;s
payroll income. For the next few years, while the government takes in more
from Social Security taxes than it pays out, it is possible to a) assure
present recipients of exactly the Social Security payments they expect and
b) allow young people to turn their future payments into a mutual fund savings
instrument tied to the private economy and thereby save significantly more
for their future. The proposal has wide support in think tanks and among
economists.That this idea is not even being discussed so far by either Mr.Clinton
or Mr. Dole is testimony to the threat of demagogy on this subject. <BR>
<BR>
7. Mr. Clinton has a new spending proposal each campaign day. For example,
he wants to fund more Americorps community volunteers, even though taxpayers
pay $27,000 per &igrave;volunteer,&icirc; about twice what comparable volunteers
cost private charities. If he is re-elected, Mr. Clinton&iacute;s statement
that &igrave;The era of big government is over&icirc; will become one of
the most ironic political pronouncements of all time, along with Herbert
Hoover&iacute;s &igrave;Prosperity is just around the corner.&icirc; <BR>
<BR>
8. Under the new federal so-called &igrave;reform&icirc; laws a lobbyist
may not pay for a dinner for a senator anywhere within 35 miles of the Capitol.
But he can take the senator on an &igrave;inspection trip&icirc; to Paris
and have his corporation or oganization pay for the whole thing. The rule
should be the opposite. No politician is going to be bought for the price
of a dinner, while a glamorous, all-expenses paid trip may raise &szlig;real
questions. Congress--and the professional &igrave;reformers&icirc; that
live off controversy--should get real.<BR>
<BR>
9. Under the same new &igrave;reform&icirc; laws, members of Congress who
may not receive a free meal from a lobbyist, constituents or almost anyone
else, are quite free, however, to provide free meals for the lobbyist, constituents,
or whomever. Later, the Congressmen also are free to ask the lobbyists for
campaign contributions, and from those campaign contriibutions--pooled in
their campaign funds-- pay off all their meal chits. This is considered
part of the expense of doing business, and since it can&iacute;t be charged
to the taxpayers, it can be charged to campaign funds. This shows again
a) that petty reform laws can almost always be circumvented, and b) that
there&iacute;s no such thing as a free lunch.<BR>
<BR>
10. It is wrong for the media to refer to Sherry Rowlands, the prostitute
hired by Presidential &igrave;family values&icirc; adviser Dick Morris,
as a &igrave;call girl.&icirc; The proper term should be &igrave;call person.&icirc;<BR>
<BR>
Results: The correct answer for each question is &igrave;True,&icirc; except
for the last, number 10, which is definitely false (Tsk, tsk. Common sense
must hold to standard English, even in vernacular speech--just as in standard
morality.) Give yourself 10 points for each correct answer. If you scored
under 50, you seriously need to re-examine your prejudices, although the
same is true for many of your fellow citizens and most of the media. A score
of 60 to 90 shows that you have a common sense understanding of the American
political scene. Congratulations! A perfect score puts you in perfect harmony
with the author and cannot be admired too highly. <BR>

To Succeed, Seattle Should Share the Olympics </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>

<BR>
The Seattle Bid Committe that is spearheading the drive to bring the Olympics
to Seattle and the Northwest in 2008 has entered a new, post-Atlanta phase.
First, the organizational effort is about to be intensified. Entrepreneur
Clark Kokich will operate as chairman of the committee, and internationally
known events impressario Bob Walsh will lead planning, as before. But to
provide day-to-day continuity, Dave Syferd, a noted public relations and
marketing executive, is expected to be named soon as president. The Seattle
Sports and Events Council is loaning staff to the project.<BR>
<BR>
The second post-Atlanta development is a growing recognition among supporters
that the early inspiration to seek the games on as broad a regional basis
as possible was wise and should be re-enforced. Indeed, the regional approach
would seem to have been vindicated both by the over-crowding in Atlanta
and the results of a recent Western Washington poll on the Olympics.<BR>
<BR>
Public backing in the poll actually grows when the idea is broached to make
the games a regional affair centered in Seattle, but with events staged
throughout &quot;<A HREF="cascadia.html">Cascadia</A>.&quot; This would
seem to reflect wholly legitimate concerns about traffic congestion and
about cost. If the Olympics are held on a regional basis, both traffic and
overhead expenses can be spread from Victoria and Vancouver to Portland,
though primary emphasis will remain on the Central Puget Sound area and
the official host city, Seattle. <BR>
<BR>
In Atlanta, though a few events were staged outside the metropolitan area,
regionalism was an afterthought. Central Atlanta was closed down and the
focus of non-event activity was on the new, 21 acre Centennial Park--less
than a third the size of Seattle Center. Yet, it was also Atlanta's ambition
to host the largest spectator audience ever for the Olympics. Nine million
tickets were printed. <BR>
<BR>
The solution for Seattle is 1) regionalize to the full extent feasible,
and 2) prune the spectator ticket sales back to the four million figure
typical of earlier Olympic Games, or at least to the five million number
Sydney will print for 2000. There is good reason to think that the International
Olympics Committee (IOC) will like this approach. It was Atlanta&iacute;s
idea, not the IOC&iacute;s, that bigger necessarily was better.<BR>
<BR>
It is probable that the IOC, with Atlanta&iacute;s experience to remind
it, also will approve of Seattle&iacute;s plan to share many Olympic events
with its neighbors. The IOC requires a single city to take the lead, or
else the organizing commitee already would be moving forward with a multi-city
or regional bid. Oregonians and British Columbians already serve on the
bid committee and Seattle area participants all want bi-national regional
cooperation to develop as one of the identifiable achievements of the games.
Victoria hosted the Commonwealth Games recently and Vancouver has splendid
new facilities, as does Portland. It would be a mistake not to share many
of the Olympics&iacute; 271 events with these neighbors. <BR>
<BR>
Closer to home, Tacoma and Everett are logical hubs for various events.
A new equestrian facility already contemplated for Ellensburg will help
pull events over the mountains into Eastern Washington. And what about the
state capital, Olympia? How could we pass up holding some of the classic
&quot;Olympic&quot; competitions in the city with the same name as Olympia,
Greece, the games' birthplace almost 2800 years ago?<BR>
<BR>
In further response to the traffic issue, Seattle itself would not anticipate
closing off the downtown or concentrating recreation and cultural events
in one small area. We already have a large and lively urban core with far
more attractions to disperse crowds than Atlanta had. Also, the Seattle
sponsors would integrate local government and citizen planning on both security
and transportation early on, as Atlantans, unfortunately, failed to do.<BR>
<BR>
But what about local costs, even with sharing? Didn't Atlanta's businesses,
individuals and government wind up paying nearly $2 billion for the games?
Yes, but they brought in over $4 billion. The metropolitan area was beautified,
its infrastructure--from road surfaces to new recreation, housing and park
facilities--was immensely improved. Thousands of young people gained news
skills and work experience, representing an untold increase in &quot;human
capital.&quot; Community groups pulled together and made regional alliances.<BR>
<BR>
Hosting the games, as Atlanta found out, is no panacea for poor planning
or other urban ills, but the games--the world's biggest event, and a positive
one--do represent a useful forward strategy. In Barcelona, host to the 1992
Olympics, the games (according to the mayor, quoted in the Wall Street Journal)
&quot;were fantastic, but it was only a 15 day dream.&icirc; Thanks to his
city&iacute;s revitalization, &igrave;The best moment in Barcelona is now.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there remains perhaps the biggest question: Could Seattle win
the games in the first place? Consider, for example, the image problem.
A Seattleite who was in Atlanta found himself marooned at a restaurant during
one of the frequent downpours that were common this past sticky summer --and
every summer. Sitting there, he mentioned to a local citizen Seattle's interest
in hosting the games in 2008.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Seattle?&quot; replied the Atlantan incredulously. &quot;But it rains
all the time in Seattle!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
News flash to the IOC: Late July and early August in Seattle are golden.<BR>
<BR>
My colleagues in Discovery Institute's Cascadia project are conducting a
feasibility study to examine a range of other real and imaginary obstacles
to Seattle's hosting the Olympics. If the whole region, working together,
cannot master those difficulties, then, by all means, the Olympic games
effort should be abandoned.<BR>
<BR>
But what a mistake it would be not to find out!<BR>

They're Attacking Dale Foreman to Defeat His Ideas</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>	State House Majority Leader Dale Foreman is a logical candidate for
governor.  He's smart, personable, and experienced. At 48, he's still a
fresh voice in politics, having been elected first only four years ago.
He's the easily-met, thoroughly decent kind of person you'd like to have
as a neighbor.  An attorney, orchardist and author, the well-rounded Wenatchee
representative has the political advantages of an earnest speaking style
and a natural bloc of support in Eastern Washington, which has long wanted
a home-based governor. He  has many friends, as well, in Puget Sound country,
where he grew up. Former King Country Prosecutor Chris Bayley chairs his
campaign.<BR>
<BR>
	 Like Jack Kemp, Foreman is a serious social as well as a fiscal conservative.
His several legal books include one describing the trial of Jesus. He also
has Kemp's redeeming grace for seeking an inclusive, welcoming Republican
party.<BR>
<BR>
	Most of all, the scholarly Foreman, better than anyone running, understands
the state budget. And he knows he wants to cut that budget.  He specifically
and courageously announced his intention to trim 10,000 jobs, and in the
campaign he has been laying out a plan for doing so. He believes efficiencies
also can be achieved through improved technology, where the state lags behind
the private sector. It is not a radical program, but a prudent, business-like
one that he realistically acknowledges will take several years to complete.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, Foreman's &quot;Comprehensive Change and Reform Plan&quot; reads
as if he had pulled together the best ideas that such reform governors as
Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, John Engler in Michigan and Christine Todd
Whitman in New Jersey have enacted in their states. <BR>
<BR>
	Selective pruning, notes Foreman, the orchardist, is especially overdue
in Washington State.  He points out that state government employment has
gone up more than 50 percent in the past dozen years--from approximately
60,000 to 97,000, rising at a rate twice that of population growth.<BR>
<BR>
	Unfortunately, the media has shown little interest in Foreman's proposal.
But that doesn't mean that word of Foreman's program hasn't gotten around.
His pledge to reduce the state payroll is exactly the kind of provocation
that excites active animosity from those who feel their jobs might be jeopardized.
And, sadly, some in the media, while mainly ignoring Foreman's policy ideas,
are quick to air personal attacks on him.<BR>
<BR>
	The charges began with allegations of infractions of the Public Disclosure
law, including largely technical matters, but also a remarkable claim that
Foreman, as Majority Leader raising funds to promote the GOP agenda in the
Legislature and only considering a run for governor, should have filed papers
then as if he already were a candidate. <BR>
<BR>
	This is new ground, a free speech limiting power grab by the staff of the
Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) that almost surely will lose in the courts
if the commissioners themselves pursues it. Once again the PDC will have
strayed far from its original mandate. But meanwhile, the issue assails
Foreman during the final weeks of the primary campaign--which undoubtedly
is just what the complainant intended.<BR>
<BR>
	Then there was the hot news tip--breathlessly reported--that Foreman had
been &quot;excused&quot; from some lawsuit ten years ago. Nothing illegal
or damaging there, mind you, just an &quot;appearance&quot; of an implication
of a suggestion, you might say. What mattered was not the empty story, but
the reporting of it. Where did the story come from and why didn't the media
tell us what the motivation might be?<BR>
 <BR>
	More recently, there was yet another story: that Foreman used irrigation
&quot;water-spreading&quot; on his farm in a way that had caused a dispute
with the Department of Ecology (DOE). It is one of those penny-ante accounts
that leaves the knowledgeable observer asking, &quot;So, what?&quot; But
it leaves--and is meant to leave--the casual observer musing, &quot;I don't
understand what this is about, but it must be really serious or the media
wouldn't be covering it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Where's there's smoke, there's fire, people say.<BR>
<BR>
	Except in politics, I would say, where's there's sometimes only a smoke
machine.<BR>
<BR>
	In this case, it definitely was a smoke machine. But it wasn't necessarily
operated from within the DOE. Carol Fleskes, director of shorelands and
water resources at DOE, states that &quot;We're not the ones generating
this story.&quot; DOE and Foreman--who added five acres of land to his orchard
and is using the same amount of water as before to irrigate it--do differ
on whether he now needs a new legal claim or the old one remains suficient
under the law. &quot;Until that claim is verified by the courts it is hard
for us to take any kind of action to clarify the dispute,&quot; says Fleskes.
<BR>
<BR>
	It boils down to a minor jurisdictional issue. But somebody did want to
make a big deal out of the little claim. Why?<BR>
<BR>
	Because Dale Foreman's fiscal program, even with scant media attention,
is close to hitting a popular nerve. His talent and his ideas endanger entrenched
powers as well as some rivals. Therefore, the strategy: If you don't want
to confront a candidate's ideas, attack him personally. Or see that someone
else does.<BR>

The Networks May Boycott the Conventions? Good!</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>

<P>	We are all supposed to be concerned that television's Ted Koppel left
the Republican convention early and is not even going to appear in Chicago
for the Democrats' show. At San Diego, the big three networks saw their
ratings plummet and they ascribe this failure to Republicans scripting their
extravaganza so tightly that no &quot;story&quot; (also known as &quot;bad
news&quot;) broke loose. Next week, the Democrats' shindig may be just as
impervious to negative media spin--as it should be, if the Democrats have
any sense. In this contrived atmosphere, the networks are warning us that
they will consider not covering the conventions at all in the year 2000.
They're going to take their cameras and go home.<BR>
<BR>
	Now I call that really good news! It will be an excellent improvement in
politics for the next millennium.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, if the networks do show up at future conventions, the parties
should allow them in only if they agree to reduce the number of their cloying
&quot;analyses,&quot;  floor interviews and other speech-usurping, distracting
and tendentious pelf. In San Diego, half of each network hour was taken
up by the commentators and, of course, the ads.  For example, instead of
being allowed to watch a newly discovered political gem like J.C. Watts,
the eloquent black Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, network viewers
were left with synthetic pearls from TV's shopworn celebrities. What matters
to the networks is not airing the conventions, but re-airing conventional
wisdom.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, network convention coverage probably subtracts more from a voter's
understanding than it adds, just as self-absorbed network coverage of last
spring's primaries represented a net loss of popular deliberation in that
process (average sound bite per candidate: 7 seconds!). We can count on
similar coverage of the serious public business at hand this fall. Perhaps,
therefore, it would be just as well if the networks decided to stop covering
the final election, too. We mustn't keep them from the important fires and
hurricanes and two-headed giraffes that increasingly interest them.<BR>
<BR>
	The best advice to both parties is to stop trying so hard to please the
networks and their celebrity minions. Especially when it comes to live coverage
of political conventions, you don't need them anymore. Since the rise of
cable TV, voters have much better options, ranging from CNN, which is at
least somewhat less intrusive than the broadcast networks, to the totally
unobtrusive C-Span--the best innovation in the cause of  good government
since punch-card voting. And there's always PBS, not to mention radio and
even the comedy channel, where the humor's intentional.<BR>
<BR>
	The parties increasingly will find it advantageous to buy their own time
on TV and put their message across the way they want it, which is just what
the GOP did this year. By 2000 we'll have some version of a &quot;teleputer&quot;
(in George Gilder's phrase), computers with interactive TV capabilities
controlled by the user.  The viewer will be able to do his own editing,
as it were, listening to a convention speech in full or cutting away to
interviews or analyses as he or she--and not some network producer--desires.
When that happens, network TV convention coverage will become largely unprofitable,
anyhow. No high ratings, no big ads.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, parties have every right--and maybe a duty-- to run their conventions
to suit their own purposes, not those of the TV networks. Party conventions
are the great gatherings of the political tribes, a unique chance to showcase
familiar political favorites and emerging lights, and, for that matter,
for the party workers and leaders to mingle with counterparts from around
the country. Simply getting the party's act together is a service to the
voters; it makes each party prepare early for the possibility of governing.<BR>
<BR>
	If these communal rites are less spontaneous now than in days of yore,
it bears remembering that the scripting of conventions to look like TV shows
is directly the fault of TV itself.  Television first covered a political
convention in 1948.  By 1952, the parties were beginning to change their
procedures to accommodate the demanding new medium. In early 1956 a novel
called The Golden Kazoo accurately forecast the parties' growing obeisance
to TV and the techniques of &quot;Madison Avenue,&quot; a satiric vision
that became reality by 1960.<BR>
<BR>
	Parties and voters accepted the likes of Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley
as &quot;moderators,&quot; sitting in Olympian judgment on mere mortal candidates.
Presidential aspirants trembled at the thought that such worthies might
criticize them, even implicitly, though the media code of the time usually
prevented the networks' power from being so exercised. And if it was exercised
sometimes, the politicians, and of course the public, were too unsophisticated
to figure it out.<BR>
<BR>
	Today, the bias--usually left wing, occasionally right wing,  but almost
always skeptical and demeaning to the people in politics--is much more common,
and also more commonly understood and resented. In respect to conventions,
in any event, the parties finally learned that what made for good network
TV was not necessarily  what made for good politics. Hence, the scripting.<BR>
<BR>
	By 2000, however, it may not matter. If the networks follow through on
their threat to boycott the conventions, the only question by then will
be, who cares?<BR>

<H1><CENTER>New Faces of 1996 Politics: <BR>
Black Conservatives</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B>by Bruce Chapman</B></CENTER>
<P><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
	Question : What do Anthony Lowe, the Deputy Prosecuting Attorney of King
County, Washington who is running for State Insurance Commissioner, Teresa
Doggett, the international banker running for Congress from Austin, Texas
and Danny Covington of Vicksburg, Mississippi, another Congressional hopeful,
have in common?<BR>
<BR>
	 Answer: they all are  conservative black Republicans who are likely to
seek support from BAMPAC--&quot;Black America's Political Action Committee.&quot;
 Expecting to raise over $1 million this year from a membership list of
37,000, BAMPAC is cited by Hill Magazine in Washington, D.C. as the fastest
growing new political action committee in the country. Its founder was the
principled and charismatic former Reagan Administration Ambassador, Alan
Keyes, who ran for president in the GOP primaries last spring.<BR>
<BR>
	A few years ago, black Republican candidates were  rarities, especially
in predominantly white districts. They did run in black districts, but were
considered little more than sacrificial lambs. Therefore, when 11 blacks
ran for Congress on the GOP line in 1990, most observers considered the
development significant. Six years later there are at least 24 black GOP
Congressional candidates--now including two incumbents, Gary A.Franks of
Connecticut and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma. As happened to blacks on the Democratic
ticket in the '70's, there suddenly are black Republicans showing up in
state offices, such as Secretary of State Victoria Buckley of Colorado and
Ohio State Treasurer J. Kenneth Blackwell. <BR>
<BR>
	Moreover, more Republican blacks are contesting Democrats in predominately
black areas. Mississippi's Danny Covington, a former parole officer and
Congressional aide with a  conservative social message, is the first black
to win a Republican primary in that state since Reconstruction days, over
a century ago. The state's US Senators, both Republicans, strongly supported
Covington against a white primary challenger.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, the Repbublican party could only go up in terms of  black support.
Just 10 percent identify today with the party of Lincoln. But there are
ocassional races where GOP candidates receive up to 40 percent black support,
and that edge often proves decisive.<BR>
<BR>
	The first black US Senator since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts
in the 1970's, was a Repbublican--one of the rarities. But Brooke was a
liberal Republican, as were many of the appointed officials advanced by
Republican presidents until Reagan. They not only backed the civil rights
gains of the '60's--as did most Republican then, and almost all by the next
decade--but also the more controversial programs, such as racial set-asides
and quotas. Their closest prominent counterpart today would be Gen. Colin
Powell, who supports &quot;affirmative action,&quot; while opposing &quot;preferences,&quot;
a fine distinction.<BR>
<BR>
	In any case, most newer black Republican elective officials are more conservative.
In this they are closest to the top black legal official in the land, Supreme
Court Justice Clarence Thomas. They like to point out that while the Republican
party, as such, is not popular among blacks, there are strong conservative
currents running in the overall black electorate.<BR>
<BR>
	A 1992 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a
generally liberal think tank, confirms that more blacks call themselves
conservative than liberal (33 percent to 29 percent). A more recent poll
by the center provides a fascinating breakdown of these averages, showing
that younger black voters, 18-25, were nearly twice as likely to identify
with the Republicans as were older ones (18 percent versus 8 percent) and
to call themselves conservatives (34 percent versus 22 percent). <BR>
<BR>
	Overall, black voters supported the death penalty 58 percent to 42 percent,
backed a two year limit on welfare by 58 percent also, by nearly 75 percent
backed mandatory sentences for drug dealers, and by 61 percent agreed that
black leaders were too quick to cite racism as an excuse for black crime.<BR>
<BR>
	The Gallup survey, similarly, found 53 percent disapproval of mandatory
busing among black voters, 48 percent pro-life sentiment and 77 percent
opposition to preferential treatment to make up for past discrimination.
Some 92 percent of blacks believe in God, a figure higher than for the population
as a whole (about 85 percent).<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, these surveys do not predict voter behavior and, moreover, wording
(for example, &quot;affirmative action&quot; versus &quot;preferential treatment&quot;)
can change poll outcomes for all groups in society. Just as Southern whites
agreed with Republicans in such polls for many years and still voted overwhelmingly
Democratic, there is little sign yet of political reallignment among black
voters nationally.<BR>
<BR>
	Yet it could come; and even a rise to 20  or 30 percent Republican support
would  transform the political landscape. Likewise, an increase of black
Republicans in Congress from two to, say, six, effectively would end the
monolithic Democratic support the media and other observers expect of black
Americans. It also might end the recent tendency of the Democratic party
to take black voters for granted. <BR>
<BR>
	However, white Republicans, too, should pay close attention to what black
members of their party are telling them. The old government solutions to
social and economic problems have failed, but, as General Powell stated
at the GOP convention, there is still a demand for solutions of some kind.
Economic opportunity is crucial. Within the party, personal or political
slights are as unwelcome as ever. Unconscious white discrimination burns
the hearts of  conservative as well as liberal blacks.<BR>
<BR>
	It's just that black conservatives, stressing family, entrepreneurism and
community self-help, believe they have found a better way of moving forward.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Bob Dole's &quot;Vision&quot; May Soon Clear Up</CENTER>

<P>The campaign of 1996 will get out of the summer Doledrums when the prospective
GOP standard-bearer announces his economic program. If that program is ambitious
in scope, joining a growth package of and tax reductions and spending controls
with a long term rescue of Social Security through private sector investments,
Bob Dole's supposed lack of a &quot;vision&quot; suddenly will disappear
as a political concern. A program simple in concept and profound in social
and economic implications, it would unite in common interest otherwise contending
generations and economic groups.<BR>
<BR>
The young, the working poor and much of the middle class, for whom high
payroll taxes and today's low-growth prosperity make saving exceedingly
difficult, would see the bulk of their Social Security tax finally put to
work as a genuine instrument for investment. Simultaneously, the effect
upon the nation's overall savings rate would give the United States the
higher growth rates that encourage real national and personal financial
progress.<BR>
<BR>
The risk in the package, of course, is raising the Social Security issue
in a politically charged atmosphere. The Clinton White House will be tempted
irresistibly to rouse the elderly against any change. Never mind that in
almost any reform plan Dole might endorse, protection of the elderly will
be guaranteed. The politics of misinformation that worked so well with Medicare
reform--where millions of dollars of Democratic and labor union TV ads persuaded
voters that a proposed reduction in the rate of growth of this entitlement
constituted a &quot;cut&quot;--will be used again to stigmatize reform of
Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
But several developments are pushing a cautious Dole to take up the challenge,
anyhow.<BR>
First, he desperately needs some new ideas. As is, his campaign is running
like a Kansas creek in a July drought. But something more than old-time
Republican deficit reductions is indicated. An economic plan that offers
ordinary workers a way to gain a share in national wealth-creation will
have broad and deep appeal. Without a forward-looking national agenda, on
the other hand, Dole's only hope is that the Clinton presidency self-destructs
in scandal. But even if it did, a victorious Dole would go into office without
a mandate for any particular program. <BR>
<BR>
Second, former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm's entry into the suddenly real
&quot;race&quot; for the Reform Party nomination puts the Social Security
issue on the table, in any case. He has met with key backers of the idea,
including Jose Pinera, the Chilean who successfully introduced it in his
country, and the proposal is now part of Lamm's avowed program. So the issue
will be debated nationally, regardless of what Dole or Clinton want or fear,
or, of course, how the more likely Reform Party nominee, Ross Perot, chooses
to characterize it. <BR>
<BR>
Lamm knows he is on to something. Young voters are especially excited about
the idea. When Steve Forbes proposed it in a debate at the University of
Arizona last spring he got a standing ovation from the largely youthful
audience and won that state's primary.<BR>
<BR>
The third development promoting a Dole decision to adopt broad reform as
an issue is the imminence of a report by the Clinton Administration's own
bi-partisan Social Security advisory commission. Having labored in obscurity
for two years, the panel is about to conclude that the best solution to
the Social Security system's problems is reform that takes advantage of
the power of the free market. (The worst solution, of course, is to raise
the already high payroll taxes and to cut benefits.)<BR>
<BR>
The 13 member commission is divided as to which of several specific approaches
is desirable. The main issues are whether all or only part of a worker's
12.4 percent Social Security tax should be invested in a savings and investment
account for him personally and how best to handle the transition from the
present system to an entirely new one.<BR>
<BR>
These are not minor questions. Without some of a taxpayers' payment going
to fund the transition costs of a new system, that transition becomes problematical.
On the other hand, unless a worker gets something close to full personal
advantage from the investment of his savings, the bright potential for him
and for the economy is reduced.<BR>
<BR>
These differences can be composed, but they need not be resolved in this
fall's campaign. Even if Dole (or Clinton, for that matter) were to embrace
a specific detailed plan, Congress would want to hold hearings and make
changes next spring. In fact, there are so many variations of the private
sector plan around now that endorsing one completely would assure criticism
from backers of other approaches. The same goes for a flat tax proposal
and a spending control plan.<BR>
<BR>
What matters is a general outline that combines the benefits of a flat or
flatter income tax with the conversion of Social Security from a fund whose
current (and temporary) surplus is used to subsidize the general budget
to one that helps individual workers invest. A flat tax without Social Security
reform could be seen as tilting toward the upper middle class and wealthy,
while Social Security reform by itself will not maximize economic growth.
The two together, along with spending controls, would help every worker
and family in the country. If Dole advocates such a package he will have
a central and unifying theme for his campaign. No more Bob Dull.<BR>
<BR>
As it happens, the last Kansan to be nominated for President, Dwight Eisenhower
in 1952, also was criticized in late summer for a campaign that was &quot;running
like a dry creek.&quot; But he managed to turn that campaign around with
a breakthrough international policy idea---&quot;I will go to Korea.&quot;
Economic reform to help average Americans could do the same for Bob Dole.

How do you Play Cards with China?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
	Washington Sen. Slade Gorton received headline attention recently  when
he announced that he would not oppose extension of &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot;
(MFN) trading status for China this year. He thereby helped avoid an embarrassing
vote in the Senate at a time when Boeing has major Chinese contracts pending
and Microsoft has just reached a new agreement  on intellectual property
rights.<BR>
 <BR>
	Less noticed, however, was the angry nature of the criticism Gorton heaped
on the Chinese and their apologists here in the United States.  Throwing
down a marker on trade complaints, the Republican senior senator declared
that unless significantly fairer treatment of American companies takes place
in the next year,  he will &quot;lead the fight&quot; against awarding China
MFN status next year.  Coming from a representative of the nation's most
trade dependent state, the pledge is considered reckless swagger by some
observers and political courage by others. Regardless, Gorton, when aroused
by a large principle, is a resourceful legislative foe.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Gorton's Democratic colleague, Sen. Patty Murray, is heading
in what seems to be the opposite direction, arguing at a recent conference
of the Washington Council for International Trade that the US should make
MFN status permanent for all nations with whom we have relations (which
is all but the likes of Iraq, Cuba and North Korea). This, she believes
would avoid the annual pain and embarrassment of the MFN debate. Many China-hands
in business and academia agree.<BR>
<BR>
	It seems unlikely that under present circumstances either option will prevail,
however. On one hand, America is too entangled with the China trade and
too smitten with the future of an economy growing by 9% a year to lift anchor
and sail away. Before long, there will be a wholesale turnover in Chinese
leadership as the aged Long Marchers finally retire or die, so US traders
are reluctant to surrender their position now to the Japanese and Europeans.
Slade Gorton is articulate as well as indignant in his cataloguing of Chinese
trade perfidies, but the very businesses he might be expected to have on
his side--software, wheat and fruit growers, for example--are unwilling
to sign up against MFN.<BR>
<BR>
	On the other hand, Sen. Murray's dream of a permanent MFN will make a easy
target for political opponents of the present annual endorsement. This year
the human rights and consumer groups who normally get involved in the MFN
fight decided to stand aside, but they certainly would not do so if a permanent
grant was being considered. Until China-US trade and other relations are
substantially improved, MFN will be retained as a handy weapon.<BR>
<BR>
	Better relations are by no means impossible, of course. Whoever wins the
Presidency in November will want to organize a US/China summit, and maybe
Bill Clinton will attempt one before then, if some attractive agreement
can be sculpted. In recent weeks, the Chinese reversed the hostile rhetoric
of the late winter and promised yet again to crack down on factories that
pirate software and other intellectual property. There are pledges also
to stop trading missile technology with Pakistan and there even are soothing
words from Beijing about the future of Hong Kong, which China will absorb
in one year.<BR>
<BR>
	But there also are trouble signs ahead. American officials, including even
 such critics as Sen. Gorton, agree that trade issues should be separated
from human rights and military issues. But, as a practical matter, China's
human rights abuses in Tibet, the military pressures on Taiwan, government-directed
abortions, prison labor camps, secret shipments of guns into the US, and
threats to democracy in Hong Kong all play as discordant background music
that cannot be ignored and could disrupt the trade dance. <BR>
<BR>
	Hong Kong is an especially tense subject, since the Chinese takeover next
July will occur just after MFN arrives once again before Congress. If the
new Chinese authorities end up arresting Hong Kong's elected political leaders,
censoring the press and exposing the economy to the corruption that too
often characterizes the Chinese version of &quot;free markets,&quot; the
resulting turmoil will not be ignored by either public or official opinion
in the West. The chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, Martin Lee,
in a whirlwind North American tour two months ago (60 speeches in 13 days)
was an effective proponent of MFN for China as well as a critic of Chinese
threats against Hong Kong. Lee in jail, however, would be a powerful symbol
against an attempt to adopt MFN, let alone make it permanent.<BR>
<BR>
	This confusion on the horizon of 1997 actually makes Sen. Gorton's Cassandra-like
warnings potentially very useful. Forgoing sentimentality, he demands that
Americans look with realism at the trade picture, not as it might be, but
as experience has shown it.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Five years ago our trade deficit with China,&quot; he reports, &quot;was
$12.7 billion. Now it is $33.8 billion....Will we never learn?...What has
the 'engagement' of the past five years accomplished to cause us to parrot
today the very arguments that have so signally failed in the past?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Will his fellow members of Congress and the Clinton Administration simply
ignore this warning? Perhaps. But if they do so, the present opposition
to China, which is found only in minorities of the two political parties,
some human rights groups and a fraction of the business community, will
grow. Under that pressure, our relations with China may muddle through,
as they have, but they will not flourish. Already the US is less evident
in investment in China than are our western trade rivals and Japan.<BR>
<BR>
	The constructive alternative is for Congress and the White House to use
the months ahead to examine and update the full range of trade and foreign
policy tools--other than denying MFN--that can be used to influence China.
Expanding current agreements on intellectual property offers one example.
Finding ways to get China to adhere to international trade standards as
a price for admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is another.
Yet another is helping the Chinese to see that their current rapid economic
growth cannot be sustained much longer without large private investment
from the west, and that such loans absolutely require a more predictable
legal system. <BR>
<BR>
	In time, it may indeed become possible to abandon the demeaning annual
MFN drill. Meanwhile, the challenge of China policy fairly cries out for
more consultation and creative diplomacy in the councils of the West. The
year ahead is crucial to that purpose.<BR>

The Issues Behind Filegate; It's Not Just a &quot;Bureaucratic Snafu&quot;</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="21" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" 
ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </CENTER>
</H3>
If illegal use of confidential FBI files is proven, Filegate will most resemble
that part of Watergate wherein White House zeal to dig up dirt on others
led to dirty practices--and genuine scandal.<BR>
<BR>
No one familiar with the White House pass system could believe that &quot;Project
Update&quot; was merely concerned with reviewing 407 FBI files of former
presidents' aides to see if they still merited passes. That transparently
false explanation is even more suggestive of a cover-up than the reluctance
of the White House to provide Congress with evidence of the affair. <BR>
<BR>
Who among former employees ordinarily would be entitled to a White House
pass? The answer is simple: no one. As a Deputy Assistant to President Reagan
in the mid-'80's I knew very well that the day after I left the payroll
I would merit clearance only on a visit-by-visit basis, and only then with
a current pass holding staffer to vouch for me. It did not matter if I still
knew the Secret Service guards or they remembered me. It didn't matter if
I was still in the same Administration, serving in a departmental position.
I had no right to a White House pass. If there were a few exceptions to
this rule, they were close family members and personal advisers of the incumbent
president.<BR>
<BR>
So how could Craig Livingstone, director of security for President Clinton,
pretend that he wanted to check the FBI files of employees of former Administrations
to see which ones should be given passes? Again the answer is simple, he
couldn't. His explanation is bogus. (Can't you just see old Reagan and Bush
aides given free rein to roam the West Wing, parking their wingtips in the
Roosevelt Room and schmoozing George Stephanopolous in the Mess?) Coming
from a security chief who at the time had given passes to many of his own
White House colleagues without ever putting them through an FBI clearance--a
record of delay and laxity unmatched by any previous Administration--the
whole story is offensive as well as ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
It is far more plausible that the former employees whose private files were
ordered from the FBI were improper targets of White House opposition research.
Out of curiosity, I sent for a copy of the list to see if I was on it. I
wasn't. But there was the name of my deputy in the White House, Tony Blankley.
Why would the file of the deputy director of the Office of Planning and
Evaluation be sought and not his superior's? Could it possibly be because
Mr. Blankley had become Press Secretary to Newt Gingrich, an Administration
critic? Other people on the list are now leaders of Congressional staffs
with direct oversight on White House activities. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the names on the list, it is true, are hard to assign any obvious
purpose. Former Chief of Staff (and later Secretary of State) Jim Baker
is often cited as such a case. Yet, think: in 1993, when the list was first
collected, Baker's name was a lot more interesting, for at that time he
was talking about running for President in 1996.<BR>
<BR>
So the White House assertion that the file acquisitions was just a &quot;bureaucratic
snafu&quot; does not meet the laugh test. <BR>
<BR>
The next line of defense for Administration apologists is, &quot;So what?&quot;
After all, why should former officials worry about their past being known
unless they have something to hide?<BR>
<BR>
In truth, they have a lot to worry about, starting with the danger of anonymous
and false accusations being promoted by people in official positions. In
most arenas of life, malicious rumors can be confronted in the public forum.
We see it all the time in lawsuits and political campaigns. But compilation
of an FBI file does not take place in the open. <BR>
<BR>
An FBI background security check routinely is ordered for people under consideration
for service in the White House or for appointment to a department post that
requires confirmation by the Senate. Some lesser positions also require
FBI checks. By law, the information collected in the resulting FBI file
is confidential and meant only for review by the President, his personnel
staff and, in the case of a Senate confirmation, a few relevant senators
and their top committee aides.<BR>
<BR>
However, it is a popular misconception that FBI files necessarily are objective
and represent the FBI's own considered judgment. FBI agents seek out opinions
as well as facts, and often more from one's critics than from one's friends.
If someone accuses you of something, you don't have the right to know his
name, or, as a practical matter, the nature of the accusation. The agents
roll the whole pile--fact and possible fiction--into something that is meant
to be evaluated by the authorities making (or confirming) the appointment.
These authorities almost always behave with responsibility and common sense.<BR>
<BR>
Even so, misuse of FBI files occurs. From 1959, when President Eisenhower's
nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Admiral Lewis Strauss, was defeated on
trumped up charges, through every administration since, we have seen instances
where something that sounds like a conclusive evaluation, but isn't--&quot;an
FBI file&quot;--is leaked, and a nominee or office-holder is smeared.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine that you were under consideration for a presidential appointment
and you knew that your views might incite foes to say false or distorted
things about you to the FBI, and that you ran at least a small risk that
your file might be misued by persons unknown to prevent your appointment.
It would be a disincentive to serve, wouldn't it?<BR>
<BR>
Grim as that prospect looms, now imagine you also learned that years later,
staffers in some future White House could get a hold of your unprocessed
FBI file and make whatever public or private use of it they wanted--without
your approval or knowledge and without connection to any legitimate official
purpose. That suggests why so-called &quot;Project Update&quot; was such
a stark perversion of security procedures. <BR>
<BR>
There are, indeed, &quot;bureaucratic snafus&quot; that mitigate government
&quot;mistakes.&quot; This doesn't seem to be one of them. It looks more
like an assault on privacy and due process, and more broadly, on the trust
that supports representative democracy. It fully warrants the investigation
it is getting.<BR>

<BR>
Congress Should Seek Out Sources of Worsening Military Morale</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>
<P>	Turf  battles and budget cuts always stir anxieties in the military,
 but recent signs of damaged morale in the officer corps  suggest worrisome
trouble from more unusual sources. At some point the fighting ability of
the military--its reason for existence--may be impaired. Before that happens,
Congress should investigate the causes of the recent spate of  firings,
resignations, lawsuits, charges of &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and top officer
suicides that are afflicting the armed services.<BR>
<BR>
	A Congressional investigation almost surely would cast a light on the results
of President Clinton's political correctness policies and micro management,
 but it also would call into question the attitudes of some members of Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	For several years now the military has been treated as some kind of social
laboratory. A Tailhook Convention of Navy aviators five years ago included
a notorious party that provided the pretext for the puritanical reaction
that followed. Somehow, few of the guilty parties at  that event were found
and punished, but people who merely attended the same convention and were
involved in no misconduct have been permanently tarnished. So were superiors
and people tagged by remarks or actions in other situations that would have
had little or no consequences in a less hysterical atmosphere.  In all,
14 admirals have been relieved or retired. Literally dozens of other officers'
promotions have been held up by the Senate. This week, Secretary of Defense
William Perry himself finally called for an end to the Tailhook witch hunt.
<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, however, the Navy, and the services generally, are pinned down
by an arch-feminist fusillade of charges and policy demands. For example,
we now have reached a point, literally, where even unattributed and unsubstantiated
accusations of political incorrectness can wreck officers' careers, and
where failure of superiors to punish those so accused can bring them down,
too. This truly is McCarthyism.<BR>
<BR>
	According to the Center for Military Readiness, a Defense Department Instruction
(DoDI 1320.4) was issued last year that allows &quot;alleged adverse information&quot;
and &quot;unsubstantiated allegations&quot; to be placed in the files of
officers after they have been selected for promotion and before their confirmation.
Without the officers being informed, the possibly false charges can be circulated
to Pentagon brass, the White House and Congress.<BR>
<BR>
	If something similar happens to short-term political appointees, they,
at least, can use publicity and political connections to fight back. Military
officers, sworn to serve civilian leadership, are nearly immobilized. They
may  be subjected to unwarranted and devastating shame.<BR>
<BR>
	The recent suicide of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jeremy Boorda,
is almost by itself worthy of a Congressional investigation. Far more apparently
was involved than an approaching Newsweek article examining his right to
wear two &quot;V&quot; (for valor) devices on his  Vietnam campaign ribbons.
Boorda had been under pressure on one hand to push the Clinton political
correctness policies, while on the other he was incurring increasing  criticism
for failing to defend the honor of his officers and the effectiveness of
the service.<BR>
<BR>
	Among the critics was combat hero, author and former Navy Secretary Jim
Webb, who, in a speech at Annapolis revealed the &quot;disturbing statistic&quot;
that in the past year &quot;53 percent of the post-command Commanders in
naval aviation left the Navy rather than continue their careers...These
were the cream, the very future of the Navy, officers who had performed
for two decades in a manner that marked them as potential Admirals.&quot;
Rather than continue on a nominally  successful track, they are quitting,
Webb noted. <BR>
<BR>
	It's not just the Navy. A Coast Guard Captain, Ernie Blanchard, made a
speech at the Coast Guard Academy that included some weak humor that offended
some female cadets. Example: he said that his friend, the Commandant, was
so unsexy that on his wedding night, when he told his wife they could do
anything she wanted, she said she'd like to go to sleep. Was it funny? No.
Was it offensive? Well, it seemingly was so offensive that Capt. Blanchard
was forced to make a public apology. But that didn't end it. Feminists demanded
a court-martial, and the top brass went along. Blanchard, a life-time veteran
with a wife and two teen-aged daughters, was led to believe that he might
well be found guilty, and lose not only his job, but also his pension. Ruined--by
a joke--he, too, committed suicide. <BR>
<BR>
	In the Army, a recent  critical internal report on morale has not been
released to the media, but it has been described in the journal Military
Review as an assessment of &quot;anecdotal accounts&quot; indicating a growing
culture of mistrust and stifled initiative.<BR>
<BR>
	The Army report echoes a former Air Force pilot who  quit because of the
backbiting and division. &quot;It's a one-mistake military now,&quot; he
says, &quot;and the mistake doesn't even have to amount to anything much
or even be true.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	It cannot help morale, in this context, that the very President who has
visited many of the new rules upon the military is the same one who has
used his  status as Commander-in-Chief as a claim against prosecution in
a lawsuit for, of all things,  sexual harassment in the Paula Jones case.<BR>
<BR>
	Some service tension, as noted, would be expected anyway in an era of military
downsizing. The armed forces are now 1.4 million, compared to 13 million
at the height of World War II; yet we have just as many generals and admirals
as then. We are top-heavy. But demoralizing your officer class so that many
of your best people quit and many of the others live in quiet fear is  a
strange way to address the leadership issue. <BR>
<BR>
	Are these problems as serious as the news stories and &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot;
suggest? Why doesn't the Congress find out?<BR>

    <TITLE>A Clear US Foreign Policy</TITLE>

Converging Trends Demand a Clear US Foreign Policy</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I></B><HR></CENTER>
<P>Incrreasingly, it appears that the United States of America lacks a coherent
foreign policy.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, there are exceptions. We do have a clear (and bi-partisan) policy on
foreign trade, consisting primarily of promotion of free trade agreements
and pursuit of violators of those agreements. But what is American policy
on preventing nuclear non-proliferation? A recently published Defense Department
report on the topic is long on analysis, but blurred on policy ideas.<BR>
<BR>
What about international narcotics trafficking? The U.S. has been de-emphasizing
eradication and interdiction of drug supplies, without expressing any rationale
for this change beyond a desire to concentrate on domestic use, as if the
two concerns were mutually exclusive.<BR>
<BR>
What, in the current U.S. view, is the proper role of the United Nations?
Our policy is completely reactive, with the U.S. failing either to lead
reform or to pay our $1.5 billion bill. We cannot even come up with a candidate
for Secretary General.<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the massive issue of economic development in the less advanced
countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia, a key to peace and stability
in the 21st century. Are we for more government to government aid, or something
else, and if something else, what? <BR>
<BR>
Seven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, one still must ask, what
kind of life do we see for the former communist states--and what role do
we see ourselves playing in helping them to achieve it? <BR>
<BR>
Not for six decades--since 1936--has a presidential election year played
out with so little attention to international affairs. Regrettably, the
national Administration takes its leadership cues from polls and focus groups,
which, like the weather before a hurricane, give no sign of disturbance.
For the Clinton White House the significance of foreign policy pertains
mainly to domestic voter groups. If there is an American strategy anymore
it is a well-kept secret.<BR>
<BR>
In 1936, history shows, the United States courted disaster by ignoring war
threats in Europe and Asia. In 1996 we tempt fate again by not supporting
development of an anti-missile weapons system and by turning our military
into a social agency instead of a fighting force. On the day that an adversary
shows a capacity to infiltrate our defensive perimeter or to intimidate
one of our overseas bases--in Korea, for example--or simply starts a regional
nuclear war, it no longer will count for much here at home that the U.S.
military has been vigorous in implementing sensitivity training.<BR>
<BR>
But even if we could assume a benign world for American interests and the
cause of peace--and who will own up to such naivet&eacute;?--we still could
not avoid the reality that global opportunities, if not necessities, are
being slighted.<BR>
<BR>
Luck and past foreign policy successes have combined to bring the world
to a point of converging trends that Richard Judy, of the Hudson Institute,
identifies and which offer great potential benefits to this generation of
Americans. The most obvious is the globalization of the world's markets
for goods and services, a trend in which the U.S. is both an actor and acted
upon. To put this trend in perspective, exported goods and services in 1960
amounted to only 4.9 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. But last year
they came to 11 percent of GDP; and by 2010, they are expected to reach
35 percent. This trend alone is transforming our relative stake in international
relations.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps even more important is the globalization of capital markets, a trend
seemingly still unappreciated by many governments. &quot;Investors worldwide
are increasingly determined and able to seek the highest risk-adjusted returns
on their investments,&quot; Judy observes, and this freedom is coupled with
a staggering growth of private investments--through pension funds and other
sources--into economies world wide. Public investments in developing countries
now represent only a third of the total, having been surpassed in recent
years by private investments. Among the likely results are a closing range
of interest rates worldwide, international funding of more innovations in
products and services and a growing inability of national governments to
thwart the discipline of the free market.<BR>
<BR>
Coincident with these primarily economic trends are four others, according
to Judy:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of institutions,&quot; including law, representative
democracy as a normative goal and acceptance in principle that &quot;private
property (will prevail) as the basic form of asset ownership.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of technologies,&quot; whether in transportation,
materials science, medicine, or such softer fields as marketing and management.
<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of information,&quot; which proceeds in part
from the technological trend. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of culture.&quot; To a staggering degree, the
other trends of convergence support a long term change in value systems,
permitting gratified expectations of common commercial practices, language
(English), and even food availability and environmental standards. This
is also the trend with the most dangerous and explosive potential downside,
for most of the world--including even the USA--does not want to be homogenized
into some one-world culture-glob. In revolt against this trend come myriad
forms of paranoia and rebellion.<BR>
<BR>
These global trends, therefore, may be inevitable, but our success in shaping
them is not. It is folly for American officials to let public ignorance
of these developments determine government policy toward them. Whether from
peril or opportunity, foreign affairs is unavoidably domestic policy these
days and must be recognized as a higher priority in the national debate.
Where, we should be asking, do our political candidates stand?<BR>

    <TITLE>Campaign Finance Reform</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<P><BR>
	This summer the Congress is expected, finally, to take up the subject of
campaign finance reform. If you believe the interpretation put upon this
issue by most of the media and the permanent, self-designated &quot;reform&quot;
lobby, the only reason to oppose the proposals being made is the self-interest
of politicians and their major backers. But this simplistic view increasingly
is contradicted by the actual results of the reform measures we already
have adopted in the past 25 years.  In few other areas does the &quot;law
of unintended consequences&quot; operate so fiercely. <BR>
<BR>
	Most, though not all, campaign reform proposals in Washington, D.C., would
result in just the opposite of what reformers claim. They would reduce accountability
of politicians, increase the power of rich candidates and special interests,
decrease electoral competition and stifle the very free political speech
that the American Founders cared about most when they enshrined it  in the
First Amendment.<BR>
<BR>
	Arguably, we need more money in politics, not less, and more people giving,
not fewer, and that to protect free political speech, we need less government
regulation, not more.<BR>
<BR>
	Look at the Alice in Wonderland situation that has developed recently in
this year's presidential race. For the past couple of months, Bob Dole,
his poll numbers sagging, must have wondered why he ever agreed to accept
public matching money for his  presidential campaign. Under the law, a &quot;reform&quot;
measure of its time, Dole received federal matching grants from revenue
raised by the check-off account to which about 20 percent of the taxpayers
contribute on their income tax forms; but in return, he had to agree to
limit his campaign spending during the primary season. Now,  effectively
having secured the Republican nomination, he is only about $150,000 away
from his legal limit and the GOP convention is still months away. He cannot
legally raise and spend campaign dollars until after the Republican convention.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Bill Clinton, who had no primary opposition, was able to husband
most of his millions in federal matching money and can campaign to his heart's
delight. In fact, as an incumbent president he already enjoys enormous advantages,
garnering campaign-like publicity while simply performing as president.
At the same time, his allies in the AFL-CIO, who are able to operate outside
the campaign laws, are spending $35 million to defeat Dole and the Republicans.
The Democratic Party has been similarly focused all spring, placing TV ads
in crucial election states. The cumulative effect on Dole's numbers could
not have been good.<BR>
<BR>
	Dole is left now with the option of using the resources of the Republican
party, but even there he has to be careful. The Republican National Committee
plans to spend $20 million to boost its cause before the party convention,
but the White House and the Democratic party's lawyers are watching to see
if, for example, Dole or other Republicans at party-sponsored events target
Bill Clinton by name in a way that will allow a campaign ethics charge to
be lodged with the Federal Elections Commission. Both parties at this point
can talk about &quot;issues,&quot; the law appears to say, but cannot explicitly
support their candidate's election. On either this ground or the likelihood
of &quot;overspending,&quot; Dole could find himself in another of our country's
synthetic &quot;scandals,&quot; and a defendant before the Federal Elections
Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	Thus we see in this one situation, the potential for absurdity in modern
campaign &quot;reform&quot; legislation. One of the major party candidates
is nearly incapacitated and tempted to technical error by the rigidity of
federal law--in a dilemma not anticipated years ago by reformers. The parties
themselves can campaign, but only if they pretend otherwise. The special
interests, however, including besides the AFL-CIO,  a host of powers, such
as the National Rifle Association, the National Chamber of Commerce, the
trial lawyers and the pro-and anti-abortion groups, can spend unlimited
funds free of public scrutiny--so long as they don't use explicit words
urging a vote for their preferred candidates. And billionaire Ross Perot
(who claims to be a reformer, of all things) can spend as much as he likes,
and say whatever he likes, so long as he spends his own money.  Ralph Nader,
another potential third party presidential candidate who  claims &quot;reform&quot;
credentials, indicates that he may not release his income tax return, since
where he gets his money  is nobody's business.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Reform,&quot; you see, is for other people. For oneself it increasingly
is mostly a dandy way to get the tactical upper hand over one's ideological
foes. Specifically, it is a means to handicap accountable political parties
to the benefit of unaccountable special interests, to handicap challengers
to the benefit of incumbents, and to enable personally rich candidates to
place their competition at a disadvantage. At least, that is the way it
is working out.<BR>
<BR>
	Twenty five years ago, when the post-Watergate Federal Elections Campaign
Act was adopted, the Supreme Court  (in Buckley v. Valeo) allowed the law's
limits on contributions (a $1000 amount in federal elections that has never
been adjusted for inflation), but cited First Amendment free speech objections
to permit limits on spending for wealthy candidates, special interest groups
or candidates who decline to accept federal matching money in presidential
races. <BR>
<BR>
	On their own terms, therefore, the reformers wound up with  a lopsided
system that is shot through with unfair exceptions and contradictions. And
the results show it. Though reformers sought lower cost campaigns, campaign
spending levels, in constant dollars, have gone up threefold. The incumbency
advantage actually increased after the post-Watergate reforms were enacted;
even in 1994, 91.4 percent of incumbents who sought re-election were successful.
Where reformers wanted to reduce the influence of special interests, they
failed spectacularly. The best example is the creation of political action
committees (PACs) that collect voluntary contributions in a given industry
or civic organization. This was originally a  reform meant to replace straightforward
corporate support of candidates. Now the PACs themselves are under attack.
<BR>
<BR>
	Even if the Supreme Court had accepted the full dose of reform medicine
first advanced in law--controlling expenditures as well as contributions--we
probably would have been disappointed by the consequences. As Larry J. Sabato,
a campaign finance expert at the University of Virginia, has written, &quot;One
cannot dam the flow of political money in a society as free as ours. If
it's blocked in one area, it will simply find other channels...These alternative
means of influence are often obscured and unaccountable, eliminating visible
disclosure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, Sabato's reality check runs directly contrary to what reformers
and much of the public believe to be the case. They always imagine that
good clean election campaigns are right around the corner, if only we pass
a few more regulations. What we forget is the &quot;law of unintended consequences.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Take the &quot;Bi-partisan Clean Congress Act&quot; introduced in the U.S.
House by Republican Rep. Linda Smith of southwest Washington,  and several
other legislators--Rep. Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) and Rep. Chris Shays, (R-Conn.)--with
strong support from the permanent reform lobby, including Common Cause,
the League of Women Voters, Ross Perot and most of the liberal media (the
latter have lionized Rep. Smith, though they oppose nearly every other political
view she holds). This bill would ban PACs, curb out-of-state contributions
to Congressional candidates, and further limit spending by the political
parties. A companion measure in the Senate, sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson
(R-Tenn.), John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-Minn.), would seek to
convince candidates to limit spending voluntarily by offering them free
or reduced TV advertising time and government-financed mailings, and penalizing
those who do not go along by giving their opponents even more government
campaign support. The Senate bill also would expand further the regulatory
powers of the Federal Elections Commission.<BR>
<BR>
	You can't blame them for trying. But how would it work out? Linda Smith
ran last time against an incumbent, Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, who received a
lot of out-of-state money and outspent Mrs. Smith, then the challenger,
two to one. But Linda Smith, a leading power among segments of the religious
right, had a well-organized power base that raised enough money to enable
her to get her message out. It would make political sense for her now, as
an incumbent, to entrench this advantage by limiting out-of-state contributions
and providing overall spending caps.<BR>
<BR>
	But consider the case of Rep. George Nethercutt of Spokane. As a challenger
in 1994 and facing mighty Speaker of the House Tom Foley, he found initial
fundraising very difficult. Even local Republicans were afraid of offending
a powerful incumbent Democrat. Nethercutt was a challenger who required
out-of-state support to get enough traction to make his race credible. <BR>
<BR>
	Thus, whether out-of-state contributions hurt or help incumbents depends
a great deal on the circumstances of a particular race. And the same goes
for efforts to keep a lid on personal spending. A challenger's only hope
against a well-known incumbent, especially if that officeholder enjoys media
 support, is to raise a large enough war chest to get his message out on
his own.  Says Bradley A. Smith, who teaches election law at Capital University
in Ohio, &quot;What is important is not who outspends whom, but that the
challenger spends enough to stimulate voter interest in the race...Efforts
to cap spending help entrench incumbents and so foster public frustration
with the system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
	The same also is true of contribution limits.  Little-known challengers
need to  raise large sums early if they  hope to win, and they usually cannot
raise such sums without getting large contributions from a few family members
and close friends. Contribution limits like those in the Smith and McCain
bills mainly help incumbents, people (like Smith) with an already organized
donor base, and the personally wealthy, who can contribute all they want.
One person's &quot;reform&quot; is thus another's restraint on fair competition
and voter choice.<BR>
<BR>
	A major flaw with the thinking of most reformers is the idea that there
is too much money in political campaigns now.  As Bradley Smith points out,
the total spent on all Congressional races in 1994, including primaries,
was $600 million, less than half the annual advertising budget of General
Motors, or about $3 per eligible voter--the amount of a video rental. It
is also false to think that the amount of money spent on campaigns is responsible
for  &quot;negative&quot; campaigning and attack ads on TV. There is no
evidence for this, nor for the conventional impression that expensive campaigns
always prevail. If the complaint is based on false assumptions, therefore,
it is not surprising that that it has bad consequences.<BR>
<BR>
	If we can all agree that we want ample political competition to assure
the voters choices, adequate airing of issues to provide voter's information
for making those choices and prevention of hidden influences, then a better
kind of reform might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
	First, raise the limit on personal contributions. In truth, there probably
should be no limit, so long as the money is disclosed. Personal donations
are far more disinterested than those of PACs, let alone the soft money
spending of special interests, that goes unreported.  Contribution limits
for individual donors have tilted the playing field to millionaires and
billionaires, who by court ruling, are burdened with no such restrictions.
As a compromise, at least raise the present contribution limit enough to
take account of 25 years of inflation; i.e., to $5,000.<BR>
<BR>
	Second, don't weaken the political parties, strengthen them. It is ridiculous
to try to limit or curtail their spending . They are the proper and historical
home of politics and the institutions of democracy that are most regulated
by political disclosure laws--in contrast to the court-protected  unions,
industry associations and special interest advocacy groups. Fortunately,
a Colorado case is about to be decided which could determine that money
parties spend on their candidates constitute an &quot;expenditure&quot;
under the law, not a &quot;contribution,&quot; and therefore, they, too,
are covered by the First Amendment's free speech clause. <BR>
<BR>
	Indeed, in Washington State, as a result of Initiative 134, we already
have reached a similar conclusion.<BR>
<BR>
	Third, if we are going to have strict disclosure laws, they should be applied
to special interest groups--including the reformer's own organizations--that
lobby the public on political issues.<BR>
<BR>
	Fourth, instead of trying to shrink spending on politics, which is wrongheaded,
and futile in any case, stimulate the ordinary citizen to participate more.
Nothing would go farther to liberate citizen politicians than expanded support
in the form of citizen campaign contributions. We can do this by offering
a tax deduction for all contributions up to the legal limit and a tax credit
for all those below a set figure; say, $50. Parties should be included,
as well as candidates.<BR>
<BR>
	Fifth, if the above is accomplished, it then would not hurt to limit PACs
further, and it will not be necessary to turn eventually to direct public
finance of political reform.<BR>
<BR>
	This kind of program suggestion is not unique. Variations of it recently
have been embraced by groups and individuals as diverse as the libertarian
CATO Institute and the liberal Center for the Study of the American Electorate,
Speaker Newt Gingrich and liberal columnist David Broder, the conservative
Wall Street Journal and the liberal Roll Call. They all have seen that what
we need now is not another round of reform, but, if you will, a reform of
the reforms already in place.<BR>
<BR>
	 Political freedom, after all,  is really an analog to economic freedom,
as well as its natural companion. Just as over-regulation can stifle the
economy and lead to government control, so too can over-regulation of politics.
Our object, therefore, should be to increase competition and free speech
in the political process.<BR>

A Cheaper, Surer Way to Fund and Build Public Projects</CENTER>
</H1>

<BR>
<BR>
<B>How are we going to pay for it all?</B> Isn't there any way to lower
the costs? These are the plaintive cries of taxpayers around the country
as their local and state elected officials try to cajole them into supporting
a growing list of infrastructure projects.<BR>
<BR>
But even as the list grows, taxpayer tolerance for big ticket public works
is declining. In Seattle, for example, where voters this week passed (turned
down) a $50 million bond measure to help build the &quot;Commons&quot;park
near the downtown, wary but resolute city officials are expected to ask
soon for a new central library, expansion of the waterfront aquarium, improvements
to parks and roads, new courts and police stations. With previously approved
bond issues and City Council votes, Seattle expects to lay out $660 million
for capital projects in the next six years, a figure that doesn't include
projects by school districts, the separately financed, and largely self-supporting
water and light departments, or the port authority. The Port of Seattle
alone, for example, has $1.6 billion of projects scheduled for the next
six years.<BR>
<BR>
King County and its neighboring counties in Puget Sound, and the State of
Washington, meanwhile, have even bigger capital plans--some slated for action,
some just a fond wish-- including a convention center expansion, two sports
stadia, a several billion dollar rapid transit system (headed for a vote
in the fall), an environmental greenway between Seattle and the Cascade
mountains to the East, and literally untold billions in freeway and bridge
construction. Statewide, transportation infrastructure needs alone have
been estimated at $20.8 billion in the next quarter century.<BR>
<BR>
It would be an exaggeration to say that voters are either fed up or exhausted
by the large construction agenda ahead, perhaps because they are only dimly
aware of how big it is. But, if voters have not shown themselves angry,
they clearly are impatient and highly selective. Part of their reluctance
is probably based on a sense that taxes at all levels are too high. Another
part is surely due to a concern that they can see no strategy or priority
evident in all this capital planning, and too little coordination among
governmental units.<BR>
<BR>
But there also could well be some frustration that the costs of these projects
are simply too high--that taxpayers are not getting their money's worth.
Past legislation meant to prevent corruption and to assure environmental
protection has contributed to delays and higher overhead costs. However,
also contributing has been the very nature of government, where typically
the group that spends the money is different from that which plans how to
spend it and is always different from those whose money is spent.<BR>
<BR>
The usual pattern (to oversimplify for the sake of brevity) is that government
decides to build, say, a prison, then hires a design team to plan it, and
then lets it out for competitive construction bids. Once the low bidder
is selected, the construction project gets underway. Soon enough, it seems,
cost over-runs are noted. More money must be found. Even some projects that
come in nominally under budget were unnecessarily expensive in the first
place. The design team, having no responsibility for balancing all elements,
including likely operating and maintenance costs, may &quot;gold plate,&quot;
or over-engineer, the design and make high price tags inevitable.<BR>
<BR>
At least, that is the charge laid against the present system by advocates
of various alternative approaches. Some are promoting privatization of construction,
wherein, say, a jail or prison will be built and managed by a private company.
Nationally, there were 88 of these secure adult facilities under construction
by the end of 1994, according the National Center for Policy Analysis. A
1991 study in Texas that found that costs for four prisons were reduced
14.4 percent by private building and management. An Australian report in
1994 found a 20 percent saving in a similar situation.<BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;design/build&quot; is used for some such projects, and &quot;design/build/operate&quot;
for ones that take the private theme still further. In the latter category
is a new project by the City of Seattle to develop a water filtration plant
along the Tolt River. But the money is still the public's and so is the
ownership. <BR>
<BR>
This brings us to a visionary approach to public projects that has been
pioneered in England, the so-called Private Initiative Project (PFI). The
PFI has changed the very concept of government's role from providing services
as an owner to procuring them as a customer. An entire project--say, a prison,
to go back to the example used before--is designed, financed, built, operated
and owned by a private concern which then, per agreement, sells its services--correctional
services, per inmate, in this case--to the government. The private concern
technically owns the project and sells services to the government, which
is spared any cash expenditure up front and pays fixed operating expenses
over a long period, such as 30 years. The government's short term role is
to decide what correctional services it wants in the first place--technically,
the values and performance standards it expects of a well-run prison, and
the risks it wants to insure against--and then to ask for worldwide bids
to design the project on that basis.<BR>
<BR>
It is in the design process that the English have found that the most money
can be saved; not because that process represents much expense itself, but
because the quality of the design determines the ultimate costs of the project
as a whole. With the full range of private sector expertise available to
companies -- and consortia of companies -- involved in bidding the project,
various cost controls, revenue streams and financing are offered to a public
authority. Then the winning team bids out the construction, also worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
The result in Britain over the past few years has been a steep increase
in Public Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, which now amount to $28 billion,
for roads, transit, prisons, hospitals, schools, libraries, government offices,
and much else. Thanks to the wide expertise available to private consortia,
their ability to integrate their work, and the freedom they enjoy as owners
to create innovative solutions, they are able to bring in projects at an
expense 20 to 30 percent lower than those of comparable public projects.<BR>
<BR>
In the past couple of months, Douglas Hogg, who heads the PFI, and Jonathan
Hugget, an associate from Vancouver, B.C. where this idea presently is being
aired, have visited Seattle to meet with a few local business and governmental
leaders who have expressed interest in the concept. The hope on all sides
is that we might be able to learn from their experiences. Britain, Canada
and the US all have differences in the way public development is governed
today. In particular, we enjoy the benefits of tax exempt bonds for public
works, which gives our public approach an advantage over almost any private
one. Nonetheless, the advantage may not be conclusive and, in any event,
the PFI concept may be adaptable to our particular circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
When a half dozen Seattle bond attorneys and public finance analysts vetted
the Public Finance Initiative idea last week, they concluded that potential
benefits definitely warrant further investigation. <BR>
<BR>
They noted that the English also might have something to teach us about
handling the politics of this form of privatization. In the UK, the Conservative
Party initiated the Public Finance Initiative and are especially pleased
that it saves money, while the Labor Party backs it because its savings
in overhead costs result in more money available for construction jobs.
The tough job initially was persuading the bureaucracy. The Brits were courageous
enough to take on that daunting challenge. Are we?<BR>

    <TITLE>A new social contract</TITLE>

<H1><CENTER>A New Social Contract for America</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
	We probably all know that costs  of entitlements are the main source of
federal budget deficits, and the problem is destined to get dangerously
worse as the Baby Boom generation ages. We all know, too, that ordinary
families--especially the young--are having a hard time saving independently
for their old age. And, we all know that elderly voters, as a group, are
easily convinced that any perceived reductions in these programs are unfair.
Less widely recognized is that younger voters are waking up to this issue;
witness recent university student council resolutions protesting the grim
future of Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
	The solutions we hear from government usually involve little more than
reduced benefits and raised taxes. But the futility of this approach, especially
for Social Security,  is evident from just one statistic. In 1945 there
were 20 American workers to support each Social Security recipient. Today
the figure is 3.1 workers per recipient. By 2030, as today's children reach
middle age, there will be fewer than two workers for each beneficiary. <BR>
<BR>
	Sharp benefit cutbacks of roughly 40 percent and payroll tax hikes from
15.3 percent to 15.7 percent will be needed in a few years to maintain the
solvency of Social Security, but they will devastate workers and retirees
alike. The entitlement programs themselves are thus becoming a source of
poverty and social insecurity  in this country.<BR>
<BR>
	Fortunately,  there is an exciting, win/win strategy for solving the Social
Security problem, at least, and it is beginning to attract broad, bi-partisan
support. The most responsible thing the two presidential candidates can
do about it this political campaign year is to agree to consider it seriously
next January, when there will be less temptation to demagogue.<BR>
<BR>
	But the public needs to start discussing the idea right away, because this
solution--using the private sector to rescue Social Security--no longer
will  be possible in a few years, once the Baby Boomers themselves have
retired. Action is needed in the next couple of years.<BR>
<BR>
	There are now several plans out to use capitalism and the &quot;miracle
of compound interest&quot; to provide a brighter future for American workers.
The libertarian Cato Institute has one, and so does Martin Feldstein, Harvard
professor and former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic
Advisers. Republicans, naturally, tend to like the idea.  Steve Forbes elicited
cheers when he embraced the idea at the University of Arizona debate during
the presidential primary season. A similar program, many point out, already
works spectacularly in Chile.<BR>
<BR>
	But one of the first and most carefully researched American plans is that
of a former Democratic candidate for Senate from Delaware, Sam Beard, founder
of the National Development Council that has helped create inner-city jobs
under four presidents of both parties, organizer of the Jefferson Awards
for community service, a fellow of the Discovery Institute in Seattle--and,
most importantly, author of a new book, &quot;Restoring Hope in America:
The Social Security Solution&quot; (ICS Press, San Francisco).  Beard's
first post-publication address will be  in Seattle next Tuesday, May 14,
at 7 p.m. in the University of Washington's Kane Hall Room 220, co-sponsored
by Discovery Institute, The Seattle P.I. and the UW Graduate School of Public
Affairs.<BR>
<BR>
	I was introduced to Sam Beard about a year and a half ago by the P.I's
publisher, J.D. Alexander, and immediately saw in him the classic example
of the enterprising generalist seized with a life-changing big idea.<BR>
<BR>
	Under Beard's plan, present Social Security recipients would receive exactly
what they have been promised, and those approaching retirement also would
stay part of the plan we have now--guaranteed. But young people just starting
out in the workforce would be given the opportunity to put their Social
Security taxes to work in investment funds in the private market, much as
regular mutual funds and annuity programs operate. The government's role
would be to allocate each taxpayer's money to the fund he or she selected
and to make certain that the funds are organized in a sound manner. Workers
in the middle-age brackets (such as Baby Boomers) could mix their forms
of participation, partially paying into the present system and partially
investing in the new Social Security investment funds. <BR>
<BR>
	The plan works because the private sector is so much more productive than
the public sector, which, in any case, does not invest its Social Security
funds, but spends them as they come in on other government priorities. (What
we have today is a great chain letter scheme that would be illegal in the
private sector.) The Beard plan also will work because the huge Baby Boom
generation presently--and for the next few years--is pumping into the government
far more than the older generation of recipients is taking out. Under the
&quot;Restoring Hope&quot; plan, that surplus will be invested rather than
squandered on other programs. A one-time, long term and, of course, voluntary,
bond program for better-off taxpayers will cover the budgetary shortfall
caused by the government's shift of Social Security money that it is &quot;borrowing&quot;
now back into the Social Security program for which it was intended.<BR>
<BR>
	What this plan offers the elderly is just what they have, without danger
of later cutbacks. What it offers the young is hope for a secure old age:
roughly 50 percent more money annually than from the present system, or
twice as much if they choose to treat the program as an annuity. For a $30,000
a year wage-earner,  after 45 years, this would come to $18, 424 a year,
versus $13,710 under Social Security (all of this is in constant dollars).
Capital of roughly $368,486 could be passed along to heirs. Alternatively,
the recipient could use his accumulation as an annuity, raising his annual
receipt to $29,256. <BR>
<BR>
	Knowing that they are accumulating real savings and that these funds are
working away in the private sector will give all wage earners an investment
in the future of the overall economy, a stake most presently lack.  What
it offers the country as a whole is a huge increase in the savings rate
and a brake on inflation and interest rates. No wonder it has won praise
from  sources as varied as William F. Buckley and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,
and from both Democratic Sen. Robert Kerry of Nebraska and Republican Sen.
Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, co-chairmen of the Social Security Commission.
<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Restoring Hope in America&quot; is nothing less than a new social
contract, a chance to unite rather than divide us, to heal generational
and class differences rather than increase them. It is the program of shared
economic growth and security that we badly need.<BR>

The PR Man Who Made Seattle a Great City</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
	When you get a copy of the Seattle Arts Commission's Directory of Public
Art, you will see listings of statues to Christopher Columbus, Leif Erikson
and Dr. Jose Rizal, the hero of the Philippines. But we barely manage one
statue and a copper bust of Chief Seattle and a mere artistic &quot;silhouette&quot;
for the local pioneers Arthur Denny and David &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard (at
the Pioneer Square Metro stop).  And even as we prepare for next year's
100th anniversary of the Klondike Gold Rush, you will see no mention of
a statue--neither silhouette nor bas relief  --to honor the person who did
the most to establish Seattle as a world class city, Erastus Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	He is not in school history books (how would they know what to make of
him?), but he surely was one of the world's greatest public relations men,
and the first of a long line of such conjurers in Seattle. The very fact
that Seattle has reason to celebrate the Klondike Gold Rush at all, and
enjoys the excellent gold rush museum operated by the U. S. Park Service
across from Occidental Park, is due largely to the talents and gall of Erastus
Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd, above all, who saw what the arrival in Seattle of a &quot;ton
of gold&quot; on the S.S. Portland in the summer of 1897 could mean for
its happenstance destination. The newly discovered gold fields in Dawson
City were some 1600 miles away in the Yukon Territory of Canada, but you
had to get there from somewhere on the West Coast. Vancouver and Victoria
were actually closer than Seattle. Tacoma and Portland were nearly as handy,
and San Francisco was bigger and better known. But Brainerd and his committee
 at the Chamber of Commerce persuaded the world that Seattle was the gateway
to the Yukon, and later Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
	The miners came here, it was said, and we mined the miners. Outfitting
stores were built, the ancestors of today's recreation equipment businesses,
shipping lines were founded, food distributors set up. A federal Assay Office
was established so that gold could be turned into U.S. currency. By 1911
Seattle had grown from a population of 65,000 to over 250,000 and was organizing
another public relations success, the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Brainerd's
public relations engineered a self-fulfilling boom and truly put Seattle
on the world map.<BR>
<BR>
	It would be nice to imagine that Brainerd achieved all this simply by sending
out a few new-fangled telegrams. But the campaign was far more extensive,
aggressive, and wily, if not deceitful. The historian Murray Morgan describes
how Brainerd &quot;wrote articles for national magazines, planted quotes
from the articles with the wire services, then used extracts from the wire
stories in advertisements which proclaimed Seattle the Emporium to the Klondike.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Other northwest cities tried to use the wire services, too, but Brainerd
sent corrections to the papers, which got printed, and provided form letters
for newcomers to Seattle to write  letters to the editors of their former
hometown papers. He used State of Washington stationery to write to mayors
and governors around the country, and to foreigners, asking how many prospectors
they expected to be heading to Seattle en route to the gold fields. Ostensibly,
Seattle wanted to prepare for all the visitors, but the effort was just
another way of leaving  the impression that Seattle was, indeed, the gateway
to the Klondike.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd took out ads in The New York Journal, Cosmopolitan, Century, McClure's
and other magazines of the day, had the state Secretary of State print a
guide to Klondike prospectors that, naturally, routed them through Seattle,
and sent the folders to libraries all over the world. It also was Brainerd
who went around the Director of the U.S. Mint to get the assay office opened;
he did it by  enlisting a Pennsylvania Congressman--the brother of a Seattle
businessman--in getting a special law passed.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd himself deserves, but lacks, a biography. We know he was born
in Connecticut in 1855, graduated from Harvard College, married and had
two children,  and was a practicing journalist in the East until 1890. At
the start of the gold rush he was, of all thing, Paraguayan Consul in Seattle.
For a while after his successful gold rush publicity campaign he tried his
own luck in the Klondike, as a mining consultant--a mistake. Returning to
Seattle in 1904 he became editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  He
was active in the Republican Party and later wrote a five volume history
of great artists, and another book on &quot;Alaska and the Klondyke.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Over the decades, Brainerd has been followed by a fabulous string of civic
leaders and PR promoters--from the people who organized the early civic
&quot;Potlatch&quot; events to those who started Seafair, from the creators
of the Century 21 World's Fair to those trying now to bring the  Olympic
Games to Seattle in 2008. <BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd who made Seattle big and rich and confident, but he himself
never cashed in. The final years of his life were spent in a mental hospital,
where he died Christmas Day, 1922, at age 67. <BR>
	We ought to put up a statue to Erastus Brainerd.<BR>

<i>The New York Times</i> calls Linda Chavez "an influential voice on civil rights policy." <i>The Washington Post</I> describes her as one of "a new generation of intellectuals [seeking] to question the orthodoxies of the civil rights establishment" 
 <P>
Chavez is President of the Center for Equal Opportunity, based in Washington. She is the author of <I>Out of 
the Barrio: Toward a New Politics of Hispanic Assimilation</i> (Basic Books, 1991) which chronicles the 
untold story of Hispanic progress and achievement and addresses the implications of bilingual education, voting rights, immigration, and Affirmative action. The Denver Post said that this book "should explode the stereotypes about Hispanics that have clouded the minds of patronizing liberals and xenophobic conservatives alike." 
 <P>
Many know Chavez from her weekly column in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, which appears each Wednesday. She writes often for many other publications, including the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>The New Republic, Commentary</i>, and <i>Crisis</i>. She also makes regular appearances on "The McLaughlin Group," "To the Contrary," "CNN & Co.," "Equal Time " and "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour." 
 <P>
Chavez has held a number of political positions, among them <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> Director of Public Liaison (1985) and Director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1983-85). She won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator from Maryland (1986), but lost in the general election. Before that, Chavez 
was editor of the prizewinning quarterly journal of the American Federation of Teachers, <i>American Educator</I> (1977-83). She also serves as U.S. Expert on the United Nations Subcommission on Human 
Rights. 
 <P>
Chavez is currently at work on her second book, <i>A House Divided: Race and the Politics of Multiculturalism</I>.

<title>Linda Chavez: Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway -- December 11, 1996</title>

<i>December 11, 1996</i><br>     
<h2>Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd><I>BETHESDA, Md.</I> - Maybe California voters ought to stay home next election. In some quarters their votes don't count anyway. 
<P>
<dd>Two years ago, a federal judge stopped the state from enforcing a measure which denied welfare to illegal aliens approved by 60% of California's electorate.  This year on election night, the television networks declared the victor in the presidential election before the polls closed on the West Coast.  And last week, a federal judge overruled a majority of California voters who voted Nov. 5 to end race- and sex-based preferences in state programs. 
<P>
<dd>This latest affront is the most galling, however, because it so grossly insults the intelligence and the decency of the voters. At issue is a ballot measure adopted by 54.5% of the electorate, Proposition 209, which banned both discrimination and preference on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or ethnicity in state employment, education and contracting.  The initiative was modeled on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination. Proponents of race- and sex-based preferences filed suit the morning after the election, alleging that the measure placed an unfair burden on minorities and women and thus violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee that all persons receive equal protection of the laws. 
<P>
<dd>How could a measure that explicitly prohibits discrimination be discriminatory? 
<P>
<dd>How could language that explicitly forbids giving any group preference on the basis of race or sex unfairly disadvantage minorities and women?  Easy, according to the judge who issued a temporary restraining order barring the state from enforcing Proposition 209.  "Courts must look beyond the plain language of an enactment," Judge Thelton E. Henderson declared.  But if we can't trust that the words of our laws mean what they actually say, the whole basis of the rule of law falls apart. Suddenly we are in a world in which a judge can say, like Humpty Dumpty in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, "When I use a word . . . it means just what I choose it to mean, nothing more or less."  All that matters, as Humpty tartly informed Alice, is "(who) is to be master." And lately in our democracy, judges have become masters of us all. 
<P>
<dd>In this case, the judge's own background casts doubt about his impartiality. Before he was appointed by President Carter in 1980, Judge Henderson practiced civil rights law in California and was on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, along with California Rural Legal Assistance, Equal Rights Advocates and
other liberal advocacy organizations. These groups have long argued that it is not discrimination to give preference to some groups so long as they are minorities or women. 
<P>
<dd>By this logic it is not discrimination when Asian and white students must have higher test scores and grades than blacks or Hispanics in order to be admitted to a top university. Discrimination is just what affirmative action proponents say, no more or less. Judge Henderson claims that Proposition 209 places an unfair burden on minorities and women by denying them the right "to petition their state and local officials for race- and gender-conscious programs aimed at remedying discrimination." In fact, most such programs are the result of executive and court orders, not legislative action, anyway. Supporters of affirmative action have been unwilling even to admit that they want preferential, not equal, treatment, much less to put a proposal for those programs to a vote. 
<P>
<dd>Nothing prevents supporters of racial preferences from doing what opponents did: putting their own initiative on the ballot and letting the people decide. They are unlikely to do so, however, because most voters believe that racial preferences are wrong, period. Unlike liberal judges and civil rights groups, most people don't imagine you can end discrimination against one group of people by practicing discrimination against another. Judge Henderson may have trouble interpreting the plain meaning of the Constitution's guarantee that "no state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." 
<P>
<dd>But most of the rest of us, including a majority of California voters, understand that to mean no discrimination and no preferences, just as Proposition 209 promises.

<title>Linda Chavez: Editors, reporters should disclose votes -- November 22, 1996</title>

<h2>Clinton should skip GOP, Arkansans and diversity</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>Administration officials are departing their jobs so rapidly since the election that you'd think the Republicans had won. 

Stepping down so far are the White House chief of staff and secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Energy and Transportation, plus the heads of the president's Council of Economic Advisers and the civil rights division in the Justice Department, to name only the most prominent. 
<dd>Second terms always produce turnover, often because the president wants it, but this mad rush for the door barely two weeks after the president won re-election is a bit unseemly. 
<dd>Whether motivated by fear that the administration will be bogged down in Whitewater and related investigations over the next couple of years or hamstrung in directing policy by the Republican Congress, the Clinton team started to bolt as soon as the ballots were counted. 
<dd>Now the president must spend the next few months trying to reassemble his players. 
<dd>Here are some tips for the president as he makes his picks: 
<ul>
<li>Forget bipartisanship. President Clinton has already announced he'd like to appoint a Republican to his Cabinet, but it's a bad idea for the president and any Republican who might be chosen.<p>Giving a post to a Republican would only further alienate congressional Democrats, and unless the president is thinking of switching parties himself, he'll need to hold his Democratic votes in the next Congress.<p>Besides, the public isn't really fooled when a president of one party picks political appointees of the other. Look at Ronald Reagan's most famous Democratic appointees: U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Education Secretary William Bennett.<p>Neither remained in the Democratic Party, and Kirkpatrick became most famous in political circles for referring to Democrats as the "blame-America-first" crowd. (I lasted almost two years as a Reagan Democrat while director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights but switched parties when I moved to the White House.)<p>
<li>Stop bean-counting. The president's obsession in 1993 with choosing a Cabinet that "looks like America" produced a series of embarrassing nominations that he had to abandon. Nonetheless, he's likely to repeat his mistakes if he listens to groups representing women and blacks, who have already been whining that the announced departures will leave the administration less diverse.<p>A coalition of women's organizations complained to Vice President Gore last week that although women gave the Clinton-Gore team a 17-point advantage in their votes, few women were being mentioned for top posts in the next term.<p>They were particularly exercised over remarks attributed to an "unnamed administration source" discounting Clinton U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright as a likely contender for Secretary of State.<p>But Albright probably isn't a good choice for State - and it has nothing to do with her sex. She's been a chief proponent of making U.N. peacekeeping/ peacemaking operations a priority for the Pentagon, as well as of expanding our efforts to include nation-building in places like Somalia and Haiti. With U.S. troops staying in Bosnia for at least another 18 months to promote more political stability, despite Clinton's original promises to have them out before the end of this year, the president would be well advised to avoid promoting to a senior foreign policy post someone who will focus attention on the mission creep in Bosnia. <p>
<li>Avoid naming anyone from Arkansas. Some of the president's most disastrous choices in his first term were political cronies and friends from Arkansas. Several of these left the administration in disgrace, including Hillary Clinton's former law partners Webster Hubbell (now serving time in federal prison for bilking clients) and William Kennedy. 
</ul>
<p>
The president can't afford any more scrutiny of his past dealings and relationships in Arkansas. He already has to worry about the likelihood of more indictments being handed down by the independent counsel investigating Whitewater, the pending Supreme Court hearing on Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit from his time as Arkansas governor, and new investigations into his Arkansas buddy John Huang, whose fund-raising efforts for the president may result in the appointment of yet another independent counsel. 
<dd>Good luck, Mr. President. You'll need it. So may the fools who rush into an administration where angels fear to tread.

<h2>Editors, reporters should disclose votes</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>BETHESDA, Md. - Whether Tuesday's election results make you mad or glad, there's one thing that should make you worry. 
<dd>One small but immensely powerful group of Americans influenced this election more than all the contributors to all political parties and candidates combined, but they don't have to disclose their influence or make public their political preferences. 
<dd>They are the linchpin of every election, the very source of nearly all the public's information. 
<dd>They are the newspaper, magazine, TV and radio reporters, editors and producers who bring you "the news." They are also arguably the most politically homogenous and biased group in American politics today. 
<dd>If past behavior is any indication, 9 out of 10 reporters and editors probably cast their votes for Bill Clinton and other Democratic candidates Tuesday. 
<dd>At least that's what most studies of voting behavior among the national media suggest, including one by the Freedom Forum last year that showed 89% of national correspondents, editors and writers voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. 
<dd>But voting bias doesn't necessarily prove reporting bias. It's at least theoretically possible that liberal reporters and editors were scrupulous in preventing their own personal bias from affecting their coverage of political issues and candidates during the election. 
<dd>Unfortunately, recent content analysis of TV news coverage indicates otherwise. 
<dd>A study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan Washington research group, shows that TV coverage overwhelmingly favored President Clinton this election season. 
<dd>In September, Clinton received 54% positive coverage on the networks' evening news programs, compared with only 30% for Bob Dole. 
<dd>The networks criticized Dole's economic views 81% of the time, his social policies 78%, and his conduct as a candidate 81%, according to the center. 
<dd>Ironically, Clinton's worst press in the early fall came when he signed the overwhelmingly popular welfare-reform bill, which the newscasts criticized in 90% of their stories, demonstrating that the media's liberal slant is even worse than their partisan prejudice. 
<dd>Perhaps that is one reason why, although voters think of the media as more liberal than conservative, they don't think the media are partisan Democrats. 
<dd>Can anything be done to curb such bias? 
<dd>Why not insist on full disclosure of the media's voting behavior? 
<dd>The public has a right to know how reporters, editors and others in positions to influence coverage actually vote, just as they already have the right to know who owns media outlets. 
<dd>It's possible to protect reporters' privacy while still informing the public by gathering the information and publishing it anonymously, much the way all survey data are reported. 
<dd>It could work like this: After each election, news organizations would voluntarily distribute surveys to their own staff asking them to identify their party affiliation and if and how they voted in the election. (Measures to protect individual privacy would be necessary, much as they are in mail-ballot elections.) The information then would be published or aired, allowing the public to make up its own mind about whether journalists' views may have influenced their coverage. 
<dd>Some voters might even clip and save the information, the better to judge the media's coverage during subsequent elections. 
<dd>Of course, some journalists would choose not to reveal party affiliation or voter preference, but that, too, could be measured and reported along with the overall results. Readers and viewers would be left to conclude for themselves why some news media staff did not want their political views known. 
<dd>I suspect some editors and producers might even be embarrassed by the political imbalance on their own staffs. A few might even try harder for more balanced coverage as a result. 
<dd>Who knows, a handful of editors and producers might be inspired to hire a conservative or two other than as commentators, the role to which most conservatives are now consigned. 
<dd>Is it really too much to expect members of the press to live up to the same standards of full disclosure they insist on for everyone else? 
<dd>Disclosure wouldn't necessarily eliminate media bias, but at least it would expose it so the public could be more discerning news consumers.

<title>Linda Chavez: The clueless voter ought to stay home -- October 30, 1996</title>

<i>October 30, 1996</i><br>     
<h2>The clueless voter ought to stay home</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Next week's election is predicted to have one
of the lowest voter turnouts in modern history, which is good news for democracy in America. Oh,
I know it's my civic duty to bemoan voter apathy and urge everyone to vote. But many nonvoters
don't know or care enough about the democratic process to cast intelligent - that is, informed
- votes. Sadly, even some actual voters probably don't know enough about
the candidates or issues to be casting their votes astutely, either. And uninformed voters going
to the polls is even more dangerous than apathetic nonvoters staying home. 
<p>
Who are these uninformed Americans? Nearly half of all adults
can't answer basic questions about U.S. government, much less specifics about issues and officeholders
or candidates, according to a recent study conducted for The Washington Post by Harvard University
and the Kaiser Foundation. The survey, taken about a year ago, found that 40%
of adults couldn't name the vice president, and almost half failed to identify the speaker of the
House. I suspect fewer Americans would flunk these basic questions at the height of a national
election, but ignorance about government itself and policy issues no doubt is just as high.
<p>
For example, nearly half of those surveyed didn't know the U.S. Supreme Court can decide whether
a law is constitutional, and nearly 60% believe that the government spends more on foreign aid than
on Medicare. Although foreign aid is less than 2% of the budget, most Americans believe it accounts
for fully one-quarter of all federal spending. According to the survey, Republicans are better informed than
Democrats, but no group is exempt from ignorance. Traveling around the country, I've certainly encountered
my share of clueless citizens, including one likely Dole voter who probably shouldn't
be voting at all. Although the woman was pleasant, hard working and college educated, she literally
had no idea why she was voting. She told me she really &quot;liked&quot; President Bush and had voted
for him in '92, but she didn't have much of an opinion about either Bob Dole or Bill Clinton. She didn't seem
to know about Dole's tax proposals or where Clinton stood on anything. &quot;I'll probably
vote for Dole because Clinton beat Bush. And I really liked George Bush,&quot; she gushed. 
I've heard other would-be voters say they support Clinton because they like his looks, or the way he
hugs Chelsea, or because it's his generation's turn to govern.
<p>
And they are quite serious. Women seem more disposed to such nonsense than men in my own informal
surveys. And the Harvard/Kaiser study confirms that women - including college-educated
young women - know less about politics than men, but they are more likely to vote. Is
it really healthy for a democracy to encourage poorly informed persons to vote? I don't think so, but
mine seems to be a minority opinion - or at least so impolitic a view that few in public life
are willing to own up to it. Everywhere the next few days we will see and hear indiscriminate
pleas from politicians, the media and civic groups to &quot;get out and vote.&quot; These high-minded
folks would do a greater service by insisting that citizens not vote unless they learn something about
the issues. Democracy entails more than a willing electorate.
<p>
Those who do vote have a responsibility to understand the political process and know something about the issues and candidates before they enter the polling booth. Those who can't be bothered to educate themselves jeopardize democracy with
their ignorance. All of us would be better off if the ill-informed stayed home on Election Day.

<h2>Belgian outrage, our silence</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - What would happen in this country if the next
time a child were starved to death or raped or murdered, we decided we weren't ever again going
to allow such a thing to occur without punishing every person who bore some responsibility? 
What if we were to stop working and take to the streets the next time a repeat offender snuffed out
some innocent life? What if hundreds of us were to descend on our local police stations, thousands
of us were to surround our courthouses, hundreds of thousands of us to march to our state capitols
demanding justice? It's hard to imagine, I know. But no harder than envisioning what's happened in
Belgium the past two weeks. 
<P>
In a population less than 5% our own, hundreds of thousands have
filled the streets of cities throughout the country to protest the handling of an investigation
into a child pornography ring that kidnapped, tortured and murdered young Belgian girls. 
In Liege, local firefighters turned their hoses on the courthouse when the Belgian Supreme Court removed the chief investigative magistrate in the case because he attended a dinner for the victims' families. 
Unions staged wildcat strikes throughout the tiny nation. Students occupied the Palace of Justice in Brussels, unfurling signs reading &quot;Justice for Sale.&quot; Even 2,000 rough-looking bikers blocked traffic with their motorcycles, demanding a reinstatement of the death penalty.  And this weekend, 300,000 Belgians gathered in peaceful protest of a justice system gone terribly wrong.  
<p>
What happened in Belgium to spark this massive civil disobedience was the murder of four young girls, two of whom were barely 8 years old, and the disappearance of at least seven more children. 
The man charged with the murders, Marc Dutroux, is a convicted child rapist who served only half
his previous 13-year sentence. He was let go in 1992 when prison social workers and psychiatrists
determined he was no longer a danger. Within one year, little girls started disappearing. Even Dutroux's own mother twice tried to turn him into the police, but he was not arrested until August when police rescued two young women who were being held in his cellar. Now, a dozen others have been arrested for their involvement in the child pornography ring, suspected of videotaping the girls' sexual abuse and torture. 
<p>
These revelations have been enough to bring Belgium to a standstill.
But can we Americans imagine any crime so heinous that we would respond similarly, with genuine
moral indignation at the failure of the U.S. justice system to punish criminals and protect the innocent?
Each year it seems some sadistic lunatic out on parole slaughters a child somewhere in
the United States. 
<p>
The list of recent atrocities is long; still, a few stand out: Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old
kidnapped, raped and murdered by an already convicted rapist. A 6-year-old boy in Washington
state kidnapped, sodomized and sexually mutilated by another demon let loose days earlier. Seven-year-old
Megan Kanka murdered by a convicted child molester who lived on her street. 
<p>
We have become inured to the kinds of horrors that have rallied
the Belgians. But who is to say whether we might put an end to such outrages here if we were to
follow the Belgians' example? Belgium's King Albert II said in a rare public speech last week
that the tragedy of the young girls' murders &quot;must become an occasion for moral renewal and for
profound change in the country.&quot; If only we would do the same. Yet we sit passively by as each new abomination unfolds. In New York, one child is starved, another beaten to death - both by their own mothers' hands. Social workers, obliged to visit these welfare mothers once a year, had failed in their duty, and twice
in barely one year babies died. Still others are murdered by their mothers' boyfriends, sometimes after years of sexual and physical abuse. 
<p>
The best we can muster by way of national examination is a Nightline episode. Most of the
time it's just an afternoon talk show.  
<p>
If tiny Belgium can turn out 300,000 people to mourn the deaths
of a dozen innocent children, why aren't there an equivalent 6 million Americans who would do the
same for the hundreds of children who die in similar circumstances here?

<h2>David Duke debate misleads voters

<p>


   BETHESDA, Md. -- A year ago, it looked like affirmative action
would be the hot topic of the '96 campaign. Today the issue has
disappeared from the radar screen, except in California where
voters will decide whether to ban state-sponsored preferences
in a ballot initiative known as Proposition 209. The pro-quota
side is nervous enough about the outcome to be running one of
the most dishonest campaigns in recent history, employing a bag
of dirty tricks more suited to an old Soviet KGB disinformation
operation than a democratic election.

<p>
In the most recent outrage, the anti-209 forces invited Klansman
David Duke to argue for the measure in a public debate today at
California State University in Northridge. The organizers said
they couldn't find anyone else to take the pro-209 position. The
real story is that once organizers had secured Duke's participation,
no reputable person would appear with him.
<p>
   Inviting Duke was a clever ploy meant to intimidate Proposition
209 supporters. Debate organizers want voters to believe anyone
who opposes race-based preferences must be a KKK sympathizer.
That's a lie, and they know it.
<p>
   But lies appear to be the stock in trade of the anti-209 campaign.
On Friday someone sent a fake "letter of appreciation" supposedly
from Duke to Ward Connerly, a businessman who chairs the group
that put Proposition 209 on the ballot. The letter thanks Connerly
for his "financial contribution" to Duke's losing Senate race
(he came in fifth in Saturday's primary in Louisiana). No doubt
the creeps who forged the phony Duke letter thought it was particularly
clever to send it to Connerly, who is black. Of course Connerly,
who abhors everything Duke stands for, has never made any political
contribution to Duke. In fact, the real money going to Duke comes
from Cal State Northridge, which is paying him $ 4,000 to participate
in today's debate.
<p>
   Another highlight of the anti-209 campaign is a graphic appearing
in fliers and some publications showing a burning cross with the
caption "Unidentified CCRI supporters celebrate the recent advances
in their struggle for civil rights."
<p>
   Why are the anti-209 groups using such dirty tactics? Because
they are desperate to deflect attention from the real issue of
preferences, which are overwhelmingly unpopular. Most polls show
more than two-thirds of Americans oppose racial quotas, set-asides
and preferences. Even with the nasty and well-funded campaign
against Proposition 209, the measure still holds a 17-point lead
among likely California voters.
<P>
   It's no wonder Proposition 209 remains popular. The measure bans
both discrimination and preferences on the basis of race, sex
or national origin in state employment, education and contracting.
What could be more fair?
<p>
It's too bad Republicans abandoned efforts to make race and gender
preferences a campaign issue nationwide. Barely more than a year
ago, Bob Dole was leading the fight to ban preferences in federal
programs, and even President Clinton was promising to "mend"
affirmative action. But Republicans got cold feet and have since
dropped their legislative efforts to ban preferences. And Clinton
has actually extended affirmative action programs, not "mended"
them as he pledged.
<P>
But perhaps politicians' reticence to take on preferences is understandable, 
given the tenor of the debate in California.
<p>
It's more difficult to intimidate millions of voters, however.
I'm betting that when Californians go to the polls Nov. 5, they
will remember the David Duke incident. We'll see then why such
chicanery rarely pays off in an election.<P><P>

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - The Spanish have a phrase for it: sin verguenza. It means without shame, and
it's no compliment. It could become the motto of our age, exemplified most recently by Dick Morris,
the president's strategist who resigned after a tabloid published pictures of him at a hotel with a
prostitute. <P>

Instead of retreating from the media spotlight when his antics with a $200-an-hour call girl became
public, Morris is actually looking for new ways to expose himself. And he's snared a breathless
media eager to help. Time magazine has already turned over its cover (for the second week in a
row) to a shameless Morris, pictured with his betrayed wife hovering grim-faced behind him. Inside,
Morris exploits the opportunity to take credit for Bill Clinton's political comeback. And Random
House has given Morris a $2.5 million book deal for more of the same. 
<P>
Expect no apology from Dick Morris. But then, why should he bother? Not even his wife seems to
expect one. After the story broke, the president called Morris to commiserate with his friend and
image maker, as did Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. A little moral outrage would have been more
appropriate - if not for Morris' indecent conduct, then for jeopardizing the Clinton campaign by
entertaining a prostitute in a hotel room paid for by campaign funds. 
<P>
But moral outrage is unfashionable today, reserved only for those who commit the last universally
recognized sin in our culture: hypocrisy. And Morris is no hypocrite, which requires at least a
semblance of adherence to some moral or ethical code. The lesson is you can get away with
anything, becoming richer and more famous in the process, so long as you are completely amoral to
begin with. 
<P>
It wasn't always so. There was a time when anyone in Morris' position would have been deeply
mortified at being caught in such a sordid liaison. And even if the miscreant felt no inward remorse,
he would still have been shunned by his peers. 
<P>
No such punishment awaits Morris, whose hubris reflects more than his own arrogance. As a
society, we've become inured to shame. Nothing shocks us. Millions tune in to an endless parade of
vice and weirdness on daytime television. The more salacious the details, the greater the celebrity.
We glorify violence in music and films. We idolize foul-mouthed entertainers and transvestite sports
figures. We re-elect public officials caught smoking crack cocaine and seducing boys. 
<P>
Is it any wonder so many social institutions are disintegrating and our streets are unsafe? Without a
sense of what is shameful in our own lives and others', we deny ourselves the capacity to make
social judgments. Deviancy has no meaning unless we can measure behavior against some common
standard. 
<P>
A few years ago, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) wrote a brilliant essay in The Public
Interest which described the social deterioration occurring, from rising out-of-wedlock births to
skyrocketing crime. Much of the problem stemmed, he said, from a phenomenon he dubbed
"defining deviancy down." In other words, so lowering our standards about what is proper that what
once would have been considered deviant behavior has become merely individual choice. 
<P>
In fact, the situation is worse than Moynihan described. We've not only done away with concepts of
right and wrong, but we've also begun to heap huge rewards on those whose actions would once
have made them pariahs. Why should Dick Morris be ashamed of himself when so many of us are
eager to shower him with fame and fortune?<P><P>

<title>Linda Chavez: Promises Don't Help Kids Read -- September 5, 1996</title>

<h2>Promises Don't Help Kids Read</h2>

Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Four years ago when running for president the first 
time, Bill Clinton promised to overhaul the nation's education system 
from kindergarten through 12th grade in his campaign manifesto, 
Putting People First. Given his disastrous attempt at overhauling the 
country's health-care system, perhaps we can be thankful he didn't 
manage to come up with an education plan once he assumed office. But 
it's re-election time, and once again candidate Clinton is an 
education reformer. <p>

Last week, the president promised an assault on illiteracy, pledging 
$1.75 billion for new programs to ensure that every American child can 
read by third grade. Sounds great, but aren't public schools supposed 
to teach kids to read already? The United States spends more on public 
education than almost any other nation - more than $240 billion a year 
for elementary and secondary schools in 1994. That's $5,300 per 
student. If schools have failed to teach kids how to read by third 
grade, how will adding less than 1% more money solve the problem? <p>

By the president's own admission, 40% of fourth-grade students fail to 
meet basic reading standards. And money isn't the problem. In 1980, 
the U.S. was spending less than $3,900 per student. Yet the reading 
proficiency of average 9-year-olds was actually higher than it is now, 
according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. <p>

What happened? Bob Dole blames the teachers unions, and they certainly 
share a good deal of blame. The 2.2 million-member National Education 
Association has supported every education fad that has come down the 
pike, so long as it was sufficiently multicultural and politically 
correct. The much smaller American Federation of Teachers, with only 
about 900,000 members, has a far better record on education issues, 
and its president, Albert Shanker, has been a thoughtful exponent of 
education reform. <p>

Nonetheless, both the NEA and the AFT have become well-financed 
political lobbies for liberal causes. The NEA alone raised $6.5 
million in 1992 and spent $2.3 million on congressional candidates, 
almost all Democrats. The only thing that really matters to the 
teachers unions is whether candidates support increased spending on 
education. <p>

Much of that money doesn't even go to teachers' salaries, much less 
directly into the classroom. American public education has become a 
giant, bloated bureaucracy, with school systems top-heavy with 
administrative staff who never set foot in a classroom. <p>

By contrast, Catholic schools, which educate 2.6 million students a 
year, produce better results with a fraction of the money. Catholic 
schools spend about $2,800 per pupil, around half what public schools 
do, but Catholic students outperform their public school peers, 
especially in comparisons between poor minority students from both 
groups. <p>

If Clinton were really interested in improving reading levels of 
America's poor children, he'd give them the same opportunity he gives 
his own: the chance to go to the school of her choice, in Chelsea's 
case the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. The 
Clintons can afford Sidwell Friends' pricey tuition, but most middle-
class, much less poor, parents can't pay private-school tuition and 
pay taxes for public school, too. <p>

During the last election, Peter Brimelow reported in Forbes, candidate 
Clinton told the NEA, "If I become president, you'll be my partners. I 
won't forget who brought me to the White House." That's one promise 
President Clinton has kept, but it won't help kids learn how to read. <p>

<title>Linda Chavez: Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces -- August 28, 1996</title>

<h2>Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>

BETHESDA, Md. - The Democrats are using the "e-word" a lot this week, 
trying to paint Bob Dole and the Republican Congress as extremists. 
But a close look at the Democrats' platform and the delegates 
themselves suggests it's the Democratic Party that represents some 
political extremes. From a balanced-budget amendment to welfare 
reform, the Democrats in Chicago are out of step with the American 
public. <p>

According to a Washington Post/ABC poll, 82% of registered voters 
favor a balanced-budget amendment, but only 32% of Democratic 
delegates agree. Perhaps that's why the Democratic platform is silent 
on the issue. After all, it might be embarrassing to mention a measure 
that 162 Democrats in Congress voted against in 1995, dooming the 
amendment in the 104th Congress. <p>

The survey also showed that 82% of Democratic delegates favor 
affirmative action programs that give preferences to minorities and 
women. But most other Americans oppose race or gender preferences. The 
Washington Post/ABC poll showed registered voters as a whole oppose 
race and gender preferences by a margin of 52% to 45%, but polls of 
the general public show even greater opposition. A 1995 poll by the 
Los Angeles Times showed 73% of Americans favor legislation to outlaw 
preferential hiring by race or sex. <p>

But it's not surprising the Democratic delegates favor preferences and 
quotas, since they were chosen under party rules that set strict 
racial and gender quotas. Each state delegation must reflect the 
racial and ethnic breakdown of Democratic voters in the last election 
and include equal numbers of men and women. <p>

President Clinton just signed the Republican welfare-reform bill last 
week, but his own delegates don't think much of "ending welfare as we 
know it." The Washington Post/ABC poll shows only 38% of delegates 
support a five-year limit on welfare benefits, something 73% of all 
registered voters favor. The Democratic platform doesn't mention 
specific time limits, except to say who should be exempted from them. <p>

Speaking of exemptions, apparently the Clinton administration has a 
lot of welfare-reform exemptions up its sleeve if Clinton is re-
elected. Vice President Gore suggested Sunday on This Week with David 
Brinkley that the president doesn't really intend to implement the 
bill he just signed. Gore said the president will use whatever means 
available - including the line-item veto - to excise parts of the 
welfare-reform bill he doesn't like. So much for democratic process. <p>

Even on abortion, an issue that seems to plague Republicans every four 
years, the Democrats are hardly in the mainstream of public opinion - 
though you won't hear the media talk much about it this week. Democrat 
delegates are overwhelmingly pro-choice, and the party platform spells 
out an unrestricted "right of every woman to choose, consistent with 
Roe vs. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay." <p>

But Americans favor a much more limited right to choose abortion than 
the Democrats' position. Most Americans favor some legal restrictions 
on abortion: 74% favor mandatory 24-hour waiting periods, and 74% 
support parental consent and 70% spousal notification laws. Although 
the president recently vetoed a bill to ban partial-birth abortions 
except to save a mother's life, 71% of Americans oppose the procedure, 
which involves partially delivering a 20- to 26-week fetus feet first 
and inserting a surgical scissors into the skull to remove the brain. 
One of the most comprehensive surveys of American opinion on abortion 
and moral beliefs, done by the Gallup organization in 1991, showed 
that 73% of Americans support a prohibition of abortion after the 
first three months of pregnancy for any reason except to save the life 
of the mother. And more than 80% oppose government funding of 
abortion. <p>

The Democrats will continue to try to paint themselves as moderates 
and the Republicans as extremists through the election. They think if 
they say it often enough, maybe the country will believe them. I'm 
betting Americans are a lot smarter than that.<p>

<h2>Perot's Legacy May Be Helping To Elect Clinton Twice</h2>

BETHESDA, Md. - Despite his quirkiness, Ross Perot has done some 
pretty impressive things in his lifetime, not the least winning nearly 
20 million votes in the 1992 presidential election. But if he persists 
in his quixotic quest for the White House this year, he may well be 
remembered only as the man responsible for twice electing Bill Clinton 
president. <p>

Polls suggest Perot won't garner nearly as many votes this time 
around. But if Perot pulls even 2% or 3% of the vote, his role could 
be decisive in a close election, as this one promises to be. White 
House aides claim they believe Perot hurts President Clinton as much 
as he does Bob Dole. (And if you believe that one, they have some land 
parcels on the Whitewater River they'd like to sell you.) <p>

In fact, Perot draws his support mostly from independent and 
Republican voters. In 1992, Perot won only 13% of Democrats' votes but 
30% of independents' and 17% of Republicans' votes. And 20% of his 
1992 voters had voted for George Bush in 1988. Maybe it's time Ross 
Perot - and his remaining supporters - rethink what they want to 
accomplish in 1996. <p>

Here are a few questions they should ask themselves. <p>

Do you really want to balance the budget? Republicans have already 
proved they can balance the budget - they passed a five-year balanced 
budget last December. But President Clinton vetoed it. And Clinton 
still can't decide when he'll produce a balanced budget. One day it's 
nine years, another day it's seven, and still another he says maybe he 
can do it in five. <p>

Do you believe the country needs to rein in entitlements? The 
Republicans offered genuine entitlement reform last year, but the 
Democrats did their best to nix it. First, Democrats - including the 
president - demagogued Medicare reform, needlessly and recklessly 
trying to scare the elderly. Then the president twice vetoed welfare 
reform despite having promised "to end welfare as we know it." The 
president is expected to sign a Republican-passed welfare-reform bill 
this week, but only because he knows he can't possibly be re-elected 
if he doesn't. <p>

lDo you still care about reforming government? Republicans in the 
104th Congress passed the most sweeping government-reform legislation 
since the civil service reforms 100 years ago. For the first time, 
laws that apply to ordinary citizens and employers now apply to 
members of Congress. The Democrats controlled Congress for more than 
40 years, exempting themselves from all the employment laws they were 
happy to inflict on others. The Republicans quickly ended that 
practice once they gained control of both houses of Congress in 1994. <p>

Which is the real reform party in America? The Democrats have said 
"no" to Medicare reform, Medicaid reform, welfare reform, lawsuit 
reform, and term limits. Meanwhile, the Reform Party can't even get 
its own members to participate in choosing the party's presidential 
nominee. Fewer than 5% cast ballots either in the nominating process 
or in selecting the candidate. Perhaps the Reform Party ought to get 
its own house in order before it tries tackling the whole government. <p>

That leaves one party and one presidential nominee for reform-minded 
voters: Republican Bob Dole. If Ross Perot and his supporters truly 
want change this year, they'll stop playing spoilers. Last time 
around, Perot spent $60 million on his campaign. This time he's not 
even willing to risk his own money, asking his supporters to pony up 
so he can receive $30 million in federal campaign funds instead. <p>

Re-electing Bill Clinton won't change politics as usual, won't end 
gridlock, won't make government work more efficiently - all reasons 
Perot says he's running. But the numbers just aren't there. Perot 
can't win, and surely even he knows it this time. It's hard to believe 
Perot wants his legacy to be a second term for Bill Clinton. But if he 
insists on staying in the race until November, he may succeed in 
ensuring just that.<p>

GOP Gender Gap Simply "Hogwash"
</h2>

Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
SAN DIEGO - Here's a political quiz: Which political party has 
suffered from a "gender gap" in voting during the last several 
presidential elections? If you answered "the Republicans," you get an 
"A" for reading the newspapers and watching the evening news -- but 
you flunk the test.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, in three out of the last four elections, it has been the 
Democrats who have actually been hurt by the gender gap. Democrats 
lost those elections because they did so poorly among male voters. In 
1984, Democrat Walter Mondale trailed Republican President Ronald 
Reagan by 25 points among men. And in 1988, Democrat Michael Dukakis 
got 16% fewer male votes than Republican George Bush. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Their losses had little to do with female voters. But the media have 
been relatively uninterested over the years in why men are less likely 
to vote Democratic, while they've been obsessed with the supposed GOP 
gender gap among women.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year is no different. Expect to read countless stories and hear 
endless explanations this election season why Bob Dole can't win 
women's votes. And most of it will be hogwash -- or wishful thinking 
on the part of reporters and pundits, most of whom w ill probably be 
voting Democratic themselves in November. (In 1992, 89% of Washington-
based reporters and editors voted for Bill Clinton, according to a 
poll by the Freedom Forum, a media think tank.)
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the favorite explanations of why women won't vote Republican 
this year is the party's position on abortion. The Republican Party's 
strong anti-abortion stance is supposed to be a huge barrier to 
winning women's votes. But, in fact, polls show that  abortion has 
little to do with how women cast their votes.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll showed only 1 in 5 female voters 
say the candidate they support must share exactly their own position 
on abortion. And of these women, slightly more than half are actually 
pro-life, so at best it's a wash. Abortion ranke d 10th out of the top 
12 most important issues to women in this poll, and about one-third 
said abortion was not at all important in determining how they would 
vote.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like men, women care most about the economy when it comes time to pick 
a president. Which is good news for Bob Dole. He has certainly shown 
this past week that he intends to make the economy his No. 1 issue -- 
first with his tax-cut proposal and then with  his selection of Jack 
Kemp to be his running mate.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both actions should have real appeal for female voters. Kemp's brand 
of compassionate conservatism and his exuberant political style will 
resonate with women who may be turned off by doom-and-gloom talk of 
budget deficits and harsh rhetoric about slashing government spending.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most importantly, Dole's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, 
coupled with an extra $500 tax deduction for each child under 18, will 
mean real savings to families. Many middle-income voters with young 
children would see their federal income-tax bill red uced by half if 
Dole has his way. Most opinion polls show that working mothers would 
prefer to work fewer hours outside the home. Allowing families to keep 
more of their earnings could give many mothers the option to work less 
or to use their tax savings  to buy a home, put toward their 
children's college education, or save for their own retirement. Dole 
is proposing real choice for women -- the choice to determine their 
own economic futures. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the Democrats who want to limit women's choices. The Democrats 
would rather let government decide how to spend working women's money 
than allow women to choose how to spend it themselves.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time Americans got a tax break -- when President Reagan twice 
reduced tax rates, in 1981 and 1986 -- the economy boomed. Growth 
averaged about 4% a year during Reagan's tenure, resulting in the 
longest period of economic expansion since World War  II. What's more, 
women's earnings grew faster during the 1980s than at any time in 
recent history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't expect the media to remind voters of these economic facts 
between now and Election Day. They'll be too busy reporting the so-
called GOP gender gap.

<h2>
We're Becoming A Nation Of Crybabies
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- Working for the federal government, which has never 
been a barrel of laughs, is about to get even less humorous. Last 
month, a Social Security Administration official told a sexist joke at 
an agency conference, and now charges are flying that the agency is 
riddled with sex discrimination. The only twist in this increasingly 
familiar charge is that the joke-teller was a woman and the butt of 
the joke was men. Now several men at the agency are claiming that a 
"hostile work environment" exists -- code words for sexual harassment 
-- which could signal discrimination complaints, lawsuits and wasted 
taxpayer dollars ahead.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many charges involving sexual harassment, the facts of this 
case aren't in dispute. Ruth Pierce, deputy commissioner for human 
resources and director of equal employment opportunity at the Social 
Security Administration, told the joke to participants in a diversity 
workshop in Miami.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to The Washington Post, which reported the story on its 
front page, the joke involved a mermaid and a fisherman whose wish was 
to become five times smarter. The mermaid granted the fisherman's wish 
by turning him into a woman. Not exactly a knee slapper as jokes go, 
but it elicited enough laughs from the mostly female listeners to send 
audience member John Boyer into quite a snit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer heads an informal group called Government Men for Equality Now 
(GMEN) and alleges the Social Security Administration is dominated by 
women and rife with anti-male prejudice. Now he's hoping to turn 
Pierce's joke into a federal case, demanding that Pierce apologize to 
all 65,000 agency employees and be demoted from her current post.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer's complaint itself might be laughable if the federal government 
weren't such a bastion of the double standard. If Pierce were a man 
telling a predominantly male audience a joke poking fun at women's 
intelligence, the government's political-correctness squad would 
already be on the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar circumstances at a Coast Guard dinner in 1995 led not only to 
months of investigation, but also to enormous human suffering. Capt. 
Ernie Blanchard, a career veteran of the Coast Guard with an 
impeccable record, told a few barely off-color jokes at a dinner 
honoring cadets and became the focus of an official investigation that 
ultimately resulted in an 800-page report. Informed that his career 
was in jeopardy and that he might lose his pension, spelling financial 
ruin for his family, Blanchard killed himself before the investigation 
was complete.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the Coast Guard incident had not ended so tragically with 
Blanchard's death, it would still be a travesty. No government career 
should be extinguished for a one-time lapse in taste before an adult 
audience.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But ever since the courts started interpreting a "hostile work 
environment" to constitute sexual harassment, bad taste has become a 
federal offense. With men so often the targets of such witch hunts, 
it's no surprise a few, like John Boyer, strike back.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the answer to this nonsense is not for more men to claim that 
they, too, are victims of sexual harassment because someone tells a 
meaningless joke. We are becoming a nation of crybabies who can 
respond to others' ridiculous behavior only by engaging in more of the 
same.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the last year for which figures are available, federal 
workers filed nearly 12,000 harassment complaints -- more than in any 
other single category of alleged discrimination.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With warm-up jokes and after-dinner entertainment now fair game for 
such charges, that number will no doubt climb. American taxpayers, who 
foot the bill for such silliness, surely aren't laughing.

<p>
SAPELLO, N.M. -- The night is cool atop Star Hill, east of the Sangre 
de Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. Nearby a herd of longhorn 
cattle and a few scattered buffalo have settled in for the night. 
Earlier in the day, I observed a coyote stalking the cattle from the 
crest of a hill, and a Swainson's hawk perched on the barbed-wire 
fence.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the thrill of seeing these creatures will soon pale as Phil Mahon, 
our host at Star Hill resort, introduces my husband and me to his 
celestial delights.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Until now, neither of us has anything but a passing interest in 
astronomy. As lifelong city residents, we rarely enjoy star-studded 
nights apart from an occasional country get-away where we can escape 
both the city lights that obscure the stars from view and the 
preoccupations that cause us not to look. Now, on an impulse we're 
here at this amateur astronomers' retreat, hoping to expand our 
horizons.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mahon, a somewhat taciturn guide, types instructions into a laptop 
computer attached to a 14-inch Compustar telescope, and the machine 
whirs into action, rotating on its pedestal until it comes to rest 
pointed at the Southern sky. Through the lens we see not only Jupiter 
and its red bands, but also four of its 16 moons. For the next hour, 
Mahon treats us to stars, pulsars, nebulae and galaxies, objects as 
close as 21/2 or as distant as 150 million light years away.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly all of the dozen sites we view have been familiar territory to 
astronomers for more than 200 years, since the French astronomer 
Charles Messier (1730-1817) first cataloged 68 celestial objects, 
including our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda. Still, the experience is 
awe-inspiring, putting daily obsessions into perspective. For a while 
at least, public policy, the culture wars, the federal deficit and 
politics fade.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not for long. As I look through the telescope, I wonder whether as 
a nation we will continue to explore this vast universe. Even as our 
knowledge increases at almost exponential rates, it seems our national 
desire and will to learn more are on the wane. NASA's budget is $ 14 
billion this year but will drop to a projected $ 11 billion by 2000.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1990s have seen dramatic swings in our space commitments. The 
decade was ushered in with great fanfare in 1991 with the announcement 
of Project Columbus, a $ 100 million joint venture between NASA and a 
private astronomy institute to search for intelligent life in the 
universe. One year later, the Senate canceled funding with derisive 
comments about little green men.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, funding for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or 
SETI as it is known, has been fickle throughout the history of the 
program. Since 1960, SETI has involved some 50 separate programs, 
initially with federal backing but more recently privately funded.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year, interest is up again with the discovery in January by 
astronomers Paul Butler and Geoffrey Marcy of the first two planets 
outside our solar system. Announced earlier this year, NASA's new 
Origins project will build powerful new telescopes over the next 30 
years capable of actually seeing planets such as those discovered by 
Butler and Marcy. They could only infer the planets' existence from 
complex measurements of light emissions of the stars 47 Ursae and 70 
Virginis, around which the planets orbit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least that's NASA's hope, if the project receives full federal 
backing. It's a big if. With so many earthly demands on the federal 
budget, the exploration of our universe sometimes seems a luxury we

This starry night, from my vantage point in New Mexico's hills, the

<h2>
New Citizens Getting Off Too Easily
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- This July Fourth, 1.2 million more new citizens will 
be celebrating Independence Day than last year. Naturalization was way 
up in 1995, more than double the 1994 rate and five times the rate 
experienced throughout the 1980s.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As an unabashed admirer of immigrants' initiative and grit, I'd 
normally welcome this surge in new citizenship. But unfortunately, 
politics -- not patriotism -- may explain this sudden spurt in 
naturalization. The Clinton administration has been quietly moving to 
water down citizenship requirements in ways that could ultimately 
damage the Americanization process.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many nations that jealously guard access to citizenship, the 
United States makes it relatively easy. Permanent residents must wait 
five years before they apply for naturalization. By law, they must 
demonstrate they can speak, read and write simple words and phrases in 
English and that they know basics about American history and 
government. They must also be law-abiding and of good character.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Though the modest commitments are hardly onerous, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service is considering exempting whole classes of 
immigrants from them. Among the proposals the INS is reportedly 
weighing is one to exempt immigrants who've completed high school in 
the U.S. from being tested on American history and government or from 
having to demonstrate knowledge of English.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, a high school degree today is no guarantee that a 
student knows much U.S. history or government. It isn't even an 
assurance that a student knows English. Foreign-born high school 
students in New York, for example, can take state graduation exams in 
their native language if they entered American public school after 
eighth grade. And many public school systems across the country seem 
more concerned about preserving immigrants' native language and 
culture than about helping them learn English or American history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's behind the administration's efforts to weaken naturalization 
requirements? Some critics suspect politics. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., 
has pointedly asked INS Commissioner Doris Meissner whether the 
administration is trying to increase the number of potential 
Democratic voters before the November presidential election.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But partisan politics isn't the most serious concern. The real threat 
is weakening national identity. As John J. Miller points out in a 
recent article in Policy Review, "Naturalization is the only legal 
instrument that allows the United States -- a 'nation of immigrants' -
- to decide who is an American and who is not. Without it, the 
cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers understood the potential for mischief if 
citizenship were obtained too easily, Miller notes. Alexander Hamilton 
urged that immigrants be drawn gradually into American civil society 
"to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American 
attachments." Indeed, the oath of citizenship pledges the naturalized 
citizen to "renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any 
foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty" and to "support and 
defend the Constitution and the laws o
f the United States of America."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Miller suggests what's needed now is a modern-day Americanization 
Movement. During the last great wave of immigration, from 1900 to 
1924, both public schools and private philanthropic organizations, 
such as Jane Addams' famous settlement houses, helped acculturate 
millions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This commitment is sorely lacking today. Immigrant advocacy groups 
focus almost exclusively on immigrant rights, with little attention to 
immigrant responsibilities. If America is to continue to be an 
immigrant nation, there must be a covenant between America and its 
newcomers. Learning the national language and the nation's history and 
form of government are the least we should require from those who wish 
to become Americans.

FBI Files: Look What I Found in Mine
</h2>

Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Wonder what all the fuss over the Clinton White House 
requisitioning FBI files on former Republican officials is about? As 
someone who has seen my own FBI file, I can tell you there's plenty of 
cause for alarm. FBI files contain not only private and sometimes 
embarrassing information, but also some things that are downright 
false.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1983, President Reagan appointed me staff director of the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights, a post that required what's called a full-
field investigation in preparation for Senate confirmation. The 
investigation took many weeks to complete and included interviews with 
my employers, colleagues, friends, neighbors, schoolmates and 
virtually anyone else who might have known me over the years. Most of 
the information the FBI obtained was innocuous and accurate. But not 
everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Years later, when I obtained my file through a Freedom of Information 
request, I was surprised to learn the document contained not only an 
occasional unflattering description but also outright misinformation 
about me and my family. In one case, a former neighbor said she 
couldn't say whether I might be a national security risk, an answer 
bound to provoke greater scrutiny. The FBI had no way of knowing I had 
reported this woman for leaving her young child locked out of the 
house alone and unfed until 1 a.m., which no doubt accounted for her 
opinion of my trustworthiness.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In another interview, a former supervisor claimed to have fired me 
from a Democratic National Committee (DNC) job I held in my early 20s. 
Being fired from the DNC could be considered a badge of honor for a 
Republican nominee, but the charge was untrue. My supervisor, a 
political rival, may have wanted to fire me, but she actually left her 
job slightly before I quit mine.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most outrageous material in my file, however, had nothing to do 
with me.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the name itself was blacked out to protect the person's 
identity, one series of entries contained information that appeared 
from their context to be about my father. I nearly fainted when I read 
the entry, which referred to an arrest for a violent crime. Then I 
noticed the date of arrest was after my father's death, and shock 
turned into anger. Derogatory information about someone who happened 
to share my father's name found its way into my FBI file, violating 
that person's privacy and besmirching my father's reputation.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As far as I know, my file was not among those the Clinton White House 
requested. Nonetheless, I'm outraged to learn that friends, colleagues 
and at least one person who worked for me in the Reagan White House 
are among those whose files were obtained.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton operatives -- no one yet knows exactly how many - procured and 
read at least 408 Republican appointees' files. How many of these 
files had egregious errors in them? How many more had malicious 
gossip? How many simply contained embarrassing private
 information that should remain secret? And what did these Clinton 
appointees do with that information?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton has dismissed this incredible invasion of privacy as 
a "bureaucratic snafu" and has declined to punish the known 
perpetrators. Craig Livingstone, the former director of White House 
security under whose direction the FBI files were obtained, remains on 
the White House payroll. Anthony Marceca, whom Livingstone recruited 
to read the files, is on paid leave from the Pentagon. Marceca may be 
protected from immediate firing by civil service laws -- but 
Livingstone, a presidential appointee, is not. Even Democrats have 
asked Clinton to fire Livingstone, but the president refuses.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such total arrogance of power should give Americans pause.

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Want proof we've abandoned all pretense of a civil 
society? Forget name-calling politicians and rancorous talk radio -- 
take a look inside sports arenas and in the city streets after 
championship games. It's not just boorish megalomaniacs like Bulls 
forward Dennis Rodman turning games into a Roman spectacle. Some fans 
are worse. Chicago police and the National Guard are bracing for 
widespread lawlessness during the Bulls' victory celebration.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And the crowd can be a real factor in the final score. Bulls star 
Michael Jordan acknowledged as much. "We wanted to come out and take 
their crowd out of the game," Jordan told reporters, describing his 
team's aggressive start in Sunday night's game with the Seattle 
Supersonics. By racking up a big lead early, the Bulls hoped to 
depress the Seattle fans' notorious fervor.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not content to cheer their team to victory, fans everywhere shout 
insults, throw things and do their best to distract opposing players. 
During the Sonics' own victory game over the Utah Jazz for the Western 
Conference Finals, Seattle spectators showed just how nasty they could 
be. With seconds left and the Jazz down by three points, power forward 
Karl Malone endured a deafening countdown before he took his foul 
shots. Between the verbal taunts and the sea of undulating white 
balloons, Malone -- who makes 70% of his free throws -- missed both, 
ending any chance for a Jazz win.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those annoying white balloons wielded by fans are deployed to throw 
off a player's aim in the free throw. The balloons wiggle like maggots 
behind the basket. But some fans have gotten even more creative. 
Boosters at Florida Panther hockey games throw rubber rats on the ice 
after their team scores a goal. Detroit Red Wings fans throw 
octopuses. The ice is beginning to look like a bouillabaisse of 
rubbery critters.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the action is more than offensive -- it's downright 
dangerous. Last year, fans pelted the field at Dodger Stadium with so 
many baseballs that the game had to be halted, and the Dodgers 
forfeited a game they were winning.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was a time when sportsmanship was synonymous with gentlemanly 
behavior. Being called "unsportsmanlike" used to be a real insult, and 
unsportsmanlike conduct actually carried penalties on the field and 
off.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
My most vivid memory of a high school game is not of some last-second 
victory but of Sister Jean Patrice, my high school principal, down on 
the basketball court scolding those of us in the stands for booing our 
opponents. "Another outburst like that and we'll forfeit the game," 
she warned -- no idle threat. She was an enthusiastic team supporter 
and a tough competitor, but she believed winning wasn't everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In today's billion-dollar sports business, winning is the only thing. 
If players act like freaks or worse on the court or off, no one seems 
to care. Least of all those in the stands whose own behavior emulates 
their idols'. Fans are supposed to boost the morale of the players, 
not become sideline guerrillas.

<h2> 
Get Political, GOP
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Democratic threats have thrown Republicans into a panic. A
plan to add an amendment increasing the minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15, has now derailed a second major bill in the Senate. Fifteen
moderate Republicans promptly followed and introduced their own
even higher minimum wage increase bill in the House, leading the
GOP leadership to predict 40 eventual disaffections from their
ranks and passage of a minimum wage bill this year. So far have
things deteriorated in the bastion of the 1994 revolution that the
House will pass a New Deal law that Bill Clinton was afraid even to
introduce before the Republican took control of Congress.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Happened? A cynic might note that the news of the AFL-CIO
ad campaign supporting a minimum wage increase broke just before
the Democrats hit the floor of the Senate with their plan. The fact
that big labor was willing to spend $35 million above its normal
$42 million to target vulnerable Republicans got the attention of
Republicans in districts with high union membership and among the
vulnerable, especially the freshmen. This is about politics, not
economics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, every economist knows that minimum wage laws cost
jobs. It is not necessary to repeat the facts because they are not
at issue. As reported here by Bruce Bartlett, as recently as
January 14, 1987, the New York Times ran an editorial headed, "The
Right Minimum Wage: $0.00."  Two years later they still were
correctly saying minimum wages help middle income families because
most people who get the increase are second or third income
earners, not the poor, and because employers hire fewer low wage
workers when their wage costs go up. Somehow, in a Democratic
Administration, the Times decided it was fine to increase the
minimum wage; but that does not repeal the law of supply and
demand. Fewer jobs will exist at an artificially higher wage, even
if it is only a small number--and even economists with President
Clinton know it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On "This Week With David Brinkley" columnist George Will asked
Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich why, if an increase in the
minimum to $5.15 was good, why not raise it to $10? Reich admitted
$10 would have a "negative effect" but $5.15 would have only a
"negligible effect on jobs." A "negligible effect" is an effect. It
is critical to note that even the minimum wage's number one
supporter admits a higher minimum wage will cost some people their
jobs. Only he does not care. Too bad for them. It's only
politics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why cannot the Republicans learn to play politics? It has been
the constant, sad refrain of this space for a year of bungled
activity, trying to rule from Congress when the President holds the
veto. It is not too late to begin learning. The Democrats are
clearly playing politics on the minimum wage legislation. The
Republicans should accept the challenge and offer an amendment to
increase the minimum wage to $100 per hour. If increasing rates by
law works, why be pikers? Ten dollars is too little. Increase it to
100 an hour and make everyone rich. Get on record supporting a
minimum higher than the Democrats would approve.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If that is too high, how about $66.66 an hour. That would make
all Americans as rich as Congressmen. But that brings up a sore
subject, so $100 is better. At that rate, all workers would be at
a high enough income to be under President Clinton's surtax. That
is the right message. It would also be possible to balance the
Budget if everyone could earn that rate. Of course, they will not
because supply and demand work. But that is the point the GOP
should want to make. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am serious. All Republicans should vote to support "a real
increase in the minimum wage" and let the President and the
Democrats sort it all out (or clean it up in a conference committee
after the point is made). Politics must be played by two or it just
is not fair, nor even interesting. There is nothing wrong with
playing politics in government, certainly not when the other side
is having all of the fun.

<title>Devine: Real  Campaign Reform -- 5/9/96 - ACU
</title>

<h2> 
Real  Campaign Reform
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Common Cause has spent a quarter-century of campaign reform  
zeal on the passion that money is evil; and the job of reform is to  
chase its specter out of politics. Yet, the fruit of their reform  
fetish has been ever greater dominance of campaigns by  
millionaires, business sharpies and union bosses, and ever less  
public confidence in the political process. Still, their only  
answer is, more laws to wipe out filthy lucre.  
  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Finally, someone is saying stop. Curtis Gans of the Committee  
for the Study of the American Electorate has organized 30  
organizations from across the ideological and political spectrum  
under the "unifying principle" that the "approaches that have been  
pushed by Common Cause and Public Citizen are wrong." Finally. From  
the American Conservative Union to the National Women's Political  
Caucus, the AFL-CIO to the National Association of Business  
Political Action Committees, the other side is stirring. Although  
ACU and former liberal senator Gene McCarthy did fight the original  
court test, the field has generally been conceded since the "get  
money out" school prevailed in the Supreme Court.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
A Republican Congressional "reformer" welcomed the debate by  
calling the response "a deceitful campaign to protect their raw  
power and personal profit, garnered in a corrupt system of money."  
The unions and business are hardly altruistic but the inclusion of  
think tanks suggests name-calling will not be enough. The counter  
argument begins with the unfortunate fact that everything costs  
money and, without it, there can be no free speech or right to  
association. The only other goo-goo idea is to have the government  
fund the whole process. Yet--partially as a result of reform--the  
people simply do not trust government to do it.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Because the whole idea of reform was to eliminate the  
corrupting effects of filthy lucre, the Supreme Court reasonably  
ruled that one could not corrupt oneself--so it is an  
unconstitutional limit of speech to limit what a candidate can  
spend on his own election. Voila, we have Ross Perot, Steve Forbes,  
the rise of the multi-millionaire Senate, and even the Michael  
Huffingtons buying House seats with their small change in the  
millions. The one certainty in the uncertain future of Common Cause  
political "reform," is more Richy Rich candidates. After the yacht,  
the airplane, the football club and the young spouse, what else is  
there to do?  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
All the $1,000 individual contribution limit has done is  
replace the sometimes-altruistic, big contributor Henry Salvatori's  
and Stuart Mott's with the always-investing sharpies who bundle  
$1,000 contributions into large batches. As the value of a thousand  
declines from inflation, the number of payers needed multiplies.  
Today, the only people who can round-up big sums are those with  
wide contacts among likeminded self-interested fellow seekers of  
influence. All of the onerous reporting only hides who is the real  
influence peddler among the scores and more of thousand dollar  
givers. Meanwhile, the Congressman is constantly on the phone  
"dialing for dollars" to call the larger number of contributors now  
needed, leaving little time for average citizens or simple  
reflection on issues or even reading about issues.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It took great courage for Speaker Newt Gingrich to question  
the central Common Cause assumption by arguing that we do not spend  
enough on politics--we actually spend less debating than on soap  
advertising. Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman John Doolittle  
have spoken out too. The fact is, if all money comes from the  
government bureaucrats who run it, the lawyers who write the laws,  
the media who sensationalize it and the sharpies who hustle it, the  
people will be frozen out. Not everyone can participate equally,  
but there must be some citizen participation. In the real world,  
that means relying upon the political parties and citizen groups  
that allow people indirect participation and influence.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
David Broder is correct that the Ralph Nader-Common Cause plan  
to limit so-called soft money for party-building and volunteer  
activities would further erode the role of parties to represent  
citizens and control interests. But Broder does not go far enough.  
If political parties are the only means for effective influence,  
they will multiply. In a free society, groups always multiply.  
Either political action groups will proliferate or parties will. As  
political action committees become more hedged by law, it is no  
coincidence that Ross Perot organizes a third party.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Real reform would: (1) eliminate limits on contributions to  
citizen-ideological political action committees (PACs) and extend  
the third-class mailing rates now granted to political parties to  
them, so they can compete in representing citizens within a two-  
party system; (2) end individual or corporate limits on  
contributions to a political party as a limit upon free speech; (3)  
continue the current $5,000 limit on contributions to candidates by  
corporate or union PACs, so they do not dominate the field; (4)  
void the $25,000 yearly total and $1,000 per candidate contribution  
limit for individuals, to allow a Steve Forbes to contribute to a  
Jack Kemp rather than force the rich to run themselves, placing  
others on a more equal footing with the Richys; (5) continue record  
keeping and reporting requirements but, to save average people from  
paperwork, only require reporting of significant amounts; (6), if  
one cannot corrupt oneself, immediately remove all limits and  
restrictions for contributions by spouses, parents, children, and  
first degree blood relatives and in-laws of candidates; (7) index  
for inflation any dollar limits; and, (9) increase the penalty for  
failing to source any unidentified campaign communication (such as  
in so-called push polls defaming opposing candidates).  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It may be pie-in-the-sky to wish for real reform with  
demagogues like Perot and Nader exploiting public anxiety; but it  
should not be an impossible case to make. If Mr. Perot gets rid of  
all other money, he will be the only person who can compete for  
President.

<h2> 
The Right's Confused But the Left is Dead
</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the media are busting with pleasure that Pat Buchanan is
sundering conservatism, the leading intellectual of the left is
forced to publish a book on progressives titled, "They Only Look
Dead." In fact, he proves they are moribund. Still, a book by the
man who invented the New Democrat and called forth Bill Clinton
obviously is an expert on levitation.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
E.J. Dionne, Jr. of the Washington Post follows his award-
winning <i>Why Americans Hate Politics</i> by shedding his earlier cover
of ideological neutrality to brag that he is a progressive
dedicated to its restoration as the ruling philosophy in the United
States. In the earlier volume, Dionne granted that liberalism had
failed and that conservatives were the ones providing answers.
Traditionalists had answers on value questions and libertarians had
them on economic ones. He even recognized the "fusionist" attempt
to harmonize both, although he ultimately said the contradictions
between the two wings would lead to failure. He proposed a vaguely-
defined New Democrat alternative to liberalism that would fill the
void, and Bill Clinton appeared to claim its mantle.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With the disappearance of the New Democrat, the world has
changed for Dionne. Now he calls the conservative formula that
places liberty as the highest value in the political sphere and
virtue as the highest in the social realm, "ingenious"--making one
wonder whether he understood conservatism as well as it seemed in
the earlier book. In any case, he ignores it and invents a New
Conservatism this time. Both "new's" are misleading. We now
discover that a New Democrat really is an old progressive, both
from Bill Clinton's performance--with constant cheering from Dionne
in the Post--and from the author's present forthrightness. New
Conservatism is more mischievous. It is a caricature. Since the
thesis of his book is that the new progressivism will arise from
opposition to the New Conservatism, it would seem to follow that
the later cannot rise from what does not exist.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given Newt Gingrich's present standing in the polls, it should
not surprise that New Conservatism is identified with him. But this
is not a Gingrichism that the Speaker would recognize. It "harks
back not to Ronald Reagan but to the Gilded Age of the 1890's." It
is created by collecting some ideas Gingrich does have about the
future and the communications revolution and transforming them to
his entire philosophy. New Conservatism simply means "accelerating
the economic transition" and embracing the dog-eats-dog social
Darwinism of William Graham Sumner and the Gilded Age.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not only is this an outrageous simplification but it borders
on the dishonest. This is most easily seen in the author's
treatment of Marvin Olasky. He is pictured both as part of the
"ingenious" (but failed) new fusionism and as part of the Gilded
Age because he says 1890's volunteer charity should be the model
for modern reform. Now reflect on that for a moment. A man who
advocates more reliance upon private charity is deemed a social
Darwinist, a philosophy that disapproves of social work because it
helps the less fit to survive--quite a slight-of-hand!
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne even has the gaul to resurrect old Robert McCloskey's
xenophobic simplification of the period as objective proof. He
admits that Gingrich does "bow" to traditional values, institutions
and to Olasky but shrugs it off. He will not make the obvious
conclusion that Gingrich is following the traditional formula, if
in somewhat idiosyncratic terms. Rather, Dionne needs a strawman to
demonstrate that where there is a Gilded Age, there must follow a
Progressive one. After all, that is how it all progressed once
before. So has historical determinism degenerated for the modern
liberal.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The contortion of progressivism is just as bizarre. After
doting on John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Croly and the rest of
the progressive pantheon, he does admit that "Progressivism's
critics have identified critical flaws in Progressive thought that
have haunted the liberal project through to the Great Society and
the present day," especially the problem that its elitist-experts
manipulate central bureaucracies rather than trust ordinary people.
The solution to Dionne is a more reasonable progressive power that
will be more sensitive to the needs of private organizations. Yet,
of his seventeen proposals, only one is not straight old-time
centralized government bureaucracy. Two of Dionne's major proposals
are a national health system and improved pensions. He ignores that
the existing national health programs of Medicare and Medicaid and
the Social Security pension programs are at the center of the
crisis even he must admit now is facing liberalism. After all,
these were the ultimate progressive creations and now they are in
absolute bankruptcy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne admits that conservatives have been correct to
emphasize private mediating institutions like family, church and
associations as superior to expert bureaucrats for many social
tasks. But he still requires that the experts must direct them.
Besides, he says, they do not operate under the "logic" of the
market. But it is Dionne who identifies the market with social
Darwinism, not understanding that the real logic of both business
and private welfare institutions is freedom to operate without too
many restrictions from experts wielding government power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No, the only way to give the private, voluntary organizations
vitality is to get the centralized bureaucracy's experts off their
backs. Send the programs back to the states and the people, which
is the real new and old conservative program. Dionne cannot
resurrect progressivism on these grounds. He contrasts a strawman
conservatism to what progressivism would be if everything worked
perfectly, as if there were no fruits of its ideals. But the show
is over as the progressive programs fall one-by-one, recognized
bankruptcies one and all. Conservatism may have its Buchanan schism
but, if Dionne is the best and the brightest, progressivism not
"only looks dead;" it is.<p><br><p>

columnist for CEO Magazine.  He hosts a weekly television program entitled FocusPoint for National 
Empowerment Television (NET) and various broadcast stations.
<p>
	Pete du Pont chairs the Strategic Advisory Committee, which advises Speaker Newt Gingrich on 
key strategic issues, and was appointed to the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform,

Policy Analysis and Chairman of the National Review Institute, public policy analysis organizations 
promoting free enterprise and conservative governmental policies.   He has served as Chairman of the 
Hudson Institute and was the founder of GOPAC, the Republican political action committee.
<p>
	Pete du Pont began his political career in l968 with his election to the Delaware General 
Assembly.  In l970, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for six years.
<p>
	In l976, Pete du Pont won the race for Delaware Governor against the Democratic incumbent

substance-to-blather ratio among candidates, even on subjects as sensitive as agriculture policy and Social 
Security."
<p>
	Upon his withdrawal from the 1988 race, Scripps Howard News Service noted, "More than any 
rival in either party, du Pont had the courage to tell specific interest groups what they least wanted to hear.
<p>
	Rush Limbaugh recently stated Pete du Pont...[is one of the] people who have paved the way 
for me to succeed.<p>

<title>Pete Du Pont--GOP CONVENTION--08/08/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/">
<img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p>
<i>Thursday, August 8, 1996</i><p>


<h2>GOP Convention</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

For the past year, the Republicans have been a fractious lot.  The 
Gingrich conservatives have argued with the liberal Senate 
Republicans.  The presidential primaries were nasty.  Abortion is an 
issue that splits the party into warring factions on a weekly basis.<p>

So it is none too soon that Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole 
has centered his campaign on an issue nearly all Republicans can agree 
on - tax cuts.<p>

Given the continuing debate between the party's supply-siders and 
deficit hawks, that may seem a strange statement.  But who better to 
preside over a tax-cutting administration than Bob Dole, the deficit 
hawk?  <p>

Supply-siders can be pleased with the prospect of new economic growth 
stimulated by the Dole tax cuts.  The deficit hawks can be pleased 
because Dole's own credentials offer them assurance that he will give 
equal attention to curbing government spending.  <p>

And the entire Republican party - supply-siders and deficit hawks 
alike - can stand on a plan for running government in the years ahead 
that combines the two most important elements of a stronger economy, 
lower taxes and the reduced growth of government spending.<p>

Both of those elements are also vital to another Republican goal:  a 
balanced budget by the year 2002.<p>

The Dole plan includes a 15% across-the-board personal income tax rate 
cut over three years, halving the capital gains tax rate, repealing 
the 1993 Social Security benefits tax increase, expanding the 
availability of Individual Retirement Accounts and giving families a 
$500 per child tax credit.  Altogether the cuts are projected to 
reduce government tax revenue by $548 billion over six years.<p>

Tax cuts are more than simply politically popular.  Dole doesn't have 
to be a supply-sider to be aware of what scholarly studies conclude 
and recent history confirms - that the right kinds of tax cuts 
stimulate economic growth.  The longest periods of sustained economic 
growth in the United States have followed tax cuts.  After the Kennedy 
tax cuts in the 1960s, the economy grew by 42% over seven years.  
After the Reagan cuts of the 1980s, the economy grew by 33% over seven 
years.<p>

Economist Gerald Scully, a Senior Fellow at the National Center for 
Policy Analysis who has done extensive analysis of taxes, has 
concluded that maximum economic growth occurs when government at all 
levels takes between 21.5% and 22.9 % of the nation's output of goods 
and services in taxes.  Currently, the federal government alone takes 
20.5 % - and the Congressional Budget Office expects the economy to 
grow by only 2.2% this year.  Real gross domestic product grew only 
1.3 % last year.<p>

President Clinton may see that kind of economy as "the soundest it's 
been in a generation," but it is not growing rapidly enough to provide 
Americans with economic opportunity.  <p>

Dole projects that the stimulation of enacting his tax cuts will push 
annual  economic growth to 3.5%, generating millions of jobs, a 
lasting expansion and more opportunities.  But the Dole proposal needs 
only a third of that increase to succeed.<p>

Clinton officials will likely jump on the bandwagon, arguing that they 
will now enact the middle class tax cut they promised four years ago.  
But for the moment, they are pushing the familiar theme of economic 
class-warfare.  Those who pay the most taxes will benefit the most 
from the tax cuts, they say.  True, of course, but that argument may 
not resonate so well with taxpayers who conclude that everybody is 
getting a fair share of the reductions.  Dole will touch some 
responsive chords with the theme he sounded last weekend when he said, 
"I was thinking of the husband and wife who both work, who have little 
money to save for their children's education after they pay their 
bills."<p>

Maybe Dole decided on tax cuts simply as a political tactic.  If so, 
this is one time when good politics is also good policy.  And a 
President Dole would be unlikely to lose sight for a moment of his 
goal of a balanced budget by 2002.  Given the tax cuts, this deficit 
hawk would of necessity have to go after government spending with a 
zeal that hasn't been seen in the White House since ... well, ever.<p>

The Information Warriors
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<P>
The American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Heritage 
Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Urban Institute, and the 
National Center for Policy Analysis.  Who are they?  Some of America's 
"think tanks."  What are they?  In the battle of public policy ideas, 
they are the information warriors, and they are changing the way 
America thinks.
<P>
In times past legislators often relied on academics and industry-
supported researchers to supply them with information and answers 
about some of the leading public policy questions.  But increasingly 
both liberal and conservative legislators are turning to private, non-
profit research institutes, commonly known as think tanks, for the 
information they need to carry on the public policy debates.
<P>
Most of the public policy debates in Congress and in the state 
legislatures begin as ideas about what the "good society" should be 
like.  For example, should the government ensure that everyone has a 
right to health care, free education, and a good job?  Or should we be 
a society of limited government?  Should the government, through its 
economic policies, try to create an egalitarian society?  Or should it 
be indifferent as to who the winners and losers are, and just ensure 
that everyone plays by the rules?
<P>
The founders of most think tanks had some vision of that good society 
when they formed their organizations, and that vision usually pervades 
the institutes' policy recommendations.  So the analyses they produce 
have been well thought through.
<P>
As a result, the ideas behind public policy proposals and the debate 
over the social or economic impact of those proposals are increasingly 
being fought between these new centers of influence.
<P>
For example, the Clinton health care plan.  The legislative defeat of 
the Clinton health care plan came in September and October of 1994, 
but the ideological battle was fought for the two preceding years 
between liberal think tanks that supported the plan and free-market 
think tanks that opposed socializing the American health care system. 
<P>
On this issue, the free-market think tanks won a clear and decisive 
victory.  But for the longest time, they were the only troops in the 
field.  The media were absolutely convinced that some version of the 
Clinton plan would pass, and even some conservative Republicans 
thought they saw the handwriting on the wall.  National organizations 
such as the American Medical Association and the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, which should have vehemently opposed the plan, cozied up to 
the administration in order to get a "seat at the table."
<P>
By contrast, the National Center for Policy Analysis (with which I am 
associated), the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and several 
other research institutes immediately raised questions about the plan 
and began to provide in-depth analysis of the economic problems that 
would arise if the Clinton plan were implemented.  Those educational 
efforts laid the groundwork for the American people's utter rejection 
of the Clinton plan.
<P>
Currently, Medical Savings Accounts are the most controversial  health 
care  issue before Congress.  MSAs are tax-free personal savings 
accounts used to pay for small and routine medical care, while a 
catastrophic health care policy pays for major expenses.  
<P>
While the battle rages today, the idea is not new.  As far back as 
1984, the National Center for Policy Analysis was promoting a 
variation of this idea, which was eventually endorsed by a number of 
think tanks across the country and passed into law by nearly 20 
states.  
<P>
In addition, the educational efforts about MSAs has resulted in 
perhaps 2,000 businesses adopting some version of an MSA plan.  As a 
result, a whole new market for health insurance has arisen, spurring 
the industry, especially the small-and medium-size insurance 
companies, to consider innovative ways to meet the demand. 
<P>
But these battles were small compared to what is coming.  Both 
liberal- and conservative-oriented think tanks are gearing up for two 
of the biggest public policy battles yet - privatizing Social Security 
before it becomes insolvent and reforming the income tax system to 
make it fairer, less complex, and more conducive to economic growth.
<P>
Both battles will make the past debates look mild by comparison.  It 
may be years before we are able to reform either system, but the 
debate is beginning now as the think tanks prepare their arguments.
<P>
In the '60s and '70s, the liberal think tanks were winning the public 
policy battles.  In the '80s and '90s, the conservative institutes 
have had the upper hand.
<P>
Now, more than ever, think tanks matter.  They are influencing our 
economy and our society as they develop the ideas behind the policies 
<P>
that drive the politics of America.

Good Intentions and Bad Policy
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No matter what your sixth grade teacher or My Weekly Reader said, 
America is not running out of space to put its garbage, recycling is 
not always good, and the world is not running out of resources.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The well-financed cultural mantra that recycling is both desirable and 
environmentally necessary has nearly become as much a truth beyond 
critical examination as that murder is wrong and that the earth is 
round.  Our schools have been full of it.  Mothers didn't even want 
juice boxes in school lunches because of fears that they couldn't be 
recycled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, it has become harder over the years to ignore the fact that 
sometimes simply throwing garbage away is more environmentally 
friendly, financially prudent - and safer for human health.  Now comes 
confirmation from an unlikely source - the New York Times Magazine.  
"Recycling is Garbage," writes John Tierney of the Times.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among other failings of recycling, it is frequently uneconomical. 
Tierney calculates that it costs more than $3,000 to recycle a ton of 
scrap metal, glass and plastic in New York City.  "For that price," he 
writes, "you could find a one-ton collection of those materials at a 
used-car lot - a Toyota Tercel, for instance - and drive home in it."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And, all things considered, you would need to use your ceramic coffee 
cup 1,000 times before it would be less environmentally expensive than 
a throw-away polystyrene cup.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For some materials, recycling is good, and businesses have long known 
this.  For instance, recycling aluminum cans requires 10% less energy 
than making them from virgin materials.   And more than 10 million 
automobile tires are recycled for retreads each year, reducing the 
energy used to produce tires by 30%.  But such success stories are not 
usually transferable to other forms of waste.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now, it would not matter if the true believers in recycling recycled 
away to their heart's content - except that they have been able all 
too often to make their beliefs public policy.  In 1986, about 10% of 
solid waste was recycled at little cost to consumers or taxpayers.  
Today, with  statutory mandates  in many  communities, about 25% is 
recycled.  But achieving that level has been costly and the programs 
lose money.  Most states  initially  set even  higher  goals, such as  
50%  in  New York  and California,  60% in New Jersey, and 70% in 
Rhode Island - but none achieved them.  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
recently declared New York's legislated goals "absurd" and 
"impossible."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At today's prices, curbside recycling programs typically add 15% to 
the cost of waste disposal.  One should remember that every dollar 
spent on inefficient recycling and waste reduction efforts is 
unavailable for other important social programs, including other 
environmental protection efforts.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the zeal to mandate recycling and the use of recycled 
products has created worse environmental and health hazards than the 
problems they were meant to solve.  For instance, government mandated 
recycling of newsprint requires de-inking - involving the use of 
toxics that create worse disposal problems.   In February, the 
Associated Press reported that a county road in Washington state was 
closed because smoke and fire kept bursting through its surface.  The 
roadway had been built with recycled tires that began to rust as rain 
seeped beneath the road's surface, causing heat, impenetrable clouds 
of steam and eventually fire.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By anointing recycling as the preferred method of disposal, 
environmentalists ignored technological, geographic, economic, and 
social limits to its usefulness.  In Wyoming, where transportation 
costs are high and land is cheap, it may make less sense to buy and 
use recycled paper than it does in New York.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Legislated mandates for the use and purchase of recycled products have 
wasted taxpayers' money, cost consumers both at the point of purchase 
and by limiting product options, dampened the development of resource-
saving technological innovations, and on occasion harmed the 
environment.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't we need to recycle because we're running out of scarce 
resources?  Hardly.  Technology makes it possible to use resources 
without exhausting them, which is why the prices of most natural 
resources, as well as food, have been falling for decades.  One 
example:  A fiberglass cable made with 25 kilograms of sand (about 55 
pounds) can carry 1,000 times as many messages today as a wire made 
with a ton of copper.  So copper prices are down, and its supply in no 
danger of depletion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And if throwing something away is the best choice, there is room to do 
that, too.  If we keep generating garbage at current rates for 1,000 
years, how big would a landfill 100 yards deep need to be to hold it?  
Just 35 miles square.

<h2>
The Best Campaign Finance Law: Repeal Spending and Contribution Limits
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Memo to true believers in campaign finance reform:  The only way to 
ensure fairer, freer elections is to get rid of the campaign spending 
laws.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Completely.  Require full disclosure of all contributors, but nothing 
else.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our present campaign finance laws are ridiculous.  As a case in point, 
Ross Perot, who spent $60 million of his own money running for 
president in 1992, can get $32 million of taxpayers' money for a race 
this year if he'll hold his personal spending to less than $50,000.  
But if Perot's Reform Party picks somebody else to run, that candidate 
may not get any taxpayers' money.  Or maybe he or she will get $32 
million after all.  The Federal Election Commission hasn't decided.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or look at publisher Steve Forbes.  He can spend a million dollars of 
his own money to run himself, but is not allowed to contribute it to a 
candidate he believes in - like Jack Kemp.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Barbra Streisand or Whoopi Goldberg can make appearances worth tens of 
thousands of dollars to candidates, but a successful CEO cannot give 
the same amount to candidates of his or her choice.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The AFL-CIO can spend $35 million on advertising against incumbent 
Congressmen, but to defend themselves those candidates must raise 
money in $1,000 or $5,000 bites.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our current campaign laws are a failed idea; complex, ineffective, and 
manipulated by a political bureaucracy called the Federal Elections 
Commission.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The reforms currently being touted include banning political action 
committees (PACs), restricting "bundling" (where individuals have one 
person deliver their contribution checks on behalf of a group), 
requiring Senatorial candidates to raise 60% of their funds inside 
their state, and outlawing "soft money."  Proponents recognize that 
banning PACs almost certainly is unconstitutional, so there's a 
fallback provision limiting their contribution to a candidate to 
$1,000.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The goal of all these proposals is to limit the influence of people 
and groups with money on the electoral process.  It might work if 
campaigns were conducted in a vacuum.  But they aren't.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Limiting the size of contributions works to the benefit of incumbents, 
or organization or party candidates, who already have in place the 
database and the organization for mass solicitation.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As Bradley A. Smith wrote in the January issue of the Yale Law 
Journal, "Reform proposals inherently favor certain political elites, 
support the status quo, and discourage grassroots political activity.  
Even if these proposals worked as intended, they would have an 
undemocratic effect on American elections."  To put it differently, 
campaign spending laws protect incumbents and special interests.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Besides, there really is no evidence that small contributions from 
large numbers lead to more representative government with less 
corruption, or that the numbers of small donors are an indication of 
the sentiment of the general electorate.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Eugene McCarthy would have found it difficult at best to conduct his 
antiwar campaign in 1968 without the six-figure individual 
contributions from backers Jack Dreyfus Jr. and Stewart Mott.  The two 
presidential candidates who have been most successful at raising money 
from small contributors were Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George 
McGovern in 1972.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Abolishing PACs may win cheers from reformers, but Francis Wilkinson, 
communications director for Democrat Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful 
Senate campaign, noted in a New York Times op-ed article "the impact 
on the 28,000 nurses who contribute an average of $46 a year to the 
American Nurses Association PAC to have a voice on issues like health 
care. ...For them, a PAC affords a convenient avenue of participation 
and a chance to exercise power they could not wield as individuals."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Campaign finance restrictions are a relatively recent development in 
American politics.  Is it coincidental that their growth parallels a 
decline in public confidence in government?  Maybe not, but certainly 
the campaign finance laws haven't done anything to raise confidence.  
And there is no evidence that we are better off because of them.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead of trying to fix campaign spending limitations, let's get rid 
of them.  Let people know how much money a candidate has received and 
who the big contributors are, and let them make up their  own minds 
about whether the candidate should get their vote.  One thing for 
sure, that approach would be an improvement over what we have now.

Chicken Little Lives
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Chicken Littles who had the last word on the International Panel 
on Climate Change tell us that the sky is falling again.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The panel of scientists comprising the IPCC recently reported on the 
state of, and potential outlook for, earth's climate.  Doubts, 
disagreements and contradictory data can be found in the body of the 
report.  But the group who wrote the executive summary, the only part 
that will be widely read, pretty flatly assert that humans are causing 
global warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Based on the executive summary and the policy options presented in it, 
environmentalists say the world's governments must take drastic action 
now to halt the cataclysmic consequences of such a change.  Analysts 
at the World Watch Institute, for example, call for an overhaul of our 
energy and transportation systems, ending the fossil fuel economy.  
Such policies would cost our nation billions of dollars.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before we head for cover, let's consider whether the sky really is 
falling, or whether some Chicken Littles in the ranks of scientists 
have been led down the garden path by a figurative acorn, in the form 
of computer climate model data, falling on their heads.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proponents of the theory of global warming, or, as is now fashionable, 
"global climate change," depend on two bits of evidence and computer 
models.  First,  ground-level measurements of global mean temperature 
indicate that earth has warmed between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees Celsius in 
the last century.  Second, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a primary 
greenhouse gas (those gases without which most animal and plant life 
would not exist), has increased by approximately 25 percent in the 
last century and a half.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you put these facts in the computer models, global climate change 
theory says that the earth's current warming is due to the increase of 
CO2 in the atmosphere, caused primarily by the use of fossil fuel.  
According to the models, absent a severe and immediate reduction in 
the level of CO2 put into the atmosphere, the earth will warm further, 
causing all manner of calamities from melting polar ice caps which 
would raise ocean levels, flooding small islands and coastal regions, 
to increased hurricane activity and severe droughts, which would cause 
massive crop failure.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IPCC report's executive summary predicts that if no further action 
is taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we can expect an increase 
in temperature somewhere  between 0.8 and 3.5 degrees Celsius over 
the next 100 years.  Interestingly, this figure is well below the amount 
of warming forecast just four years ago.  In fact, with every new report, 
the range of warming falls.  At this pace, in a few years scientific 
doomsayers will be talking about the next ice age again.  (We haven't 
forgotten that that was this same group's doom and gloom scenario in 
the 1970s.)
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the current figure is correct, the increase is well within the 
natural range of known temperature variation over the last 15,000 
years.  Most of the earth's plant life evolved in a much warmer, CO2-
filled atmosphere.  In fact, the predicted warming would affect 
primarily night-time temperatures, lessening the number of frosty 
nights and extending the growing season.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, there is little evidence that increased CO2 has had more than 
a small part to play in this century's temperature increase.  Most of 
the warming occurred before the 1940s, before the widespread use of 
automobiles.  In fact, from 1938 to the present, we have actually 
experienced a cooling trend.  Indeed, satellite data, the most 
reliable climate evidence that we have, show no evidence of warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why do scientists agree that we must take drastic action now?  
Well, they don't.  Some scientists are proclaiming impending disaster, 
but others of at least equal repute say the evidence of global warming 
is questionable at best.  So this is not a question of proven science 
versus a bunch of know-nothings.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And why do they agree, as the executive summary says, that we should 
take drastic action now to curb fossil fuel use, limit economic growth 
in established countries, and condemn less-developed countries to 
continue in their less-developed circumstances, and increase 
unemployment and misery all around?  They don't agree with that 
either. Even some of climate change theory's foremost scientific 
advocates acknowledge that there is nothing we can do now to prevent 
global climate change that we won't be able to do 10 years from now.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A far better course of action is to keep studying, keep learning, and 
keep improving our data until we understand what, if anything, is 
really happening.  Then we can take action that will allow economic 
growth and a higher standard of living and keep our planet livable.  
Both must be accomplished together; we must not sacrifice one to 
achieve the other.

<h2>
Cut Taxes, Help the Economy, Win the Presidency
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
As Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.  And sometimes 
very quickly.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Barely a month ago, on April 29th, Bruce Bartlett, formerly at the 
Treasury Department and now a Senior Fellow with the National Center 
for Policy Analysis,  put forth a simple idea:  cut personal income 
taxes 15% across the board.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Why a 15% cut?  Because that would bring the government's share of the 
nation's gross domestic product back to about what it was in 1992, 
before President Clinton took office.  In Bartlett's words, "In the 
first three years of the Clinton administration, Americans have paid 
$151.1 billion more in taxes than if federal receipts had remained at 
their 1992 level as a share of gross domestic product."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett had the inspiration after he saw recent Commerce Department 
figures that showed that more than one out of every three dollars 
produced by the American economy last year went to government.  At the 
federal, state and local levels combined, government consumed 31.3% of 
all national output - the largest share of GDP ever taken by 
government.  Even in 1945, with the country fighting and paying for 
World War II, total taxes only amounted to 30% of GDP.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett calculated that since Bill Clinton took office, personal 
income taxes have increased 1.6 times faster than the country's 
economic growth, as measured by GDP, and corporate taxes have 
increased 3.5 times faster.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Three weeks later, on May 20th, Bartlett could report that Bob Dole, 
soon to be the Republican nominee for president, was giving his idea 
serious consideration.  Dole has been a deficit hawk during his 
career, but history, politics and economic theory are all on the side 
of a tax cut - and that may be enough to sway him.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is historical justification for a tax cut now.  The increasing 
government share of output caused by bracket creep during the high 
inflation 1970s led to the Reagan tax cut.  For that matter, the high 
percentage of state output that was being taken by taxes in California 
was what prompted Proposition 13 in California in 1978 and the 
beginning of a nationwide revolt against state and local tax levels.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Political justification?   Well, there's the Reagan proposal in 1980 
for a 30% across-the-board reduction that helped him beat Jimmy 
Carter.   More recently, Christie Whitman came from behind to win 
election as governor of New Jersey in 1993 after she too pledged a 30% 
tax cut.  Further, that 15% figure represents a repeal of President 
Clinton's tax increases, so it should have some symbolic importance to 
Dole and the Republican Party.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The magic of a tax cut pledge is that it gives a campaign a focal 
point.  (After 1988, it's pretty safe to say that just pledging "no 
new taxes" is not going to be a vote-getter.)  For Republicans, whose 
agenda is less regulation, smaller government, and increased personal 
responsibility, a tax reduction proposal provides philosophical 
underpinning for all their policies.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Perhaps the most compelling justification, however, is economics.  
Because personal and corporate income taxes are graduated - the more 
money one makes, the higher tax percentage one pays - the tax burden 
increases as the economy grows.  To hold it steady as a percentage of 
the national economy requires periodic tax cuts.  Further, reducing 
marginal tax rates provides an incentive to earn more money, freeing 
up more dollars for saving and investment and stimulating economic 
growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"But," as the liberals (and moderate Republicans) are fond of saying, 
"what about the deficit?"  That argument was dealt a body blow  by 
Democrat Felix Rohatyn in the April 11th Wall Street Journal:  After 
listing our most serious economic and social problems, Rohatyn wrote:  
"Even though all of these require different approaches, the single 
most important requirement to deal with all of them is the wealth and 
revenues generated by a higher rate of economic growth.  John Kennedy 
was right:  A rising tide lifts all boats.  Although it may not lift 
all of them at the same time and at the same rate, without more growth 
we are simply redistributing the same pie." 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So how can Dole, as a deficit hawk, rationalize a tax cut? A 
successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing the 
growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic growth 
is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases take home 
pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax receipts. 
There aren't many problems that a 15% tax cut can cause that a 3.5% 
economic growth rate can't solve if you keep a handle on spending.  
Ideas do have consequences.  And Bob Dole's election could be the 
consequence of a proposal to cut taxes 15% across-the-board.

<html> <head> <title> du Pont: Whatever Happened to Environmental Policy Reform? -- 5/29/96 </title> </head>  <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">  <BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>  <i>  Wednesday, May 29, 1996 
</i>
<h2>
Whatever Happened to Environmental Policy Reform?
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The new Republican Congress roared into Washington and set out to 
change the rules of environmental policy.  Environmental reforms were 
going to be based on risk assessment, cost-benefit analysis, less 
business regulation and smaller environmental agencies.  Congress was 
going to prune back the oppressive bureaucracy and get the government 
off our backs.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Two years later, what has happened?  Not much.  The budgets of the 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department are little 
changed from previous years.  The EPA's 1996 budget is only 1.5% less 
than its 1995 budget.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The flawed Endangered Species Act continues in force unchanged even 
though authorization for it has long since lapsed.  The Safe Drinking 
Water Act, among the least controversial of the nation's environmental 
laws, has not been re-authorized.  Wetlands reforms are still nothing 
but a promise.  Commitments to improve individual property rights 
protections and to give more control over environmental matters to the 
states have largely gone unfulfilled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has even been unable to reform the one law widely cited by 
both Democrats and Republicans as perhaps the most flawed 
environmental program:  Superfund.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So why have the reformers failed? First, there was an image problem.  
Republicans focused on the cost to business of environmental 
regulation.  They talked about dollars and cents, efficiency, and 
decreased regulation, thus providing Democrats the opportunity to 
seize the moral high ground.  Defenders of the status quo frightened 
the public by painting reforms as the abandonment of basic 
environmental protection.  Talk about decreased business costs was no 
match for talk about threats to "children's health."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then there were election year politics. The President and 
Congressional Democrats calculated that it would be better for their 
election prospects to bash Republicans for their lack of compassion 
than to support positive bipartisan environmental reforms.  Democrats 
even refused to vote for environmental policies that they themselves 
had proposed and supported when they controlled the Congress.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then came the pollsters.  Republican pollsters found that the vast 
majority of voters consider themselves to be environmentalists. They 
also found that even Republican voters trust Democrats more than their 
own party on environmental issues. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But people who vote based on environmental issues generally think 
either that environmental laws need basic reforms that balance human 
needs with environmental protection, or that we must protect the 
environment regardless of the costs.  The former group has largely 
supported reform efforts.  Backing off environmental reforms threatens 
to alienate them.  Voters in the latter group don't trust Republican 
efforts and attempting to gain their support is a losing proposition.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But the main reason for the failure of Republican environmental reform 
goes much deeper.  It rests on the first rule of successful politics:  
you must present a positive vision for the outcome of your policies. 
While the reformers correctly pointed out the excesses associated with 
current environmental laws, they neither discussed environmentally 
appropriate goals nor provided a blueprint for attaining a better 
environment.  Simply put, they ignored the "vision thing."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
A positive environmental vision for the future is centered upon the 
solution to the tragedy of the Commons.  You remember the tale:  all 
the village cattle graze upon a jointly owned common.  It is in the 
interest of each villager to add more cattle to his herd, since he 
pays no price to use the common. Soon there is no grass left on the 
common, the cattle die, and the village economy fails.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The solution?  Give each villager an ownership stake in his portion of 
the common and he will graze only so many cattle as it will support.  
The village economy then prospers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Instead of the government regulating the trout stream, let the trout 
fisherman manage the lands and trout will flourish.  Let nature 
conservancies manage the bird sanctuaries and reap the profits of 
drilling for oil beneath them, and oil and fowl will peacefully co-
exist.  When the government bans the killing of elephants, poachers 
take them and the herds dwindle.  Let the natives own the elephants, 
and hunters are permitted a share, but the herds will grow under the 
watchful eye of people who have a stake in their growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Free markets produce more wealth, and free people are the best 
environmental stewards.  Wealthier societies have healthier 
populations and commit more resources to environmental protection than 
do poorer nations.  Freedom of people and markets is not only 
compatible with environmental health, it is essential to it. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
What the Republicans forgot is that beating up on regulators - no 
matter how well deserved - is no substitute for an environmental 
vision for the future.

<h2>
Eastern Europe and the Western Alliance
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil," Edmund Burke 
observed, "is for good men to do nothing."  While what has happened in 
Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 is hardly evil - 
communism was the evil - the fact is that good men have done very 
little to nourish the seeds of Western values in the freed nations of 
Eastern Europe.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
At a recent gathering of several hundred pro-democracy ministers and 
MPs from western and central European nations in Prague, Czech 
Republic President Vaclev Havel put it more bluntly:  "Six years have 
passed since the fall of the Iron Curtain.  It seems to me that little 
has happened during those six years and time is working against the 
Democrats.  Against those who want peace and peaceful cooperation.  
Unless Democrats proceed with greater vigor to build the European 
order, others will start to do so and we know who the 'others' 
are....The story of the former Yugoslavia should be a clear warning 
for  Europe and for the whole wor as to what can happen if there is 
too much hesitation."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The Congress of Prague, as the meeting was called, stressed the 
urgency of bringing Eastern European nations into the western 
alliance.  Its mission was "to reunite the family of western 
civilization, and so to ensure its future."  Lest this seem too 
pessimistic, consider that for 50 years, from 1939 to 1989, Central 
Europe was the battleground of our century's epic battle of freedom 
against tyranny.  With the flush of the victory of the west over 
communism, all seemed possible, and the integration of Russia's former 
satellites into the European community and its commerce seemed 
probable.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But it has not come to pass.  Instead, "Market reforms in the former 
communist countries are being slowed down or reversed.  Post-
communists now govern in all the former satellites except the  Czech 
Republic.  A former communist has replaced Lech Walesa as president of 
Poland.  The communists won 45 percent of the Russian Duma in the 
recent elections.  And Central Europe has seen its membership of both 
NATO and the EU postponed."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So what to do?  First, the economic base of western Europe must be 
expanded eastward.  The current strategy of European Union (EU) 
advocates - principally the French and Germans - is flawed.  A single, 
common-currency, Brussels-regulated European monolith, hard to join 
and with limited economic growth potential once admitted (the EU 
annual growth targets are the same anemic 2.5% as the U.S. Federal 
Reserve's), offers less hope for the future than a tariff-free trading 
group with harmonized procedures.  All the former European Soviet 
satellites should quickly become a part of such a group.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Second, NATO must be expanded eastward as well.  The Czech Republic 
and Hungary should be admitted now; Poland and the Baltic nations 
should follow.  The Russians, of course, are opposed, and have been 
saber-rattling against it ("Moscow plans pact with Belorussia if NATO 
expands" - May 15, 1996).  But as the London Times editorialized on 
May 14th, "The case for enlargement is one of principle:  that 
independent nations have the right to choose their own foreign and 
defense policies and allies."  Especially independent nations once 
enslaved by the very nation now objecting to their increased freedoms.  
Or in President Havel's words, we cannot allow "someone else [to] 
decide which countries should be allowed to join the Alliance and 
which should not."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Third, the United States and the newly enlarged memberships of the EU 
must move promptly to increase trade across the Atlantic.  A Trans-
Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) must be put on the agenda of the 
World Trading Organization.  If it does not receive favorable 
attention, the EU and NAFTA should begin direct discussions to further 
liberalize trade agreements.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
For seven years there has been a window of opportunity to bring 
stability to an area of the world that has spawned a century of wars.  
But it is closing rapidly; in fact, there is a chance that it may be  
slammed shut by the June elections in Russia.  The fears of central 
European nations of instability to the East are not groundless.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Lady Thatcher's address to the Congress of Prague provided a practical 
program:  "...to merge the North American Free Trade Area with the 
European community, including the countries of Central and perhaps in 
time Eastern Europe."  And a corresponding vision:  "We in the West 
won a great victory  the Cold War.  Let us not now forget why we 
fought.  The mission of this Congress is to recapture that sense of 
purpose and clothe it with practical action."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is an opportunity to bring the victims of this century the 
opportunities of the next one.  It must be seized before it slips 
away.

</i>  <h2>  Unfunded Mandates:<br>
 Congress Is Targeting Business Instead of Governments 
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has made it illegal for the federal government to impose 
unfunded mandates - requirements to take certain actions or provide 
certain services without providing the federal funds to pay for those 
mandates - on state and local governments.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfunded mandates have been a real burden in the past, forcing state 
and local governments to spend millions and even billions of dollars 
while members of Congress took the political credit for good deeds.  
For example, Columbus, Ohio, complained in 1991 that Congress was 
forcing it to spend $62 million to fulfill environmental mandates.  
The National Association of Towns and Townships estimated that 
unfunded federal mandates cost local taxpayers about $6.5 billion in 
fiscal year 1993.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The new Republican Congress with great fanfare put a stop to it.  Or 
so it claimed.  But the fact is that Congress hasn't really repented 
of its past sins, it has just changed its focus - from local 
governments to private businesses.  Congress' new mandate addiction 
can best be seen with regard to the issue of health care reform.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; People without health insurance sometimes develop a medical condition 
and then have difficulty finding an insurer to provide health 
coverage.  Although this is a relatively small problem for the U.S. 
health care system - surveys show that less than 1 percent of the 
population has been denied health insurance because of an preexisting 
medical condition - it is nevertheless real.  And its solution - 
Congressional mandates to help the poor and the ill - has irresistible 
political appeal.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But Congress does not have the money to solve the problem of the 
uninsurable, and under its new rule against unfunded mandates, it 
cannot tell the states to handle it.   So it has decided, through the 
Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act,  to tell health 
insurance companies - primarily those that write health insurance 
policies for individuals - that they must accept and pay the costs of 
medical care for the uninsurable.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While everyone agrees this bill will increase the cost of health 
insurance - the difference of opinion is only how much - Congress is 
not required to provide the funds to businesses.  It just tells health 
insurers what to do, takes the credit for solving the problem of the 
uninsurable, and passes the costs of the unfunded mandate on to 
business, and ultimately consumers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A second example concerns mental health.  Health insurance companies 
often treat mental health problems differently than they do physical 
health care problems, primarily because mental health science is much 
more complex and less understood than physical health science, and 
mental health illnesses less specific.  It can also be much more 
difficult to tell when a patient is "cured" of a mental health problem 
than of a physical ailment.  A broken limb can be seen to mend.  
Mental uneasiness has no obvious limits and can linger indefinitely.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result, insurers have been reluctant to give mental health care 
the blank check it has provided for traditional health care and 
insurance coverage for mental health services is much more limited.  
Some in Congress would like to solve that problem by telling insurers 
that their policies must cover mental health care needs to the same 
extent their  policies  cover other medical conditions. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once again, Congress praises itself for its compassion and passes the 
unfunded mandate - the costs along with the economic chaos  - on to 
private-sector businesses.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfortunately, health insurance isn't the only place Congress is 
considering imposing unfunded mandates on business.  Consider the 
recent struggle over increasing the minimum wage.  Congress wants to 
raise the cost of labor to both state and local governments and 
private employers, requiring them to pay the cost.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This is a perfect example of members of Congress appealing to the 
American public, explaining how concerned and compassionate they are 
about the plight of the low-income employee, and how Congress is going 
to solve the problem by raising their wages.  What they don't make so 
clear is that they intend to require business to pay for their 
compassion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Worse, the 23 Republican Congressmen pressing the Republican 
leadership to increase the minimum wage all voted for the unfunded 
mandates prohibition.  Most of them even voted against an amendment 
exempting the minimum wage from the unfunded mandate prohibition.  So 
much for candor in government. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Perhaps what we need is a Contract With America II, with a provision 
that would protect private companies from unfunded mandates the way 
the first Contract protected state and local governments.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Simply put, if Congress isn't willing to pay for something, it ought 
not require someone else to buy it.

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of 
popcorn.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Or if that strikes you as sensible, turn to Section 551 of the Freedom 
to Farm Act.  It creates the "National Kiwifruit Research, Promotion, 
and Consumer Information Act." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 <i>September 3, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. I </h2><p>

<i>We're told that the era of big government is over, but what about the era of judicial activism? When will that end?</i><p>



Constitutional law expert Richard Morgan predicts that the era of judicial activism is almost over -- and that, when the end comes, it will come rapidly. He likens this imminent, swift demise of an outworn orthodoxy to the sudden fall of the Soviet empire. "Just as political and social institutions that appear as durable as the mountains can collapse almost overnight," Morgan explains, "so, too, seemingly impregnable intellectual orthodoxies can suddenly stand revealed as so flawed that we're abashed at having accepted them for so long." Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, the Bowdoin College professor contends that "America is on the edge of such a collapse of orthodoxy in our thinking about the proper role of judges and judge-made law in our governmental process. Central to this change," he says, "is the demythologizing of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education."<p>

Before we can lay judicial activism to rest, we must first acknowledge the flawed nature of the Brown decision. "The collapse of Brown as a model for judicial behavior will resonate through many of the most contentious areas of American public policy," says Morgan, "from criminal justice and affirmative action to education and welfare reform: for Brown is the mother of contemporary judicial activism -- policy making by judges acting essentially as legislators, without any real justification from such ordinary legal authorities as statutory and constitutional texts, history, and precedent." Morgan charges that the Supreme Court decision that "overruled the people of Colorado in May with respect to homosexual rights, without any serious attempt to offer a constitutional reason for doing so, is only the latest example of the Brown style of judging."<p>

Morgan notes that "arguments undermining the authority of Brown as a model for judging have long been piling up. Right from the beginning, some of the country's most distinguished constitutional lawyers criticized Brown -and especially Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion, which relied on essentially sociological reasoning to brush aside 70 years of precedent and settled understanding as to the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment." The Chief Justice relied "neither on text, nor history, nor precedent," says Morgan, and "was, in effect, claiming for the Court the authority to revise the meaning of the Constitution."<p>

Richard Morgan maintains that the Court "attempted to dismantle segregation (a profoundly important end) by means that were profoundly wrong. Not only did this judicial fiat traduce democracy, substituting the will of the judges for decision by the people and their representatives; it disregarded fundamental constitutional forms (federalism, separation of powers, and the procedures for amending the Constitution prescribed by Article V)." The Brown decision "launched the modern era of judicial 'reform,' in which purportedly noble ends can justify even the most constitutionally suspect means." It's time, says Morgan, to admit the error in Brown.<p>

<title>Duplantier: NAFTA & Narcotics  -- 9/02/96</title>

 <i>September 2, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> NAFTA & Narcotics </h2><p>

<i>"The impact of NAFTA on the sale and distribution of narcotics within the U.S. was felt immediately. In the very first month after the treaty took effect in January l 994, there was a sharp rise in marijuana, cocaine, and crack in the streets and schoolyards of our towns and cities. "</i><p>

Former Mexican president Carlos Salinas "joined Bill Clinton in bulldozing NAFTA through," recalls William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade. NAFTA made perfect sense to Salinas, who with his family was "deeply involved in the drug trade and other criminal activities. Salinas is now hiding in exile," reports Gill; "his brother, Raul Salinas, is in prison, and Raul's wife was arrested in Switzerland for attempting to withdraw some of their laundered money from a Swiss bank." In addition, "several of Mexico's most prominent businessmen were linked to the Salinas family's crime ring."<p>

Gill charges that "the lucrative narcotics industry" has corrupted public officials south -- and north -- of the border. "Three former high U.S. Justice Department lawyers were indicted last year for helping the Cali drug cartel ship literally tons of cocaine into our country, most of it via Mexico," he reports. High officials in both the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service were "allegedly involved in drug and immigrant smuggling from Mexico." Drug trafficking generates an estimated "$30 billion in income for our neighbors to the south," says Gill. "Drug money is financing all kinds of businesses in Mexico and, no doubt, in the United States as well."<p>

The crime explosion NAFTA caused in Mexico is spilling over into the U.S. "Last year, there were 1000 slayings in the larger cities on the Mexican side of the border, most of them drug-related and unsolved," says Gill. "No one could possibly know how many murders in the United States are caused by the NAFTA-spurred increase in the drug trade. But they are bound to be in the hundreds, if not thousands, by now. Indeed, there is deep and growing interaction between the drug gangs in Los Angeles and other American cities and the drug lords and gangs in Mexico and Central America."<p>

Gill argues that "free trade is the primary driving force behind the crime wave that is sweeping the globe." Calling this crime wave "a crisis that threatens the very foundations of all civilization," he predicts that "the chaos emanating from Mexico now will sweep in stronger from China tomorrow. Already we are getting a foretaste of what Communist China and others in the East have in store for the U.S.A.," says Gill. "In May, Customs officers seized 2000 AK-47 assault rifles in California." Chinese agents had sought to sell these weapons to L.A. street gangs.<p>

"China is also exporting thousands of illegal aliens to this country," Williarn Gill reports. "Many come into Central American mini-states and are smuggled into the U.S. via Mexico." Gill warns that "the invasion from China could easily surpass the present 1 million or so Mexican illegals entering each year."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Special Ed: Kids go in, Don't come out -- 8/28/96</title>

 <i>August 28, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> SPECIAL ED: KIDS GO IN, DON'T COME OUT</h2><p>                           


     The budget for special education in New York City schools exceeds
     $2 billion, for just 135,000 students!<p>

     There's a lesson to be learned when "a school system that has
     made a fetish out of testing, counting, and record-keeping
     ignores the most important tests and statistics of them all: the
     ordinary measures of whether children are learning anything." So
     observes Kay Hymowitz in a distressing article entitled "Special
     Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," in the Summer issue of
     the Manhattan Institute's City Journal. "Two-thirds of special-ed
     students officially exiting in 1995," she observes, "dropped out
     instead of graduating."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that "only 5 percent of special-ed kids are ever
     'decertified' into general education." In other words, from the
     perspective of the students, the program is a colossal failure.
     It has, however, created enormous opportunity for the bureaucrats
     and attorneys responsible for complying with "a mammoth federal
     mandate and a 17-year-old consent decree." It has succeeded in
     "providing employment for members of the United Federation of
     Teachers." It has given poor parents an incentive for having
     their children misdiagnosed in order to obtain Supplemental
     Security Income. It has furnished a way for conniving
     middle-class parents to provide their children with "a private
     education at public expense." It's also proven to be a boon for
     those private agencies that "evaluate potential special-ed
     preschool students, and then, in 75 to 80 percent of cases . . .
     refer them to their own schools."<p>

     Hymowitz argues that "both the federal law and the apparatus
     dedicated to its enforcement rest on a largely worthless
     scientific model. The federal law asserts that such great
     progress in 'diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods'
     has taken place that, given enough money, all handicapped
     children can be educated effectively. Like a team of doctors,
     experts are supposed to 'diagnose' a child's malady and then
     recommend the proper course of treatment." Hymowitz reports that
     "the criteria for referrals and placement in New York City
     schools were far from uniform." There is no telling how many
     students have been misclassified. "A child might be called
     learning disabled in one school, emotionally disturbed in
     another, or not be referred at all in a third."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that learning-disabled, or L.D., kids "are
     overwhelmingly minority, poor achievers, and often behaviorally
     disruptive. Many have moved and changed schools often; many are
     chronically late for school. All this suggests chaotic home lives
     that clash with the ordered processes of learning," says
     Hymowitz. "Though both state and federal law clearly specify that
     the category 'learning disabled' should 'not include children who
     have learning problems which are primarily the result of . . .
     environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage,' those are
     precisely the children who are included."<p>

     Kay Hymowitz concedes that "we must do something for these
     children," but insists that special education "does almost no
     noticeable good for perhaps half the pupils it serves . . . and
     is forbidden by law to include them in the first place."<p>

<title>Duplantier: FDA is Stifling Medical Innovation -- 8/27/96</title>

<h2> FDA IS STIFLING MEDICAL INNOVATION</h2><p>                    





     Society offers numerous safeguards against unsafe medical
     devices, including: consumer awareness, free competition, private
     testing laboratories, and tort law.<P>

     "Today, in what used to be the Land of the Free, someone with an
     idea for a new medical device that might help alleviate a human
     health problem can't just test the device and market it (and
     accept responsibility for any adverse effects)," observes Dr.
     Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American
     Physicians and Surgeons. "First the people with the idea have to
     invest tens of millions of dollars . . . in government paperwork.
     Then they have to submit their idea to a Czar. A few years later
     their dream may lie in ruins because of the Czar's arbitrary
     decision. If they complain, the Czar might also impound other
     products they happen to have on the market."<p>

     Why isn't there more of a public outcry over this tragic abuse of
     government power? "The people who might benefit from the proposed
     new device will never hear about it," explains Dr. Orient. "The
     public might learn about an FDA error in approving something, but
     it's almost always safe for a bureaucrat to disapprove
     something."?<p>

     Writing in a recent issue of Priorities, a publication of the
     American Council on Science and Health, Dr. Orient notes that
     "devices subjected to this maddening approval system could save
     lives . . . or could mitigate serious disability." Nevertheless,
     the FDA denies access to them "for months, for years, or
     forever." There were roughly 5,000 such devices waiting to be
     approved in 1994, and there's no telling how many ideas were
     never even submitted "because their inventors were deterred,
     perhaps for lack of money, from even trying for approval. Often
     inventors just take their ideas abroad," says Dr. Orient. "The
     American lead in medicine," she concludes from this ominous
     trend, "may soon be a distant memory."<p>

     The FDA was originally established "to assure that drugs were
     properly labeled and not adulterated," recalls Dr. Orient. "Then
     its role expanded into proving the safety, and then the efficacy,
     of drugs. Now the FDA is into medical devices. Soon it will be
     dictating the practice of medicine."<p>

     The U.S. Constitution, needless to say, makes no provision for
     the FDA. "As with most of the ever-expanding powers of the
     federal leviathan, the pretext lies in the constitutionally
     mandated power of Congress to 'regulate commerce,'" observes Dr.
     Jane Orient. "This is surely not what the Founders had in mind.
     They thought of government as a necessary evil, a system needed
     to restrain evildoers; they definitely did not envision
     government as a do-gooder." Well-intentioned or not, governmental
     intervention has inevitable consequences. "As the power of
     government agencies grows, other protections wither or are choked
     off," Dr. Orient explains. "Consumers don't bother to think for
     themselves; they just trust the government to look out for them."<p><br>

<title>Duplantier: Treaty Threatens American Security -- 8/26/96</title>

 <i>August 26, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> TREATY THREATENS AMERICAN SECURITY</h2><p>                    

                  




     Why would anyone object to the banning of chemical weapons? Good
     question! Here's the answer.<p>

     The United States Senate is scheduled to vote soon on
     ratification of a treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention.
     This Treaty purports to ban the production and stockpiling of
     chemical weapons, which would seem to be a laudable goal. A good
     case can be made, however, that the Treaty will not achieve its
     expressed objective and that certain unintended effects could
     undermine our nation's security and threaten the personal liberty
     of American citizens. Analyst Baker Spring of the Heritage
     Foundation charges that the Treaty "contains serious
     shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable.
     But the potential damage," says Spring, "is not limited merely to
     national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden
     on American businesses and thus harm America's economy."<p>

     The Treaty would require American businesses to "prove to the
     U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not
     producing or stockpiling chemical weapons," Spring explains.
     "Failure to comply with these regulations could result in
     companies being fined as much as $50,000 per incident." But
     following the rules isn't cheap either. Complying with the terms
     of the Treaty could cost American businesses as much as $200
     million a year, says Spring. That doesn't include "potential
     indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the
     loss of confidential information." Spring stresses that the
     Treaty would apply not just to chemical companies, but to almost
     any business that uses chemicals, including "food processors,
     brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies,
     petroleum companies, and rubber companies."<p>

     "If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security
     interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American
     businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the
     inspection regime," concedes Baker Spring. "But to ask American
     businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by
     implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security
     makes neither economic nor security sense."<p>

     Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy agrees that the
     Chemical Weapons Convention will "seriously damage United States
     national security interests and impose a massive, new regulatory
     burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses." The Treaty, he says,
     "will do nothing to reduce the arsenals of terrorist countries
     and other nations hostile to the United States." Several such
     countries "have neither signed nor ratified" the treaty, observes
     Gaffney, citing Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea as examples.
     China has not yet ratified the Treaty; nor has Russia, "the
     country with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world."<p>

     Gaffney also consider the Treaty unverifiable. He worries that it
     "will forbid United States commanders from using tear gas and
     other riot-control agents to protect our soldiers in the field
     and minimize civilian casualties." And he argues that it "will
     create yet another international bureaucracy costing millions of
     U.S. taxpayer dollars every year to impose costly new regulatory
     burdens on thousands of U.S. companies."<p>

<title>Duplantier: SCHOOL ABUSE -- 8/16/96</title>

<h2>SCHOOL ABUSE</h2><p> 

[On March 19th of this year, 59 sixth-grade girls at a middle school in  
East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania were subjected to gynecological exams  
against their will and without the permission of their parents.]<p> 
 
"This whole unsavory incident provides us with one more reason why  
parents ought not to put their children in public schools, and another  
reason why the government ought to be kicked out of the education  
business," concludes education expert Samuel Blumenfeld in the June  
issue of his Blumenfeld Education Letter. "This is probably the worst  
case of public educators violating the privacy rights of students and  
parents that we have seen to date."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld warns that "the totalitarians among the education  
establishment are becoming bolder and bolder in their assertion that they  
own the children." Heretofore, it was "unheard of in this country for  
perfectly healthy individuals to be forcibly herded into a nurse's room,  
and told to strip and lie down on a table for an examination." Blurnenfeld  
associates such practices with Nazi Germany. "During World War II,  
when the Jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps," he  
recalls, "the first thing their captors forced them to do was strip. The  
purpose of the stripping was to deprive these captives of any notion of  
privacy or personal dignity. The stripping meant that they were now the  
property of their captors, who could do anything they wanted to them."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that the 59 grade-school girls in East Stroudsberg  
were similarly dehumanized. "The psychological damage done to these  
girls by the government of Pennsylvania cannot be undone," he contends.  
"They shall have to live with the traumatic consequences for the rest of  
their lives." Some good may come of the incident, however, if parents  
learn "that the educators cannot be trusted and that they will continue to  
deceive the public. The cavalier manner in which the school authorities  
say that parents were supposedly 'informed' of the planned exam, and the  
fact that the school cannot provide any evidence that such prior  
notification was indeed given, is an example of the contempt that school  
authorities now have for parents," says Blumenfeld. "It's as if they were  
telling them, 'We own your kids and we don't need your approval for  
anything we want to do with them."'<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that "this trend toward totalitarian enslavement will  
continue until such time as the American people put a stop to it. They can  
do so tomorrow by simply withdrawing their children from the  
government's national socialist schools and educating them at home or in  
private schools they can trust." He warns that public school officials now  
"feel so confident of their power to impose their will" on schoolchildren  
that they think they no longer have to obtain parental permission for  
anything. Samuel Blumenfeld urges all Americans to assert their parental  
rights before they lose their children entirely to the totalitarian state.<p>

<title>Duplantier:  FREON -- 08/15/96</title>

 <i>August 15, 1996</i><p>

<h2>FREON</h2><p>
 
[Twenty million American drivers will pay four times as much for air  
conditioning repairs this summer, and it won't make any difference to the  
ozone layer.]<p> 
 
"Federal law has banned production of Freon, the refrigerant used in  
more than 100 million automotive air-conditioners, in response to  
concerns about depletion of the ozone layer," says Ben Lieberman of the  
Competitive Enterprise Institute in a recent Washington Times  
commentary. "America's first post-phaseout summer is now upon us,"  
notes Lieberman, "and the news for consumers is not good. The price of  
existing Freon stocks is rising, and with it the cost of auto A/C repairs.  
Millions of car owners who will need A/C service are going to get very  
angry, especially when they realize that the excessive costs are both  
unnecessary and unfair."<p> 
 
The wholesale price of Freon was less than a dollar a pound five years  
ago, Lieberman recalls. Nowadays, that same pound of refreshing Freon  
costs upwards of $20. That's wholesale, too. The retail price is roughly  
double, and you'll probably need three pounds to fill your car's A/C.  
"Nearly all pre-1994 vehicles use Freon," Lieberman observes. "In  
addition to higher Freon costs, EPA regulations on the handling of  
refrigerants are time-consuming and require expensive equipment, adding  
to labor costs. In total, the bill for a typical automobile A/C repair has  
gone up by $100 or more."<p> 
 
Ironically, none of this extra cost or effort will have any real impact on  
the ozone layer. Most scientists have concluded that "ozone depletion is  
not nearly as serious nor immediate a threat as once predicted," observes  
Lieberman. "In fact, virtually every scary sounding prediction about the  
consequences of ozone depletion . . . has been qualified or abandoned by  
scientists." According to Lieberman, "The abrupt phaseout does not make  
sense. A few more years of limited Freon production to meet the needs of  
the existing fleet of Freon-using vehicles would have made little  
difference to the ozone layer, but a big difference to consumers."<p> 
 
Banning an efficient coolant may be a mania in America, but very few  
foreign countries are suffering from Freon phobia. "Although more than  
100 nations have signed an international treaty banning the production of  
Freon and other compounds," observes Lieberman, "developing nations  
have been given a 10-year extension, and few other developed countries  
are taking the phaseout as seriously as the United States. For example,  
illegal Freon is readily available throughout much of Europe, at a fraction  
of the U.S. price. Further, most countries have nothing like our  
Environmental Protection Agency's costly Freon-handling regulations."<p> 
 
But facts won't phase the phaseout. "Rather than trying to reduce the  
ban's costs, the EPA is loudly denying their existence," says Lieberman.  
"Most car owners have no idea how expensive their next A/C breakdown  
will be -- until it happens," he adds. The Freon phaseout is an  
unnecessary and unfair tax on everyone with a car made before 1994.<p>

<title>Duplantier: Corporate Welfare -- 08/13/96</title>

 <i>August 13, 1996</i><p>

<h2> CORPORATE WELFARE</h2><p>

<i>"Business research and development should be paid for by stockholders, 
not U.S. taxpayers."</i><p>

"When it comes to attacking the federal deficit," says Stephen Moore of 
the Cato Institute, "there is one area of the budget that both parties have 
come to regard as politically untouchable: corporate welfare." Moore 
reports that a recent Cato study "shows that Uncle Sam currently spends 
$75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Eliminating those 
subsidies would cut the budget deficit in half," he contends. "If Congress 
were willing to stop the giveaways, the feds would save enough money to 
make up for the complete elimination of the capital gains tax and the 
estate tax. Reducing the deficit or eliminating the anti-growth taxes 
would do far more to benefit American industry and U.S. global 
competitiveness than asking Congress to pick industrial winners and 
losers."<p>

Moore tells us who the lucky "winners" are. "About $10 billion to $15 
billion a year is spent on agriculture subsidies -- not to small family 
farmers, but to large agribusinesses, such as Archer Daniels Midland. The 
federal sugar program provides the owners ofthe 33 largest sugar 
plantations in America more than $1 million each per year and doubles 
the price of sugar to U.S. consumers." Who else is on the gravy train? 
"Another $8 billion to $10 billion a year subsidizes U.S. exporters," says 
Moore, "including such impoverished companies as Boeing, General 
Electric, and Westinghouse." And that's just a sampling.<p>

Moore chides the Congress for failing to make any significant reductions 
in corporate welfare, then takes the executive branch to task. "With few 
exceptions, the administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest 
corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress," he observes. "In fact, 
the administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in 
spending on business subsidies." Noting that "Republicans made a valiant 
effort to close down the Commerce Department, but the Clinton 
administration allied itself with lobbyists to fend off the budget cutters," 
Moore concludes that "the Clinton administration has proved itself to be 
corporate welfare's best friend."<p>

Moore contends that corporate welfare "corrupts both our free market 
system and our representative form of government. Corporate welfare 
converts the industrialist into a statist businessman, whose market is the 
political arena in DC, not consumers." Corporate welfare also "creates a 
bidding war for preferential treatment among businesses and industries," 
a process not conducive to high ethical standards among lawmakers. 
Corporate welfare appears to be counterproductive no matter how you 
look at it. "There is no evidence that business subsidies and industrial 
policy programs are at all successful in creating jobs or wealth," says 
Moore. "Even if they did, those benefits would almost never offset the 
efficiency loss from large tax burdens imposed on workers and 
businesses to fund the programs."<p>

Successful businesses do not require the financial assistance of American 
taxpayers. One of these days we're going to have to dismantle the welfare 
system, and we might as well start with the least needy.<p>

<h2>
Trade Revolution 1996
</h2>

<i>"Most Americans are still living and laboring under the illusion of 
freedom. But more and more of us know that our freedom has been sold 
out from under us by a totally corrupt government. "</i>
<P>
"America is frittering away the last shreds of its once inviolable and 
cherished sovereignty," says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. The mechanisms for ceding our nation's sovereignty 
to a global authority were established in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as 
NAFTA and GATT) "and a host of subsidiary actions via the UN and 
other international agencies," says Gill. "The list of actual and potential 
infringements -- and worse -- upon U.S. laws and the rights of our 
citizens ," he warns, "is literally endless."
<P>
Gill laments the ease with which a foreign country can "invade the United 
States with its exports and agents, with its products and services -- even 
with its own plants and equipment -- and skim off American capital and 
technology with the help of its American wage slaves." Under the 
circumstances, the United States can no longer "call itself a free and 
independent nation," he concludes. "Any nation that permits foreign 
interests to take over its plants and production, its farmland, and even its 
banks is no longer truly independent. Any nation that sacrifices the jobs 
and livelihood of millions of its citizens in order to absorb billions upon 
billions of dollars in imported goods from Third World countries . . . has 
already surrendered its claim to nationhood. Any nation that has already 
openly acknowledged that its own laws are subject to interpretation -- and 
even cancellation -- by an international tribunal such as the World Trade 
Organization or the United Nations . . . is no longer free."
<P>
Gill points out that our Founding Fathers did not labor under illusions as 
we do today. "In 1776 all Americans knew that King George III and his 
Parliament were the rulers of this country," he observes. "Today we are 
not even permitted to know who the real rulers of the supposedly 
independent USA are, let alone what they are up to in leading us toward 
world government. Along the way toward this goal, they have already 
surrendered our sovereignty in the unholy name of 'free trade.' They have 
also surrendered millions of our best-paying and most secure jobs -no 
less than nine million in the downsizings since 1990." Gill charges that 
our nation's self-destructive trade policy "has been fostered by such 
esoteric groups as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateralists, and 
the super-secret Bilderbergers."
<P>
If we want to save our country, William Gill advises, we must "stop the 
New World Order now -- before the Bilderbergers and other plotters have 
transferred the last vestiges of our sovereignty and independence to the 
United Nations via its subsidiary World Trade Organization." To protect 
American sovereignty, Gill's group, the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade, will soon file lawsuits seeking to nullify NAFTA and 
GATT.

August 2, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>
Good Business
</h2>

<i>The revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the 
everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century are rarely 
recognized.</i>
<p>
"Most businesses exist to make or sell things, not to engage in political or 
social commentary, act as a philanthropic foundation, or even . . . to 
employ people," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Focusing solely on the means by which businesses carry out their basic 
mission -- such as their employment practices, their participation in 
community or cultural life, or their waste management -- distracts us 
from the benefits that businesses confer on society." Writing in the 
August issue of Policy Review, Hood explains that businesses benefit 
society by inventing "new products, new services, new ways of doing 
business more efficiently. This they do better than other social 
institutions, such as governments or charities. And the impact of such 
innovations on our society is massive, often far exceeding the benefits of 
governmental or charitable action."
<p>
Why do so many Americans fail to recognize the enormous contribution 
that businesses make to our individual and general welfare? The 
prejudice of the press and the demagoguery of Democrats deserve much 
of the blame. Hood argues that "journalists and politicians thrive on bad 
news. They continue, for example, to decry the inequality of men and 
women in the workplace, and blast American companies for unfair hiring 
and compensation practices." In doing so, says Hood, they consciously or 
unconsciously ignore the fact that "business innovation historically has 
helped liberate American women. Technological advances have 
promoted greater equity in pay by reducing the value of physical strength 
and increasing the value of mental acuity and social skills, which are 
distributed more evenly between men and women. At the same time, 
labor-saving devices in the home have given married women more 
freedom to pursue education and employment."
<p>
Technological advances have also made the workplace safer, for both 
sexes. Hood notes that "automation and computers have improved 
workplace safety far more than has government regulation or union 
activists. Computers allow employers to track accidents carefully and 
devise solutions to systemic problems."
<p>
For reasons of their own, professional agitators "spend a lot of time 
talking about what they perceive to be the wasteful or destructive 
properties of goods and services, while ignoring their value to 
consumers," Hood charges. He cites one of the more telling examples of 
anti-business bias. "Critics of free enterprise denigrate plastic for being 
nonbiodegradable and polluting," he observes. "Yet, plastic is the 
essential ingredient of many of the products and services that make our 
standard of living possible, such as medical devices, telecommunications, 
wastewater treatment, transportation, safe and tasty food, and computers."
<p>
John Hood laments the fact that, "with few exceptions, those who create 
the amenities we enjoy and the innovations that make our lives safer, 
healthier, and happier toil in relative obscurity." He argues that "the real 
heroes of our age are the innovators who raise our standard of living and 
overcome the fundamental problems of humanity."

August 1, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>
Positives Of Pesticides
</h2>

<i>As usual, the mass media have gotten the story completely backwards. 
Far from threatening our health, the pesticides that control bugs, rodents, 
and plant disease have proven to be a boon to mankind.</i>
<p>
"Pesticides are not scary; they're wonderful. They rank equal to 
pharmaceuticals in saving and extending life. They save the environment, 
they save wildlife, they give the American housewife a roach- and rat-
free home," contends Pat Tigges of the Pacific Northwest Aerial 
Application Education Foundation. Tigges says she is "sick and tired of 
agriculture being on the defensive. We don't have to defend; we should 
be on the offensive," she insists. "Crop production technology has made 
our quality of life the envy of the world."
<p>
Radical environmentalists are winning the propaganda war, however, 
primarily because they've been the only ones waging battle. "The focused 
concerns of a few will take precedence over the unfocused concerns of 
the majority," Tigges warns, unless farmers -- and the American 
consumers whose larders they fill with inexpensive, unspoiled food -- 
fight back. Of particular concern, she says, is "new EPA-recommended 
legislation that would phase out consideration of benefits when 
establishing food-use pesticide tolerances." The net effect would be to 
raise the cost of the food we eat, while lowering its quality.
<p>
"The 'pesticide scare' is not about pesticides," Tigges insists, "it's about 
fear and control." She charges that radical environmentalists "use 
pesticide misinformation to create fear, from which they create a crisis, 
and a crisis generates funds. These funds are not spent saving anything. 
They are spent furthering a political and social agenda. The pseudo-
environmentalist leaders don't want to solve problems. They love 
problems. Problems give them more press, create more fear, and gain 
them credibility and money."
<p>
Fear mongers capitalize on the agricultural ignorance of the average 
American, but that ignorance can be overcome. "We can fight fear in 
children with education," says Tigges. "Children are afraid of the 
unknown. Farm pesticides are an unknown," she observes, "but 
household pesticides are not." Tigges fights fear in children by showing 
them that farm chemicals are similar to "things they touch and use every 
day in their homes. They aren't afraid of mom's shower cleaner; they just 
don't know it's a fungicide. They aren't afraid of pool chlorine; they just 
don't know it's a bactericide."
<p>
It's not just children who are afraid, but their teachers too. That's where 
Pat Tigges and the Pacific Northwest Aerial Application Education 
Foundation come in. "We teach teachers the truth," she explains. "We 
refute all the lies and misinformation that, for the past 30 years, have 
been repeated so often they are taken as truth." The foundation offers 
"continuing education classes, teacher conferences, in-service workshops, 
and structured farm fairs." Tigges and her colleagues come prepared to 
discuss "the history of the environmental movement, man-made vs. 
'natural' biochemistry, organic farming, Alar, and anything else a class 
wants to talk about." They know that minds, like farmland, need to be 
cultivated.

We were 35 minutes ahead of TWA Flight 800 on the runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But for a whim, we would have been on the later plane. A TWA flight to Rome, departing within minutes of ours, was cancelled. The Rome passengers were put aboard TWA Flight 800, to make connections in Paris. We were not aboard TWA because, at the last minute, our travel agent found a bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Close friends and family knew of our destination, but few knew whether we were flying with Delta or TWA. When we arrived in Todi, our hostess had been up most of the night, fielding calls from our friends in America -- wanting to know what she knew.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She had verified with a kindly Italian airline clerk that we were indeed on the Delta flight, that our names were on the manifest, that we probably watched "Grumpier Old Men" on the inflight movie. He reassured her and she relayed the news to America. We didn't learn of the TWA crash until we arrived in Todi.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We settled into the enchanting stone house overlooking the Umbrian hills, and called home. We thought our family would like to hear our voices. We knew we wanted to hear theirs. We spent the next few days and nights swinging helplessly between polarities of alternating emotions, haunted by images of a plane exploding, plunging through the night into the dark sea, taking with it 230 men, women and children -- fathers, mothers, daughters, sons who would never see another day.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Frugality saved our lives. At least that's what we told ourselves. But we could not escape the eternal question, a soulful and frightening version of the tragic challenge: Why us? Or more to the point, why not us? Frugality is not a virtue that spares lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Indeed, the night after we arrived in Todi we went out to an especially fine, and expensive Italian restaurant and there we spent far more on food than we saved with the bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Whatever we do now suddenly feels strange and precious. We are like children tasting a fresh fig for the first time, discovering the extraordinary in a blade of grass, a clay cup, a barking dog, the crunching sound made by the tires against the stones in the dirt road, the shapes of the white clouds scurrying across the sky as they begin to turn a beautiful shade of gray.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Everything is beautiful. Everything counts. We can't settle for the commonplace experience of a vacation. This vacation must mean something more. We feel compelled to testify to life, to our senses, to our appreciation of the world in all the wondrous variety of God's infinite gifts to man.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We celebrate with fresh bread and old wine, the trivial and the contemplative. Whatever we look upon and listen to is nourishment for the soul, linking us with others through succor and sustenance.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Umbria is a special place to think about the inexplicable. Its earthy colors, punctuated by acres of sunflowers and threaded with cypress trees, is a region of gentle, verdant, undulating hills and valleys where St. Francis of Assisi fed the birds. He was a man of prayer and penitence whose poetry in praise of all living things is a lesson to us still.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We rediscover the Sistine Chapel at St. Peter's. We look at Michelangelo's glorious fresco of God giving life to man. God barely touches man's fingertips and the spirit is suddenly tangible. We stand in awe of the vividness of the image, now illuminated in a gorgeous restoration of color. We ask again the eternal questions that haunt every thoughtful man and woman tormented for the answers to the questions about the meaning of life and death.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We do not find the answers. We say a silent prayer for the passengers aboard TWA Flight 800 and mourn with their families. We leave the Sistine Chapel chastened and uplifted, sobered if not wiser. The forces of evil and terror wound deeply and destroy with enormous power, but such dark forces ultimately have no power to smash the human spirit. <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<font size=7>Conservatism can close<BR>
Dole's gender gap</font><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is obsessed with the gender gap. All the pundits inside the Beltway say so. His gaffes, his turn-arounds, his flip-flops, his misspoken attitudes and waffles over abortion, the assault weapons ban, and a less-than-enthusiastic attempt to trash the affirmative action quota schemes that discriminate against the innocent, are meant to reach out to the women's vote.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>They aren't working. He's looking through the wrong end of the telescope. He's right to show tolerance for those with different opinions on abortion. His choice of Rep. Susan Molinari, an unusual one, as the keynote speaker at least sharply contrasts to the Democrats who wouldn't let Bob Casey, a former governor of Pennsylvania, even talk about his pro-life convictions in New York in 1992.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole's record as a pro-life senator shouldn't be discounted by pro-lifers simply because he has lately become inarticulate on the subject. But he desperately needs to re-focus on what pro-life and many pro-choice women agree on. A majority of women in both parties want to ban the infanticide procedure euphemistically called "partial-birth abortion." They want to be notified if their under-age daughter seeks an abortion.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Elizabeth Dole gave her husband good advice when she told him to look at crime as a women's issue. A majority of women favor the ban against assault weapons, but few expect it to have much impact on their lives. A majority of women, like men, want dangerous criminals locked up for longer. That's always been a strong Republican issue and Mr. Dole ought to ask Bill Clinton how he hopes to reconcile midnight basketball and curfews as an effective approach to crime. Such ideas are the work of an illogical mind and reflect a pandering politician.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Affirmative action hurts ambitious women, and there are lots of ambitious women in this country today. Furthermore, they vote. Bob Dole ought to gather the facts and talk to women who are naturally receptive to conservative fiscal solutions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One of the most fascinating stories lost in the debate over affirmative action is the way that women are smashing through glass ceilings. These women don't need affirmative action and, in fact, many of them could be hurt by it, especially those among the large numbers of female entrepreneurs with small companies who don't need meddlesome and burdensome government mandates.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women own and run a third of the businesses in the United States and 40 percent of all retail and service firms. According to the Public Interest, magazine women-owned and operated firms grew by 43 percent -- almost double the rate for all firms -- between 1987-1992 under Ronald Reagan and George Bush. These women also increased their payrolls by 100 percent, compared to 38 percent for all firms in the same period of time.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who look up and see only their reflections in the glass ceiling usually have made "quality of life" choices that determined their rank. Those who got in and duked it out like men are closing the wage gap, rapidly. Working women between the ages of 27 and 33 who have not had children earn 98 percent of what a man earns. A 2 percent disparity isn't fair, but it isn't bad and it's certainly not difficult to close.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who continue to earn less than men in their fields usually have chosen to work less and take off more time, mainly for the children. Women are more willing than men to give more points to "home and family" in measuring success, whether they work or not. These women especially appreciate lower taxes.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women, traditionally the moral arbiters of our society, are fundamentally conservative. Many are deeply offended by Bill Clinton on character issues and appreciate the integrity they perceive in Bob Dole. So far this moral outrage hasn't registered in the polls, maybe because Mr. Dole hasn't talked directly to them. Now is the time if he is ever to do it.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=6>The shattered fairy tale<BR>
of Charles and Diana</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><DD>The marriage and divorce of Princess Di and Prince Charles
is a fairy tale for our time. Their story has all the appropriate literary
ingredients.<BR><DD>Prince Charming may not be as gallant as we like our princes to be, and we
don't know whether Cinderella turned out to be so terrific either. We only know that the shoe
fit.<BR><DD>Royal watchers chatter about the many ways Prince Charles and Princess Di were
mismatched, but the original Sleeping Beauty was mismatched with her prince, too. She slept
through the last 100 years. At least Di was awake in the 1980s.<BR><DD>There's also a jealous
Other Woman in the Di and Charles fairy tale triangle. Camilla Parker Bowles is a mistress of
the prince, not the mean stepmother, but she gets no sympathy from the rest of us and deepens
our empathy for the hardships endured by Di. The princess once remarked with bitter wit: "There
were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded."<BR><DD>An angry Queen Mother also
pulls her weight against the princess, not letting her keep the title "Her Royal Highness."
That's a little like giving her back the glass slipper after it's broken, but at least she gets
to live in a palace.<BR><DD>Lots of fairy tales include dwarfs and rogues, unpleasant little
people who try to put something over on the princess and who frequently disguise themselves as
something finer. Does anyone doubt that Capt. James Hewitt, who kissed the princess and told the
world about it, and more, is such a stunted human being? The princess describes his "handsome
physique," but everyone thinks that such physical perfection must camouflage an ugly character
inside.<BR><DD>People in disguises in fairy tales are free to say outrageous things, half-truths
and lies, because the princess cannot see the wickedness within. Capt. Hewitt may later turn
into an ass, literally, reflecting his nature in outward form, but even without the tall ears we
can see that he's a donkey. When his tell-all book was published in London, Tory Member of
Parliament Sir Nicholas Bonsor said, "I cannot comprehend how he can still look at himself in
the mirror." Mirrors tell the truth. Snow White's royal stepmother discovered that to her
dismay.<BR><DD>I've been reading fairy tales (that's what happens when a grandson comes into the
family). Fairy tales are more illuminating and insightful during this pre-election season than
Bob Dole's inexplicable gaffes and Bill Clinton's "conservative" conversion pronouncements. One
man on the road to ruin, the other on the road to Damascus. (Read your Bible.)<BR><DD>I've
discovered what John Updike saw in a collection of Italian fairy tales: "They were the
television and pornography of their day, the life-lightening trash of a preliterate
peoples."<BR><DD>We're fascinated by the stories of Princess Di and Prince Charles for the same
reasons medieval men and women repeated fairy tales and for reasons these stories remain
popular. They're rooted in the reality of human emotion, both conscious and unconscious, an
awareness of wishes and desires that make us do strange and irrational things. They also grow
out of the culture and history of their time, at the upper reaches of society as well as what we
would now call the underclass.<BR><DD>No one -- certainly no one who has ever been part of a
couple -- believes any couple lives happily ever after, but it's fun to imagine they do. That's
no longer possible as newspapers, zoom lenses and an increasingly permissive society bring the
philanderings of the prince and the promiscuousness of a princess into our living rooms. You
might call this "defining deviancy up."<BR><DD>We no longer need to pretend that royal
personages act any different than commoners. But the British, unlike their American cousins,
must consider whether it's worth it to them to continue to support in such a lavish fashion a
modern royal family which creates such a cultural embarrassment. Americans may pay thousands of
dollars for faux pearls to turn Jackie Kennedy into faux royalty, but at least we don't pay
taxes to invent happy fairy tales we know aren't so.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>We get the leaders we deserve. Such cliche may be glib but it's not without insight.<BR><DD>The character issue is dismissed as irrelevant and hence unimportant, and Bill Clinton holds a large lead over Bob Dole. Explanations, such as they are, abound.<BR><DD>First, Bill Clinton has been through a trial by fire and is no longer burned. We knew that he was no angel, but 43 percent of the voters gave him a plurality to win in 1992. So who cares?<BR><DD>"Filegate" may change the polls in ways that the conviction of his business buddies in Arkansas did not. But that's certainly not clear yet.<BR><DD>Character and politics seem to have little to do with one another. The Democrats have succeeded in sticking unfair descriptions of "extremism" on the Republicans. Bill Clinton knows how to read the polls and promise the American people exactly what they want, which is what a lot of the extremists promised first.<BR><DD>The rap on Bob Dole, who nearly everyone agrees is a man of character and integrity, is that he cannot turn his virtues into victory. He hasn't persuaded the American people why he wants to be president. Besides, "he's too old." That may be inaccurate, but it's a powerful perception nonetheless.<BR><DD>Hence, better to elect a deeply flawed young man than a decent "old" man. Sophisticated Europeans understand this amoral approach. They could never understand how a successful president like Richard Nixon could be brought down by the clumsy cover-up of a third-rate burglary.<BR><DD>But Americans have been a deeply moral people in matters of money, sex and power. When a leader shows lapses in any one of these categories, we react by electing someone who is dramatically deficient in those vices.<BR><DD>Gerald Ford, a stolid congressman, conspicuous for his ordinariness, restored a measure of confidence to the office of vice president after Spiro Agnew disgraced it by taking money under the table. Jimmy Carter had lust in his heart, but he kept it there, and he was upright and virtuous in his personal habits, a sharp departure from Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, leaders whose private behavior was unscrupulous, promiscuous or unprincipled, or all of the above.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has surmounted scandals of sex, money, and power, at least so far. No one cares about Gennifer Flowers any longer and Paula Jones has been relegated to the wrong side of the tracks, beyond feminist concern. The Little Rock trials demonstrated that as governor Bill Clinton had criminal associates, but he has not yet been found guilty of anything illegal. Not yet.<BR><DD>In fact, the public appears to be extremely forgiving of Mr. Clinton. He could promise a middle-class tax cut in his campaign in 1992 and drop it completely after he won the election. He could seek the lifting of the arms embargo on the Croats in Bosnia, and once elected drop it. The voters don't care. Not yet.<BR><DD>Bob Dole supporters, down in the dumps about his poll ratings, insist that his ultimate integrity will win out if he's able to connect with powerful conservative issues that he has not yet articulated with any force -- slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, balancing the budget, school choice, English as our binding language and a foreign policy that won't suffer from "misguided romanticism." But they seem to be trying to persuade themselves first.<BR><DD>A fascinating book called "Character Above All" measures 10 presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush on elements of character. The most provocative essay is by David McCullough, Harry Truman's biographer. He reckons that "character counts in the presidency more than any other single quality."<BR><DD>Could we find another president like Harry Truman? "Who knows?" he replies. "Maybe somewhere in Texas she's growing up right now."<I><BR>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>When Hillary Rodham Clinton is tempted to give in to self-pity, she ought to consider her sisters of earlier White House imprisonment. She and Eleanor Roosevelt were neither the first nor will they be the last to suffer outrageous slings and errors. Nor are they the most "victimized," in the fashion of the day. This pouring of new whine into old battles does not become a first lady.<BR><DD>She can consider herself lucky by comparison to Rachel Jackson, who was so vilified by the supporters of John Quincy Adams that she didn't live to move into the White House. She had wanted to skip the inauguration of her husband, but Andrew Jackson's friends warned that she mustn't give in to her tormentors lest they enjoy a "chuckle" at scaring her away.<BR><DD>She made plans to come to Washington, only to be reminded that her enemies not only called her an "adulteress" (and worse), but described her as "fat, forty, but not fair." Old Hickory himself was 61, but that didn't count. Buying a ball gown wasn't much fun. Rachel grew depressed and fell sick before she left Nashville, fulfilling a wish she had announced, paraphrasing the Psalmist, when she heard that her husband had won the election: "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to live in that palace at Washington."<BR><DD>If it's a seance she wants, Hillary ought to run a short circuit to Mary Todd Lincoln, who also dabbled in spiritualism, even before there was a Psychic Friends Network, believing that she had supernatural powers to communicate with dead relatives. But despite Mary's confidence in her own prophetic powers, she couldn't foresee how wretched she would be as first lady.<BR><DD>Although she was loyal to the Union cause, many of her relatives, including two brothers, fought for the Confederacy. She was accused of being a traitor and a spy. The newspapers were merciless, even when Will, her 11-year-old son, died. Instead of showing the first lady a little sympathy in her grief, the newspapers attacked the style and "extravagance" of her mourning clothes.<BR><DD>Not only did Mrs. Lincoln endure the assassination of her husband, but when she became a widow, a Lincoln biographer argued, probably inaccurately, that Lincoln had only one real love in his life, Ann Rutledge, a woman who died before he met Mary Todd. On reading this, Mrs. Lincoln broke down and was eventually placed in a mental institution by a son.<BR><DD>Florence Harding, like Nancy Reagan, consulted an astrologer -- as a senator's wife, not as first lady. But why not? It was "Madam Marcia" who told her that her husband would become president of the United States and he would also have many sordid affairs. Madam Marcia was right on both counts. Futurespeak has a downside.<BR><DD>Mrs. Harding, like Hillary Clinton, was furious at those who protected her husband from her. President Harding continued to see Nan Britton, a favorite mistress, after he moved into the White House, occasionally partaking of Nan's favors in a coat closet adjoining the Oval Office. Once when Mrs. Harding heard that that woman was in the White House she set out to find her, and only because someone tipped his Secret Service detail did the president and Nan escape the wrath of "the Duchess."<BR><DD>Nor is Hillary the first first lady to make personal and public sacrifices to protect her husband. Bess Truman learned early in the election year of 1948 that the White House was collapsing, rotting from within. Mrs. Truman preferred to bear the accusation that she failed to initiate a formal social season than to give her husband's enemies the metaphor of a crumbling White House. The Trumans moved into the Blair House after he upset Tom Dewey, and the White House was renovated.<BR><DD>Jean Houston, Hillary's psychic friend, suggests that she carries the burden of 5,000 years of subservience to men, and compares her to Joan of Arc. Bob Woodward writes in his new book "The Choice," that Hillary "seemed jerked around by the muddled role of first lady as she swung between New Age feminist and national housewife."<BR><DD>The first lady cut short one session with Jean Houston to inquire into Chelsea's tummy ache. Thus a child's aching tummy brought the burden of 5,000 years of "female subservience" abruptly to earth -- where it belongs.<P><BR>

<font size=7>The rising tide of 'Wifewater'</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Hillary Rodham Clinton has done more for educating the public in the principles of modern feminism than Gloria Steinem or Betty Friedan, the early superstars of the movement.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She climbed to the nexus of power using everything it takes. Like many male wheeler-dealers before her, she took ethical risks which, now that they have come to light, are like curses. Chickens coming home to roost.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No wonder that she's taking a solo trip to Eastern Europe to celebrate the Fourth of July in Prague. Wicked wags in Washington say, unkindly, that she's looking for a country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For anyone who doesn't yet know her offenses, a quick read of the majority report on the Whitewater hearings will fill in most of the blanks. Many ethical lapses lead in and out of Vincent Foster's office and continue to fuel speculation not only about why he committed suicide, and where, but how his files mysteriously disappeared from his office with the help of Hillary's staff: "From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death," the committee says, "Mrs. Clinton and her key agents -- Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases --were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That means they dealt with papers about Whitewater and Travelgate that were -- and are -- potentially damaging to the First Couple, which the first lady knew were in Vince Foster's possession.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What we have here is a pre-White House/post-White House scandal in which Hillary Clinton is accused of hiding or destroying documents from her law firm, and for holding on to files when they were subpoenaed by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, two years earlier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"At every important turn, crucial files and documents 'disappeared' or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised," the committee charges. One of the most damaging bits of evidence are her fingerprints on the late-recovered billing records of the Rose Law Firm found in the White House residence last August. Although other fingerprints were found as well, the others are not those of anyone who was in that part of the White House the day the files were found.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's more, the billing records -- which Mrs. Clinton says she's "happy" were finally found -- reveal that Hillary lied about the amount of time she spent on the shady side of the Whitewater and Castle Grande land investments. She had the most to lose if the billing records were made public.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Naturally, the Democrats are trying to diminish the importance of her activities, attacking the committee report as blindly partisan. They'll have lots of time during the campaign to make their side of the argument. What may be more fascinating for the rest of us is to consider is how Hillary has played the cards handed to her, and its implications for the future course of feminism.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's abundantly clear is something many feminists are loath to accept. A woman in power -- however that power is obtained -- is little different from a man in power. She can use it for better or for worse, but being a woman has very little to do with it. Lord Acton's famous dictum applies to her, too: "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mrs. Clinton gingerly slides back and forth into mini-feminine dramas, putting on pink and granting interviews with favorite reporters to talk about menus and White House decor. Such appearances are carefully orchestrated for maximum political impact. Just as a man will occasionally use his "sensitive" side to highlight how much compassion he has, he knows that really power resides in his tough positions. No man knows better how this works than Hillary.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A chorus of friendly critics has frequently suggested that if only Hillary Clinton had come clean about Whitewater and Travelgate she could have quickly put it all behind her. This overlooks the possibility that maybe there was something to hide. You can only come clean if you are clean.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The First Feminist doesn't get the First Man off the hook, either. No matter what his wife did, Mr. Clinton as governor and then as president is responsible for her semi-official actions affecting the public good and bad, whether by arranging to have employees in the White House travel office cashiered, or in causing elderly blue-collar Arkansans to lose their savings in bad land investments.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The late, great Satchel Paige, who had a curve ball that could go around a mountain, used to say that it's dangerous to look back because "somethin' might be gainin' on you." If Hillary is brave enough to look back, she might recognize it.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BODY>
</center><DIV ALIGN=Right><FONT SIZE=2><B>LONDON</B></DIV></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've always enjoyed the comfort and easy convenience of the London underground. The tunnels and cars lack the grime, grunge and menacing quality we associate with most big city transportation. New York this is not. Not yet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But today the London subway is emblematic of the cultural changes that reflect a deterioration in manners, morals and civility that we've always associated with our ever-so-polite English cousins. Graffiti is everywhere. Litter is more prominent than it used to be. Rudeness is commonplace. A fear of violence lurks in spontaneous discourtesy.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I boarded a subway car on June 8 with dozens of young men heading for an important soccer match at Wembley. They wore the black leather jackets of hooligans, swigging beer from cans, unshaven and loudmouthed, singing rowdy drinking songs.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>When two English bobbies boarded the same car, these young men switched to verses of "Old MacDonald's Farm," drawing attention to "the pigs" with a boisterous "oink oink here, and an oink oink there." The bobbies showed their customary patience and forbearance, holding steady lest a riot break out. But it was scary as well as shocking to feel adolescent intimidation kept in check only by police firmness.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Brits worry about violence breaking out whenever their soccer team plays, and commentators are much in demand to lend historical perspective to bad behavior. But England is wary this month as it hosts "Euro 96," the soccer championships of Europe.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One professor, who directs the soccer research unit at Liverpool University, traces the roots for modern hooliganism back hundreds of years, when young English working men went abroad to fight. This is to explain how the fighting spirit lives on in the shrunken psyche of a small island nation. But soccer as the Crusades? Others argue that violence and aggression among the lower classes are psychological compensation both for Britain's poor athletes and bruising social realities. Wobbly legs made me do it. Or maybe it was Lady Thatcher.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>After this mindless drivel how can it hurt for a foreigner to offer her instant analysis? What seems to be at work is a growing tolerance for anti-social behavior such as we thought was rampant only at home.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I lived in London in the "Swinging Sixties"; I have no illusions about the coarsening of manners in the city once identified with propriety. But remembrances of the Beatles and Carnaby Street, miniskirts, mod ties and Chelsea mornings evoke a nostalgic high of innocence. We're talking about the loutish rebellion that has followed them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Behaving badly, loud swearing and filthy insults, drinking and fighting in what the stylish English critics have dubbed the "New Lad" culture has been elevated to a lifestyle of perverse glamour that's begun to upset even the cultural elites that created the monster.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The defenders of nastiness and the violent underpinnings of the "New Lads" are in cowardly retreat, hiding behind the feeble defense that they never expected their irony and wit to be drunk straight up as it was "democratized down."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The New Lad style was taken up by a mass of young men who had little in common with their counterparts in Medialand," writes Cosmo Landesman, a critic bewailing the decline of civil standards in London's Sunday Times. "These were the prole-lad-tariat, and they had no interest in irony. Here was loutishness without the alibi of quotation marks. Now the middle class of Medialand are horrified by what they've unleashed."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sound familiar?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first to speak out against moral decline in London, are, like their American counterparts, conservatives who were derided as "right wing" squares, cranks and old fogies. But old fogies have a way of cranking up influence over time. The starting point for most cultural and political debates in England -- as in the United States -- is right of center.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Recently Bill Clinton, ripping off another conservative issue, called for curfews for American children as a means to control violence by youngsters. The British Labor Party was inspired to quickly follow. But Tony Blair, head of the Labor Party, suffers the same problem (without the character issue) afflicting Bill Clinton. The farther he runs to the right, neglecting his core support, the more he risks becoming merely a bleached imitation of the political opposition.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Lefties in England face the same dilemma that lefties in the United States confront with our president. Can they trust their leader to run right and govern left? If not, why vote for watered-down conservatism? Good question.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><DD>The hip young man in khaki Dockers and the striped Henley has a problem. He's just met a young woman he thinks he might like a lot. But before he can unreel his line she tells him: "I'm into abstinence."<BR><DD>He's heard this lady's line before, at cocktail parties where nothing stronger than sparkling water of expensive vintage is served, on or off the rocks. Should he take it personally, or put it down to the luck of the draw? The third or fourth time he hears it he might wonder, is something else going on here?<BR><DD>Sometimes such a woman sounds like the incredible tease that every boy's mother has warned him about. But who, male or female, needs this or any other come-on in our sex-drenched age, when every man can be a libertine without even trying.<BR><DD>But wait: from almost anyone's circle of acquaintances among single women in their 20s and 30s comes a repeated refrain: They're tired of a man's great sexual expectations. In this game even liberty has its limits. A woman wants to get to know her man before she knows him.<BR><DD>Since the dawn of the sexual revolution, which was supposed to have put all aright, sex and not love has preceded intimacy, and the intellectual and emotional titillation that a man and a woman find in the first thrill of a romance has been reduced to days, sometimes hours. Some women, determined to regard themselves as gifts to the men they expect to love, call themselves recycled virgins. They're transformed in mind if not precisely in every aspect of body.<BR><DD>Premature mating, they believe, puts at risk the delicious journey of discovery that courtship provided for generations upon generations of young adults before them.<BR><DD>Few of us want to return to boy-meets-girl conversations on a front-porch swing with Mom, Dad, two brothers, three sisters and the neighbors looking on and listening in. (Nobody has a front porch, anyway.) Nevertheless, the easy flirtation of style over substance, with no guarantee of even a call the next day, may be becoming yesterday's weapon, the discarded Gatling gun in the war between the sexes.<BR><DD>The men in the trenches of this warfare want something better than a casual hayride, too. David Klinghoffer, who writes the "token man" column in Women's Quarterly, understood just how times had changed one Sunday morning when, on a Hamptons weekend with several other eligible young men, he found himself in the usual fight over the newspaper. Everyone reached not for the arts or book review sections, or even the sports pages, but for the wedding announcements. Who among their friends was lucky enough to be on the latest casualty lists from the front?<BR><DD>Many unattached young women so despair of finding Mr. Right they suspect themselves of the commitment-phobia they accuse young men of. How else to account for always choosing the wrong man, which ultimately keeps them free from a lasting attachment? Of course, with wrong men as plentiful as the mosquitoes on a summer's night at the lake, sometimes a girl can't help herself.<BR><DD>The Victorians, whose manners and morals are not always any longer a source of merriment for the sophisticates of our age, raised romantic love to elevated heights by introducing an element of the sacred into the pursuit of pleasure. They linked sensuality with divinity, sexuality with divine approval. A man regarded a woman as "saint-like," or "heavenly," an angel of light sent to restore his faith in life, love and marriage. Or tried to. Instead of sleeping together, courting Victorians attended church together. This required an appreciation of sexual abstinence and chastity, even if occasionally observed in the breach. They understood that romantic love without opposing resistance could have all the flavor of Juicy Fruit left overnight on the bedpost.<BR><DD>Julia in Byron's "Don Juan" linked remorse with temptation:<BR><DD>"A little still she strove, and much repented,<BR><DD>And, whispering 'I will ne'er consent' -- consented."<P><I><BR></I><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I> <FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've changed my
treadmill schedule from the evening, when I watched "The News Hour with Jim
Lehrer," to the morning so I can get a sampling of the talk-show fare and stay in
touch with "real people" outside Washington. No offense to Jim Lehrer, but I can
watch him at night without the help of endorphins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But if my morning energy
level has gone up, my tolerance for talk television has sharply declined. In the weeks
since I began surfing for the morning shows the absolute worst, yet quite typical,
was about identical 10-year-old twins. Two girls and two boys were videotaped by
their parents showing how nasty they could be to each other, kicking and biting and
pulling each other's hair. Then we meet the twins live, in the television studio, to
hear and see them tell the audience why they hate one another. Each boy and girl
wish they weren't stuck with a horrible double.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>To give this junk morally
redeeming value, we're told that after the commercial break these twins are going
to want to shape up and learn the meaning of brotherly (or sisterly) love. When we
return we're introduced to the tutors for the twins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One is a tragic mother
who ran over her son, a twin, when he was 4 years old. She didn't see him as she
backed the van out of the driveway. She felt a bump and wondered if she had hit the
dog. She thought both boys were asleep upstairs in their room. Her son, sitting by her
side, describes almost inaudibly how lonely he is and wishes he could bring his
brother back. By now everybody is crying, the twins, their mothers and the audience.
I confess, me too.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've written about child abuse on television before and
this time I'm not even going to castigate the hosts of such shows. They only offer
what the guests and the public of the idiot culture will bear. But what can we say
about the exploitative parents of these children? Do they have no
responsibility?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Maybe less should be written about the effects of television
sex and violence on children and more about the ill effects of putting children on
display before the cameras. This is a long way from "Sesame Street" or silly home
videos.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We eagerly write child labor laws. We lock up pornographic
photographers of children. Isn't it obscene to portray children violently taunting
each other in scenes of sibling rivalry and then on cue parade their feelings before
their friends and millions of others?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The last time I complained about child
abuse on television, it occurred on a show where children, ages 6 and 9, were trotted
out to explain how and why they wanted to kill their mothers. Greek tragedy this
was not.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The hosts usually make a pretense of offering such families "a
therapeutic environment," with bright lights and microphones, lots of supportive
gasps, sympathetic applause, and of course ample commercial breaks. Frequently a
resident expert is recruited to say that killing mothers is bad for their health, or
that beating up a sibling is not nice, either.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>These shows are sometimes
defended as "the democratization of culture," a harmless low-brow pleasure -- like
watching Christians being fed to lions? Or defended as giving those who don't have
much to feel good about an opportunity to feel superior to someone else: At least my
kids don't want to kill me or each other! They've even been called popular theater
with an Aristotelian catharsis: There but for the grace of God and television
producers, go I.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But no matter how you look at it from an audience's point of
view, the children placed in front of that camera are abused children. We should
worry about the psychological impact on their lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Now that we've bid our
farewell to Phil Donahue, who started this abuse, we can wax nostalgic about a more
innocent time when the host merely wore a skirt and brought male strippers into our
homes. Tastelessness beats beating up kids.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for

<BODY>

<BR><DD>Big Bob Dole and little Billy Clinton are strapping on the shootin' iron for the shootout at Gender Gap. Like the Clantons and Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral, they're itchin' to show the wimmen just who the real man is.

<BR><DD>Neither of these men strike any resemblance to Gary Cooper, to stretch the metaphor, but each is desperate to convince the ladies that he's a man who knows how to protect women, children and the community from bad guys in black hats.

<BR><DD>Women ought to find it offensive that any candidate thinks he can woo a woman on the basis of her &quot;gender&quot; (what in our pre-euphemistic days we called simply, sex.) But in a world where voting blocs are about differences, and women make up a majority of voters in almost every economic category, it can't hurt to target women. Picking up their votes is another matter.

<BR><DD>Bob Dole, who is looking for a quick fix for his depressing poll numbers, decides that women's issues might help him cross the finish line first. He cites day-care funding in the Republican welfare-reform bill, which Bill Clinton vetoed twice, as well as the balanced budget and regulatory reform, which are Republican initiatives that provide strong reasons why women should vote Republican in November.

<BR><DD>Bill Clinton, who is better at seducing women with his sensitive and puckered lower lip, is aggressively wooing blue-collar women, who voted in the presidential elections in 1992 but who stayed home in the 1994. Some women are harder to seduce than others.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women in focus groups describe the president as a &quot;wussy&quot; and a &quot;pantywaist,&quot; according to Hanna Rosin in the New Republic magazine. They're not charmed by his boyishness or his chameleon-like changes. They're familiar with untrustworthy men who promise them moonshine at midnight and disappear in the harsh light of morning.

<BR><DD>These women, who have been described by pollsters as Angry White Women, do not have a college degree, and they're too smart to be impressed by Hillary Rodham Clinton trading on her husband's position to achieve the perks of power. High-powered patronizing women like the first lady are the nemesis of women who would rather stay home with their children than put their children in day care, if only they could afford it. Feminists who scorn men as white male devils make them uncomfortable; some of those men with pitchforks and forked tails happen to be their husbands.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women are the biggest losers when public schools decline and they can't afford an expensive private school, like, for example, Bill and Hillary Clinton. They're a natural voting bloc for such conservative temptations as school vouchers, dumping affirmative action (which hasn't much benefitted them and certainly not their husbands), and illegal immigration which sometimes takes theirs and their husbands' jobs.

<BR><DD>Abortion is often not an emotional issue for these women, but most are appalled (like most of the rest of us) that Bill Clinton vetoed a bill banning partial-birth abortion (nothing short of infanticide), which liberal feminists railed at in China, but accept in our own country.

<BR><DD>If blue-collar women are angry and disconnected from feminism, middle-class mothers feel like Rodney Dangerfield, who &quot;don't get no respect.&quot; They're stressed to the max.

<BR><DD>A survey of more than 18,000 women for Parents magazine turned up some surprises. Sixty-eight percent of the working moms say they work for money, not emotional or intellectual satisfaction, up 12 points in seven years. Big majorities of mothers prefer part-time work to full-time work when their children are young. A mere 4 percent say they would choose full-time work. Though 49 percent of working mothers say they envy at-home moms, only 11 percent of at-home moms envy working mothers.

<BR><DD>Readers of Parents magazine make up a special sampling because nearly all of them live with their husbands, have been married only once, and more than half are college graduates. They are especially open to listen to Bob Dole's critique of the president for vetoing balanced budget proposals and welfare-reform bills. This would have put more money in their pocketbooks, to spend or save as they see fit.

<BR><DD>Most startling of all is the majority - the majority - of young mothers under 25 who say they prefer the lifestyle of the 1950s, the decade the feminists love to hate; 43 percent of these mothers say they long for the security and less pressured lives of that decade. A 24-year old mom captured their sentiment succinctly, describing herself as a &quot;June Cleaver Wanna-be.&quot;

<BR><DD>Neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole will woo their votes. These women vote very much like their husbands, and aren't interested in life in Gender Gap.

<BR><DD>The baby boomers flooded the culture with post-pubescent rebellion: &quot;Never trust anyone over 30.&quot;

<BR><DD>Adults trembled and then surrendered. Now the boomers are on the back side of 30 themselves and their children are saying: &quot;Never trust anyone over 13.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany, 13, is typical. She lives in a small New England town where her parents moved to get away from big-city problems. The big-city problems have moved into their town and into their living room.

<BR><DD>&quot;What she watches and hears from television and her peers on the bus to school deprives her of childhood innocence,&quot; her mother tells me. &quot;We can't control the other children, but we thought we could control our own daughter.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany's parents put a &quot;family-code lock&quot; on MTV so she wouldn't watch too much television. But Brittany is bright and she broke the code. Retaliating, she put her own code lock on the &quot;Discovery Channel,&quot; her parents' favorite.

<BR><DD>On the way to school, one of Brittany's buddies laced a large Coke with vodka and passed it around on the bus. She wound up in the emergency room, dead drunk.

<BR><DD>What we have here is a variation of the inmates taking over the asylum. With computer-literate, media-saturated, middle-class children poised for revolt, it's more difficult than ever for parents to maintain their position of authority.

<BR><DD>Not so long ago we accepted terms like &quot;identity crisis&quot; as a normal stage of development that adolescents would be expected to pass through. But today young people are exposed to so much &quot;adult&quot; information without the emotional development or psychological security to cope with it that parents are terrified.

<BR><DD>We look for one-shot elixirs to enable them to cope. We try to prevent teen-age pregnancy by distributing condoms at school. That sounds reasonable, but it plays to the lowest common denominator among us. The girl who would say &quot;no&quot; because she's afraid to get pregnant is reminded that the school provides condoms for squeamish young girls just like herself. How could it be bad?

<BR><DD>Movie and television producers, sensing a growing movement for censorship, offer ratings so parents will know what their children shouldn't watch. That only makes such shows and movies more desirable, of course, and the children quickly find the latchkey kid with no supervision at home. They hang out there to watch whatever they want.

<BR><DD>Most of us remember our own teen-age traumas and figure that those of our children will pass, too. But parents raising teen-agers today can't be so sure. The starting place for belligerence is so far beyond where the baby-boomer parents ended their rebellion that the test of limits is limitless. Today's teen-agers tolerate graphic sexuality and violence that would have made their parents throw up.

<BR><DD>Children are entering puberty at younger ages, some as early as 10. They're more likely to want to separate themselves from their families when parental protection is absolutely essential. Their mothers burned their bras; their daughters never get one. Young girls of another generation who would debate who to go out with, and &quot;how far to go,&quot; now debate when and with whom to have uncommitted and casual sex.

<BR><DD>We could begin to change some of this by pointing out that rhetorical and abstract appeals to sexual equality are false and misleading, hiding a multitude of dangerous differences starting at puberty. What once made up a teen-ager's fantasy life quickly became a short cut to coarsened reality. Parents must repeat and re-establish moral principles that reinforce an understanding of the difference between the sexes, enabling young women to once more become the arbiters of what's acceptable and what's not, because they're the ones who have the most to lose.

<BR><DD>This started out to be a column about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, pending in Congress, which is an attempt to give parents a veto power over policies in schools that they say undermine them. It sounds good, but it won't take the place of parents paying close attention to their own children. Nothing else, in the end, will work.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=7>Time for another<BR>killer euphemism?</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><Align=center>

<BR><DD>In 1789 Jonathan Swift bewailed the shameful numbers of abortions and murders of &quot;bastard children&quot; among the Catholic peasants of Ireland, desperate women who sacrificed innocent babes to avoid the expense and the shame of giving birth without benefit of clergy. Such horrid practices, Swift wrote, &quot;would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman beast.&quot;

<BR><DD>In searching for a way to alleviate such cruelty, Swift invents an American, whom most Englishmen regarded as a not-so-noble savage, to support his modest proposal.

<BR><DD>&quot;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,&quot; he writes in a satire that became a classic of English literature, &quot;that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.&quot;

<BR><DD>Swift was only ahead of his time, and he was only kidding. His modest proposal was deliciously sly in appealing to an impeccable financial logic. His classic was a dig at the rapacious absentee English landlords of Ireland, whose money-grubbing tactics were condoned by the British parliament, ministers and the Crown.

<BR><DD>Taking a cue from Swift, the time is right for a similar modest proposal to President Clinton and all those congressmen who are willing to uphold his veto of the ban on &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>First the facts: a partial-birth abortion is the euphemism for the procedure of turning a baby around (with forceps) in the birth canal so that his tiny legs and tummy and arms escape the mother's body, allowing the doctor to stick a pair of scissors into his head while it is mostly still inside his mother's body. The doctor then spreads the blades of the scissors to allow him to insert a tube with which to suck out the tiny brain. Scientists who work with animals in a laboratory wouldn't be permitted to perform such nasty business.

<BR><DD>So heinous is the procedure that such abortions as are done are mostly to preserve the mother's health, usually her psychological health, since the procedure is done a few seconds before the baby's head slips free of the womb.

<BR><DD>And since psychology is so crucial, why should we deprive the mother-to-be of &quot;psychological closure&quot; by the technicality of keeping the head inside the birth canal while the procedure is being done? Why not do it outside, so that she can watch?

<BR><DD>Why not, in fact, provide a grace period of 15 minutes after birth, to allow her to decide whether she really wants to have a baby. Or even an hour. Perhaps a day or two. Why rush these things? The doctor's scissors would still work the next day.

<BR><DD>It's almost impossible to anesthetize an infant in the womb without putting the mother in great danger. But a baby who lives outside the womb for an hour or even a day could receive treatment to reduce pain prior to its execution. We shouldn't be barbaric, after all. The law, of course, must exempt this carefully considered procedure from charges of premeditated murder. We could give such infanticide a nice name like &quot;mercicide.&quot; The kindly Dr. Jack Kevorkian might offer the use of his death machinery.

<BR><DD>There is another great advantage to this scheme. By forcing the whole baby out of the mother's body for mercicide, we could decide at our leisure whether the infant is indeed a monster with four legs and no suitable brain, thus avoiding disposing of (we must watch our language) a Down's Syndrome child or a child with a cleft palate, both of which are justifiable reasons now for electing a &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>In fact, the law as it is now interpreted enables a mother of a normal baby to kill the child in the last trimester if the birth contributes to a mother's depression or neurotic excesses. Though it may be difficult for some to imagine that a loving adoptive mother would welcome a live baby with Down's Syndrome or a cleft palate, that option would be made available before mercicide, which is after all permanent.

<BR><DD>The advantages of this proposal are obvious and many, it seems to me, as well as of the highest importance to the body impolitic. To satisfy the squeamish who require the delicacy of euphemism, as the president seems to, we could describe mercicide as killing with kindness.

<title>Fumento: New Gun Law Penalizes Cops - 1/8/97</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>January 8, 1997</i><p>
<h2>Cops Pay the Price for New Gun Law</h2><p>
<P>  
	Lt. Dale Barsness was truly one of Minneapolis's finest. A 28-year veteran of the police
force, he had just been promoted to head the homicide department. But now he may lose
everything, courtesy of our national lawmakers.
<P>
	A month before the election, Congress approved and President Clinton signed a law
proposed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D.-N.J.) forbidding anyone who has committed a misdemeanor 
act of domestic abuse from possessing a handgun.
<P>     
	In Barsness's case, the act in question (details are unknown) occurred back in 1991. He
pleaded guilty and served his punishment. Yet he is now on a six-month administrative leave
while the department decides whether it has any choice but to fire him.
<P>     
	If he loses his job, his ex-wife told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, "it hurts the people
who were hurt in the first place: his children and his ex-wife."  
<P>     
	Lautenberg and Clinton championed the bill as necessary to protect women, children, and
other living things, but it was essentially a ball of fluff--99.9 percent substance free. 
Already persons who commit domestic felonies are forced to turn in their guns, so by
definition the bill only targeted lesser offenders.
<P>     
	In support of the proposal, the White House cited a Justice Department figure that of 
the 1.7 million incidents of domestic violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  But
that comes out to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot or even
that bullets were fired. Considering that almost half of all Americans own guns, guns and
domestic violence hardly go hand in hand.
<P>
	But nobody in Congress had the guts to point this out, the law passed, and now it's 
time to pay the piper.  Officers across the country like Dale Barsness are doing the 
paying--as are the citizens that such police serve and protect.
<P>     
	Police departments are now scouring their files to see if any of their officers were
ever convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse--10 years ago, 20, 30, it doesn't matter. Once a
conviction is found, the officer may be fired or reassigned to a permanent desk job.
<P>     
	It hardly seems fair to take away a cop's livelihood because of something he did a
decade ago, even as the average time served for murder in this country is about six years. It is
even more unfair to slap him or her with penalties that were unforeseeable when the officer
pleaded guilty.
<P>      
	How would you feel if a new law mandated that the speeding ticket you pleaded guilty
to 15 years ago now results in your license being revoked, your car impounded, or your
first-born sold into slavery?  You might wish you'd gone to court and fought that ticket,
huh? Picture Bill Clinton saying: "Ah feel your pain--but it's too late, sucker!"    
<P>     
	The Constitution clearly forbids laws which make something a crime after the act has
already been committed.  But for some reason, penalties slapped on after a crime has been
committed is a shadier area. Thus, while the gun law may still be legal.
<P>     
	Further, though the law was billed as a crime-fighting measure, in practice it may
impact only crimefighters themselves. (It might also be applied to soldiers.)
<P>     
	"It's being unfairly applied to our people since we're the only ones with the capacity
to check our people and take our guns away," said Sgt. Bill Clayton, a Denver cop and head of
the Denver County Police Protection Association. "For us, it's the tools of the trade, like
taking a hammer away from a carpenter," he told me.   For other persons who have committed
past acts of misdemeanor abuse, he says, "There's just no way to enforce it."
<P>     
	Exactly. The new law can be used to take away guns from all persons convicted from now
on.  But even the most ardent gun-control advocates wouldn't dare call for making lists of
domestic abuse violators and systematically ransacking their homes looking for firearms--not
that the idea of it doesn't make them feel warm and tingly all over.
<P>     
	In Denver, two cops with 37 years' experience between them are in danger of losing
their jobs because of the new law. Meanwhile, Clayton points out, "In the state of Colorado, a
convicted felon can get a gun after ten years but if convicted of a misdemeanor domestic
abuse, you get a life sentence [preventing your from] carrying a gun."
<P>     
	"I don't know how they got this [law] through," said Barsness's ex-wife.  "I think
there were a million people sleeping."
<P>     
	Maybe, but the lawmakers were wide awake.  Clinton fervently backed the bill, and the
Senate twice voted for it by a margin of 97-2. House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave it his
explicit support.
<P>     
	This truly was a bipartisan act of cowardice and foolishness.</P>

<title>Fumento: Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation - 12/18/96</title>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 18, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation</h2><p>     
<P>
     They're mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore.  For almost seven years
environmentalists have had to put up with people (like me) crying, "Remember Alar!" as
shorthand for bogus science and health scares. But now, they're striking back.
<P>
     For those who don't recall, the Alar scare began in February, 1989 when reporter Ed
Bradley began a 60 Minutes segment by calling Alar "the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food
supply." Alar, manufactured by Uniroyal Chemical Co., was sprayed on apples to keep them on
trees longer so that fewer would fall to the ground and rot before they could be picked.
<P>
     It was this substance that the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) decided to
scapegoat to illustrate the horrors of man-made chemicals. The 60 Minutes segment was part
of a campaign by a PR firm the NRDC had hired, called Fenton Communications.  The rest of
the campaign consisted of helping reporters write scary articles, enlisting the support of
actress Meryl Streep, and creating an NRDC front group called Mothers and Others for
Pesticide Limits.
<P>
     In short order, terrified people were dumping their applesauce into the trash, apple
juice down the sink, and swearing off apples entirely for "healthier" foods.  (You know, like Hostess
Twinkies.) Soon Uniroyal felt it had no choice but to stop selling its product to apple
growers, some of whom then went bankrupt.
<P>
     In the ensuing months, though, articles, monographs, and even whole books by myself and
many others revealed that the NRDC-Fention effort was, as I put it, "one of the slickest,
most cynical fear campaigns in recent American history."  Few people dispute this nowadays,
and it drives the environmentalists bonkers.
<P>
          Thus author and long-time environmental doomsayer Paul Ehrlich, in his new book
<U>Betrayal of Science and Reason</U>, calls the Alar debunking a "fable." A recent article in the Columbia
Journalism Review (CJR), published at the nation's most prestigious journalism school, was
entitled: "Myths," with the subtitle informing us "The Alar `Scare' Was Real."
<P>
     Their evidence, however, is embarrasingly flimsy and often downright false.  For one,
the NRDC and other environmental groups claim the EPA banned the chemical. CJR writer Elliot
Negin gives a date for the ban, saying the decision was "in late 1989." Ehrlich informs us
that three years late, "the EPA issued a statement reaffirming the sound scientific basis
for banning Alar."
<P>
     Sorry Charlies, but the EPA never banned it in the first place, much less reaffirming
any ban. Once Uniroyal withdrew the product for use by fruit growers, the EPA considered the issue
moot. Further, to this day Alar continues to be used on plants which don't produce food.
<P>
     A simple phone call to the EPA would have revealed this.  But apparently
environmentalist crusaders have better things to do with their time.
<P>
     Any other evidence?  Well, Negin makes much of the fact that Washington State apple
growers lost their suit against 60 Minutes alleging their products were wrongly disparaged.
<P>
     In the wake of the decision in the O.J. Simpson criminal trial, such utter confidence
in the court system is truly touching.  But in any case, the courts didn't rule that Alar is
carcinogenic or evil or anything like that. They simply said the apple growers had failed to
meet the extremely high standards needed to win a suit against a media outlet.
<P>
     Finally, both Negin and Ehrlich and other revisionists remind us that both the EPA and
the International Agency for Research on Cancer had labeled Alar "a probable human carcinogen."
Neither writer points out that the studies these agencies had relied upon to make this
classification later proved to have been terribly sloppy. That's why the EPA had
commissioned several new ones. But the NRDC, rather than await the outcome, decided to
launch its scare campaign instead.
<P>
     Neither writer points out--nor do any other environmentalists--that all the evidence
against Alar was always based on the findings of tumors in mice, while the same doses of chemical
caused no tumors in rats. The EPA had simply arbitrarily decided that mice in this case were
a better surrogate for humans. Had the rats developed the tumors and not the mice, they
could well have decided that mice were the better surrogates.
<P>
     All of this is explained in detail in my book Science Under Siege.  Ehrlich, for one,
quotes from that book repeatedly, in an attempt to refute it.  But rather than meet its arguments
head on, he simply ignores them.
<P>
     This, alas, is all too typical of environmentalists.  Evidence that challenges their
world view is inadmissable to them. All that matters is that their myths live on forever. 
Alar-as-deadly-poison was a myth in the making that was cut off at the knees--and deservedly so.

<title>Fumento: Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda - 12/11/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 11, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda</h2><p>     
<P>
 I don't know about you, but when I want a real scare I don't pick up a Stephen King novel
 or rent a movie like Curse of the Demon.  No, when I want a real bone-chilling I go to my
 neighborhood news stand and look at the covers of the women's and family magazines. Where
 else, I ask you, can you find such headlines plastered over the face of Kathie Lee Gifford
 or Claudia Schiffer:  "Schools That Make Kids Sick," "The Foods That Are Poisoning Your
 Child," "Are Pesticides Poisoning Our Children?" "The Woman Who Stole 5,000 Babies,"
 "Stranger Danger," "The Infidelity Epidemic," and "EPA Warning: How the Sun Can Kill Your
 Kids."
<P>
 My favorite?  Hmm . . . That would probably have to be: "Shocking Report: 
 Babysitters who Maim and Kill."  Boy, that'll keep a parent up at night, won't it?  Or at
 least keep the parent from ever going out again until the children are old enough to stay
 home alone. 
<P>
Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis did a poll in
which he found that women were far more likely to buy into the latest fad scare than were
men.  While he wasn't sure of the reason, I'll bet these magazines have something to do
with it. The Washington, D.C. watchdog groups Consumer Alert and Media Research Center
appear to agree.  Indeed, their recent study, "Women's Magazine's: A Liberal Pipeline to
Soccer Moms," found that in addition to lipstick and tampons, what these magazines
specialize in selling is fear--and the notion that Big Government is almost always the
solution. Looking at a year of offerings from 13 such magazines, with a combined
circulation of over 66 million, the organizations found most stories on science and risk
issues served no other purpose than scaring the skirts off readers--outnumberingd balanced
articles by two-to-one.
<P>
Among them:
<ul>
<LI>Family Circle in last August's article, "Danger in the House," warned of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides.  The evidence?  Well, there's this spooky anecdote about a mother who blamed a neighbor's pesticide spraying for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting.  That's enough for you, isn't it?  After all, mother knows best. 
<LI>McCall's and Better Homes & Gardens warned of pesticide residues in baby food.  The McCall's article warned that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults (a supposition, not a fact), but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. 
<LI>Articles in Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Weight Watchers reported the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer, without noting that the largest study ever conducted on the subject looked at two of the most often-mentioned culprits -- the insecticide DDT and the insulating liquid PCB -- and found no connections.  Weight Watchers even condemned scientific studies that pointed to such causes as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." Next thing you know, even saying the words "breast cancer" will be politically incorrect because it suggests that it's a woman's fault that she has breasts.  And what all this has to do with watching your weight I just can't figure out. 
</ul>
<P>
 Once these magazines have you
 hyperventilating into a paper bag, they then spring upon you the solution to these terrible
 problems. Yes, it's Uncle Sam, or more specifically Uncle Bill and Aunt Hillary.  The
 Consumer Alert/Media Research Center survey found 115 articles with positive portrayals of
 government activism and/or calls for more activism.  There were only 18 negative portrayals
 or calls for less government action.  Of these, 23 stories also asked readers to lobby
 government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. 
<P>
 Having made their readers
 feel bad about the way mankind is treating the environment (when you're describing
 something bad, like polluting, using "mankind" isn't sexist), they then go on to promote
 feel-good environmentalism.  Never mind that even the New York Times magazine recently did
 a cover article affirming what free-market environmentalists have been saying for over a
 decade--that most recycling is a waste of time, energy, and money.  Out of the 15 articles
 in the women's magazines on recycling, each and every one was solidly in favor of it.
 (Actually, probably the last 14 articles were simply recycled versions of the first one.)
<P>
 "Story after story," in these magazines, says Consumer Alert Executive Director Fran Smith,
 "outlines a problem and proposes that a new law be enacted and that women should lobby for
  it."
<P>
   Not for nothing did the Clinton team label its re-election campaign aimed at young
   mothers and women in general as its "Redbook strategy."  The Redbooks of the nation had
   already paved the way for his second term.

<h2>
 "Killer Airbag" Hysteria is the Real Killer
</h2>     
<p>
<dd>
 For all the news lately about the threat that airbags pose to children, you'd think it's
 the Slaughter of the Innocents all over again.  You'd believe you could look out your
 window at any time and see an airbag chasing some poor little boy or girl down the street.
 But no, such is not the case.  The scariest thing about this whole airbag thing is not the
 threat to children but that the media has taken its cue from USA Today, the paper that
 prides itself on promoting hysteria.
<p>
<dd>
 It was USA Today that led the coverage of the missing
 children epidemic in the early 1980s, telling us, "estimates of lost children [per year]
 run as high as 2 million," and asking "how could it happen?"  It also said, "More than
 100,000 children are abducted each year." How could it happen?  It couldn't and didn't. 
 The newspaper was later forced to admit that the two million figure was probably about
 30,000, of which (according to the FBI) only 67 were kidnapped.  Oops.
<p>
<dd>
 More recently, it
 was the first newspaper to inform us of an "epidemic" of  black churches being torched by
 racists.  After six months of incendiary reporting it finally admitted that of over 70
 black church burnings it looked at, only three were clearly done by racists and a third of
 the churches were burned by blacks.  Oops. No matter, there's always a new hysteria to be
 created.
<p>
<dd>
 And so it was that USA Today crack reporters in May kicked off the airbag mania
 with an article running under the inch-high headline, "DEADLY AIR BAGS."  An accompanying
 story was titled, "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children."  If your trembling hand turned to
 the next page you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags Are Claiming the Lives of Children," while
 yet another page blared, "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly." The rest of the media then
 followed USA Today, which is about as wise as letting Stevie Wonder pilot your plane. 
 Suddenly it's worthy of a headline when a child is so much as injured by an airbag. It's
 gotten to the point where volunteers at busy freeway rest areas spent their Thanksgiving
 handing out fliers warning parents of the danger of these pneumatic beasts.  (USA Today
 proudly displayed a story on this on page one.)
<p>
<dd>
 I've always been a big seat belt fan,
 myself.  They've saved my rear (and the rest of me) twice.  But it's clear that even if you
 do wear a seat belt and especially if you don't, airbags are far more likely to save you
 than to kill you.
<p>
<dd>
 Department of Transportation (DOT) figures show that since 1987, airbags
 have probably kept 1,136 people from being crushed to death, with the life-saving rate
 accelerating rapidly as more and more cars are equipped with them.  In 1995 alone, airbags
 prevented 462 deaths. The trade-off?  Since 1990, DOT says, they have caused 52 deaths,
 including those of 32 children.  You needn't dig out that misplaced pocket calculator to
 see that this comes out to a net savings of a lot of lives. As to those 32 children, in a
 real sense that is 32 too many.  But other than being mauled by a Siberian tiger in New
 York City, there is practically nothing less likely to kill your child than an airbag. 
<p>
<dd>
 Indeed, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, during the time those 32
 children were killed by airbags, over 15,000 children age 11 or under were killed in car
 accidents for reasons having nothing to do with the devices. But hard facts like these are
 the first casualty of panics. And so, reacting to the hysteria, DOT has decided to relax
 the law making it illegal for a mechanic to disconnect a vehicle owner's airbag.  The
 utterly unavoidable result is that people will die in crashes whose lives would otherwise
 have been saved by the devices. And for what?  As tiny as your child's risk of being killed
 or injured by an airbag currently is, you can reduce it even further by simply by sliding
 the passenger seat all the way back, and by making sure your child is wearing a seat belt. 
<p>
<dd>
 Last year, over half the children killed by airbags were not wearing seat belts.  The
 one-year-old girl who just died from an airbag was, according to the coroner, not properly
 restrained. To reduce your child's near-zero risk from airbags to absolutely zero, just put
 him or her in the back seat. Unfortunately, panicky people don't think about such things. 
 So it's off to the auto shop to have both the passenger and driver side bags disconnected.
 The first time a person is impaled on a steering wheel or squished by a dashboard because
 of a disconnected airbag, I hope we read about THAT in the papers.  But don't expect to
 hear about it from USA Today.

<title>Fumento:Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile - 9/05/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>  September 5, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile</h2><p>     
Bill Clinton has made it clear yet again that he likes cruise 
missiles, with their ability to slip under radar screens and do damage 
without endangering the guy who launched them.  No, I'm not talking 
about Iraq, but rather Clintons' advocacy of a federal law prohibiting 
those convicted of domestic abuse misdemeanors from ever again being 
able to legally obtain a gun.  I've counted at least five things it 
accomplishes: <p>
<ul>
<li> It appeals to feminists. 

<li> It appeals to Americans' natural desire to protect women and 
children. 

<li> It promotes "gun law creep," whereby inch by inch we make fewer and 
fewer people able to legally obtain and keep guns. 

<li> It promotes "federal power creep."  See above. 

<li> It leaves the public with the impression that Clinton is a no-
nonsense "law and order" president. 
</ul>
If you're thinking that none of this has anything to do with making 
anybody safer, you're missing the point--there's an election hard upon 
us, and as Clinton taught Bush there's no such thing as a safe lead. <p>

But let's hear out Cruise Clinton. <p>

Said the president, "if you're stalking or harassing women or 
children, you shouldn't have a gun."  Can he not know that the 1994 
Violence Against Women Act which he signed already forbids the sale of 
guns to stalkers and harassers who are under court restraining orders? <p>

"The problem is there is one class of misdemeanors that tend to be 
particularly violent, where we know there's a potential for future 
violence," said Clinton.  "And that is the painful area of domestic 
violence." <p>

In fact, as Woman's Freedom Network Vice-President Cathy Young notes, 
"There is no evidence that domestic violence misdemeanor offenses are 
more violent than non-domestic misdemeanor assaults."  We'll just 
chalk that one up to presidential puffery. <p>

With domestic violence, says Clinton, "often there's a plea bargain 
which goes from a felony to a misdemeanor. " <p>

Sure, but that's true of all felonies. "Virtually all available 
research shows that when the levels of injury are the same, domestic 
assaults are no less likely than non-family assaults to be prosecuted 
as felonies," Young told me.  <p>

To the extent such plea-bargaining is a problem, it can be dealt with 
"three strikes and you're out" or other mandatory sentencing laws.  
Increasingly, states are passing just such laws.  Our purpose should 
be to try to make sure those guilty of felonies are punished with laws 
meant for felons, not to apply felony laws to persons who commit 
misdemeanors. <p>

"If you commit an act of violence against your wife or child, you 
shouldn't have a gun," thunders Clinton, who is such a fatherly type 
that he plans to adopt a child if the polls show Dole getting to 
close. <p>

But it's not that simple because the definition of "violence" can 
stretch from all the way from an unwanted grab to strangling your 
spouse and tossing the body into a meat grinder. <p>0

In most states, misdemeanor assault is any intentional touching 
without consent.  That includes such things as poking someone with 
your finger. In a New Jersey case, a man was convicted of misdemeanor 
assault not for punching his girlfriend but rather the couch she was 
sitting on.  Some states allow misdemeanor assault convictions for 
yelling at someone.  Los Angeles hero Rodney King accused his wife of 
assault because she yelled at him in the car for not being able to 
read a map.  (Rather than press charges, he promptly ran her down.) <p>

All of these are wrong, which is why the law covers them.  You can 
serve "hard time" for misdemeanor domestic violence.  But take away a 
person's right to own a gun for life because of an arm grab or heated 
words?  Slap that person in the same category as a brute who blackens 
his wife's eyes because she burned the toast?    <p>

Ironically, one outcome of this might be that many prosecutors and 
judges would feel sorry for the defendant faced with a 
disproportionate penalty, and be tempted to let him or her go scott-
free.  <p>

Conceivably Clinton's proposal could keep guns out of the hands of 
some violent people, if we make the shaky assumption that violent 
people when turned away from stores won't just go out and buy their 
guns on the street.  It's also true that we would keep guns out of the 
hands of some violent people if we forbade them for other arbitrary 
reasons, such as having blow-dryed gray hair and a bulbous nose. <p>

But the point of any law that denies somebody the right to own a gun 
should be to match as closely as possible that denial to persons most 
likely to use them for violence. There's no evidence that this is the 
case here. <p>

One figure cited in support of Clinton's proposal is that according to 
the Justice Department, of the 1.7 million incidents of domestic 
violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  That comes out 
to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot 
or even that bullets were fired.  Considering that almost half of all 
Americans own guns, guns and domestic violence hardly go hand in hand. <p>

Like most gun control measures, this proposal is essentially 
irrelevent to crime control.  If you think reelecting Clinton and 
piling on more federal laws are worthy goals, you may not mind.  
Otherwise you'll see this as the harmful distraction and campaign 
stunt that it is. <p>

<title>Fumento:"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope - 8/28/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 28, 1996</i><p>
<h2>"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope</h2><p>
       


He's the sickest American cult figure since Charles Manson, with two 
major differences. First, he's killed almost eight times as many 
people. Second, he's still walking around, free to kill again. And 
kill he will. Some call him an Angel of Mercy, but he's better known 
as Dr. Death. <p>

As I write this, Dr. Jack Kevorkian has put down/put to 
sleep/euthanized persons 35, 36, 37, and 38, though lately he's been 
killing faster than I can type. None of the people appear to have been 
imminently close to death. One had Lou Gehrig's disease, the same 
illness that Dr. Steven Hawkings had for decades when he penned a 
best-selling book and became world famous. Two had multiple sclerosis, 
the disease Annette Funicello had (and has) when she starred in her 
film autobiography. <p>

The fourth, 42-year-old Judith Curren, was a nurse and a mother of two 
young children. She was overweight and depressed and believed she 
suffered from a vague (though sometimes real) malady called chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS). None of these are terminal, and the woman's 
belief she had CFS may well have been a manifestation of depression. <p>

Further, severe depression is often accompanied by a desire to commit 
suicide. But this is a highly treatable condition, and in any case a 
severely depressed person no more has the capacity to "elect" to die 
than a five-year-old girl can "elect" to engage in sex. <p>

But no matter, for Dr. Death continues to be treated like some gallant 
crusader. "Dr. Jack Kevorkian stepped up his campaign for doctor-
assisted suicide," began a recent Associated Press article. <p>

Wrong. Kevorkian no more kills in the name of any higher cause, 
including doctor-assisted suicide, than a lion rips out an antelope's 
throat in the name of balancing the eco-system. The lion is driven by 
instinct; Kevorkian by something we used to call evil.  <p>

The man is a ghoul. Some of us like to watch female volleyball; 
Kevorkian likes to watch people die. A much-ignored 1993 Newsweek 
article documented that in the 1950s, while studying to be a 
pathologist, Kevorkian made regular visits to terminally ill patients 
and peered deeply into their eyes. He wanted to watch the sparkle of 
life disappear. "There was no practical application," he admitted 
later. "I was curious, that's all." <p>

Later he advocated surgical experimentation on the bodies--
particularly the brains--of live death row prisoners. Later still he 
expanded his idea to encompass other persons, including "comatose, 
mentally incompetent or otherwise completely uncommunicative 
individuals . . . " <p>

Earlier this year, thinking he was making some salient point, 
Kevorkian invoked Christ's death, saying "Do you think it's dignified 
to hang from wood with nails through your hands and feet?" He said, 
"Had Christ died in my van . . . it would have been far more 
dignified." <p>

Look Jack, it's not just that a van would look rather bizarre hanging 
above the altar of my church. When Christ sacrificed his life, he knew 
he was setting himself up for crucifixion, the most painful and 
undignified mode of execution in use. Again, Kevorkian shows he is 
devoid of understanding of humanity. And it speaks volumes about the 
pro-euthanasia movement that it pretends that this man is a crusader 
for a larger cause, rather than a grown-up version of the little boy 
who pulls wings off flies.<p>

Not that some euthanasia supporters aren't just a bit queasy after 
this latest round of killings. "Sooner or later, someone will die for 
the wrong reasons," conceded a USA Today editorial, not specifying 
what the right reasons are. <p>

Others warned that if we don't watch it, we'll slide down the slippery 
slope. As if we haven't already? Jack Kevorkian IS a one-man slippery 
slope. He keeps loosening the definition of who "deserves" to die. 
Originally he saw the need to pretend that his 
clients/patients/victims were in great pain and on death's doorstep. 
But after the latest killings he admitted, "It had nothing do with 
lethality. It's quality of life . . . . Quality of life." <p>

This evolution was utterly predictable. It's called the "camel's nose" 
effect. The camel puts his nose into the tent to see if he can get 
away with it. If so, he keeps moving in until he's fully inside, hump 
and hooves. <p>

Those on both sides of the euthanasia debate in the United States are 
fully aware of the history of legal euthanasia in the Netherlands. It 
began with a doctor responding to the wishes of her terminally ill 
mother who was in much pain. Within a few decades it encompassed 
killing infants born with non-fatal diseases--Down's syndrome and 
spina bifida. Patients in persistent vegetative states, often 
incorrectly referred to as "comatose," are also now legally killable 
in Holland. <p>

According to a Dutch government survey, doctors there kill some 20,000 
patients a year, most without the patients' consent. The difference is 
that the Dutch took decades to get to that point, while Kevorkian is 
trying to bring the whole camel in within a matter of years. And 
damned if he isn't getting away with it. <p>

We need to ask ourselves right now if we want to follow Dr. Death down 
the Dutch path or if we're going to treat human life as sacred. In 
other words, we tell our doctors that they are to follow the 
Hippocratic Oath they took and "first do no harm." Executioners kill; 
doctors are supposed to heal. And "Dr. Death" is a contradiction in 
terms. <p>

<title>Fumento:The EPA vs. Clean Air - 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 22, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  The EPA vs. Clean Air</h2><p>



                    

DENVER, COLORADO  "Make a better mousetrap and the world will beat a 
path to your door," goes an old saying. Well, not always.  In some 
cases you just may find a 300-pound government gorilla obstructing the 
way. Such has been the experience of University of Denver chemistry 
professor Donald Stedman. <p>

Stedman has developed a machine which, when hidden by the side of the 
road, can detect how much exhaust a car puts out as it drives by. High 
emissions trigger a video camera which films both the car and its 
license plate.  This allows the municipality using the device to send 
a letter (perhaps backed by a fine) to the violator informing him that 
his car must be repaired. <p>

As present, the standard practice in high-pollution areas is to 
subject cars to regular inspection and maintenance programs. The 
problem is that drivers with the dirtiest cars can pass the test by 
pouring a commercial additive into their gas tank. (Since they refused 
to pay me a product placement fee, I won't tell you the name.) Or they 
can pass by tampering with the exhaust system.  <p>

Studies with remote sensors have shown that such cheating is rampant. <p>

But drivers who happen upon remote sensors have no ability to cheat. 
The effectiveness of such devices has been demonstrated repeatedly in 
the U.S. as well as in Canada and Great Britain.  Indeed, they have 
now been put into regular use in various parts of California; Phoenix; 
Ontario, and Stedman's hometown of Denver. <p>

"If we want to have any success in reducing emissions from autos, we 
must employ remote sensing technology" says Buzz Breedlove, the 
assistant director for the California Research Bureau. <p>

But the EPA, whose mission is supposed to be preserving the 
environment, doesn't like remote sensing. <p>

Why?  Breedlove told me that "the staunchest opponent of remote 
sensing" he knows once said, "The problem with remote sensing is that 
it will clean up all the cars  and we won't be able to justify a 
centralized program on a cost-effective basis." <p>

For over a decade now, the EPA has put all its eggs in one basket: the 
inspection and maintenance program. In part, this is because such 
testing requires a large centralized bureaucracy to administer it. <p>

This involves--surprise--lots of money!  The tests cost about $25 per 
car.  Remote sensing, by contrast, is about 50 cents per test. <p>

Although the EPA has improved the efficiency of its testing devices, 
they will never be truly cost efficient. "It's not a mechanical 
engineering problem," Stedman observes, "It's a human behavior 
problem. The driver's interest isn't in reducing emissions; it's in 
passing the test." <p>

Hence, if the driver thinks he'll fail and be liable for perhaps 
hundreds of dollars in repairs, he'll cheat. And the EPA's equipment 
can't stop him. <p>

But pride, reputations, and bureaucratic inertia refuse to allow the 
EPA to admit this.  And so, while remote sensors work to clean up the 
air, the EPA is working against remote sensors. <p>

First, the agency actively discriminates against state and local 
governments that want to use remote sensors. Under the Clean Air Act, 
governments are not given credit for actually cleaning up the air. 
Rather, they're given credit for running programs that the EPA says 
SHOULD BE cleaning up the air. And in its credit formula, remote 
sensing counts for very little.   <p>

Second, EPA has now cut off further funding for Stedman's lab, 
hampering his efforts to enable it to detect more types of pollutants. 
For six years he got a fairly small but, to him, vital amount of his 
research money from the EPA. No more. <p>

But hey, things are tough all over, right? Money is tight these days. 
But not for things that suit the EPA's  agenda--namely more government 
regulation. <p>

Competitive Enterprise Institute scholar Jonathan Adler has documented 
that from 1993 to 1995 alone, the radical environmental group the 
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) received almost $2 million of 
your and my tax dollars funneled through the EPA. That's 20 times what 
Stedman's shop was receiving annually. <p>

The American Lung Association (ALA) received almost as much from the 
EPA. Unlike the NRDC, the ALA does some good work.  But part of what 
it does with all that cash is to lobby for EPA-proposed mandates.  It 
even sues the EPA to make regulations stricter.  Since by law the EPA 
can't lobby itself, it throws money at organizations who will do it 
for them.   <p>

In fact, the EPA even gives cash to a group called the Consumer 
Federation of America, which publishes literature disparaging remote 
sensing. <p>

The EPA's mandate isn't to promote bureaucratic self-interest and 
political lobbying, but to clean up the environment. Supporting remote 
sensing would do just that. <p>

<title>Fumento: Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study - 8/15/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 15, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study</h2><p>

A new report on the impact of laws allowing persons to carry concealed 
guns has gun control advocates shooting wildly and missing their 
target by a mile. <p>

The report, co-authored by law professor John Lott and economist John 
Mustard, both of the University of Chicago, concluded  "allowing 
citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it 
appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths.  If those states 
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted 
them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 
60,000 aggravated assaults would have been avoided yearly."    <p>

Think of it; that's more murders than the combined total of 21 states 
last year.  That's over 4,000 women last year alone who were violently 
sexually assaulted. <p>

In percentage terms, the authors found that when state concealed 
handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 
percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent, 
respectively.  (Thirty-one states now have such laws). <p>

Lott and Mustard, however, probably feel like they've been assaulted 
after the smearing they received in much of the press. <p>

For example, director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence 
Dan Kotowski blasted the study as biased because it was funded by the 
Olin Corporation, which owns Winchester, Inc., a firearms 
manufacturer.  An <i>Associated Press</i> (AP) story and that of individual 
newspapers aired the Kotowski allegations as fact, but they were wrong 
several times over. <p>

Lott, as the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics at Chicago, 
is paid by the Olin FOUNDATION, which funds guest academic positions 
at institutions throughout the country.  It does not choose the 
scholars who fill these slots, but leaves it up to the institution.  
Nor does it choose their research projects.  John Olin did make money 
in firearms, but died in 1982, endowing the foundation that bears his 
name.  Since then there has been no connection between the Olin 
Corporation and the Olin Foundation. <p>

AP has now issued a retraction of the allegations.   <p>

On the other hand, Kotowski gets ALL his money from advocating handgun 
control. <p>

Meanwhile, Douglas Weil--who as research director at the Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence also makes all his money from advocating 
handgun laws--claimed the Chicago study "goes against well-established 
evidence," citing specifically a University of Maryland report from 
last year which claimed to show that concealed weapons laws cause 
homicides to go up. <p>

Really?  The Chicago report looked at the entire nation over the last 
15 years for which data were available.  The authors of the University 
of Maryland study, conversely, picked out just five cities to report 
on out of the hundreds it could have chosen.  They didn't even use the 
same sample period for the cities, but the periods they did choose 
were just a few years each. <p>

So somehow a study that uses specially-picked cities and specially-
picked periods of time is better than one covering the whole nation 
over a decade and a half.  It makes sense to the gun control 
advocates. <p>

The nation's top law enforcement official also weighed in.  Asked 
about the Chicago report at a press conference, Attorney General Janet 
Reno avoided giving direct comment, saying she hadn't yet read it.  
But Reno, the former chief state prosecutor in Florida's Dade County, 
added her impression that Florida's concealed weapons law "didn't seem 
to be effective." <p>

Oh no?  When that law was passed in 1987, Florida had the nation's 
highest murder rate and it was going up.  Immediately it began 
dropping steadily year by year, falling almost 30 percent by 1994 and 
putting Florida under the national average in homicides.  Of over 
320,000 licenses issued between the time the law passed and the end of 
January of this year, only 58 have been revoked because the owner 
committed a crime. <p>	

So why does Miss Reno think the law wasn't effective?  Maybe it has 
something to do with the view she stated to a B'nai B'rith gathering 
in Ft. Lauderdale in 1991 that, "The most effective means of fighting 
crime in the United States is to outlaw the possession of any type of 
firearm by the civilian populace." <P>

Naturally, some gun control advocates would rather avoid the need to 
use data at all.  "It defies common sense," said Kotowski at his press 
conference, "to think that putting more guns on the streets is going 
to make us safer." <p>

Actually it makes perfect sense.  If a criminal thinks you might be 
packing something more powerful than a tiny canister of pepper spray, 
he might be just a bit more hesitant to rape, rob, or kill you.  
That's common sense, and the Chicago study simply backs it up. <p>

Common sense also suggests that if this were happening, criminals 
might compensate somewhat by committing more property crimes.  And the 
Chicago study found just that.  Criminals respond "to the threat of 
being shot" by substituting "less risky crimes," state the Chicago 
authors.  One example is burglaries in which the criminal has "cased" 
the house to make sure no one will be home. <p>

That seems a small price to pay.  I don't know about you, but I'd 
rather have my home or car broken into than be smashed over the head 
for my wallet or have my girlfriend raped.  I'll bet even most handgun 
control advocates feel the same way.   <p>

<title>Fumento:  Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish - 8/07/96</title>

   <h2>
         Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish</h2>
<P>
(DENVER, COLORADO) Oxygenated fuels started here in Denver and took 
the nation by storm--sort of like the Denver Boot, a nasty contraption 
they clamp onto your wheel when you don't pay your tickets.  But 
unlike the boot, which works all too well (don't ask me how I know!), 
it turns out that oxy fuels may be virtually worthless, yet cost 
motorists across the country billions of dollars. 
<P>
That's the conclusion of a recently-released report by the National 
Research Council (NRC), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The report has been utterly ignored outside of the Denver area, yet it 
concerns municipalities--and drivers--across the country. 
<P>
Oxygenated fuels, generally shortened to "oxy fuels", are made by 
putting an additive into gasoline, usually either ethanol made from 
corn or a chemical derived from natural gas called MTBE. These 
additives put more oxygen into the gasoline, and in theory make your 
car burn more cleanly. Allegedly they especially reduce the production 
of carbon monoxide, which reaches relatively high levels in many 
places during the winter. 
<P>
About 27 areas around the country are using oxy fuels during the 
winter months.  They are not provided as options, but rather forced 
into your gas tank by law.  Which is the only way local governments 
can get motorists to use them, since they not only cost as much as 
seven cents a gallon more than regular gasoline but also decrease 
mileage by at least 2-3 percent. 
<P>
As to how much this is costing the nation as a whole, bizarrely enough 
the EPA says it doesn't know.  "That should be one of the easiest 
things to identify," says Carleton Howard, an atmospheric scientist at 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, 
Colorado. 
<P>
In any case, the Colorado Health Department says the program has cost 
the Denver area alone about $14 million a year since 1988 and critics 
say it could be twice that.  It could therefore easily be setting back 
the nation over half a billion a year. 
<P>
And for what?  We don't know, says the NRC.  Nobody knows. 
<P>
The Colorado Department of Health (CDH) instituted the oxy fuels 
program back in 1988 under pressure from lobbyists funded in great 
part by the huge grain conglomerate, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).  
ADM is the biggest producer of the oxy-fuel additive ethanol.  It has 
also been supporting an activist who goes around saying that ethanol's 
chief rival, MTBE, makes people sick. 
<P>
  The CDH concluded the oxy-fuels program was a resounding success and 
made it permanent in Denver.  Mayor Federico Pena (now Secretary of 
Transportation) crowed about it, the Environmental Protection Agency 
crowed about it, and next thing you know, Congress was requiring it 
around the country. 
<P>
But CDH had based its approval on two findings.  First, it said that 
carbon monoxide levels in Denver's air had gone down significantly 
since the program was instituted.  Actually the city's carbon monoxide 
levels had been dropping yearly since the 1970s, primarily due to the 
installation of catalytic converters on cars.  Ah!  Details, details, 
said the CDH.  Don't bother us with details! 
<P>
Second, it put together a nice computer model that it claimed showed 
that an area-wide oxy-fuels program would reduced carbon monoxide by 
29 percent. 
<P>
But while computers don't lie, liars compute.  The NRC found that the 
most optimistic study which actually measured carbon monoxide 
reductions from oxy fuels found a 16 percent drop.  And the author of 
that study, University of Denver chemist Donald Stedman, says that 
even if everybody else had such promising results "it wouldn't be cost 
effective." 
<P>
Other studies such as one conducted by the University of Georgia found 
virtually no reduction in carbon monoxide emissions at all. 
<P>
According to one NRC panel member, University of Colorado professor 
Douglas Lawson, it does seem to be the case that at warm temperatures 
oxy fuels reduce carbon monoxide.  But carbon monoxide is only a cold-
weather problem.  "In some studies there were higher carbon monoxide 
emissions with oxy fuels at that lower temperature than with standard 
fuels," Lawson told me. 
<P>
Further, even if oxy fuels do reduce carbon monoxide, they can 
increase levels of other pollutants.  For example, benzene levels go 
up.  Benzene is strongly suspected to be a human carcinogen. 
<P>
Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, merely replaces oxygen in the 
bloodstream.  While this can be fatal in massive doses (such as when a 
faulty propane heater killed former tennis great Vitas Gerulaitis), in 
even the heaviest levels ever recorded in the air above a city it 
never causes anything more than headaches and fatigue. 
<P>
In any event, notes Lawson, "It's been known since 1983 that majority 
of emissions come from a small percentage of the cars on the road."  
<P>
Says Stedman, "Forcing all drivers to use oxy fuels for the sake of 
those few broken cars is like making everybody take aspirin every day 
for the sake of a few who will get headaches." 
<P>
As a result of the NRC findings, Colorado Governor Roy Romer--hardly 
an enemy of regulation--says he is considering dropping the oxy-fuels 
program.  Unfortunately, since this story was ignored in all the other 
parts of the country that have since adopted it, the evil that 
Colorado's regulators did will live on.

<h2>
           Paper Scares Parents for Politics and Profit
</h2>
<p>
"DEADLY AIR BAGS."  So ran the inch-high headline in USA Today.  "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children," was the title of an accompanying story.  Jump to the next page and you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags are Claiming the Lives of Children," while yet the next jump is entitled "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's nothing a sensationalist paper likes more than running stories about suffering children, and no paper does it better than USA Today. Back in the early 1980s it led the way in publicizing the epidemic of missing children, an epidemic that turned out to be non-existent.  Now there seems to be an epidemic of children crushed under air bags which--oh irony of ironies--are supposed to save lives.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Don't get me wrong.  I'm not the world's biggest proponent of air bags.  I AM one of the world's biggest proponents of seat belts. Twice seat belts have saved my life.  The second time was when my car went flying off a cliff and tumbled down 350 feet.  I would have had just a few scratches had my air bag not then--after the tumbling had stopped--gone off and bruised my face.  Gee, thanks a lot.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that's the nature of the beast.  Presently air bags only protect you in head-on collisions.  And while they don't provide much additional protection beyond seat belts, they apparently do help a little, saving a little over 500 lives a year.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unless, it seems, you're a small child.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to USA Today, probably 20 children will be killed by air bags this year, ten more than will have their lives saved by the devices.  Now ten children is ten children, no doubt about that.  But this year, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, about 1,100 children between the ages of 0 to 4 will be killed in motor vehicle accidents.  An additional 2,000 will die who are between the ages of 5 and 11.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
With that many deaths, it is hard to imagine any aspect of motor vehicles less likely to kill your child than air bags.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine anything that can possibly kill your child that will kill fewer children this year than air bags.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, USA Today does everything it can to exaggerate the scope of these deaths.  Of 22 children known to have been killed by air bags since 1993, it pictures fully 12 of them.  For each and every child on which it was able to obtain records, it lists their name, age, home town, and date of death.  Their anguished parents are repeatedly quoted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Meanwhile, the thousands of other children killed in other ways since then by car accidents go unmentioned, and even the number goes unlisted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yeah, yeah, but aren't I missing the big point here, that these devices that are supposed to save lives are taking them?  No, because tradeoffs with safety devices are commonplace.  Seat belts, for example, save over 5,000 American lives each year but every once in a while somebody whose life would have been saved if they had been thrown clear was instead trapped in their vehicle by a seat belt.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Air bags do save lives.  Last year, according to National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) figures, air bags saved 570 lives and took 12, including eight children.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The real point here is that while we're off  turning little bogeymen into giants, giant bogeymen are stalking the land but not getting huge spreads in USA Today or elsewhere.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A fourth of all children in this country are now obese, setting them up for a lifetime of disease and early death.  Schools are steadily dropping physical education programs from their curricula and nobody's complaining.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Half of all black children in this country, according to Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, are suffering broken chromosomes due to lack of folic acid in their diets.  Broken chromosomes often lead to cancer. Adding folic acid to the diet is a cinch, but parents worried about airbags and all the other media-fabricated scares of the week--from Alar to power line electromagnetic fields to pit bull attacks--don't even know this.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of course, as few deaths as air bags cause, they could be made to cause even fewer.  Many years ago regulators such as Joan Claybrook, who was then President Carter's head of NHTSA and is now at the Naderite Center for Auto Safety, suspected that air bags posed a risk to children. Nonetheless, she pushed full speed ahead and child safety precautions were never built in.  But whose fault was that?  Why, says USA Today, Ronald Reagan's of course!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"'If I had gone back another four years, it's entirely possible we'd have gone back and rewritten the (air bag) standard' to better account for children," USA Today quotes Claybrook as saying. "But Ronald Reagan ousted Carter," says the paper, "foreclosing Claybrook's chance to revise the standard."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Entirely possible"?  She just needed four more years?  It's bad enough to use pictures of cute dead kids to sell papers, but turning them into political fodder--well, that's just cold.

<h2>
The Great Black Church-burning Hoax
</h2>
<p>
Responding to the reported wave of southern black church burnings, 
President Clinton proclaimed that "Racial hostility is the driving 
force" behind the church burnings and said, "I want to ask every 
citizen in America to say we . . . we are not slipping back to those 
dark days." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Okay, Mr. President, I'll say it.  I'll say it because this "epidemic 
of hatred" is a fraud.  A myth.  A deliberate hoax.  There is no good 
evidence of  any increase in black church burnings. There is, however, 
evidence, that a single activist group has taken the media and the 
nation on a wild ride. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It turns out there is no good federal data on black church arsons.  
The FBI doesn't keep such statistics, and the Department of Justice 
doesn't usually break them down by white and black churches or arson 
and accidents.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms only 
tracks federal fires and those it's specifically asked to investigate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A private group, the National Fire Protection Association, keeps 
careful track of church arsons.  While their data don't break down 
churches by race, they do show a dramatic drop in the number of church 
arsons, from 1,420 in 1980 to 520 in 1994. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Though arson committed against any house of worship is especially 
heinous, it should be reassuring to know there have been far fewer 
recently than there used to be.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So who is giving out these data suggesting it's open season on black 
churches?  It turns out the main source--indeed, the one which started 
the whole thing--is far from impartial.  It is the Atlanta-based 
Center for Democratic Renewal, whose self-proclaimed mission is to 
work "with progressive activists and organizations to build a movement 
to counter right-wing rhetoric and public policy initiatives." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally called the National Anti-Klan Network, it changed its name 
when the Klan virtually fell apart in the 1980s.  But far from seeing 
that as a sign of declining bigotry, it has continued for more than a 
decade to issue statements and reports "discovering" a sudden 
resurgence in racist activity. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR's agenda goes well beyond rooting out genuine bigotry; the 
group tars mainstream conservatives with the same brush as racist 
criminals.  The Rev. C.T. Vivian, chairman of the CDR board said,  
"There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons 
and those that are really doing the burning." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In late March, the CDR held a press conference and released a 
preliminary report showing a tremendous surge in black church arsons 
from 1990 to the present.  From there it's been a media snowball, with 
over 2,200 stories written on the subject to date--including three 
huge consecutive layouts in USA Today. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"You're talking about a well-organized white-supremacist movement," 
the Rev. Mac Charles Jones, a CDR board member told one paper.  "This 
is domestic terrorism," he told CNN. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But after numerous law enforcement agencies concluded there didn't 
seem to be any contact between those arsonists who had been arrested, 
others have blamed, as Jesse Jackson put it, "a cultural conspiracy."  
The "ringleaders" are everyone from talk radio hosts to Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas to the religious right. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
said the Christian Coalition "created the context for the fires." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR report claims there have been 90 arsons against black churches 
in nine southern states since 1990, with the number rising every year 
up to 35 in 1996 as of  June 18.  Each culprit "arrested and/or 
detained," it stresses, has been white. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But when I contacted the law enforcement officials of several states 
on the CDR list, a very different picture emerged. The CDR, it turned 
out, regularly ignored fires set by blacks and those that occurred in 
the early part of the decade, and labeled fires as arsons that were 
not--all in an apparent effort to make black church torchings appear 
to be an escalating phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example CDR lists ten churches allegedly torched in Alabama, but 
State Fire Marshall John Robison says that only one of these was a 
confirmed arson.  All the others were accidental, undetermined, or 
weren't fires at all but vandalisms. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
CDR somehow managed to omit three bonafide black church arsons that 
took place in Alabama in 1994.  In two cases the culprits were black. 
Moreover, the group left out ten black church arsons that took place 
before 1994, creating the illusion that the burning of black churches 
is a recent phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even the claim that black churches have been singled out for arson is 
questionable.  In 1995, according to USA Today, there were 45 arsons 
against white churches and 27 against black ones in the surveyed 
states. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Other than saying that some black churches over the years have fallen 
prey to racists, we can't easily infer motives. "We have not uncovered 
in [Alabama's] 38 cases a single piece of information to substantiate 
racially-motivated fires," said Robison.  Further, "There have been no 
dramatic increases, except for this year because of the media hype."  
Other states' officials have told him the same. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here lies the ultimate irony.  By claiming there has been an epidemic 
of black church burnings, it appears that in recent months they have 
actually caused one. They have also fomented tremendous racial 
division and caused great fear among southern black churchgoers. That 
which the Ku Klux Klan can no longer do, a group established to fight 
the Klan has done for them.

<title>Fumento: Old Law Continues to Be a Highway Killer - 7/5/96</title>

<h2>
Old Law Continues to Be a Highway Killer
</h2>

Michael Fumento

<P>
We often hear that to live longer, most of us need to lose weight.  
But did you know that when it comes to automobiles, losing weight is a 
killer? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's the conclusion of a draft National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) study just evaluated by the National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS).  It found that for every 100 pounds shaved off the 
average weight of cars, 322 more Americans will die each year in 
traffic accidents. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The NAS panel declined to endorse the report, but did not specifically 
reject the 322 death figure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That estimate is considerably higher than the 200 deaths  a year cited 
in a 1991 NHTSA report. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it should make us re-evaluate an anachronistic law that's turned 
an agency with "Safety Administration" in its name into a killer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The law is CAFE, which stands for Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
standards.  Congress enacted it in the mid-1970s as a means to 
increase the fuel economy of cars and reduce our dependence on foreign 
oil.  It mandates that the cars sold by any manufacturer selling in 
the United States must average at least 27.5 miles per gallon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since then, we've fought a war which made clear that nobody can tamper 
with our foreign oil supplies.  The post-war period has shown that the 
world has such a glut of oil that even with one of its major producers 
(Iraq) out the business, prices when adjusted for inflation are as low 
as they've ever been. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet CAFE remains on the books and it continues to kill.  Here's why. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are numerous ways in which auto makers have made their vehicles 
more fuel efficient.  Engines have been improved, tires have been 
stiffened so they balloon less at high speeds, car bodies have been 
made to cause less wind resistance. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But for all this, the easiest way to improve mileage is still to make 
a car lighter or to simply sell more lighter cars and fewer heavier 
ones. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA has calculated that every 10 percent reduction car weight, on 
average, produces and 8 percent reduction in fuel consumption. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And there's the rub.  For as car companies have sold more lighter 
cars, there have been more deaths as a result. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In what is still the best peer-reviewed work on the subject, Robert 
Crandall of the Brookings Institute and John Graham of Harvard 
calculated that CAFE had caused about 500 pounds to be cut from 
automobiles and that this 500 pound reduction was causing from 2,200 
to 3,900 fatalities per year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They found that each 100 pounds shaved off cost 440 to 780 lives--
somewhat above NHTSA's calculation but the point is the same.  
Lightness kills. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In defense of CAFE, NHTSA has pointed out that since it was enacted, 
automobile death rates have gone down considerably. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sure they have, but that's because on a per-vehicle miles traveled 
basis deaths have been going down since the 1920s.  The point is they 
would have declined even further but for CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another argument is that cars are safer than ever because of things 
like airbags and crumple zones that make the car collapse upon impact 
in such a way as to protect passengers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This, too, is true but irrelevant.  Were it not for CAFE those cars 
would be safer yet.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, one study shows that an airbag is the equivalent of about 485 
pounds.  So the airbag that you think makes you so much safer really 
just, on average, offsets CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA contends that while cars have gotten lighter, there's no telling 
how much of this is due to CAFE  and how much to market forces.  It 
notes that many consumer items, such as cameras have been downsized by 
manufacturers without any incentive from the government. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that comparison is "incredibly dumb," points out Sam Kazman, chief 
counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.  
"Cameras are products you carry around on cords around your neck.  
There's a tremendous incentive to make them smaller and lighter.  But 
with fuel prices staying the same, there's no indication that market 
forces have made cars lighter." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since 1988, Kazman and CEI have fought CAFE, calling it "blood for 
oil."  In 1992 they sued NHTSA over the agency's insistence that CAFE 
wasn't killing anyone.  The court found that NHTSA had used "fudged 
analysis," "statistical legerdemain," and "bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo" 
in order to avoid dealing with CAFE's safety impact. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unfortunately, NHTSA won the next time the case returned to the court, 
because the judges said that while they were troubled by the safety 
issue, a bureaucratic agency deserves a certain amount of deference. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And so, the deception continues.  As do the deaths. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If all that's not enough for you, Bill Clinton and Al Gore's 1992 
book, Putting People First proposes raising CAFE standards to 40 miles 
per gallon by the year 2,000 and 45 miles per gallon by 2015.  That 
sounds more like putting people last.

<h2>            
Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
When I heard seven tobacco company executives testify before Congress back in 1994 
that smoking wasn't addictive, I thought "These guys are lying through their nicotine-
stained teeth." The issue has resurfaced with Bob Dole's recent remarks at a Kentucky 
rally that, "To some people, smoking is addictive; to others, they can take it or leave it." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Having studied the issue since that original congressional hearing, I've found it's a lot 
more complex than most of us think. In fact, Dole's characterization seems about as 
sound as anything you'll hear on the subject. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
No matter, for Dole is a presidential candidate, and so a tempting--apparently irresistible-
-target. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The last thing our kids need to hear is a statement from a man who would be president 
that smoking is not addictive," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. "Senator Dole, side 
with our kids, not with the tobacco industry."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Dole's comments show that Joe Camel -- the cartoon 
advertisement figure -- is in the lead to be his running mate. Mother Jones magazine 
actually took a full-page advertisement out in the New York Times declaring that Joe 
Camel would be Dole's choice for Surgeon General. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Referring to the fact that tobacco companies have been among Dole's biggest campaign 
contributors, Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said "Bob Dole should spend 
more time looking at the scientific evidence and less time counting his campaign 
contributions."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But you needn't be a recipient of tobacco money to think that this addiction thing is a lot 
smokier than it might seem.  True, a lot of people have had a hard time quitting 
cigarettes, but there are about as many who have managed to quit as are still smoking.  
According to the surgeon general, the vast majority of them gave up the habit without 
formal treatment. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We live in a country in which a third of us are obese. Virtually all of them will tell you 
they've tried restricting their food intake but just can't keep it up.  Does that make food 
addictive? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One definition of addiction says that the substance in question must have some sort of 
intoxicating effect, and cigarettes do--albeit very slight compared to such drugs as 
cocaine and heroin.  But researchers have found the same thing about chocolate, that it 
raises levels of certain chemicals in the brain and makes you feel better. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of us joke about being "chocoholics" but to some who binge on thousands of 
calories of chocolate a day it's no laughing matter.  Indeed, a drug has now been found to 
block chocolate cravings. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But there is no scientific definition of addiction.  Neither the Diagnostic and Statistical 
manual of the American Psychiatric Association nor the World Organization use the term 
addiction.  This allows anybody who wants to use any definition they wish. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, the famous 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report on smoking concluded that 
smoking was not addictive, though the Surgeon General's office now says it is--a move 
some say is motivated by politics and not science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately it comes down to how a New York Times headline put it in 1994: "Is Nicotine 
Addictive?  It Depends on Whose Criteria You Use." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Bob Dole cleverly sidestepped the issue of whether smoking is addictive in general 
and observed that different substances have different effects on different people. You 
really can't argue with that--as much as his opportunistic opponents have tried. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As it is, however, the issue of addiction is a red herring.  Dole was also right when he 
said, "But I think the more serious question is whether or not the FDA has jurisdiction" 
over cigarettes. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA is using the addiction issue as an excuse to gain the power to regulate tobacco.  
But it routinely regulates drugs that are non-addictive--antibiotics, for instance--while 
forsaking regulation of substances that are. By the same criteria the FDA is applying to 
tobacco, "beverages containing alcohol or caffeine are addictive, but they're not regulated 
as drugs," notes Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, author of an upcoming 
book on the anti-smoking movement. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Addictiveness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for FDA jurisdiction," he 
says. Rather, it's just a smokescreen for Commissioner David Kessler to justify the 
sudden reversal of its longstanding position that cigarettes are not covered by the Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. "They pretend this is a new development," Sullum told me, "but 
people have been talking about the addictive potential of tobacco for hundreds of years." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Only in one respect was Dole truly wrong. He also told the Kentucky crowd, "In effect, if 
they should claim jurisdiction and find that cigarettes are a drug, then in effect, you're 
banning cigarettes and production of tobacco, so it's going to affect a lot of people." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Possibly, but probably not. Kessler and Waxman did initially say that if the FDA decided 
to regulate tobacco as a drug, a ban might be its only option. But now the FDA is instead 
pushing a series of measures ostensibly intended to reduce underage smoking, including 
restrictions on advertising, promotion, and sales. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Personally, I like some of what they propose. Society has traditionally given children less 
leeway to do stupid things than it has adults. But Dole's right in that cigarette regulation 
is best left to the states--and individuals and their parents. Federal Big Brother should--
pun intended--butt out.

<title>Fumento: Animal Rights Mean Human Wrongs - 6/20/96</title>

<h2>
     Animal Rights Mean Human Wrongs
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Back when I was in college, I attended a meeting of the local animal 
rights organization.  When somebody asked the group leader about using 
animals for medical research she replied (and I'm not making this up) 
"Well, it's our belief that people shouldn't get sick, in which case 
there would be no need for animal testing." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Such awesome smugness is actually par for the course for these people.  
Consider the following statements from Ingrid Newkirk, co-founder and 
vice-president of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the 
largest animal rights organization.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Medical research is "immoral even if it's essential." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even if animal testing produced a cure for AIDS, "We'd be against it."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And here's the kicker:   "Six million people died in concentration 
camps," she told the Washington Post, "but six billion broiler 
chickens will die this year in slaughter houses." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Somehow I have trouble identifying that chicken breast I ate last 
night with my cousins who died in German camps.  And I must say that 
"Heil Frank Perdue!" seems to lack an ominous ring. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But then, I am a member of the group that constitutes the lowest form 
of animal life.  No, not lawyers--humans. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This week, the animal rights groups are going on the warpath against 
us human types.  They're launching "World Animal Awareness Week," 
beginning June 18th, in Washington, D.C. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the medical community has decided it's mad as hell and 
isn't going to take it anymore. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They pre-empted Wacky Week by launching their own campaign.  It 
included a press conference, statements by scientists and patients 
affected by animal rights extremism, release of a joint consensus 
letter signed by the nation's leading AIDS organizations supporting 
animal testing, and a report called Endangered Cures, which details 
specific areas of research threatened by animal rights activists. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Animal rights activists aren't called that for nothing.  They don't 
just stand around on street corners politely handing out pamphlets.  
Indeed, they have struck at scores of labs across the country and in 
other nations, smashing equipment and releasing experimental animals--
sometimes killing them in the process. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Among the raids the animal liberators have conducted was one on the 
laboratory of Dr. John Orem, who was using cats in painless research 
on crib death.  Crib death will claim 8,000 babies lives this year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Everyone who works with experimental animals lives in constant fear of 
harassment, vandalism, and death threats.  Said PETA's medical 
advisor, Dr. Neal Barnard, a few years ago, "We're demoralizing the 
people who think there's a buck to be made in animal research.  And 
they're starting to get scared . . . and they're starting to veer 
away." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the activists are also waging a war of public opinion with 
misleading ad campaigns, staged photos of animals in pain, and by 
enlisting the support of many celebrities like Paul McCartney, the B-
52s, Kim Basinger, Mary Tyler Moore, Woody Harrelson, and Alec 
Baldwin--the last of whom was later spotted wearing a leather jacket.  
Oops. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The worst aspect of these campaigns, says Frankie Trull, president of 
the Foundation for Biomedical Research.  "Is the way they have shaped 
public opinion by providing misinformation and playing upon emotions 
of people who love pets." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is ironic, because if the activists get their way, keeping a pet 
will be outlawed as slavery.  Pet ownership is an "absolutely abysmal 
situation brought about by human manipulation," Newkirk told the 
Washingtonian magazine. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But such views are kept out of the slick adds.  As a result, "They're 
eroding public support that would allow this research to continue," 
Trull told me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The stakes couldn't be higher.  Animal testing of drugs intended for 
humans is absolutely vital.  Indeed, it's required by law. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"All drugs approved by FDA in last 30 years have to be tested on 
animals," says Wise Young, a professor of neurosurgery at New York 
University Medical Center and medical advisor to actor Christopher 
Reeve. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Without animal testing, he told me, we wouldn't have gotten anti-
hypertension drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, pharmaceuticals for epilepsy, 
or any of the modern anti-depressants.  "It's horrendous the kinds of 
lives people have when they don't have the benefits of research." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He noted that one drug originally tested on spinal cord injuries in 
humans failed.  But later it was tried in much higher doses in 
animals. There it was found effective and the trials were successfully 
repeated in humans.  This drug was given to Reeve and reduced his 
paralysis to the point where he has been able to resume much of his 
life. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, the animal rights activists are simply parasites.  They 
benefit just as much from animal-assisted medical research as anyone, 
even while they vigorously oppose it.  Oh sure, they abstain from 
eating hamburgers or wearing raccoon coats. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On the other hand, they could wear bracelets with tags (similar to 
those worn by persons with penicillin allergies), saying "In case of 
emergency, do not administer any drugs or therapies tested on 
animals." Bet you don't see that any time soon.

Wanted for pandering: President William J. Clinton. No, not 
philandering, pandering.  The latest incident: doling out money to 
veterans allegedly suffering from the effects of the herbicide Agent 
Orange, in order to shore up his political support among a group that 
has understandably come to loathe him.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clinton had a PR problem with the military even before he became 
president.  When almost three million of America's sons and daughters 
served their country in Vietnam, he was dodging the draft and figuring 
out a way to smoke marijuana without inhaling.  As president, he had 
barely taken the oath of office when he ordered that homosexuals be 
openly allowed in the military. And now, the greatest insult, his 
lawyer has declared him an active duty serviceman in order to postpone 
Paula Jones's suit against him. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So with the election just five months off and his opponent a true war 
hero, Clinton decided to open the government coffers to a number of 
Vietnam vets by providing compensation for those who have suffered 
from a rare nerve disease called peripheral neuropathy, who contract 
prostate cancer, or have babies born with spina bifida. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Veterans' Administration has estimated the five-year cost of this 
largesse at $350 million, which of course is too low because early 
estimates always are.  In any case, because prostate cancer is the 
most common malignant tumor in men (about one in ten will eventually 
contract it) and because Vietnam vets are only now starting to reach 
the age where it becomes a major threat, the cost of this giveaway 
will surely reach many billions of dollars. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This might be fair if there were scientific evidence that these 
problems were really being caused by Agent Orange.  But there is not. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Those who were exposed to the very highest levels--the men of 
"Operation Ranchhand" who actually sprayed it--have been intensely 
studied for years. They have shown no more cancers, and their children 
no more birth defects, people with no dioxin or Agent Orange exposure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, one of the Ranchhand researchers told a House committee in 
April, "The accumulated evidence does not establish that there is a 
cause-and-effect relationship between herbicide exposure and spina 
bifida." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So where does President Clinton get off on saying there IS a 
connection? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
His support comes from an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, which is 
an update of an earlier report previously used to grant compensation 
to veterans suffering other diseases such as Hodgkin's disease, non-
Hodgkins lymphoma, and certain respiratory cancers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
IOM is an arm of the non-governmental National Academy of Sciences.  
Congress asked the group to look into Agent Orange after Congress's 
own Office of Technology Assessment repeatedly found that very few 
ground troops were ever exposed to the herbicide and that no vets or 
their offspring had been shown to suffer health effects from it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Both IOM studies used methodology that was anything but scientific.  
They largely ignored the volumes of data that showed no link between 
Agent Orange and health effects--the Ranchhander findings--and instead 
looked at studies of  Swedish and Dutch herbicide applicators, and the 
like. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Any study of anybody anywhere in the world with exposure to 
herbicides was used by IOM," explains Michael Gough, director of 
science and risk studies at the Cato Institute, a former chairman of 
the Ranchhand Advisory Committee, and author of the book Dioxin, Agent 
Orange. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One problem: None of these people were exposed to Agent Orange, but 
rather to other types of herbicides, many of which didn't even contain 
dioxin. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, the studies themselves consistently contradicted each other.  
One might find an excess of lung cancer but not of Hodgkin's disease.  
Another would find an excess of Hodgkin's disease but not of lung 
cancer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ignoring such inconvenient facts, the IOM--well aware that it was 
working under political parameters and not scientific ones--seized on 
the slightest excuses to indict the herbicides even when the evidence 
weighed heavily on the other side. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, their 1993 report listed 28 studies which looked for 
prostate cancer among persons exposed to herbicide.  Of these, three 
were positive (that is, they found a statistically significant 
increase), one was significantly negative, and 24 didn't go either 
way.  Bingo!  Herbicides cause prostate cancer.  Agent Orange is an 
herbicide.  Ergo, Agent Orange causes prostate cancer! 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"It's unbelievably bad what the IOM did," says Gough. "I think one of 
the major costs of something like this is that all the scientists, 
government and nongovernment, who have done their best to understand 
and explain the health of veterans are now discredited." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, he says, it also bodes ill for getting the truth out on Gulf War 
Syndrome, another alleged disease phenomenon that has more to do with 
politics than science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, it is the vets themselves who will lose the most. Yes, 
some will get money, if they contract the right diseases. But at the 
same time, they're being needlessly terrified. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How many vets will now refuse to have babies because they're afraid 
they will be born with birth defects?  How many will spend the next 
few decades agonizing that because of their Vietnam service they are 
far more likely to contract prostate cancer, a terrible illness to get 
even if you survive it?   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Once again, Clinton has shown himself the enemy of the military.  And 
it's when he's making a show of being compassionate that he does the 
most damage.

<b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><br> 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am going to try to say this without sounding like a man-hating 
feminist. Here goes. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are few things in life more disgusting than men who, when 
discussing abortion, use the phrase: "I can't tell a woman what to do 
with her body." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's like a password. It's usually pronounced with a self-satisfied 
smile. They're saying, "I'm cool. I'm a supportive kinda guy. I'm 
sensitive to the needs of women." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yea, right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes, there's a slight reluctance in their voice as they recite 
the mantra. Those are the ones who believe that while they, 
personally, are opposed to abortion, they couldn't tell a 
woman...blah, blah, blah. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You've heard it before, I'm sure. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In most cases, these guys have never, in their lives, used the words 
"chaste" and "dating" in the same sentence. You can bet that many of 
them are pretty adroit at telling a woman what to do with her body, if 
it happens to serve their own needs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Abortion, or "choice," as it's euphemistically called, becomes a 
requirement, for many of them, because it has the ability to erase any 
unforeseen problems caused by their lack of moral discretion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I was at a G.O.P. cocktail party last week, and a man used that old 
line on me: "I can't tell a woman what to do with her body."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I gave him the logical response: "What about the body inside her womb? 
What if it's a male body, a little boy? Surely that can't be her body, 
because she can't be a man and a woman at the same time. Can you tell 
her, in that case?" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He looked at me glumly. This was not the response he expected. He 
probably assumed, because I'm a young woman, that I'm pro-choice.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not a wise move. Three major studies within the last four years show 
that women tend to be more pro-life than men.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Makes sense, doesn't it? We're the ones with the maternal instincts, 
and if we know the facts of life -- meaning all the stuff you never 
read in the newspaper, such as what an abortion does to an unborn 
child -- many of us come down on the side of the baby. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I've been around enough men to know that they occasionally daydream 
about great feats they would perform if, for example, they suddenly 
found themselves trapped, with their whole platoon, under enemy fire. 
It's one of the most charming qualities of men, this desire to prove 
themselves to be brave and fearless. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, so many men fail to realize that all around them, in our modern 
world, are opportunities to show their valor. Every day, they are 
confronted with opportunities to witness to the truth -- situations 
which, perhaps, take more courage than saving a platoon from enemy 
attack. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once a month, I attend a rosary vigil with about 200 people in front 
of a local Planned Parenthood clinic. I see the woman going in for 
abortions, some reluctantly, some being steered through the door by a 
man who is probably the father of the baby.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After about 45 minutes, some of the men come out, alone, looking 
relieved. They did their duty and sat in the waiting room with their 
significant other until it was time for the abortion, and then they 
get to go off -- get a cup of coffee, read the paper -- while she's in 
the recovery room.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What bothers me is that most of these guys are dressed as if they were 
on a date -- as if they were on the way to the movies. Except, this 
date involves the destruction of their children, and the wounding of 
their girlfriends. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'm with the early feminists, when it comes to abortion. Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Dr. Alice Bunker Stockham, and the 
whole crowd of them were staunchly pro-life. They called abortion 
"child murder," and the "exploitation of women and children." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More emphatically, they pointed out that abortion primarily serves the 
needs of the predatory male. In a July, 1869, article in "The 
Revolution," the feminist newspaper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
and Susan B. Anthony, the latter -- of current U.S. one-dollar coin 
fame-- wrote: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Guilty? Yes, no matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to 
save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty 
who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will 
burden her soul in death; but oh! thrice guilty is he who, for selfish 
gratification, heedless of her prayers, indifferent to her fate, drove 
her to the desperation which impels her to the crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In her day, Susan B. Anthony was describing a tiny minority of men. 
Today, you'll run into hordes of them at just about any political 
cocktail party you attend. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, still, there are countless other men who dare to swim against the 
tide -- men who respect life, and respect women, at a time when 
neither is required by the world. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those are men who don't have to daydream about performing feats of 
great valor. They do it every day.

When the local Catholic priest trades his black suit and Roman collar 
for faded jeans and a T-shirt, and says to his flock, "Just call me 
Bob," what should you do? 
<P>
I suppose intercessory prayer should be your first response, but after 
that, you might think of picking up "Serpent On the Rock," a 1994 book 
by Alice Thomas Ellis, a native of Liverpool. 
<P>
It's a funny, faithful, and realistic view of what it means to be 
Catholic in the 1990s.  <P>

P.D. James, best-selling author of British murder mysteries, reviewed 
the book for the Times Literary Supplement, and described it as: "One 
woman's idiosyncratic, passionate and sometimes intemperate 
view...(It) should be compulsory reading for all bishops and placed in 
the library of all seminaries and theological colleges." <P>

But, most importantly, it will make you laugh. In fact, it's quite 
possible that while reading the book you will, on occasion, be 
convulsed by fits of uncontrollable laughter. I was. 
<P>
Ellis, the mother of seven children, traveled across Ireland and 
England, asking people what they thought about the current state of 
the Catholic Church.  <P>

 Ecumenism, liberation theology, liturgy, and feminism -- it's all 
there. <P>

She gives plenty of ink to Catholics who dissent from Church 
teachings. Then, she politely puts in a word or two of her own. 
<P>
She writes: "Visiting some people I had not seen for years I found 
again that smiling determination to deny that there is anything awry 
in the Church -- despite the fact that the Vatican and many 
theologians are seldom in accord and that there is laxity, confusion 
and an abundance of what used to be called heresy until it was decided 
that this was rude and everyone was entitled to his own opinion." 
<P>
Ellis, on church architecture: <P>

"If you visited a place where you knew the Catholic church had been 
recently constructed, you only had to ask for the most diabolically 
ugly building in town, bar none." 
<P>
On the interior decoration of churches: 
<P>
"It doesn't feel too different from McDonald's or the bank, and the 
local post office has got a new carpet, too. If I merely want to feel 
comfortable I go to the pub." 
<P>
On Confession: <P>
   "The church noticeboard advertised a 'Ceremony of Reconciliation' 
with the word 'Confession' in brackets. One day, bowed down under an 
awareness of my failings, I went to unburden my soul. Having conducted 
an examination of conscience I announced 'sub rosa' that, on 
reflection, I had to accuse myself of having fallen short in virtually 
every aspect of what was required of me: I was, to say the least, 
inadequate as a daughter, wife, mother and Catholic. Picture my 
astonishment on hearing my confessor suggest soothingly that he feared 
I was suffering from 'low self-esteem.'" 
<P>
On women priests:  
<P>
"I find something infinitely touching in the sight of males serving at 
the altar. A seriousness, a dignity and a humility which are not 
readily apparent in most of the other things they do. Women don't give 
the same impression. I saw some round the altar in New Zealand. They 
looked incongruous and bossy, very much as though they felt only they 
knew how to wash up properly." 
<P>
On sex: 
<P>
"I keep meeting women who insist on telling me how important their sex 
drive is to them. Once they might have announced they were regular 
church-goers; now they tell you they're sexually active. It's a sort 
of claim to credibility." 
<P>
On homosexuality: 
<P>
"Nor do I understand why so many people seem determined to define 
themselves by their sexual orientation. It seems unnecessarily 
limiting. When a person fixes you with a glance and says 'I'm 
gay/lesbian, you know,' you think: 'So what, darling? Just don't eat 
with your mouth open.'" 
<P>
On nuns:  
<P>
"One sometimes hears of women who are said to have been 'hurt' by the 
Church. I was thinking now of a new-style 'nun' who, finding herself 
at dinner sitting between two Jesuits, burst into tears because they 
spoke only to each other. She felt ignored and therefore diminished -- 
and fled, weeping. As a married women I am entirely accustomed to this 
kind of experience and do not mind it in the least. It gives you time 
to think your own thoughts, which are often more diverting than the 
conversations of men. Perhaps she would have felt more at ease in an 
old-fashioned convent where she would not have had to cope with the 
complexities of social intercourse between the sexes." 
<P>
Unfortunately, you might have a problem getting your hands on a copy 
of "Serpent on the Rock," published by Hodder and Stoughton, a British 
firm. So far, the book hasn't been distributed in America. 
<P>
Your local bookstore may be able to special-order it. If you have 
friends or relatives in Ireland or England, you could ask them, or 
even beg them, to send you a copy. Or, write directly to the publisher 
at: 338 Euston Rd., London NW1 3BH. 
<P>
It's worth the effort. If you're not one of the lucky Catholics in 
America who lives in a parish with a licit and reverential Mass, then 
you're probably long overdue for a dose of laughter, the best 
medicine.

<html><head><title>Howley: Divorce, Irish Style</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 28, 1995</I><hr><h2>Divorce, Irish Style</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  

Centuries of oppression couldn't stamp out the Catholic Church in 
Ireland. The deadlier the persecutions became, the more people clung 
to the Rock of Peter. 
<p>
A tragic famine that killed one out of every eight people in Ireland 
didn't shake their faith. Only a tiny fraction became "soupers," the 
name given to people who denied the faith in order to receive food 
from Protestant soup kitchens. 
<p>
Nor could dismal poverty, lasting for generations, make Irish people 
lose their hope in winning eternal life through fidelity to the 
teachings of the Church.  
<p>
But, a decade or two of secularization and materialism has managed to 
cripple the faith in Ireland quite easily, with hardly a voice raised 
in complaint. 
<p>
For proof of that, just look at their politics. 
<p>
In 1990, Ireland elected a left-wing, pro-choice lawyer, Mary 
Robinson, as president. In 1993, the government removed legal 
sanctions against homosexual activity, and made condoms freely 
available. 
<p>
And now, in a country that is more than 92 percent Catholic, divorce 
has been legalized -- albeit by a wafer-thin margin. 
<p>
In fact, the recent divorce referendum proved to be the closest vote 
in Irish history. A recount confirmed that only 9,114 "yes" votes 
provided the margin of victory for 1.6 million ballots cast. 
<p>
The Irish press lent a helping hand in defeating the pro-family 
forces, just as our own American press does for family issues on our 
side of the ocean. 
<p>
For example, Irish articles tended to describe those who opposed the 
legalization of divorce as blindly following the heavy-handed 
teachings of the oppressive Catholic Church. 
<p>
On the other hand, pro-divorce voters were not portrayed as mindlessly 
following the dictates of the liberal agenda -- like liberal Democrats 
in America, who all claim to be free-thinkers, yet, march lockstep on 
every issue.  
<p>
No -- articles tended to give the impression that supporting divorce 
qualified someone as being thoughtful and farseeing. 
<p>
And, the press employed their usual "reductio ad extremus" technique, 
giving big play to stories that profiled heartbreaking cases, to 
emphasize the tragic results of opposing liberal advances.  
<p>
Such as: the story of a young woman, abused and deserted by her 
husband, consigned to a life alone. In reality, that situation 
represents only a tiny fraction of the marriages in Ireland. 
<p>
Someday, the Irish will learn what many Americans have gleaned from 
watching the disintegration of our own society: Tough cases make bad 
laws. 
<p>
As it turned out, there were several deciding factors in the campaign 
to legalize divorce. The biggest was the $800,000 chunk of public 
money used by the government to fund a pro-divorce publicity drive. 
Shortly before the big vote, an Irish court ruled it was illegal to 
use tax revenues in that way. But, by then it was too late. Most of it 
was already spent. 
<p>
And, the pro-divorce movement was helped with cameo appearances by a 
host of Irish celebrities, such as Bono of U2, and Van Morrison. 
<p>
Another factor was the weakness of the Catholic Church, depleted by an 
endless array of sex sandals that began several years ago when the 
much-beloved bishop of Galway, Eamonn Casey, resigned after admitting 
he had fathered a child with an American woman. 
<p>
In the days before the vote, posters appeared on lampposts all over 
Dublin picturing Bishop Casey. The text stated: "Let the Bishops look 
after their own families ... VOTE YES." 
<p>
Fifteen years ago, no prominent Irish politician would have dared to 
support divorce. To do so would have meant mean electoral suicide. 
Yet, in the recent divorce campaign, every major party was pro-
divorce. 
<p>
What could have caused such a change in Irish society? The biggest 
impetus, many agree, has been the endless stream of soul-less 
television shows beamed into Irish homes over the last decade, most of 
it American-made. 
<p>
Last June, I was in Ireland, visiting my family. One afternoon, I 
stopped at a friend's farmhouse for tea, and while we chatted, she 
kept the television on in the background to entertain her four-year-
old daughter. 
<p>
Children in Ireland watch television just like American kids: soaking 
everything in with big eyes. 
<p>
It was an episode of "Murphy Brown" that portrayed Murphy and her 
lover having a tryst in a hotel room.  
<p>
My friend didn't mind that her daughter was exposed to such 
immorality. But, it was a shock to me, even though I was weaned on 
that kind of trash. 
<p>
What was once inconceivable in Ireland had become old hat. 
<p>
In times past, the Irish believed that marriages, even unhappy ones, 
lasted forever. They believed that adultery was a poison to a society. 
And, their laws reflected their beliefs.  
<p>
Today, they have set their sights on the liberal path that Americans 
blazed more than 20 years ago.  
<p>
It leads, as we know first-hand, to a place where broken families, 
violence and endless heartache are commonplace. 
<p>
Remember that lonely young woman, abused and abandoned by her husband? 
Currently, she represents just a handful of Irish women. But, you can 
bet that in a few decades, that sort of misery will be spread all over 
Ireland.

<html><head><title>Howley:  Pagans I Have Known</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 16, 1995</I><hr><h2>Pagans I Have Known</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  
 
The press pretty much ignored the 20th annual Women's Ordination 
Conference, held during the Veteran's Day weekend at a Marriott hotel 
near Washington D.C. 
<p>
Apparently, it's not newsworthy when 1,000 Catholic women -- more than 
half of them nuns from mainstream orders -- gather to denounce the 
teachings of their church, ridicule the pope, and voice avid support 
for lesbianism and abortion.  
<p>
Ho hum. Tell me something new. 
<p>
But, if the reporters and their cameras had been there, I'd be willing 
to bet that they wouldn't have focused on the over-the-edge, bizarre 
events of the conference, such as the Friday night opening ritual that 
included women dressed as bishops and priests, dancing on-stage to a 
rhythmic, sensual drum beat.  
<p>
Instead, they probably would have zoomed in on the mere handful of 
moments that corresponded with their idea of what these women are 
interested in: ordination and inclusive language. 
<p>
But, anyone who has spent five minutes around W.O.C. members knows 
better. Do you really think these women want to kneel at the feet of a 
"patriarchal" bishop to receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders?  
<p>
No way. First, they don't believe in Sacraments, as instituted by 
Christ and defined by the Catholic Church. For example, I've heard 
their leaders suggest, repeatedly, that several new Sacraments should 
be added to mark the stages of women's lives, such as the onset of 
wisdom, which supposedly happens when a woman reaches 50 -- they call 
it "croning." 
<p>
The "Sacrament of Croning." See what I mean?  
<p>
Secondly, they are adamant about their desire to dismantle the 
priesthood as we know it, and change the function of a priest into a 
non-sacramental facilitator who derives power from the community. 
<p>
 "Ordination means sub-ordination," was the mantra at the recent 
conference. They claim they want to "deconstruct" the priesthood. 
Meaning, they want to destroy it. 
<p>
And, inclusive language? They're definitely not interested in that. 
They demand that liturgical language be exclusively feminine. 
<p>
I've been to plenty of W.O.C. and Women-Church gatherings. The events 
always include prayers to the goddess, who, for the uninitiated, has 
three personalities -- maiden, mother, and crone -- each with various 
names. 
<p>
And, the conferences usually include bread-breaking rituals that 
resemble a Catholic Mass. 
<p>
At most of their rituals, the focal point is an altar with a statue of 
the goddess, usually with a candle burning in front of it.  
<p>
During the Saturday night "ritual meal" at the recent conference, 
there was no statue in sight, but the goddess personality of the 
moment was the ever-popular Sophia, a W.O.C. invention that twists the 
Scriptural meaning of "Sophia" -- recognized by Catholics as the 
virtue of wisdom, or as another name for the Holy Spirit -- and turns 
it into a pagan deity. 
<p>
That night, in the darkened banquet hall, one of the incantations 
sounded eerily like the Divine Praises: 
<p>
"Blessed be Sophia. Blessed be her holy name. Blessed be all women: 
young, generative and wise. Blessed be Sophia's sisters who keep alive 
the discipleship of equals. Blessed be all children who tell the 
stories of their foremothers...."  
<p>
It was chanted by all the attendees, following a bread-breaking 
ceremony. The only ones who didn't take part were a handful of 
faithful Catholics who were there as observers. 
<p>
Hours later, after the ritual meal was finished, and the attendees had 
moved on to another room for an all-women dance with cash bar, I spoke 
to one of the waitresses, who was clearing tables. 
<p>
"What did you think?" I asked her. 
<p>
"I'm a born-again Christian," she warily told me, in broken English, 
"so I really don't know about these Catholic things." 
<p>
"This was definitely not Catholic. It was pagan," I said, 
emphatically. 
<p>
She looked relieved to find out that I wasn't one of "them," and 
confided, in a low voice, "I felt the presence of evil here, tonight." 
<p>
"Me, too," I told her. 
<p>
Beyond the fact that every soul is precious in the eyes of the Father, 
why should the apostasy of W.O.C. followers interest us in the least? 
<p>
Because these are powerful women. They teach at Catholic universities 
and seminaries. They run Catholic high schools. They work in 
chancelleries and parishes. They design R.C.I.A. and C.C.D. programs. 
They run retreats and offer spiritual direction to unsuspecting 
Catholics. 
<p>
They don't want to leave the Church. They want to remake it, in their 
own image. 
<p>
And, it's rare to find one who doesn't have a string of graduate 
degrees after her name. The elderly members of their religious orders 
may live in fear of losing their health insurance as a result of a 
shrinking financial base, but these younger members, typically 50 to 
65 years old, have plenty of money to continue their education. 
<p>
In the battle for the soul of the Roman Catholic Church in America, 
these women are mighty adversaries, indeed.<p><p> <I>Copyright 1995, <a href="mailto:73360.271@compuserve.com">Kathleen Howley</a></i><P> <br><center><a href="/townhall/tbut.map"><img src="/townhall/tbut.gif" ismap border="0"></a></center></body></html>

Americans are in the dark when it comes to the Catholic Church in 
China -- or, I should say, the two Churches in China: one, the 
underground Roman Catholic Church, the other, the Communist-controlled 
Patriotic Catholic Church. 
<p>
To illustrate the degree of confusion, Joseph Kung, the nephew of 
Ignatius Cardinal Kung, the much-beloved bishop of Shanghai, tells the 
following story: 
<p>
He was at a pro-life dinner last year in New Jersey. A monsignor 
tapped him on the shoulder, introduced himself, and said: "I just saw 
your uncle. He gave a speech at the seminary this morning." 
<p>
Joseph Kung knew his uncle had not been at the seminary that day, and 
immediately realized that the monsignor was talking about the OTHER 
bishop of Shanghai -- Aloysius Jin Luxian, S.J., appointed by the 
Communists and consecrated without the Holy Father's permission. 
<p>
After Kung explained the situation, the monsignor replied: "I had no 
idea. I thought I was listening to the Roman Catholic bishop of 
Shanghai. And, so did all the other people at the lecture." 
<p>
Generous Catholics in America have donated millions of dollars to aid 
the Catholic Church in China. Few realize that their money is helping 
to support the Patriotic Church. 
<p>
Still, the real Catholic Church in China is alive and growing 
stronger, despite the fact that it is persecuted, penniless, and, it 
would seem, friendless. 
<p>
Chinese Roman Catholics celebrate their Masses in hiding, or, during 
bolder moments, in open fields. They risk life and limb to protect 
their underground priests and seminarians. Their families pray the 
Rosary in secret.  
<p>
Life would be easy if they would just align themselves with the 
Patriotic Catholic Church. But, they won't. 
<p>
They follow the example of their shepherds, the loyal bishops who have 
refused to renounce the fullness of the faith, despite imprisonment 
and torture. Three years ago, one elderly bishop, Joseph Fan Xueyan, 
S.J., was beaten to death by his jailers. The rest of the world hardly 
noticed. But, his flock did. 
<p>
On the other hand, the Patriotic Church controls the real estate, the 
churches, and has approval from the Communist government and numerous 
Catholic bishops in the free world. Often, their seminarians study in 
America, supported by American dioceses. 
<p>
Bishops and priests of the Patriotic Church describe themselves as 
loyal members of the Catholic Church. Or, if they are willing to admit 
to their true status, they'll rationalize that the pope is "making 
overtures" to the Patriotic Church.  
<p>
The Holy Father has a certain brand of patience and tact that he uses 
when dealing with Communists -- a method he learned first-hand during 
his years in Poland. It's not to be confused with approval. 
<p>
In fact, John Paul II made his feelings clear when he made the true 
and loyal bishop of Shanghai -- Ignatius Kung -- a Prince of the 
Church. 
<p>
"With what prayerful longing and love do I follow the life of the 
loyal Chinese Catholic communities," the pope said, when he received 
Cardinal Kung in 1991. 
<p>
True -- the Patriotic bishops say they love the Holy Father, and 
respect him as the Successor of Peter. But, they don't believe that he 
has the authority to appoint bishops or to govern the Catholics in 
China. 
<p>
Cardinal Kung, now 94 and living in Connecticut, spent 30 years in a 
Communist prison. If he had been willing to renounce the authority of 
the pope, he would have been released and rewarded with a high 
position in the Patriotic Church. Others did -- like Bishop Jin of 
Shanghai, Bishop Fu Tieshan of Beijing, and Bishop Zong Huaide, the 
president of the Patriotic Association. But, Cardinal Kung would not. 
<p>
Today, the Communists continue to arrest members of the underground 
Church. Sadly, the state-connected Patriotic Church has yet to 
denounce the persecutions. 
<p>
The ranks of the loyal bishops arrested within the last few weeks 
include the 76-year-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu -- his second arrest since 
August -- as well as Bishop Han Dingxiang and Bishop Jia Zhiguo. All 
were later released, but the message was clear: don't give us trouble, 
or you'll be arrested again. 
<p>
Several underground priests, including a Jesuit, are currently serving 
prison terms. One was recently released, after being severely 
tortured. 
<p>
And, lay people have been imprisoned for attending an underground 
Mass. This past Easter, dozens were arrested and tortured. 
<p>
For an update on recent arrests, or for information on how to help the 
underground Catholic Church in China, contact the Cardinal Kung 
Foundation, P.O. Box 8086, Ridgeway Center, Stamford CT 06905. 
<p>
 With all its advantages, it would be reasonable to assume that the 
Patriotic Catholic Church has the most followers, wouldn't it? But, it 
doesn't work out that way. 
<p>
There are three million members of the Patriotic Church. Compared that 
to NINE million members of the underground Roman Catholic Church -- an 
increase of 300 percent since the beginning of the persecution in 
1949. 
<p>
Best of all, the true bishops of China continue to proclaim Church 
teachings joyfully, loudly and completely -- even though they know the 
only way to ensure their own safety is to stay silent. 
<p>
Sixty years ago, Catholic school children in America donated "pennies 
for China" to support the missions. 
<p>
Today, we have reaped a priceless reward for that almsgiving: an 
example of courage and faithfulness that could -- if it were more 
widely known -- be an inspiration for others to remain steadfast in 
the ancient Faith.

<h2>Old TV Makes A Comeback</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
I stopped watching mainstream television shows almost two years ago. I 
finally cracked.  <p>

One of the last straws was an episode of "Seinfeld" -- a well-written 
series that was relatively clean in its first year, but gradually 
ended up in the gutter. <p>

Jerry, after sleeping with his new girlfriend, decides that he doesn't 
like her. So, he asks a buddy how many more dates he has to waste on 
her so he can break up with her "like a gentleman."  
<p>
Has womanhood fallen so low in America? Is respect for females so 
absent, and the standards of gentlemanly conduct so warped? 
<p>
The answer is, "Yes." But, but, must we be continually reminded? 
<p>
I resolved -- after that episode, and others that were even worse -- 
to honor the old-time computer motto: "Garbage in, garbage out." 
<p>
Watching shows that featured members of my generation sinking to the 
bottom of a moral pit -- although being very witty in the process -- 
was bound to effect any viewer, eventually. Makes sense, doesn't it?   
<p>
So, I decided to go cold turkey. 
<p>
Now, I keep the TV tuned to either CNN, C-Span, or Nickelodeon, the 
cable station where Dick and Laura Petrie are still young, Mary Tyler 
Moore is still looking for a husband, and Lucy is still trying to get 
a spot in Ricky's nightclub act. 
<p>
Perhaps Nick at Night, advertised as "safe TV," has put me out of 
touch with popular culture. Recently, I asked a friend, "Did you watch 
Nick last night?" 
<p>
She replied, innocently, "Whose Nick?" 
<p>
And, last month, when I saw a road sign for New Rochelle during a trip 
to New York, I turned to a pal and asked, "Hey, do you know who lives 
there?"  
<p>
She didn't. 
<p>
But, a growing number of Americans could answer that question. TV 
shows that feature a better vision of America are making a comeback, 
as recounted in a recent Washington Times story. 
<p>
The article, titled, "Old television gives disgruntled viewers new 
hope," credits the "Dick Van Dyke" show -- set, of course, in New 
Rochelle, NY -- as being one of the most popular shows on "old TV." 
<p>
According to the article, Warner Brothers, Universal, Columbia and 
Paramount are all trying to start cable networks that will feature 
1960s and 1970s sitcoms. 
<p>
Old television is big. Very big. 
<p>
And, why not? The old shows remind us of a era, not so long ago, when 
Moms were at home when their kids came in the door from school, 
neighborhoods were safe, and marriages tended to last a lifetime. 
<p>
I was a baby when Dick Van Dyke made its original run in the 1960s, so 
I don't remember it first-hand. But, that was the America that I grew 
up in. Not such a bad world, after all. 
<p>
When I was a kid, my Mom used to send us out the door without worrying 
about us -- just like Laura did with Richie. Can you imagine? Even if 
we were a whole block away, there was another Mom nearby, keeping an 
eye on us through her kitchen window.  
<p>
The biggest part of our day was when Dad came home from work -- just 
like on the old sitcoms. We would crowd around him, looking for hugs. 
The dog would bark. It was general pandemonium. 
<p>
Now, the biggest part of the day for many American children is the 
moment when Dad or Mom walks through the door of their daycare center 
to take them home for a few short hours, before returning them the 
next morning. 
<p>
Today's network executives have a strange sense of what "family 
values" means. They claim their new fall lineup is dominated by family 
shows.  
<p>
But, the most normal family they could come up with is portrayed in 
"Bless This House." According to the previews, it portrays a family 
with "rock solid values."  
<p>
Unfortunately, the actor who plays the husband is Andrew Dice Clay -- 
a real-life comedian known for his obscene nightclub acts. 
<p>
In addition, TV executives this year came up with 10 new "family 
shows" with divorced or single parents. Some would call that being 
"realistic." I call it, "accentuating the negative." 
<p>
Also, on the heels of the already-established "NYPD Blue," touted as 
the first R-rated television series, there are at least a half-dozen, 
brand-new "adult" shows bent on breaking new ground. Half feature law 
firms. The rest feature news rooms. 
<p>
TV Guide describes one of them as containing "gratuitous lewdness." 
Remember -- in the eyes of TV Guide, that's not necessary meant to be 
critical.  
<p>
Another contains "risqu scenes." A third is described as "seductive." 
<p>
If the writing is good, and the story lines are interesting, the new 
R-style shows will probably attract even some Americans who try to 
live according to higher principles.  
<p>
And, despite their good intentions, they will slowly, bit by bit, be 
corroded.  
<p>
After all, garbage in, garbage out. 
<p>
Give me that old-time TV, any day of the week. 
<p>

<h2>GRAMM: CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are just a year away, and the contestants for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination are already out of the gate and heading for the first turn.  With an unpopular Democratic incumbent likely to be on top of the ticket -- for the first time in sixteen years -- and with a historic victory in last November's midterm congressional elections, Republican challengers are fighting to win a nomination many see as virtually guaranteeing a four-year lease on the White House.<p>
One GOP presidential aspirant has a leg up on the competition -- and maybe an arm, as well.  In the view of many political insiders, in fact, he's been preparing to run for President for at least the last decade, with his sights set on the 1996 GOP nomination.  With a secure Senate seat, a national fund-raising apparatus to go with his prodigious fund-raising skills, and an issue clearly in vogue, he is likely to be one of the finalists for the GOP crown.<p>
He is U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and though he has never before run for national office, he already is seen as a member of the GOP's top tier of presidential contenders.<p>
<b>THE NEW NOMINATING ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Before we can begin a dispassionate analysis of a presidential contender's prospects, we must recognize the changes in the rules regarding the nominating process, and their likely impact on the contest itself.<p>
The formal 1996 nominating season will be shorter than any in recent memory.  Large states like California and New York -- which, between them, control one-third of all the electoral votes needed to capture the White House -- long have held their primary elections relatively late in the election season.  As a result, they had relatively little influence over the party nominees.  Party activists in those two states, tired of having to support candidates largely chosen for them by others in states with earlier primary elections, finally rebelled and decided to move their respective state's primary elections up on the calendar, to give them more influence over the process.  Key midwestern states -- Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan -- facing the loss of their own influence as a result of the California and New York moves, are now considering holding their primaries on the same day in mid-March, as sort of a Midwestern regional primary.<p>
The result:  with California moving from early June to late March, and with New York moving from late April to early May, more than seventy percent of the delegates to the 1996 GOP convention will be chosen within a six-week period from mid-February to the end of March.<p>
The impact of the scheduling change on the nominating race could hardly be more dramatic.  No longer will long-shot candidates have the luxury of plotting an insurgent upset in Iowa or New Hampshire, then coasting on free media while raising money over the next several weeks.  In the new environment, money will matter even more than previously; candidates simply won't have time to raise large amounts while in the heat of battle.  Most seasoned analysts expect that a candidate will have to have a minimum of $20-$25 million on hand on January 1, 1996, to have a serious shot at winning.  And the shortened time-frame means that name identification and media skills will increase in value, as well.<p>
This new environment, then, favors candidates with the ability to raise large amounts of money, who know how to present themselves well through the media, and who already have positive name identification.  On two of these three counts, Phil Gramm is well-armed for the competition.<p>
<b>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Money is the mother's milk of politics, now more than ever.  Of the last eight major party nominees for President -- that is, going back to the 1980 campaign -- seven were the candidates in their party who had the most money in the bank on December 31 of the year preceding the nomination contest.  The new primary schedule enhances the need for early money.  Gramm has some of the best fund-raising skills of any of the likely contestants -- including even Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who has already run three national campaigns.  Even before the end of the 1994 election cycle, Gramm was far in front of the pack when measured by funds on hand for a potential run -- he had almost $8 million in the bank, as compared to about $2.5 million for Dole.  None of the other potential GOP candidates had even $1 million on hand.<p>
Too, Gramm knows how to raise money.  In his last Senate campaign, he spent more than $12 million; and since then, he has served four years as chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  From his post at the NRSC, Gramm has had the opportunity to travel the country on behalf of dozens of GOP Senate candidates -- and, in the process, has acquainted himself with literally thousands of high-dollar donors, the kind who write $1,000 checks without a second thought.  It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that every American who has contributed $5,000 or more to the GOP in the last four years probably has an autographed photograph of himself and Gramm hanging on the wall of his den or office.<p>
The second key to winning the GOP nomination will be positive name identification.  This is the chink in Gramm's armor.  As the field begins to shape up for 1996, Gramm runs far behind better-known party leaders like Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, and Dick Cheney.  In early trial polls, Gramm only captures 2-3 percent of the GOP vote against the field, while Dole and Kemp battle it out for first place in the low twenties and high teens.<p>
But name identification can be driven up with paid advertising -- as long as there is adequate money to finance it.  As noted above, Gramm will likely have more money to spend than any other candidate in the field.  Thus, it is the third key to the nomination -- media skills -- that likely will become the determining factor.<p>
Media skills can be broken down into PAID media skills and EARNED media skills.  "Paid" media is just that -- media advertising paid for with campaign dollars; "earned" media is time on the mass media earned by the candidate for making news in some way.<p>
Gramm's earned media skills have, for the most part, been little better than adequate.  His slow Texas twang turns off Northeasterners as much as it soothes Southerners; but his wit and his knack for framing issues serve him well in the studio interview setting.  He has been known to drone on in speeches to large gatherings; he is perhaps best-remembered for his long-winded and boring keynote speech to the 1992 GOP convention in Houston.<p>
But while Gramm may not be well-armed when it comes to basic earned media skills, when the battleground shifts to PAID media skills, there is not a stronger warrior on the field.  Gramm's television commercials are things of beauty, miniature movies -- not surprising, given the attention Gramm pays them, not to mention the money he lavishes on these mini-productions.<p>
In big states like New York and California, the ability to successfully communicate with the electorate through television advertising is THE key to success.  And that means just two things are needed:  a good flight of commercials, and the money to saturate the media.  Gramm will have both.<p>
<b>SOME NEGATIVES</b><p>
It's a good thing Gramm has money going for him, because he's got to overcome several handicaps on his way to the White House.  To begin, no Republican has gone directly from the Senate to the presidency in this century (and only one Democrat, John Kennedy, has made the trip); Senate experience appears not to be as great a plus as experience in a governor's mansion, which, with its executive decision-making prerogatives, is viewed by most voters as a better testing ground for the nation's chief executive.<p>
Moreover, Gramm -- long known to the public at large as a conservative activist -- starts with a relatively small base in his own party, as a result of the kind of internecine warfare among conservatives that threatens to divide their movement and render it politically impotent.<p>
At issue is Gramm's support for the 1990 budget deal -- which included what was then the biggest tax increase in the nation's history -- despite President Bush's promise of no new taxes.  While conservatives on and off Capitol Hill raged about the President's betrayal, Gramm loyally carried water for Bush, and was pilloried by purist conservatives for his apostasy.  The following year he opposed a Social Security payroll tax cut offered by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and even opposed another Social Security payroll tax cut -- combined with a capital gains tax cut -- offered by Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Tom DeLay.<p>
These heresies have given cause to some conservatives to think that Gramm -- a former economics professor at Texas A&M -- cares about only the spending side of the budget equation, and that he is unwilling to consider tax cuts as stimulative and necessary.  To most Americans, these arcane debates -- pitting minority factions of a minority party against one another -- remind them of nothing so much as Medieval arguments over how many angels will fit on the head of a pin; but to the conservative activists who have enormous influence over the nominating process of the Republican Party, they are important tests of purity.  If Gramm allows himself to be boxed in to a corner marked "green eye-shade Republican" along with Bob Dole, he will leave the economic optimist label open to others.<p>
But it's not just money and access to money that sets Gramm apart from the rest of the Republican field; it is another trait, deep in his bones.  In the words of one former House colleague of Gramm's, "Phil wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself, 'What are the ten things I need to do today to be President?' -- and then he gets seven of them done."  It is a driving ambition deep within Gramm, a determination to do what it takes in order to be President.??<p>

<title>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</h2>
<i> by Bill Pascoe</i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Add Bill Bradley to a list that already includes Ross Perot, Colin Powell, and Jesse Jackson, and what do you have?  On the surface, a list of possible Independent candidates for the presidency -- but below the surface, a recipe for the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
For even as the political class muses loudly and publicly about the erosion of two-party politics and the breakdown of civil society -- both because the Establishment finds such talk interesting in an otherwise slow news month, and because it sells newspapers -- it blithely overlooks a fundamental fact gleaned from any in-depth analysis of American political history:  that national elections are about relatively simple choices; that much more often than not, those choices boil down to ONE simple question in the minds of most voters (to wit, Do I want to return the incumbent party for another four years in the White House?); and that, therefore, virtually any Independent candidacy (to the extent it is effective in its goal, which is to win votes) can have but one result -- the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.  In 1996, the exception could be Mr. Jackson.  A Jackson Independent candidacy would likely have two effects, at least one of which would be good for the Democratic Party:  on the down side, a likely split-off of the black vote, with much of it going to Mr. Jackson, thereby making more difficult Mr. Clinton's chances for reelection; but on the good side,  an increased turnout among black voters, which could redound to the party's benefit in salvaging congressional seats that otherwise would be considered at risk.<p>
The jury is still out on whether Mr. Jackson will run or not.  The betting here is that he won't.  But that still leaves Messrs. Bradley, Powell, and Perot.<p>
And if even one of the three were to mount a serious Independent candidacy -- let alone a combination, or even, possibly, all three -- the likely result would be a renewal of Mr. Clinton's lease at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<p>
Ah, the Conventional Wisdom says, of course that's true of potential Independent bids by Mr. Powell or Mr. Perot.  Both of them, according to the CW, would draw more heavily from the GOP presidential candidate.  Nothing new there.  But how would an Independent bid by a known Democrat like Mr. Bradley enhance Mr. Clinton's electoral prospects?  Wouldn't he draw from the  Democratic base vote, and weaken the President?<p>
No.  Mr. Clinton has a firm hold on his party's base vote.  Feminists, liberals, pro-abortionists, welfare recipients, gays, environmentalists, union members, public service employees -- the traditional Democratic coalition -- are still solidly behind the President, who has done as much as he can to deliver for them.  He was elected to office with 43 percent of the vote, and his approval ratings have hovered within a ten point range of that margin throughout his presidency, never dropping much below, even though he never gets too high.<p>
More importantly, any analysis that projects presidential results based on a simple reading of partisan loyalties -- or even ideological loyalties -- misses the point.  When push comes to shove in the polling booth, voters choose not on the basis of party or ideology, but on whether they want to give the incumbent party another four years in power.  Just ask Ken DeCell and Alan Lichtman, whose seminal book THE THIRTEEN KEYS TO THE PRESIDENCY remains the best analysis -- and projection 
model -- for explaining voter behavior in presidential elections.<p>
By their standards, a Perot or Powell candidacy would help Mr. Clinton not because they would split the GOP vote with the Republican candidate, but because they would split the ANTI- INCUMBENT vote with the Republican candidate.  (Interestingly, a close examination of exit polls from 1992 shows that, contrary to much of the Conventional Wisdom, Mr. Perot didn't actually hurt President Bush, he HELPED him, by splitting the anti-incumbent vote then, too; had Mr. Perot not run in 1992, the result would have been NOT a Bush reelection, but a Clinton LANDSLIDE victory.)<p>
Similarly, a Bradley Independent candidacy would provide a second option NOT for those inclined to return to Mr. Clinton to the White House, but to those seeking his removal.  And to the extent he waged a serious campaign and actually won serious votes, he would, necessarily and concomitantly, draw anti-incumbent votes from the anti-incumbent candidate -- e.g., the Republican nominee.<p>
Thus, in the unlikeliest of paradoxes, an Independent bid by a long-time Democrat unsatisfied with his party's presidential leadership would likely have just the opposite of its supposedly intended effect.<p>
Mr. Bradley has been accused of many things in his career, but being stupid isn't one of them.  The day before he announced his potential Independent candidacy, he claims to have called 120 people to tell them of his decision to retire from the Senate, and to discuss future options.  Would someone please send him Mr. DeCell's phone number?<p>

Some of the Nice Republicans think this is because they've got something on the bottom of their shoes, and the others understand the earthquake rumbling beneath their feet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Nice Republicans take their cues from The Washington Post, which they, like a lot of Washington, despise for its deceit and arrogance but nevertheless take their cues from it. Ignoring The Post is as difficult as ignoring the stink of a dead skunk under your bedroom window. It takes a stronger stomach than a lot of people were born with.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>So these Nice Republicans trembled on cue because Mr. Dole rebuked NBC-TV's Katie Couric for her adversarial scolding of Mr. Dole for his not joining the crusade against tobacco.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Instead," reported The Post July 4 on Page One, "the former Kansas senator, who volunteered his doubts about the addictiveness of cigarette smoking during a tour of tobacco-producing Kentucky almost three weeks ago, has continued to wage war with the news media on the issue" (italics mine).<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Wage war with the news media?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Why, you might ask, would the news media -- news media being journalogical jargon for "reporters" -- be waging a war against a candidate for president of the United States in the first place? Don't the "news media" advertise themselves as neutral in these disputes? Odd that you should ask.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Post's description of the parties in the dispute tells you even more about media neutrality: The candidate is "old Dole," who is the "picture of frustration," picking on Miss Couric, "a popular anchorwoman known for her perky image and big smile." <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The description of Miss Couric is accurate enough as far as it goes, and fairly daring for the politically correct Post, because this is the shorthand of aging white guys, their lechery showing, for "the perky boobs, blond hair and empty head that are the requisites for network-news pinups."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But it's not that Mr. Dole, treating Miss Couric with the respect that feminists say they despair of getting from old white guys like Mr. Dole, was picking on a little lady who merely parrots in a silkier voice what she hears the boys say. This is exactly how George Bush gobbled up Dan Rather for breakfast in a famous interview in 1988, which was grudgingly applauded even by the media notabilities who didn't like him, and the only difference between Mr. Rather and Miss Couric is that Katie is prettier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole, too bad for him, challenges a doctrine of media theology. Tobacco is this season's fashionable evil -- like eating steak and potatoes, or going to church. Enlightened people just don't indulge in such morbid things. (Speaking of behavior modification, the real old Dole would challenge President Clinton to scold gays for their addiction to practicing anal sex, the chief conductor of the AIDS virus, which is far deadlier than tobacco smoke.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's enough to make little Richard Cohen bang his rattle against the wall on the op-ed page at The Post: ". . . he went after [Miss] Couric, the Dorothy of our early morning Oz." (Won't someone please send this poor guy a man-size box of Kleenex?)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's evidence, scant but nevertheless just visible, to suggest that Mr. Dole is at last paying occasional attention to his own instincts. Only in Washington can you hear grown-ups question the universally held belief that the media are relentlessly liberal, or suggest that a candidate is out of step for saying what everyone already thinks.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole has been in politics long enough, longer than his armchair skeptics, to understand that neither he nor anyone else will take down Bill Clinton with a campaign designed to please the League of Women Voters. He'll have to fight with the tenacity, energy, guile and shrewdness of Mr. Clinton, who in turn will fight with the artifice, deception and cunning that propelled him from the casino-and-racetrack culture of Hot Springs to the hothouse of Washington and the White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The rap on Mr. Clinton is that he has elevated phoniness to high art. You might not like Bob Dole's indulgence of tobacco smoke, or even his treating a network bimbo with the respect he accords his other media adversaries, but the anger looks authentic. His only hope for November is that authenticity is what America is yearning for. America, not America's media, is the authentic constituency.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

fugitive from justice last seen in Nepal, and Janet Reno has appointed a special prosecutor to
press charges that Socks the Cat has been hunting mice out of season.<BR><DD>But a new poll,
commissioned just in time for the Republican National Convention in San Diego, shows the
president 31 points up on you, and you're only 6 points ahead of Ross Perot.<BR><DD>Ordinarily,
this would curdle the cream in your coffee, but the cream had turned sour weeks earlier. You
decide to drink your coffee black, to match your mood. You sit there, staring at the trees on
Roosevelt Island across the Potomac (which looks particularly bleak), and your mind begins to
examine the possibilities:<BR><DD><I>Hmmmmmmmmm. George McGovern is a nice guy, a good friend,
but do I really want to be remembered as the man who made the Nixon-McGovern blowout look like a
cliff-hanger? And Fritz Mondale -- always liked him. Good man. Wrong on some stuff, not so bad
on other stuff. But do I really want to challenge his mark of winning only a single state? The
numbers from Kansas don't look so hot, either.</I><BR><DD><I>Got to do something. Maybe make
another speech. Start wearing a tie again. Put new pennies in my loafers. Take Katie Couric out
to lunch. Get a new bathing suit. Buy some jokes. Whatever. Nah, it wouldn't last. Been there,
done that. Maybe call Colin Powell one more time. Nah, been there, too. Besides, he's like all
the other generals, waiting for somebody to appoint him president. Got enough of generals in
Italy.</I><BR><DD><I>What if ... Nah, too bold. Better to lose it all in November. Except . . .
Nah, better wait 'til Liddy leaves the room even to think these thoughts. Ah, there she goes ...
What if . . . I call a press conference and announce that I'm stepping aside. Had some chest
pains, back pains. Pains in the neck. Whatever. Gonna throw the convention open. No endorsement.
Not from me. The ultimate act of loyalty and generosity from the ultimate party man. Who else
would be remembered as being so unselfish? Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
of the party. Only I actually will. Let the right-to-lifers and the abortionists slug it out.
See how far Pat Buchanan gets in an open convention. Let's see who's got the uh, nerve, to get
in now. Jack Kemp won't. He's afraid he might run third. Or fourth. Never called fourth-and-one
in his life. I won't play any favorites, but I might get somebody to nominate Colin. We'll see
how the general who couldn't get to Baghdad fares with all those ex-privates and ex-corporals
out there in the convention hall. Whatever.</I><BR><DD>Well, of course it won't happen. Nobody
with a politician's ego would forego the moment of watching himself being nominated for
president of the United States, standing up there waving to a standing ovation big enough to
fill a stadium and loud enough to make a man's mother believe some of them actually mean it. But
it is a thought, and if such wistful musings ever occur to Bob Dole it doesn't take a Hollywood
scriptwriter to imagine what would happen.<BR><DD>The country would be electrified, and here,
finally, is the place to use that cliche. Direct current at 240 volts. The reporters and
commentators would go bonkers, finally getting to cover a nominating convention like they had in
those old black-and-white newsreels. The good, gray Republican Party, where a simple
disagreement over where to go for dinner is considered gauche, finally giving lessons to the
Democrats, who can start a floor fight over a resolution commending Mother Teresa for giving
milk to starving babies, about how to conduct a free-for-all.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama
is proud to cast its votes on the 29th ballot for . . . </I><BR><DD>ABC would pull its camera
crews from Bosnia, CBS would call back reporters from Tel Aviv, CNN would forsake its stakeout
of O.J. The newspapers would double their staffs in San Diego, with finally something to
actually write home about. <BR><DD>The delegates in San Diego would forget all about the beach,
the side trips to Tijuana, the cocktail parties aboard the yachts tied up in the
harbor.<BR><DD>Best of all, the race would be transformed overnight.<BR><DD>By waiting until
August to bequeath his great gift to the party, Bob Dole would guarantee an open convention.
Nobody would have time to raise the money to ruin it in the way that the primaries have ruined
the process, and at last the Republicans could tell little Virginia that yes, Virginia, there
really is a Republican National Convention, and this is how it's supposed to
be.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama is proud to stand fast on the 44th ballot for . .

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>Let's blame the dead for the scary stuff</FONT></center><BR><DD>These guys at the White House are fast learners.<BR>
  George Stephanopoulos sees how Mortuary Bob Woodward gets by with talking to men lying in comas and crediting the most unlikely assertions in his books to sources conveniently dead, so George does it, too.<BR><DD>It wasn't Hillary who hired Craig Livingstone to vacuum raw FBI files to put together dossiers on their Republican enemies, says the president's senior adviser. "It was Vince Foster."<BR><DD>Dead men not only tell no tales, they don't dispute tales, either.<BR><DD>This emboldens Hillary. She was in Romania and Eastern Europe for the Fourth of July holiday (where she didn't have to put up with a lot of tacky flag-waving by men in military uniform parading down the avenue), but she supports Mr. Stephanopoulos in his blaming of Vince Foster, who, though still dead, has his uses yet.<BR><DD>Said she, repeating the White House mantra the nation has heard over and over in Clintonoid answers, some under oath and some not, to all questions about Whitewater: "I don't know anything about it."<BR><DD>She has no idea who hired the hapless Mr. Livingstone: "I know I didn't."<BR><DD>She doesn't like Gary Aldrich's new book, either. "It is a politically inspired fabrication, and I don't think anyone should take it seriously."<BR><DD>But the White House is taking it seriously indeed, mounting a full-scale offensive we hadn't seen since, well, since Bill and Hillary attacked Gennifer Flowers' claims that she had been Mr. Clinton's main squeeze for years and years in Little Rock, when Miss Flowers produced a tape recording of beddy-bye conversation that included Mr. Clinton's suggestion that Mario Cuomo was a Mafia asset. (Mr. Clinton denied saying it, of course, but apologized the next day to Mr. Cuomo for saying what he never said. Of course, it never happened, but he would never do it again.)<BR><DD>Americans soon learned what Arkansans had learned before them, to their considerable sorrow, never to take the first denial as the last word from either Clinton.<BR><DD>Mr. Stephanopoulos, citing widespread coverage of the Aldrich book by newspapers and lecturing David Brinkley on the ethics of journalism, complains that Washington newspapermen and journalists seem willing to believe anything malicious, salacious or promiscuous about his bosses. Journalists, in his view, don't enforce a high-enough credibility threshold.<BR><DD>What he means is that when someone tells the story that the prez sneaks off in the middle of the night to visit a bimbo -- no doubt to discuss Bosnia policy -- almost everyone is likely to believe it. True or not, the most risible rumor has the ring of truth. Sad that may be, but whose fault is that? Nothing but hoots of disbelief would have greeted a story like that about Jimmy Carter. The trouble Mr. Clinton and his men have on occasions like this is that he, like Jimmy Carter, has a track record.<BR><DD>We've all come to recognize the track record. First the denial -- in the case of the Aldrich book, not exactly a categorical denial -- and then the White House smear attacking "the Republican smear." Finally, days or weeks later, the facts dribble out, confirming the original story.<BR><DD>We're near the end of the first stage of this controversy, with Mr. Stephanopoulos attacking not Gary Aldrich, but Bob Dole, of all people, demanding that he disavow the book that has so panicked the White House, but that Mr. Dole has had nothing to do with.<BR><DD>The White House is not really concerned about the reputations of either Clinton. It's too late for that. But if the allegations in the Aldrich book -- like the allegations in the Meredith Oakley book, the Roger Morris book, the James Stewart book, the Bob Tyrrell book to come, take a number -- begin to stick, it's curtains for the Clintons. At some point the wonderfully/woefully tolerant American public will decide that we've had enough of Flem Snopes' grandson and his unblushing parvenue bride.<BR><DD>The White House knows how to read polls, and knows what not to attribute to them. <BR><DD>The Wall Street Journal reported only last week how some Democratic congressional candidates, even in liberal districts, are putting a little distance between themselves and the president.<BR><DD>Says John Tierney, a Democratic candidate in Massachusetts: "I'm campaigning on my own strengths." Says Steve Eastaugh, a Democratic challenger in Maryland: "A person's not worth spit if he doesn't defend his team captain. But I don't defend Clinton." Even the Democratic candidate to succeed Patsy Schroeder in Colorado says, with emphasis, that she's "not a Clinton Democrat."<BR><DD>"They're being prudent," says Charles Cook, a political analyst. "They don't know what's coming next." Too bad for George, but who does?<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>It's 1996, and we're all from Arkansas</FONT></center><BR><DD>What a country. (If the polls are correct.) Most Americans think the president is probably a crook, more than half of them think his wife is the family bag man and a shrew besides, and 62 percent have concluded that the administration they preside over uses the power of the government to intimidate and blackmail private citizens.<BR><DD>And they want four more years of it.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton leads Bob Dole by 17 points, or 20, or 22, or 6. Whatever. Take the poll of your choice. Talk about the Stockholm Syndrome.<BR><DD>This is good news for people who sell newspapers, because the Scandal/Outrage/Screw-up of the Day sells newspapers. It's a shame for the country, but the bigger shame appears to be that the country doesn't any longer give a damn who a president is or what he does. Hot Springs is at last writ large.<BR><DD>A poll taken for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News and released late last week, not only shows Mr. Clinton up by a ton, but 44 percent are down on Hillary, 62 percent think she's lying about past deeds of graft and greed, 35 percent say they believe the president helped himself to public money to cover his Whitewater investment, and 68 percent say they believe the Clinton White House is using the FBI, illegally, to bullyrag opponents.<BR><DD>New revelations litter the landscape, if not yet the public consciousness. The books pour out a profusion of perversion, greed, incompetence and criminal bumbling. The Clinton crowd is exposed as a collision of clowns or crooks, and probably both. It's not the comedy, stupid, it's the stupidity.<BR><DD>We've become such a nation of soap-opera addicts, having mainlined Oprah and Phil Donahue and their cretinous compatriots for so long that we no longer aspire to be "the good nation" that Alexis de Tocqueville found here almost 200 years ago, when he observed that America was great because it was good and predicted that America would cease to be great when it ceased to be good.<BR><DD>We live in the New Age now, and happy is as happy does. A new book out this week, "Unlimited Access," by Gary Aldrich, an FBI agent assigned to the White House, details how the president assuages his melancholy memories of Gennifer, Sally, Paula, Kay and the other ladies of the wee hours he left behind in Little Rock. Mr. Aldrich describes how the prez leaps into the back seat of Bruce Lindsey's car, pulls a blanket over his head and doesn't come out until they're safely in a tunnel beneath the JW Marriott Hotel, just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. He takes an elevator to a suite upstairs, where the late evening's yum-yum awaits. This would be the hour for the bad guys to unleash missiles, since nobody knows where he is for hours and hours. Hillary is safe in the arms of the Sandman.<BR><DD>This beats the arrangements in Little Rock, where he was reduced to using the front seat of a car on the deserted grounds of his daughter's school or the back seat of his limo on a side street at the foot of Main. But let's be fair. Bill Clinton is not the first president to slip around with the satin smoothness of the son of a preacher man. Warren Harding made a love nest of a closet off the Oval Office. Grover Cleveland made out like Bill Clinton before he got to Washington, leaving a love child in his wake, and JFK partook often of the consolations of forbidden feminine charms and, in a fit of populist bonhomie, even shared his treats with a Mafia don.<BR><DD>FDR had a squeeze, too, but his was a vice that paid the homage of hypocrisy to virtue, and nobody knew for sure for years afterward. This was in part due to diligence and careful competence, and in part the work of media that protect Democrats to conserve energies to ravage Republicans. Bob Packwood was hounded from office for kissing women in elevators, but when Bill Clinton was caught at dropping his drawers and demanding curb service it was his accuser who was held up to public ridicule. "I'm not interested in Bill Clinton's sex life," said Johnny Apple of the New York Times in a widely quoted (and widely copied) dismissal of the larger part of Bill Clinton's life and career.<BR><DD>Some people say that this merely reflects selective distaste, but Mr. Apple is not the only man in town who finds sex a vice unfit for the consideration of gentlemen. But polls indicate that a mean average of 61.3 percent of the rest have concluded that vice is nice at twice the price, and Bill Clinton is our man.<BR><DD>Robbing banks in Arkansas is old stuff, and doesn't count. Covering it up in Washington is what anybody would have done. Using the FBI to compile dossiers on "enemies" is sort of shoddy, but Republicans deserve it. Billy Dale might have been Everyman, but thinking about it can make a man's teeth itch.<BR><DD>Too bad for Bob Dole, but that's the way the cookie -- whoever she may be -- crumbles. We're all from Arkansas now.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<IMG SRC="/wash_times/pruden.gif"><BR><font size=7>A familiar odor from<BR>
the summer of '73</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton is not a crook. We have Chris Dodd's word on it.<BR>
  And the word of Paul Sarbanes, Mary McGrory, Richard Cohen, Jim Hoagland, Tom Lantos and maybe Norman Ornstein. And Mark Fabiani's and Mike McCurry's.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Democratic defensive line -- the politicians, academics and journalists who work hard to make our lives happy and productive, if only we would listen to them -- assures us that despite all the evidence that the ganglion of criminal scandal called Whitewater may look like a duck, walk like a duck and even quack like a duck, it's really a turkey.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing upsets these refined worthies more than for someone to remark on the obvious, that the Clinton White House smells like the Nixon White House, that the flavor of the Clintonoid excuses, rationalizations and tortured justifications is remarkably similar to the taste of stale Nixonian leftovers, and that Pennsylvania Avenue reeks of the aroma that old-timers remember from the summer of '73.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"On my scorecard," writes Jim Hoagland in The Washington Post, "the president has endured a couple of bad but far from fatal weeks as the Senate Whitewater committee rolled out its final, conflicting reports, old associates in Arkansas were convicted in crooked land deals and House hearings revealed the White House's improper possession of more than 400 FBI investigative files. All that hurts, but there was no smoking gun: The Clintons were not personally and conclusively linked to major scandal."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Say what? Mr. Hoagland, a genial fellow who has heretofore successfully disguised himself as a wise-policy wonk and good-government groupie, thus reduces the Clinton White House "enemies list," to which he insists the Clintons are not "conclusively linked" even though it happened in their house, from outrage to merely a matter of "impropriety." We didn't hear this kind of excuse for Chuck Colson, who went to prison for the possession of a single FBI file.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mary McGrory, still waiting for JFK to float out of his grave at Arlington to rescue Camelot, mocks the Republicans on the Whitewater committee as witch-hunters: "They put a pointed hat on Hillary Clinton ... and they all but called her ... the wicked witch of the White House. But that doesn't make it Watergate. She isn't the president." Evita Peron wasn't the president of Argentina, either, but she did a good imitation of the maximum leader. (Don't cry for me, Arkansas.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Tom Lantos, the congressman from California, turned livid the other day when someone on Bill Clinger's committee, investigating Hillary's beheading of Billy Dale, remarked on the perfectly obvious, that the Clintons, who matured, sort of, in the Watergate years, learned nothing from that experience, except how to do it better.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Paul Sarbanes, who hectored the Nixon men without mercy for crimes less outrageous than those for which the Clinton men -- and women -- have implicated themselves and each other, finds the Clintons guiltless of doing anything wrong in Washington and even perfectly innocent of anything shady in Arkansas. (Ain't nobody here but us chickens.) Richard Cohen, the conscience of The Washington Post, assures us that he took time out from his bizarre feud with blacks to personally investigate the FBI files scandal and found nothing to worry about. (So there.) The good gray Norman Ornstein, also writing in The Post, says what went wrong at the White House was a bureaucratic snafu after all: The Clintons cut the size of the White House staff, and shouldn't have, because what they (and we) actually need in Washington are more bureaucrats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For their part, the Clintons keep sending poor Mark Fabiani out to tell the reporters artless fibs, stretchers, fables, myths and yarns every time another scandal rocks the house. The president has put him in the position of the man who, caught by his wife between the sheets with her best friend, tells his wife: "I guess you'll try to make something out of this."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Fabiani will be on call over the next few weeks as the second Whitewater trial proceeds in Little Rock, where two bankers are on trial for robbing their bank in behalf of Bill Clinton when he needed the last few sacks of cash to sew up his gubernatorial election in 1990.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's fingerprints, so far as we know, were not on the deal. David Hale, his earlier banker angel, says Mr. Clinton was always insistent that his hands never touch the deals he designed.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton, up 20 points in the polls and looking at disgrace and ruin, is his daddy's salesman son, still trying to sell the notion that nobody but David Hale, a convicted felon, has accused him of anything illegal. But one by one the president's men are becoming convicted felons.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sort of reminds people with long memories of Richard Nixon.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<p><font size=7>Trying to beat nothing<BR>
with not very much</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole poses an interesting question for America in 1996: Can a man with no strength of his convictions beat a man with the strength of no convictions?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole seems determined to campaign on a platform that can be boiled down to a forgettable bumper sticker: "Vote Republican: We're Not as Bad as You Think We Are."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton's message, no less succinct, is the mirror image of the Republican slogan: "Vote Democratic: You're Right, We Bad -- And You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This sets up an interesting Hobson's choice, with each alternative worse than the other, and the answer may tell us not only who the president will be, but a lot about who we are as a people. Bill Clinton and his campaign-year alter ego, Dickie Morris, understand that almost everybody mistrusts Mr. Clinton, many regarding him as a liar like his wife and a fraud like no other, but an amiable fraud nonetheless and a likable liar besides. Not only that, he's famous. Mr. Clinton and his guru believe that since America now keeps pace with fiction, liars rule.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is a man of character and principle, even if he gives the impression that he doesn't understand what that means, exactly. In any event, he gives the impression that he's not really serious about wanting to be president. He seems to think the presidency is something like being a senator, only bigger, if not necessarily better. He believes in things, but not too much, which is good, but he's not as famous as Bill Clinton, which is not so good.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The poor guy has been so long in the Senate, where cutting deals is the mark of leadership, that when he closes a sale now, he can't shut up. He had the abortion question squared and boxed, safely on the shelf, with all the Christian "extremists" willing to put their suspicions aside, and then somebody or something persuaded him that Colin Powell and John Warner and Christie Whitman and the pro-choice wing of the party deserved a little lagniappe. Having flaunted his tolerance in the face of the conservatives, he shoved it down their throats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>He expects to bask in the applause of the liberals and Democrats whose approval such Republicans not-so-secretly covet. We'll see how long he has to wait for that. Within minutes after his tribute to the successes of 1970s liberalism in his farewell address to the Senate, all but ignoring the legacy of Ronald Reagan in his rush to shower accolades on the Democrats who thwarted the Gipper's revolution, the Democratic National Committee in return faxed a bulletin to political writers listing 10 bad things Mr. Dole had done as a senator. (Note to Colin Powell: They're ready for you.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Given the givens, selling himself as the lesser evil is not necessarily a hopeless strategy. Despite the piously naive cliches of the political-science professors, the pundits and the good-government groupies, most people vote against, not for. Bill Clinton has disillusioned a lot of his 43 percent of '92, but if he has persuaded many in the 57 percent who voted against him in '92 that he's better than they thought he was, it's difficult to find them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No one understands this better than Mr. Clinton and Dickie Morris. That's why Mr. Clinton is running this year as a conservative Republican. He'll steal every issue Bob Dole lets him steal, understanding that he can't fool all the people all the time, but with a little Clinton luck maybe he can fool enough.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What terrifies the president and the man behind the curtain is the sure and certain knowledge that, despite everything the media elites can do to persuade everyone otherwise, Americans are growing more, not less, conservative. A poll taken last month for USA Today demonstrates that 83 percent of Americans favor a balanced budget, 83 percent want to prohibit racial preferences (i.e., scrap affirmative action), 82 percent want to make English the official language, 80 percent want life sentences imposed on drug dealers, 74 percent want term limits, 73 percent want prayer in the schools, 73 percent oppose legalization of marijuana, 71 percent want to cut off welfare to deadbeats, 71 percent want to reduce the number of government agencies, 67 percent oppose same-sex "marriage," and 57 percent oppose partial-birth abortions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Exact or not, such percentages tell Mr. Clinton -- and almost any other politician who can stay awake through the second cup of coffee -- who the real extremists are, and that there's no percentage in diluting a conservative message.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That's why he intends to run to the right of Bob Dole if the Republican nominee lets him. Mr. Dole and his compassioneers, full of moderation and meekness, may persuade a few people that he's not as bad as they think he is, but he'll never get anyone to throw his hat in the air with a message like that. An army marches on its stomach, and you can't win a war on milk and toast.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>The limited hangout at the White House</FONT></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing makes Bill Clinton and Miss Hillary and their friends jump quite like barking the words "Nixon" and "Watergate" at them, in the manner of thrusting a cross in the face of Count Dracula.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Like the count, they quail.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>You can almost see the beads of perspiration breaking out in the hollow of Miss Hillary's pretty throat, and the president reddens like a schoolboy caught with a hot book hidden between the covers of his geography text.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's no sign yet of the ghost of Richard Nixon, but he can't be pleased by the comparison, either. Fortunately, it's difficult to libel the dead.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first lady, who worked as a staff lawyer for the congressional committees working to bring down Mr. Nixon an eon ago, is a quick study and she learned a lot. Her mistake, as it may turn out, is that she thought she could make the Nixon strategy work in her husband's White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Nixon's men came up with what they called "the modified limited hangout," the paying out of as few of the sordid details of the Watergate scandal as possible in hopes that the press would go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's men are similarly paying out the sordid details of the Whitewater collection of scandals -- any one of which might be worse than the third-rate burglary of the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Office Building on Virginia Avenue NW -- in the hopes that the press, with an attention span shorter than you could find in any kindergarten class, will get bored and go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The modified limited hangout is not working any better for the Clintons than it did for Mr. Nixon, for whom ultimately it did not work at all. Pity the poor spokesmen at the White House. Not only are they asked to tell fibs, distortions and stretchers to the reporters, some of whom are finally getting it, but the fibs, distortions and stretchers change every hour on the hour.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Late last week, Mr. Clinton's hapless excuses men came up with the third and fourth explanations of why the president's lawyer (and we can assume that a smart Yale lawyer like Bill Clinton knew about it all the time) tried to get the confidential FBI files on Billy Dale, covering 30 years of his life, seven months after the first lady ordered him fired as director of the White House travel office.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Rep. William Clinger of Pennsylvania suggests that Bernard Nussbaum, who was the president's lawyer, sought the FBI documents because even then the White House was concocting a smear job on Mr. Dale. Naturally, Mr. Nussbaum couldn't remember sending the request to the FBI. Nobody in this White House ever remembers anything. This is the first White House in history to make Alzheimer's disease, with its consequent loss of memory, a helpful qualification for employment.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Then someone at the White House had another bright idea. Maybe someone could say that Mr. Dale was being considered for another White House position, and they needed the background checks to make sure they knew who he was. He had only worked for the U.S. government for three decades. This was an excuse first tried at the Nixon White House when, in a celebrated fiasco, it got caught putting together a dossier on a prominent Washington reporter and then insisted that he was being considered for an important job in the administration.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But wait! The FBI dossier was not asked for by Bernie Nussbaum, who as everybody knows would never pull a dirty trick, but by the General Accounting Office. Drat! Then the GAO said no, it had never asked for nor looked at FBI files on Mr. Dale.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Back to the drawing board once more: The White House said it asked the FBI for the files by "accident" when it routinely sought background reports on all White House employees. Bernie, George, Bruce, Patsy, Harold, Maggie, maybe even Hillary. Not just Billy and the boys, but everyone in the Goodtime Gang.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was too much for Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI. He certainly doesn't want to do a Patrick Gray imitation, and be left twisting slowly, slowly in the wind. He ordered a full investigation of the White House request for the FBI dossier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"He certainly doesn't want the bureau mixed up in this stuff," says an official at FBI headquarters. "He has moved to make sure that the public's perception is that there's not some cozy relationship between the White House and bureau executives."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This is surely a puzzlement to the president, accustomed to using the State Police for all manner of conveniences when he was the governor of Arkansas. Puzzling to the first lady as well, who thought she had learned from the errors of the Nixon White House and imagined that the failure was not in conception, but in execution.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

Learning lessons,<BR>all of them wrong
</FONT></center>

<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>When Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as the president of the
Confederacy on the steps of the Capitol in Montgomery, he and the occasion were
acclaimed as the time and place where "the man and the hour have met."<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We may be on the scene of
another occasion when the planets align themselves with reckless abandon and
God throws down the stars in a fit of divine disgust. Bill Clinton, the man, and
the nation, in an hour of disarray, have met.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Disaster followed Davis, and disaster is no doubt
stalking us, too. Billy Graham said it best the other day when he came to
Washington to receive the Medal of Freedom: "... the greatest nation in history
stands on the brink of self-destruction."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The signs of unraveling are certainly all about. The chief of
the Navy, having presided over the emasculation of the greatest sea service in
the history of man (presuming Atlantis had nothing better), shoots himself in the
chest, which almost anyone's elderly aunts, armed with their modest knowledge
of firearms, could have told him was not the way to do it. He was afraid someone
might think he was wearing his medals crooked.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was the most dramatic Washington suicide
since James Forrestal, the secretary of defense, leaped from a window at the top
of Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1947, pursued by the vicious demons and fierce
worms known only to himself, haunted by fears of the red menace when it was
not fashionable to be so haunted. It's already the second major suicide of the
Clinton administration, and as the going gets tougher, the curveballs breaking
ever more sharply across the plate, all the president's men must stand resolute
against despair.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>Like Vince Foster, Mike Boorda was by all accounts a man of splendid
character and moral stature, but, like Mr. Foster, he was over his head in the pool
of ego and ambition that the capital is and has been since the days when someone
was forever trying to set fire to George Washington's wooden teeth.<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What other explanation can
there be for the suicide of a warrior who is expected to dispatch 19-year-old
boys -- and pregnant 19-year-old girls, to make the most shameful point -- to
court a briny death on the stormy sea but who so quails at the prospect of talking
to a reporter that he takes the weak man's out?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's difficult to imagine that an old salt as
experienced as Mike Boorda would have killed himself over the misuse of his
medals, as dear as such decorations are to the men who understand the sacrifice
required to win them. It's not so difficult to understand why Washington, with its
unerring instinct for getting it wrong, took a crash course last week in how many
pins can dance on a campaign ribbon.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Boorda, though skillful enough at playing the
bureaucratic game to make it to the top of the sea service, might have understood
that at the end he had let down his beloved Navy by betraying it into the hands of
snotty Clintonoids who think that no opportunity must be missed to emasculate
the military the commander in chief has said he "loathes."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The admiral conceded months before his
death that he reckoned that he had let down the Navy by caving in to the
pressures brought by the neurotic feminists inside and outside the Congress, and
the frightened senators (some of them Republicans) leaping to chairs, pulling up
their pants' legs to cry "eeeek!" when Pat Schroeder walks into the room, who
demanded the head of Adm. Stanley Arthur when he was nominated to be the
commander of the Pacific Command.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Arthur, a 500-mission hero of the Vietnam War
(enough already to condemn him to scorn and ridicule), was accused of reaching
an incorrect judgment when a female pilot filed a sexual-harassment claim
against her flight instructors. Upon investigation, Adm. Arthur ruled the claim
without substantial merit. The poor woman should count her lack of blessings;
she might have been assigned to the USS Acadia, "the Love Boat," which returned
from the Persian Gulf War with 10 percent of her crew in a family way, more in
need of diapers and bassinets than armor and bullets.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The promotion was held up by a single
senator, the self-righteously strange David Durenberger of Minnesota. "I should
have fought this to the end," Adm. Boorda conceded to the Navy Times. "I helped
screw it up, and I don't feel good about it."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That made everything A-OK, of course. "Feeling
good" is what life in Bill Clinton's America is all about. But not to everyone. Jim
Webb, another authentic hero of Vietnam who was Ronald Reagan's secretary of
the Navy, demanded of the weak John Dalton, the Clintonoid secretary of the Navy,
and of Mike Boorda: "Where was the outrage?"<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But outrage is not appropriate in a Navy fit for a
lady, and a ladies' Navy is what we've got.

No cheap sentiment<BR>for his generation
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Gentlemen (and ladies): Start your spinning.

<BR><DD> This is the Bob Dole nobody expected to see, lean and tough and poignant without the cheap sentiment, and from the White House to the newsrooms of the elites (and some who only dream of being among the elites), the favorite adjective was &quot;desperate.&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;The irony of Dole's decision ... is that one of the pivots of Dole's campaign was in fact an admission of his defeat&quot; (from the Boston Globe). The announcement &quot;is a drastic bid to unyoke himself from an unpopular Republican Congress ...&quot; (from the San Jose Mercury News). &quot;A bold maneuver, full of potential perils - not the least the possibility that an electorate weary of tactics and stratagems would see his resignation from the Senate as just another gimmick ...&quot; (from the New York Times).

<BR><DD>Some of the punditry was born of the amnesia that strikes nearly everyone who has lived in Washington long enough to get a telephone. Says Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster: &quot;Dole will live to rue the day. ... It's too tactical. You're denying your career. It's like going back to Russell and announcing you're moving to New York.&quot;

<BR><DD>Kevin Phillips, the Democrats' favorite Republican analyst, agreed: &quot;I don't think this puts a whole lot of electricity in his socket. He can go out and give speeches, but the speeches he gave before were no good.&quot; Concurred Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, echoing the favorite spinsters' word of the day: &quot;It sounds like a strategy that's a good deal more desperate than the situation demands now.&quot;

<BR><DD>There's no doubting that Mr. Dole was in tough shape - dire straits, a panic, up a creek without the paddle, almost any of the cliches the pundits rush to employ. But the speech, one of the most memorable campaign speeches since Ronald Reagan's famous speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, does not strike the ears of Middle America as a gimmick, a stratagem or even a tactic. (Most people forgive politicians their tactics, even when they shoot trespassers.)

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole sounded at last like a man who knew what he was doing, who was saying what he thinks because he was speaking from the heart. His careful, precise allusion to his heroic service in World War II struck just the right grace note. There is life after all beyond a company job in the ultimate company town: &quot;I will be the same man I was when I walked into the room, the same man I was yesterday and the day before, and a long time ago when I arose from my hospital bed and was permitted by the grace of God to walk again in the world. And I trust in the hard way, for little has come to me except in the hard way, which is good because we have a hard task ahead of us.&quot;

<BR><DD>He does, indeed. But when he speaks his mind from his heart, it rings as true as the sound of distant battle. Speaking this way now, after so many months of avoiding all sentiment because he was afraid it would sound like cheap sentiment, makes it all the more believable. If hardly anyone can imagine authentic sincerity from Bill Clinton, who will say everything about anything to anybody, hardly anyone doubts that the tears and the choked sobs were real. Nobody, said Steve Forbes after watching the remarkable ceremony on television, can pucker a lip like Bill Clinton, and only the most foolish of fools would try.

<BR><DD>The most heartfelt part of the Dole farewell was the hardest for Washington to credit: &quot;My campaign for the president is not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real. My campaign is about telling the truth, it's about doing what is right, it's about electing a president who's not attracted to the glories of the office, but rather its difficulties.&quot;

<BR><DD>Lincoln's famous observation about not being able to fool all the people all the time will get its test this year. Bill Clinton has a lot of things going for him - youth, vigor, the gift of gab unencumbered by steadfast principle or heartfelt conviction - and the greatest of all is his confident reliance on the cheerful willingness of the public to cut a little slack to a roguish shill.

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole is embarked on a mission to see how many adults are left in America. He has said that he thinks a man of his generation, arguably the bravest and most dependable since the nation sent two mighty armies to battle against each other and there was enough left over to tame a frontier and build a constellation of gleaming cities, has enough left over this time for one final mission.

<BR><DD>Like Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conquistador who burned his boats on the beaches of Mexico 400 years ago to impress upon his crewmen that they were in the New World to stand or die, the Republican candidate for president is gambling that America has had enough of the children's hour.

Somewhere there's a<BR>hero from Kansas
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Now that someone from Kansas has to stand up to the wizard behind the curtain, where's Dorothy?

<BR><DD>The wizard, without even popping a sweat, has sent the Republicans into a tailspin a lot like the crash of George Bush in 1992, when his eye-popping poll numbers fell from 92 percent in the wake of the war in the Gulf to 38 percent in the ruins of November.

<BR><DD>One loud &quot;boo!&quot; from the nation's most famous draft dodger and the entire regiment of Republicans, who only yesterday imagined they should be posing for recruiting posters, went flying for cover, crawling up under the nearest front porch to hide with the dogs. Bill Clinton, who's never met a woman he didn't run after or a man he didn't run from, was the most astonished pol in town.

<BR><DD>When the president found someone to throw the first punch at Newt Gingrich, he never imagined that nobody would strike back. When he found someone to throw the second punch, he never imagined that the Republicans themselves would join in piling on.

<BR><DD>The campaign to demonize the speaker was simple and brutish: Throw out lies and distortions and scream even louder when the Republicans fire back. The lies got louder, but the Republicans never fired back.

<BR><DD>The speaker's aims were not radical, unless most of us are radical: Cut down the size of government, shrink the budget on which big government feeds, crack down on criminals, throttle welfare cheaters, strengthen the military, roll back the regulatory bureaucracy, cut the throat of the trial-lawyer lobby before everyone but the lawyers are bankrupt, limit the terms of congressmen so they can return home to productive jobs, take the necessary steps to preserve the medical-care safety net - and cut taxes. Some radicalism.

<BR><DD>So radical, in fact, that President Clinton adopted most of these goals himself, beginning with his assertion that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; None of his own troops, liberals all, believe he really means it. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose contempt for the organizer of Vietnam anti-war rallies is obvious, calls him &quot;an unusually good liar,&quot; and in this case the president's big-government allies feel reassured.

<BR><DD>Some of the speaker's erstwhile allies, in the bravura of the morning after the November '94 blowout, likened their mighty victory to the D-Day landings at Normandy. The analogy, for a bunch of guys who mostly spent the Vietnam war at the Student Union, sounded a little far-fetched to some aging ears, but if some of these warriors had been barreling across France in the summer of '44 they would have braked cold on hearing Axis Sally's first diatribe against that ol' meanie Georgie Patton, and looked for a barn to hide in. Second Lt. Al D'Amato would have wanted the Germans to understand that he never really liked that Patton fella, anyway.

<BR><DD>Who can be surprised that the clouds of pink and baby blue floating over the White House are made of gauze and giddiness? Bill Clinton hasn't had a stroke of luck like the Republican collapse since Monroe Schwarzlose, a turkey farmer so obscure that even Mrs. Schwarzlose wasn't sure who he was, turned up as his only serious opponent in a Democratic gubernatorial primary back home. (Mr. Clinton won, but not by much.)

<BR><DD>The moral is that the Republicans can make a race of it in '96, too, if they can figure out which end of the gun you shoot with, and how to tell a foot from foe.

<BR><DD>For weeks everyone in Washington was trying to figure out whether Bob Dole was asleep, or merely dead, and now they're trying to figure out whether Al D'Amato is the hit man from Cleveland, dispatched by Mr. Dole, or whether he's just a slap-happy, showing off.

<BR><DD>What the Republicans seem to have lost sight of - and Bill Clinton hasn't - is that the conservative tide is still running, and gaining momentum. The great risk to Republican fortunes is that the voters will conclude that the Grand Old Partypoopers never had the convictions they seemed to have the courage of only a few months ago. Bill Clinton has no convictions, either, but he knows better than anyone else how to fake it.

<BR><DD>Mike McCurry, his press agent, remarked May 6 that the pendulum measuring the Clinton fortunes is groaning against the rope, close to reaching its apogee. Soon everything that has been breaking in the president's favor may begin breaking the other way.

<BR><DD>But maybe not. Iron laws govern politics, but not the iron laws of physics. The Republicans think they've got the character issue cold, and maybe they do, but in a street fight and a presidential campaign raw courage can count for more than character.

<BR><DD>The wizard, trembling behind the curtain, understood that. So did a little girl from Kansas.

The stern rebuke of<BR>a Sunday-school boy
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>To everything a season, to quote the forbidden texts, and that includes even politics. If you wait long enough, the wheel comes 'round.

<BR><DD>Only nine presidential campaigns ago, the elites of media and academe were aghast at the redneck notion, propagated by the lesser fundamentalist tribes, that the pope and his Roman legions would impose the morality of a foreign church on America if Americans were foolish enough to elect John F. Kennedy.

<BR><DD>Voting for the Catholic candidate thus became something close to a civic duty for the enlightened American. The enlightened elites of course never imagined that anyone as smart and as attractive as a Kennedy actually believed any of that religious stuff, just as the enlightened elites never imagined that Martin Luther King and his fellow clergymen in the civil-rights movement were men of actual faith. In 1965, when I asked to interview Dr. King and said that I wanted to talk about faith as well as politics, he invited me to lunch in New York. &quot;I thought no one would ever ask,&quot; he told me, and a promised 30 minutes stretched into the mellow gloaming of late afternoon, long past the ham sandwiches at his desk, and we talked about how faith in Christ must guide every step in a believer's life.

<BR><DD>Ah, but now the enlightened elites are not so sure.

<BR><DD>Just when they thought the streets - or at least the power positions in the culture - were safe for atheists and pagans, witches and wizards and assorted lesser geeks, along comes something barbaric and grotesque like President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. Suddenly the priests and preachers and rabbis think they have something to say that the rest of us ought to hear.

<BR><DD>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a Catholic and a Republican who usually supports secular Democratic positions (and whose efforts at raising well-behaved children have been mixed), was one of the first to tell Pope John Paul II to butt out of the moral argument. &quot;Such direct involvement in politics is not a good idea, because I think it confuses people.&quot;

<BR><DD>This is an odd view, that politicians and not priests should declaim on moral issues, and that when priests want to say something about moral issues they should be careful not to offend the politicians.

<BR><DD>The partial-birth abortion procedure is certainly a moral issue, though the Ministry of Euphemy has already decreed that it must be called &quot;intact dilation and evacuation,&quot; or &quot;late-term abortion,&quot; which is somewhat like calling the District of Columbia &quot;an interesting experiment in local government.&quot; But you may have noticed that the media have already taken the cue.

<BR><DD>This particular abortion, on a whole baby in the act of being born, is so gruesome, so cruel, so like something from the Manual of Procedure at Auschwitz, that the vicars of the Catholic Church, beginning with the vicar of Rome, have suspended their usual reticence at involving themselves in American electoral politics to tell Bill Clinton that he blundered in behalf of the forces of darkness.

<BR><DD>Cardinal John O'Connor of New York departed from his sermon during Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral to rebuke those who, like His Honor the mayor, denounced the pope for sticking his nose in what the mayor insists is only the business of politicians.

<BR><DD>Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, appearing on the David Brinkley program, repeated for television what he had said earlier, that if a public official finds an irresolvable conflict between his conscience - the president has said that he personally finds this abortion procedure repugnant - and public service he should resign.

<BR><DD>&quot;I think that's rather straightforward,&quot; the cardinal said. &quot;It means what it says. I believe that an individual has an obligation to follow his or her own conscience, and I don't think any of us would want to be served by persons who don't do that.&quot;

<BR><DD>Well, of course no one could imagine that he had Bill Clinton in mind as a man conflicted by demands of duty and conscience, but it is curious that a pol as attuned to the political uses of public worship could have made such a miscalculation. Bill Clinton, after all, is the man who, after losing his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas, suddenly joined the largest Baptist church in Arkansas, which telecasts its Sunday morning services, and joined the choir on the assurance that he could sing from a position at the preacher's right hand, in full view of the camera at all times.

<BR><DD>Some cynical people have noted that now, since it has become clear that Baptists and other evangelicals aren't likely to do doodly-squat for him in November, he has abandoned his church for Hillary's Methodist congregation, one of the most liberal in town. This is, of course, merely another of those Arkansas coincidences.

<title>Rockwell: Bad Law Bites Back -- 12/3/96</title>

<h2>Bad Law Bites Back  </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
The &quot;Contract with America,&quot; reflexively denounced
by leftliberals, was never as good as its bad reputation. It posed
as big government's tormentor, but on close analysis proved to
be more gimmick than gauntlet. It even included some planks that
increased the power of the central state.
<P>
One item in particular did positive harm. This was the Congressional
Accountability Act, passed in the first days of the last &quot;revolutionary&quot;
Congress. Its point was to apply the government's health and labor
laws to Congress, thereby ending its previous, and presumably
hypocritical, exemption. Hardly anyone stopped to ask: was there
a reason for exempting Congress in the first place? 
<P>
Congress is beginning to find out. If labor laws apply to
Congress, its employees can use the courts to demand quotas, form
unions, threaten strikes, and generally cause trouble. And who
enforces all these laws? Bureaucrats in the executive branch.
That gives the Clinton administrationor whoever happens to be
in chargedirect control of Congressional offices.  
<P>
In the American constitutional tradition, Congress is <I>supposed</I>
to be exempt from any laws enforced by the executive. Remember
the doctrine of the separation of powers that used to be taught
in highschool civics? Congress supervises the executive, not the
reverse. Any other system invites abuse of power, corruption,
and intimidation of the elected officials closest to the people.
<P>
Let's say some lawmaker wants to cut the budget of the Labor
Department, and has a good chance of succeeding. Well, maybe the
Secretary of Labor might get interested in whether this lawmaker
is obeying all the laws on overtime pay or racial nondiscrimination.
Just the accusation would cause harm.  
<P>
To avoid that kind of intimidation, lawmakers might decide
they have better things to do than attack the agencies with new
legal power over them. That takes the heat off the home of big
governmentthe executiveand puts it on the Congress, the branch
charged with overseeing the spending of our tax dollars. 
<P>
The proponents of the Accountability Act argued that if Congress
is going to impose lawslike racial quotas or the minimum wageon
the private sector, the least it can do is obey these laws themselves.

<P>
For starters, not all legislators vote for every law. Why
should a majority of lawmakers be able to impose laws, enforced
by the president, on a minority of lawmakers? Even if a law passes
unanimously in one Congress, why should a future Congress be bound
by it? Congressmen should have sovereign immunity from all these
laws, even when they are passed by the Congress itself. 
<P>
A case now before Congress illustrates the point. Members
of the U.S. Capitol Police, a Congressional institution, want
to form a union, an action made possible only by the police applying
the executivedepartment labor code to themselves. In response,
the Republicans have done the right thing: sued to prevent it
from happening.
<P>
As the Republicans arguethough not for the recordunionization
introduces all sorts of complications. Unionized cops can, for
example, engage in work slowdowns and expel conservative, antiunion
police. Moreover, unions are heavily political organizations,
backing Democrats in all national elections.
<P>
If this suit succeedsand it probably will notit would gut
the Congressional Accountability Act, which would be great. But
by attempting to prevent unionization, the 105th Congress puts
itself in the ironic position of trying to repeal one of the most
heralded, if wrongheaded, achievements of the 104th.
<P>
When imposed against private companies, U.S. health, safety,
and labor laws cost hundreds of billions in lost productivity
every year. They are a major source of the secular decline in
American business vibrancy. Why did Congress, which should be
trying to repeal these laws, instead expand them?
<P>
When confronted with this point, some people argue that the
real purpose is to make Congressmen &quot;feel&quot; the laws
they have imposed on the American people and thereby encourage
them to work towards cutting red tape. But this too is a flight
of fancy. The authors of the Contract believe in these laws for
the private sector, and meanwhile, good lawmakers face witch-hunts
by the regime they are supposed to be battling. 
<P>
 Congress is right in suing to stop a police union. But it
should also admit it made a mistake in imposing this law on itself,
repeal the darn thing, and then repeal the oppressive regulations
that make life a living heck for American business.
<P>

<title>December 2, 1996--Murder by Air Bag</title>

<h2>Murder by Air Bag</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR>
Can we trust government to regulate business? For an answer, take
a look at the great airbag fiasco. Five years ago, the government
mandated that air bags be installed in cars. In an instance of
death by government, these bags kill people involved in fender
benders. 
<P>
Turns out, the car makers were right about the dangers all along.
But they were browbeaten and overruled by the usual cabal of anticapitalist
militants, Congressional liberals, and regulatory bureaucrats.
Let's review the history. 
<P>
Ralph Nader and his political network never stopped trying to
replicate the successful smear of the Corvair, as found in his
famous fairy tale, <I>Unsafe at Any Speed</I>. In the seventies,
they dreamed up a new way to attack the car industry, by now vulnerable
to media assaults. 
<P>
Here's what Nader and the gang came up with. Hear ye, hear ye:
there's a technology that would massively cut automobile deaths.
It is a pillow that pops out of the steering wheel in an collision.
Yes, it's even better than the seatbelt.
<P>
So why aren't these magic pillows available on cars? Why, indeed,
aren't they mandatory? In a word: Greed, said Nader and Co. The
car makers could be spending money to save your life. Instead
they are lining their pockets with profits from unsafe vehicles.
<P>
Thus did the air bag become the leftwing craze of the Carter years.
Typically, the product and the mythology surrounding it embodied
socialist paranoia. In this view, the capitalist is secretly killing
the consumer while the average man is too stupid to know about
it, which is why we need the government to intervene.  
<P>
But if air bags were a valuable product worth the expense, car
companies would have installed them while Nader was in law school,
if only to gain an advantage over the competition. 
<P>
None of the Naderite nonsense was convincing to people who knew
something about markets. But the media laughed at company warnings:
that, first, air bags were not cost efficient (yes, you can put
a price tag on safety; we could all drive around in tanks, after
all). Second, air bags would make people think they could get
by without a seatbelt, thus increasing injury. 
<P>
Third, that air bags are not soft and fluffy at all, but can hit
your forehead like a 200 mph brick wall. You might have all your
limbs after a crash, but you might also be dead. The companies
warned that children and small women were particularly at risk.
<P>
But the crash dummies favored by the consumer groups didn't test
for this factor, and, anyway, the well had been poisoned. The
media dismissed company complaints as more evidence of the capitalist
conspiracy to make people drive dangerous cars.
<P>
The government prevailed against the car companies, and the airbag
mandate went into effect. Everyone cheered Ralph and booed Detroit.
But the bags added billions to the cost of cars, led Americans
to drive more recklessly, and directly killed some fifty people
in just the last three years, including the infant who was decapitated
by an air bag in Idaho.
<P>
Haven't they also saved 1,500 lives? That's the claim, but there's
no way to know. It's easy for the airbag lobby to play fast and
loose with these hypotheticals.
<P>
Plus, it's one thing to have a loved one die in a tragic traffic
fluke; it's quite another to have him killed by a government mandate.
It's the difference between falling and being shoved off a ledge.

<P>
To correct the problem, the government is considering a number
of options. One is to allow people to have their air bags disconnected
by car dealerships. That's right: they can't do that legally now.
<P>
Another is to mandate a huge warning sign on the dashboard: WARNING!
DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY CAN OCCUR. Thanks a lot. Another is to
mandate a &quot;smart&quot; bag that will supposedly adjust to
your height and weight so it won't kill you. Still another would
order you to keep your baby in the back seat (as if a single parent
could take a long commute that way).
<P>
Mandate, mandate, mandate, that's all the government can talk
about. Instead, those behind this mess should be offering public
apologies and then forced to pay compensation to the families
who've had their mothers and children murdered by air bags, to
the car buyers who've had their prices artificially increased,
and to the car companies that have been vilified and harassed.
<P>
Even if the government won't draw the right lesson from this fiasco,
we should. Don't trust the feds with your safety. Trust those
in private enterprise, who have the best interests of the consumer
in mind. They won't kill you and then lie about it. 
<P>

<title>Rockwell: The Republican Mixed Economy -- 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>The Republican Mixed Economy</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 




In the 1950s and following, when full-blown socialism began to lose 
its intellectual credibility, there arose a theory of the "mixed 
economy." The idea was that the best of socialism and capitalism can 
be combined into a new system that curbs the excesses of both. The 
result was the political economy of contradiction: "market socialism," 
"collective entrepreneurship," and "community investment," among many 
other strange hybrids. <p>

The theory of the mixed economy didn't get very far, no doubt because 
of its confused and conflicting character. Property is either private 
or it isn't. Prices either float freely or they don't. Investment is 
either market-driven or it's not. One system must dominate the other, 
in the same way that cars must drive on the left- or the right-hand 
side of the road. <p>

The idea of the mixed economy may have fizzled among American liberals 
(though academic publishers are still enthralled with the idea). In 
the Republican Party, however, the idea is making a huge comeback. The 
party is not backing the old mix of socialism and capitalism or 
anything as systematic as that; it is backing the political economy of 
polar opposites.<p>

No where is this more evident than in the Republican treatment of the 
budget. With Jack Kemp on the ticket, supply sideism has again become 
the dominant fiscal ideology. There's nothing wrong with the idea that 
tax cuts fuel economic growth. The American people are overtaxed, and 
only an all-out statist would deny it. The problem is the belief that 
government spending can go up forever without someone, sometime, 
having to pay for it. <p>

The Republican plan has not spelled out any spending cuts because Jack 
Kemp doesn't believe they're necessary (as he demonstrated during his 
free-spending HUD years). He's got a long history of excoriating 
people to his right who have the courage to call for cuts in Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare generally. He never misses 
the chance to underscore the ticket's desire to keep the social 
"safety net" exactly the way it is, or even expand it. <p>

In some areas, Republicans are pushing for huge spending increases. 
For example, they say that the Clinton administration has cut the 
military budget too far too fast, and that they will reverse course 
with tens of billions in new spending. And they are promoting the 
hare-brained idea that taxpayers should foot the private-school bills 
of any kid who is dissatisfied with public school. <p>

At the same time, tax cuts have become the centerpiece of the 
campaign. They are promising a three-year 15 percent cut in income tax 
rates, a per child tax rebate, and a 50 percent capital gains tax cut. 
That's laudable, though the full program--even if it passes--won't 
begin to reverse the tax increases Robert Dole has engineered during 
his 35 years in office. <p>

For once, liberals are asking the right question: where in tax-cut 
land is the money going to come from to supply new guns to the 
Pentagon, and a $2000 annual voucher to every "poor" child in America? 
The candidates won't say, except to suggest that this contradiction 
will be solved through the mysterious magic of "economic growth." 
Private enterprise can be enlisted, unwittingly, to pay for ever-
higher public spending. <p>

The ticket compounds the error by suggesting it will "end the IRS as 
we know it," a phrase designed to lead voters to believe they will no 
longer have to answer to the tax police. Here again, the idea is a 
fine one. But to make it a reality, government must dramatically curb 
its appetite for spending. Without such curbs, the promise to stop 
collecting taxes, or make paying them less onerous, is deeply 
deceptive.  <p>

There is such a thing as the bottom line. Every dime in new public 
spending must be extracted from private markets, either through 
stepped-up use of the taxing power or more borrowing, or by calling on 
the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt by printing money. All three 
have a destabilizing effect on the financial markets at some point. 
There's no such thing as having your cake and eating it too. <p>

The same contradictions spoil the Republican monetary policy. Jack 
Kemp has long advocated a gold standard (or, more strictly, a gold 
price rule for monetary management). But the chief benefit of the gold 
standard is that it puts shackles on the ability of government to 
borrow and monetize debt. You can always print paper money (which is 
why politicians like our present money system), but gold has a fixed 
supply (alchemy being the stuff of legend). <p>

At the same time, Kemp evangelizes for giving the poor more "access to 
credit." He endorses the dangerous movement to force banks to lend 
money to borrowers on grounds of their lowly economic status, without 
regard to whether the loans will be paid back on time or ever. This 
policy requires the kind of loose money regime absolutely prohibited 
by the gold standard. You can't expect to gain the benefits of a gold 
standard unless you're willing to accept its discipline. <p>

The same mixed-up approach is evident in their statements about 
regulation. Dole and Kemp employ the rhetoric of deregulation and call 
for the government to stop muscling private enterprise. At the same 
time, just prior to the convention, Dole told a group of disability 
activists that he is going to expand enforcement of his pet Americans 
With Disabilities Act.<p>

Yet the ADA--which calls on all public and private entities  to make 
accommodation for every conceivable disability, physical or mental--is 
surpassed only by the Clean Air Act in the costs and burdens it places 
on business. According to the letter of the law and court precedent, 
practically every business and public facility is in violation right 
now. For that reason, the ADA has become the latest get-rich-quick 
scheme for the litigious overclass of trial lawyers. <p>

So it goes for the freedom of association. The ticket has strongly 
implied it will retain the laws imposing affirmative action; indeed 
Kemp has been a rabid advocate of these policies. At the same time, 
the Republicans want to be seen as opposing "quotas," the logical and 
necessary outcome of anti-discrimination laws empowering the 
government with defining what constitutes illegal preference in the 
workforce. <p>

On and on it goes with welfare spending (they promise both a 
guaranteed national income and policies to force people to work), 
education (they promise to abolish the Department of Education and to 
have it administer a federal voucher program), immigration (they 
promise to end the free ride and give immigrants full rights to 
welfare), and trade (it is supposed to be both "free" and "fair," i.e. 
restrictive).  <p>

The final and most brazen contradiction has been the Republican 
Achilles heel for at least three decades. They promise smaller 
government at home while insisting that the U.S. step up its empire of 
foreign aid, foreign troops, and foreign wars. This is the most deeply 
dishonest of all the clashing positions within the Republican grab 
bag. A government big enough to run a global empire will hardly shrink 
from total social management at home. <p>

Philosophers speak of antinomies: contradictory truths that may not 
negate each other. Unfortunately for Republicans, these do not exist 
in economic policy. The mixed economy of Robert Dole and Jack Kemp is 
just as mixed-up as the attempt to blend socialism and capitalism. 
Reality eventually forces the politicians who try it to choose one 
path or the other. <p>

<h2>
Conservatives and Vouchers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seeking to align himself more closely with conservatives 
before the Republican convention, Bob Dole has endorsed a federal 
school voucher program. But if he had done his homework, he would 
have known that conservatives have grave reservations about 
putting private schools on the dole. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Dole's idea is a four-year pilot program that would cost 
$5 billion, with half the bill paid by the federal government 
providing the states foot the rest. Four million students from 
mostly poor families would get grants to attend private schools.
This is "a civil rights movement for the 1990s," he said. Is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For decades, conservatives have debated with liberals on 
education. Liberals say money needs to be redistributed from rich 
districts to poor ones, and overall spending increased 
dramatically. Bosh, say conservatives. The answer lies with local 
control, returning to basics, and rewarding achievement. Throwing 
more money at the problem--especially federal money--will not 
work. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To which side of the debate does the voucher idea belong? 
Vouchers means new federal spending in a new federal education 
program that violates the 10th amendment. Vouchers guarantee 
perpetually higher budgets for the Department of Education, which 
will distribute them. Vouchers get the feds involved in the 
funding and running of private schools, something not even Mr. 
Clinton's Goals 2000 does. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even Mr. Dole's pitch is strangely class-based: we should 
take from the rich, who send their kids to private schools 
because "they have the money," and give to the poor, so they can 
have "choice" too. The implication is that disparities in wealth 
are inherently unjust; it takes subsidies to make people truly 
free. Only the far-left used to talk like this. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course rich people have more "choice" than poor people, 
and not only in the schools they attend. Rich people can live in 
nicer homes, drive nicer cars, dress better, eat fancier food, if 
they so choose. Mr. Dole says "that's not the way it ought to 
work in America." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Oh? There's a name for the system that allows such 
disparities: it's capitalism. Those who work hard, save, and 
invest benefit materially, as they should. And by spending their 
own dollars on private school, people are investing in the future 
of their children. How strange that Mr. Dole would be the one to 
offer such a radical critique of this system. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's brand new in Mr. Dole's plan is that vouchers would 
also be given to home schoolers. That's a sure path to disaster. 
The feds would not only monitor and license these caring 
mothers--the way social workers do welfare recipients--but also 
determine what and how many hours they teach. Goodbye 
homeschooling. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already Americans are taxed to the hilt to pay for failing 
public schools. Already states are strapped by intrusive federal 
regulations that have transformed many schools into condom-
distributing, multicultural petri dishes. Now, Republicans are 
supposed to get behind a program that will do to private schools 
what the feds have done to public ones? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's safe to say that Mr. Dole's idea won't go far. Of course 
teachers unions oppose vouchers. But so does an organized 
movement of religious and economic conservatives in the 
Republican Party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
George Roche of Hillsdale College says vouchers would remake 
private schools "into the image of the very public schools that 
have failed so miserably." Ronald Trowbridge adds that "if 
government vouchers are extended to private primary and secondary 
schools," private schools "will become virtually extinct." 
Columnist Samuel Francis says that if vouchers pass, the nation's 
"private and parochial schools would soon be homogenized by the 
same government that has already ruined public schools."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at the budget figures, Charlotte Allen, writing in 
the American Spectator, is shocked by the sheer cost. Taxpayers 
will "find themselves obliged to pay for a private-school system 
on top of a public-school system." Worst of all, they will "leave 
us even more in thrall to a powerful central government."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pat Buchanan, who once backed them, says he took "a hard 
second look at those school vouchers." Now he predicts they will 
"entail greater state contamination and control." Why not "give 
the billions back to taxpayers" in tax cuts, he asks? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economist Murray Rothbard was once asked what he proposed in 
place of vouchers. Abolish the Department of Education, he said, 
repeal regulations on private schools, cut public school budgets, 
and insure local control. Finally, Dr. Rothbard said, the best 
voucher is a person's own hard-earned dollar; government should 
let us keep what we earn. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead, Mr. Dole has proposed yet another far-flung federal 
program. On this issue, as with many others, he has abandoned the 
true conservative position, and thrown in his lot with the 
big-spending, egalitarian left.

<title>Rockwell: Alienation in American Politics -- 7/8/96</title>

<h2>
Alienation in American Politics 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "alienation" of workers 
exploited by wage slavery. Someday, they predicted, the system 
would come unglued, and the workers would expropriate the 
expropriators. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a bunch of malarkey, to be sure; no system is as 
exploitative as socialism. Yet alienation does exist: it's what 
average citizens feel towards the political process and the 
massive federal government it sustains. Every day we are 
exploited more and more, and yet seem powerless to change 
anything. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the recent example of VMI and the Citadel, proud 
and ancient institutions steeped in the respective histories of 
their states. As single-sex military academies, they offered 
young men the camaraderie only this setting can provide. Then, 
for no good reason, a majority of the Supreme Court decided it 
didn't like these schools. In one fell stroke, they are 
destroyed. It's the kind of action that alienates citizens from 
their government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example involves Stalinesque demographic planning. 
Federal judges in Baltimore, Maryland, and Dallas, Texas, have 
decided that inner-city public housing residents should be living 
in the suburbs, again, for no good reason. By court order, these 
residents will be dispersed according to a government plan and at 
taxpayer expense. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is wildly unpopular, both among those who pay to live 
in nice areas and among public-housing residents. When a similar 
scheme was tried in Chicago, it led to enormous social upheaval, 
huge population shifts, and the wrecking of formerly decent 
neighborhoods. No doubt, if the judicial dictators get their way, 
the same will happen in Baltimore and Dallas. Yet exploited 
citizens are powerless to stop these schemes. No wonder they feel 
so alienated from the government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example was brought home by the bombing in Saudi 
Arabia. How many people knew the U.S. stationed thousands of 
troops at the King Abdul Aziz air base in Dhahran? Of those, how 
many think the U.S. has a vital interest in continuing to do so? 
Yet when 19 Americans were killed, the obvious solution--bring 
the troops home--escaped everyone in Washington. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bloated military budget and the foreign policy it 
supports have virtually nothing to do with the average citizen. 
Only the traditional beneficiaries of imperialism gain: 
politicians, corporate exporters, military contractors, lifetime 
bureaucrats, and spooks. The long-suffering taxpayer is alienated 
from the whole system, yet powerless to change it. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The examples provided by the last few years could be 
multiplied without end. Clintonian tax increase, Nafta, Gatt, the 
Mexican bailout, welfare for immigrants: all are projects of federal 
government, all were fantastically unpopular, yet all were 
steamrollered through anyway. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "power elite"--the 
wealthy and unaccountable capitalists who oppress the workers. 
Who today denies that American politics is in fact dominated by a 
power elite? This class is not made of capitalists, who make 
their living, after all, by serving the consuming public. It 
consists of employees and hangers-on of the federal government 
itself. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alienation is fueled by the obvious reality that the power 
elite does not have independent means of support. The huge public 
treasury they have at their disposal is transferred directly from 
the paychecks of the working class. This creates a permanent 
state of conflict, and deepening political discontent unlike any 
we've seen. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some people drop out of politics altogether, and turn 
towards radical groups with a leftist or rightist bent. Those 
still active seek other outlets, including third parties. Most
Americans think two parties are not enough. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What else can we expect when the nominees of the major 
parties are such open representatives of the ruling class? But if 
Watergate undermined faith in the presidency and in government 
generally, what will the newest unflattering revelations about 
Bill Clinton do? They can only increase alienation and 
discontent, and cast a permanent pall on the Beltway elite. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elite may bemoan this fact, but the rise of intense 
anti-government feeling is the most encouraging development in 
modern political life. Jefferson and Madison said a free people 
should never have confidence in men with power. The bigger the 
government, the less it should be trusted, and the less it's 
trusted, the more likely it is to fall. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In Marxist lore, history would settle all scores in favor of 
socialism. But the opposite is happening, and, because the system 
cannot hold, time is running out for leviathan. The expropriated 
taxpayers will have their day, the troops will come home, the 
central planning will end, and the dictatorship of the power 
elite will be no more. Then we will understand the one truth in 
Marxism: the state can wither away.

<title>Rockwell: Clinton's Libertarian Cloak -- 7/3/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Clinton's Libertarian Cloak 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a crazy, mixed-up political world when Bill Clinton 
comes out for individualist libertarianism. The trend began in 
his state of the union address when he announced that "the era of 
big government is over"--and then proposed half a dozen new 
government programs. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But that statement was merely a coming attraction. During a 
press grilling on the FBI files controversy, Mr. Clinton said he 
is "appalled" by "any kind of abuse of public authority that 
tramples on the liberties of individual citizens." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He's gone beyond stealing Republican issues. Now he's 
remaking himself in the image of Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine. 
Moreover, he says, this is not a new position, but one held "from 
my earliest days as a young man."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's new-found libertarianism does have one 
advantage. He has committed himself to a philosophical standard 
by which he can be judged. Do his policies measure up? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House wants to outlaw work that pays under $5 an 
hour. But what if a person can't find a job that pays that much? 
If he works for less, he and his employer violate federal law. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's a clear case of public authority trampling on the 
liberties of individual citizens. If a person works for two bucks 
an hour, and the deal is by mutual agreement, there's no harm 
done. But when the government steps in to prevent the 
transaction, it robs both parties of the liberty to contract. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar examples can be found on every page of the U.S. 
Code. Why should the government drive a wedge between consumers 
who want to buy cigarettes and companies that want to sell them? 
Why should the government force employers to hire people who 
aren't right for the job?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why should the government stop importers from selling Iraqi 
oil? Why should the government prevent property owners from 
draining their swamps and developing their land? Why should the 
government tax away up to 40 percent of people's incomes, and 
declare some to be "unearned"? All these actions trample on 
liberty. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is it unfair to discuss economic policies when Mr. Clinton 
was talking about the "civil liberty" not to be spied on by 
federal police agents without cause? No, although left-liberals 
have long tried to have it both ways, dreaming of socialist 
economics and strict enforcement of the Bill of Rights. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the ACLU, it's impossible to separate the different 
aspects of liberty. A government that forbids and controls 
economic exchange will think nothing of invading what are 
designated as "civil liberties." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There might have been a time when left-liberals believed in 
free association and other civil liberties. They are still fuming 
because Senator Joseph McCarthy thought it mattered when a public 
figure in Hollywood or the State Department was a member of the 
Communist Party. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But those days are long gone. Today, the left is far more 
hysterical about private militias than Mr. McCarthy ever was 
about communists. Freedom of association? Any gun owner who gets 
together with a few friends to fret about the feds is to be spied 
on and treated as a potential bomb builder or church burner. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals are still shrieking about J. Edgar Hoover's 
investigations of the civil rights movement. But today, left-wing 
nonprofit groups spy on people's political affiliations and share 
their files with happy federal bureaucrats. No anti-communist 
group of the 1950s painted with the broad brush of the 
"anti-hate" blocs of the 1990s, which link the desire for tax 
cuts or less recycling with every manner of terrorist activity. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The left loved the Bill of Rights when it was used by the 
federal government against the states. With the independence of 
the states demolished, the left thinks nothing of openly 
attacking the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th amendments. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bill Clinton's devotion to libertarian doctrine is 
laughable, so is the left's claim to defend individuals against 
the government. These are the people who have created the 
Orwellian state they warned us against, and--among a host of 
other depredations--turned private comments into punishable 
speech crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's libertarian sentiments were provoked by the 
accusations that he used FBI files for political purpose. We'll 
know he's serious when he proposes to burn--not the files on 
political appointees--but the millions of dossiers on law-abiding 
private citizens. Until that great day, the big government whose 
era he claims has ended, will still be lording it over us.

<title>Rockwell:  The Politics of Church Fires -- 6/17/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
The Politics of Church Fires
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1988 Willie Horton ads were considered awful because 
they played on fears of race and crime for base (that is, 
Republican) motives. Fast forward eight years, and consider the 
uses to which the Democrats are putting the church burnings in 
the South.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These fires are invariably described as part of a "wave" or 
"rash" of attacks against blacks not seen since Jim Crow. Even 
though almost all are unsolved, the Clinton Justice Department 
assures us that whites are the perpetrators and racial hatred the 
cause. Therefore, these are not mere arsons, but big-league 
political crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, more than 200 federal agents are crawling around 
the rural South, usurping local and state fire investigators, and 
the South-bashing New York Times has had a field day, running 
treatises on why this is exactly what one would expect from a 
racist region. We should all look to New York City, locus of 
peace, harmony, and intergroup love. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A gaggle of left-wing organizations, led by specialists in 
racial agitation, has declared the burnings to be part of a 
conspiracy tacitly encouraged by the Republican Congress and the 
Supreme Court's rulings against racially drawn voting districts.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Jesse Jackson takes it a step further. The burnings are part 
of a new "anti-black mania," he says, a "white riot" spread by 
"lawmakers." People in white sheets burn churches, but so do 
Congressmen "in blue suits, who use thinly coated, veiled race 
signals when they say welfare and crime and three strikes and end 
affirmative action." Mr. Jackson urges people to register and 
vote for you-know-what party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As for the victimized pastors themselves, they went on 
television to complain that they and their parishioners had been 
questioned, even though it's standard procedure to look to owners 
first when a building is torched. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All this is but a side show to the central message as stated 
by Bill Clinton. Standing outside a black church in South 
Carolina, he denounced burnings, poverty, and discrimination, and 
proclaimed the glories of civil rights. "We are not going back," 
he said. "We are not slipping back to those dark days." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In case you missed it, there's a political agenda here: any 
attempt to repeal quotas or welfare is, like torching a church, 
motivated by hatred. This is how liberal politicians play on 
racial fears and crime for their political purposes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton has already been caught in one fib. He said he 
had "vivid and painful memories of black churches being burned in 
my own state when I was a child." It turns out that there is no 
record of such burnings. His remarks had to be corrected by a 
spokesman. They weren't churches, but "community buildings." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Joyce Price and Warren Strobel of the Washington Times
talked to NAACP officials, black pastors, and historians in 
Arkansas. But only one expert could remember a suspicious fire in 
the 1950s that involved a racial element. Curtis Sykes, chairman 
of Arkansas's Black History Advisory Committee, said the fire was 
set by a black man, who was convicted of several insurance-fraud 
arsons. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Frank Wolfe of the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette said that Mr. 
Clinton might be remembering the bombings in Little Rock on Labor 
Day 1959, resulting from resentments over forced school 
integration. Trouble is: all the targets were white, including 
public officials, lawyers, and firemen who had turned their hoses
on protesting white parents. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fibs aside, the campaign marches on. Always anxious to find 
evil in Alabama, the media have focussed on our four fires since 
December. But Alvin Benn of the Montgomery Advertiser raises 
serious questions. Since 1990, thirty-eight houses of worship 
have burned in Alabama. Twenty were black; eighteen were white, 
although there has been no publicity about them. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And none of the fires apparently involved "hate," says the 
State Fire Marshal. For example, some burglars set fire to 
churches after robbing them. Other cases involved internal church 
disputes, drunks who decided to burn a building, insurance fraud, 
electrical fires, and lightning. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More interesting data: thirty church burnings in the South 
over eighteen months may sound like a lot, and it is obviously 
thirty too many, but it represents 0.03 percent of the arsons 
recorded. In just 1994, Chicago had more than 1,000; Los Angeles 
more than 3,000; and New York City more than 5,000. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The church fires may "harken back to a dark era," as Mr. 
Clinton claims. But his efforts certainly harken back to other 
fear-based campaigns to get out the vote, while chilling anyone 
who would question statist federal policies and the racial 
orthodoxies used to justify them.

<h2>
The Terror Threat?
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whip yourself into a frenzy. Dig a shelter out back. Fly 
into a panic and be extremely scared. It's time for special 
alarms, drills, and teach-ins. Most of all, pay your taxes with 
diligence and joy so the government can protect you.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The big news? The feds say terrorists are loose on the land. 
And you could be their next victim. The only way to safety is to 
surrender your money, your freedom, and your guns to the 
bureaucrats, and quake with fear unless the FBI is near. At least 
that's what we'd do if we believed everything we're being told. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ever since the Oklahoma bombing, we've heard that the threat 
of domestic terrorism means the government needs vast new power 
and money. Every chance they get, officials from virtually every 
federal police agency--the FBI, FEMA, Justice, the CIA--tell the 
press that a bomb could blow up your neighborhood any minute. 
Look out! 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And that's only the beginning. Why, do you realize that 
someone could use chemical weapons against your hometown? Even 
more frightening is the supposed prospect of biological warfare. 
If something isn't done right away, we'll be infected with a 
deadly disease or writhe on the floor, dying from asphyxiation. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The likelihood that state or nonstate actors," says head 
spook John M. Deutch in his best bureaucratise, "will attempt to 
use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. interests is 
growing." But, never fear, the feds are here to protect you, 
just as they protected so many in the past. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last November, for example, FEMA hosted a creepy gathering 
in Mount Weather, Virginia, attended by the CIA, the FBI, and 
various other spies and paranoids prominent in the D.C. political 
racket. They met in a huge bomb shelter built at the height of 
the Cold War to maintain life and luxury for government officials 
as the civilian population suffered nuclear annihilation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At this meeting, according to the Wall Street Journal, the 
geniuses in government met to fret about how little money is 
being spent to prepare for terrorist attacks. But "some serious 
planning has begun," says the Journal. Oh to be a fly on that 
wall. Who can doubt that these people salivate over the prospect 
of martial law, suspending the Constitution, and shoving the 
population around like cattle?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What will the ruling regime do to maintain its power in the 
post-Cold War environment? Well, there is the terrorism bill 
passed by Congress and signed by the president. It bolstered 
federal police power with new funds and responsibilities, and 
restricted the rights of American citizens. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Funny that the framers of the Constitution never anticipated 
the need for an internal police force to keep the people in check 
and protected. If they had, they might have given up those silly ideas 
about liberty and self government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Going on seven years now, the ruling elites have confronted 
a serious problem. With no credible foreign threat on the 
horizon, the central state seems to have lost its primary reason 
for existence. The average fellow can't understand what the 
apparatus in Washington does with 1.7 trillion bucks every year. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A government this big does its best to avoid peace at home 
and abroad. As it knows from experience, these are the times that 
try men's pocketbooks. People demand lower taxes, shrinking 
government power, and less government arrogance. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For instance: during the first World War, the government 
practically established martial law at home, planned most 
industrial and agricultural production, revved up the military 
machine to full capacity, and squelched free speech and a free 
press. It was a sad chapter, but one that came to a quick close 
when the war was over. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the American people demanded an immediate end to the 
violation of their rights and the high taxation of their 
property. The military shrunk in size, and the war planning 
boards were shut down, not to be reopened until the New Deal 
(under the auspices of curing an economic crisis, itself brought 
on by the Federal Reserve). 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same thing might have happened after the Second World 
War, which also saw an explosion in government power over the 
economy. But just as people were demanding a return to normalcy, 
the Cold War intervened, and thankfully so for folks in 
Washington. The communists were coming, and taxpayers could be 
relied up on to stay frightened and relatively docile for another 
forty years. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fast forward to 1989, and the end of the ramshackle Soviet 
empire. With no substantial foreign policy threats on the 
horizon, peace and freedom threatened to break out yet again. A 
series of botched military exercises overseas has made the public 
ever more skeptical of the ruling regime. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terrorism is as good an excuse as any for keeping people 
alarmed about some enemy, and to deflect attention away from the 
real threat to their liberties, which is the government itself. 
Indeed, for several years, polls have recorded record-level 
dissatisfaction with government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington is none too happy that nobody seems to care about 
the supposed terrorist threat. Complains Senator Dick Lugar, 
"there is almost a sense of denial out there in the public." 
Indeed a recent poll--which underscores that the public is 
keeping its wits--reveals that only a few Americans are 
"seriously worried" about terrorism. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The government is trying to fix that. Some militia guys were 
recently arrested in Georgia, and the anonymous federal informant 
who had undoubtedly egged them on told the press they planning to bomb 
the Olympics. Not true, said the on-the-record briefing that followed, 
but the essential message had already been planted in the minds of 
many.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And last year, the feds called the Anaheim, California, fire 
department to say that Disneyland would be sprayed with poison 
gas in three hours. Whoops, they said later, it's not true. But 
again, the essential message had been planted. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From the beginning of time, governments have used the 
prospect of attack, real and phony baloney, to inspire citizen 
compliance. Will it work this time?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I have my doubts. A government that can't deliver the mail
surely can't stop poison gas attacks. And the American people 
have become stingy with their rights and liberties, as they 
should be and will ever be, now that government has become the 
"fearful master" George Washington warned us against.

<title>Rockwell:  Revenue Neutrality   -- 5/9/96</title>

<h2>
Revenue Neutrality  
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans might as well pack their bags, admit defeat,  
and head home. Their entire program has been doomed by the  
doctrine of "revenue neutrality." In practice, it means that the  
government's income can never fall. This has turned fiscal policy  
into, at best, a pointless exercise; at worst, a deeply dishonest  
shell game.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Look at recent Republican maneuvers. Every proposed lower  
tax is matched by some increase. Give a tax credit for adoption,  
and raise taxes on business. Cut gas taxes, and increase other  
excise taxes. What's next? Cuts in the inheritance tax, "paid  
for" by an increase in the gas tax? Maybe the per child tax  
credit can be "paid for" by repealing the adoption tax credit.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The total burden of taxes remains the same no matter what  
these guys do. So what is supposed to be the purpose of this  
nonsense? If it is too much to ask that the federal government  
take less from the private sector, Republican slogans about  
cutting the size of government are empty. There's no point to  
elections, platforms, or debates, because you can't cut  
government without cutting its income.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The doctrine of "revenue neutrality" is a leftover from  
George Bush's 1990 budget agreement, which raised taxes and  
arguably lost him the election. Part of the deal was that any  
increase in spending must be accompanied by an increase in taxes;  
likewise, any decrease in taxes must be matched by an equal  
decrease in spending.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At first, it sounds reasonable to treat the federal budget  
as if it were a household's. But it's not, because it doesn't  
consist of owned property. It is a vast redistribution scheme  
whereby property is pilfered from some and doled out to others;  
either or both practices should be curbed wherever possible.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Before the 1990 budget deal, no one said that all tax cuts  
had to be "paid for" in other ways. That language makes it seem  
deeply expensive to cut revenue, and thus fiscally irresponsible.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For taxpayers, however, a tax cut is not an expense, but a  
boon. It allows them to keep more of what is rightfully theirs in  
the first place. What's expensive is keeping taxpayers on the  
hook for the same percentage of the national income, year after  
year, and never allowing it to fall.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One fallacious assumption behind the doctrine of revenue  
neutrality is that Congress can know exactly what people will do  
before and after tax changes. Consider the gas tax. It's possible  
that deep cuts in the gas tax would cause the price to fall and  
the demand to rise, thus increasing overall revenue. But Congress  
doesn't even consider the prospect. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is true for many taxes. If the inheritance tax were cut  
dramatically, people's incentive to accumulate property would  
increase dramatically. It's even possible that the resulting  
economic activity would offset the revenue losses of the tax cut.  
So it goes for the income tax and every other excise tax.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But let's say the so-called Laffer Effect didn't kick in,  
and total revenue actually went down. A loss to government is a  
gain for everyone else. Lower revenue means government is less of  
a burden on the American people, and that the economy is that  
much freer. That's why we should be as thrilled to see a falling  
tax take as a falling crime rate. Each makes people that much  
more secure in their person and property.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about the deficit? It's true that deficits crowd out  
private investment, tempt the Treasury into monetizing debt, and  
drive up interest rates. A balanced budget, with both spending  
and taxes low, is a joy to behold.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But we live in the age of deficits not because taxes are too  
low, but because government has been freed from the obligation to  
back the currency with gold. It's no coincidence that the budget  
was last balanced in 1969, when gold restricted the Treasury's  
ability to pile up debt.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Why do increases and decreases in the deficit always seem to  
surprise the political class? Because its size is influenced by  
factors over which they have little control, like economic  
growth, the business cycle, the size of the underground economy,  
and the numbers of people receiving wages and salaries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One thing politicians can control is how much government 
steals from our paychecks every year. But to fix that, we must  
first trash the 1990 budget deal. Concocted by an evil genius,  
it's the only budget agreement in the last two decades that  
anyone bothers to obey. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So long as "revenue neutrality" is the rule, leviathan will  
grow and grow, and the Republican promise to reduce the size of  
government will continue to be a rhetorical cover for the same  
old political racket.

<title>Rockwell: "Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry -- 5/08/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
"Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
  
Federal offices aren't often surrounded by protesters. But   
egregious civil-rights decisions against Mitsubishi and Hooters   
inspired their workers to take to the streets. Meanwhile, lesser   
victims of the civil-rights police are forced to suffer in   
silence as legal defense bills threaten bankruptcy.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Justice Department and the EEOC decide what constitutes   
"discrimination" on grounds of race, religion, age, disability,   
and sex, the most sensitive areas of our national life. Since any   
action can be construed as somehow influenced by them, the   
government can exercise ferocious power over a vast range of   
economic decisions.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When a business is involved, bureaucrats act as the   
sure-to-win plaintiff's lawyers capable of imposing de facto  
quotas in any business or industry. It has the power to brand   
companies with labels like "racist" and "sexist," and drive them   
to ruin. It is a main reason why race relations are so rotten   
today, and why, more than three decades after the Civil Rights   
Act, everyone feels more victimized than ever.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Not only has the Congress done nothing to curb this, it is   
preparing to expand government power into the makeup of our   
families. The pretext is a bill making it easier to adopt   
children. There is a $5,000 tax credit, "paid for" by higher   
taxes on business. But the heart of the bill is a provision   
putting the federal government in charge of adoption and   
foster-child services, imposing huge new costs, and robbing   
prospective parents of the freedom to choose.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the adoption process, adoptive parents, biological   
parents, and children work directly with public and private   
adoption agencies. After years of experience, agencies have   
learned which matches are likely to succeed, and which are not.   
The criteria are often unquantifiable, but can include such   
factors as race and ethnicity.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


For example, a Vietnamese family may know of some Vietnamese   
orphans in need of permanent loving homes. So long as the match   
is otherwise suitable, the agency will work with the parents to   
accommodate their request. Children are then brought together   
with adoptive parents who will love them and care for them.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But Washington planners find this intolerable, and so are   
scheming to abolish it. They don't want people to be able to   
specify the race of the children they want to adopt; nor do they   
want an agency to be able to draw on its experience in working   
with parents insofar as race is involved. The planners would   
replace the right of contract with bureaucratic edict.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the Washington tradition of antonymous titles, the bill   
is called the "Adoption Promotion and Stability Act." It mandates   
that adoption providers can no longer "discriminate in making a   
placement decision" on the basis of national origin, race, and color.  
The original bill was so draconian it had to be amended to   
say race can be one factor if more than one "qualified" family   
want the child. In fact, the amendment counts for nothing.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Let's say a young mother considers giving up her child for   
adoption. Today, she is allowed, within reason, to specify what   
kind of family she would like her child to be brought up in,   
including the racial makeup of that family. If this bill passes,   
the agency will not be allowed to take her wishes into account.   
Faced with less certainty about her child's future, she will be   
more likely to choose abortion.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The same goes for adoptive and foster parents. If the bill   
passes, they will still be able, for now, to request the sex and   
religion of the child they would like to care for. But any   
request regarding race or national origin will not be considered   
under most conditions. Will the Vietnamese couple be just as   
interested in adopting a white or black child? Of course not, and   
they might just drop out of the process.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How will the government know whether discrimination takes   
place? In its usual ham-fisted fashion, it will count the   
numbers, establish quotas, and override people's preferences. It   
will substitute private judgment with rule by bureaucrats and   
lawyers, and give the Justice Department veto power over all   
private decisions that affect adoption and foster care.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This law will also be subject to category creep like other   
civil-rights bills. It's only a matter of time before religion,   
sex, and disability are added to the list. In time, Washington   
will be running the private and state-level child placement   
industry the way it runs its own welfare bureaucracies.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The proponents of the bill make the wildly unproven claim   
that all delays in foster and adoptive placements are due to   
discrimination against minorities. They have demonized the   
National Association of Black Social Workers for seeking black   
homes for black children. Like all liberals bent on social   
engineering, they pursue their plans with a John Brown-like fury   
and blindness to the other side.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What, then, is the real cause of sluggishness and   
disequilibrium in the system? Federal laws that overregulate the   
industry and prevent a well-functioning market for parental   
rights from emerging. So these revolutionary Republicans, instead  
of repealing the existing government interventions, impose more.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The result will be to make adoptive agencies and social   
service providers vulnerable to killer lawsuits from parents who   
experience any delay. "Public-interest" lawyers will also file   
civil suits by the thousands, and tie the placement process in   
knots. In a system already replete with broken hearts, this will   
impose limits on the numbers of organizations willing to be   
involved in the first place.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The bill will not end up "promoting the adoption of minority   
children," as supporters claim, because Washington can't people from  
deciding not to be adoptive or foster parents, or from choosing  
abortion over childbearing. The more freedom of choice the government  
takes away, the less anyone will want to bear the burden in the first  
place.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There's a moral principle involved here too. The federal   
government has long managed our associations with regard to race   
at ever more intimate levels, and the results have been awful.  
Now it wants to make the same divisive intervention into the   
makeup of families. What's next? Non-discrimination laws for   
marriage?  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's time we begin to trust the judgment of the private   
sector, and local levels of government over federal, and stop   
transferring power to Washington. Unlike Mitsubishi and Hooters,   
the children and parents victimized by civil rights enforcement   
aren't in a position to stage public protests.

<h4>THOMAS A. SCHATZ</h4> 
President<br> 
Citizens Against Government Waste and<br> 
Council for Citizens Against Government Waste<br> 
</center> 
<p> 
Thomas A. Schatz is President of Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) and the Council for 
Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW). 
<p> 
CAGW was founded by J. Peter Grace and Jack Anderson in 1984 following the release of the Grace 
Commission report. It is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit, educational organization with more than 600,000 
members nationwide. Mr. Schatz is a nationally recognized spokesperson on government waste and has 
appeared on hundreds of radio talk shows from coast to coast, including WBZ in Boston, WGN in 
Chicago, KABC in Los Angeles, WCBS in New York, and WOAI in San Antonio. His national television 
appearances include: "ABC News with Peter Jennings," "CBS News with Dan Rather," "NBC News with 
Tom Brokaw," CNN, CNBC, "Larry King Live," "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour," and numerous local 
network affiliates. 
<p> 
According to official Office of Management and Budget figures, implementation of Grace Commission 
recommendations saved taxpayers $152.4 billion through 1990, and CAGW estimates another $ 100 
billion have been saved since then. An additional $78 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1993 and $54 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1994. 
<p> 
As President of CCAGW, the 501(c) (4) nonprofit lobbying organization, Mr. Schatz spearheaded the 
expansion of the grassroots Taxpayers Action Network to more than 400 chapters nationwide. Mr. Schatz 
has also testified on government waste issues before committees of the United States Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
<p> 
During his nine years with CAGW, Mr. Schatz has been instrumental in a development program that 
increased membership from 5,000 to more than 600,000. 
<p> 
Prior to joining CAGW in 1986, Mr. Schatz spent six years as legislative director for Congressman 
Hamilton Fish and two years practicing law and lobbying. 
<p> 
Mr. Schatz holds a law degree from George Washington University and was graduated from the State 
University of New York at Binghamton with a BA degree, With Honors, in Political Science. He is 
married to Leslee Behar and has two daughters, Samantha and Alexandra.

<title>Schatz: Radioactive Tax Boondoggle  -- 08/01/96</title>

<h2>Radioactive Tax Boondoggle</h2>

By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 

It's hard to imagine the government waste watchdog group Citizens Against
Government waste (CAGW), the conservative Heritage Foundation, the
Libertarian Cato Institute, and Taxpayers for Common Cents agreeing on a
policy issue with The Safe Energy Communication Council, Friends of the
Earth, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. And yet it's true.
These and other philosophically divergent organizations are united in their
opposition to more taxpayer funding for one of the most egregious symbols
of pork-barrel spending: the so-called Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR).
<P>
Bringing the budget ax down on the Department of Energy's ALWR program
should be a no-brainer for Congress. The drive to revive nuclear power with
taxpayer subsidies has failed on Main Street, Wall Street, and in the
utilities' executive suites.
<P>
Today, there's simply no domestic market for these reactors, and the
international opportunities are drying up as more governments turn their
backs on this economically-challenged energy source. Every U.S. reactor
ordered in the past 23 years has been subsequently canceled.
<P>
Two independent surveys released earlier in 1996 show that seven out of ten
American voters and nine out of ten utility CEOs don't want new nuclear
plants tax-funded or built, respectively. Most, if not all, forecasting
reports from Wall Street brokerage and investment firms wouldn't argue with
Bear Stearns analyst Daniel Scotto who quipped that the next nuclear
reactor would be built "when Jimmy Hoffa was found alive and well."
<P>
Yet, after spending 60 percent of all U.S. energy research and development
money on nuclear power between 1948 and 1996 (despite the fact that it now
only provides 8 percent of our overall energy needs), Congress is debating
whether to pump more of our tax dollars into the ALWR program.
<P>
Authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), the ALWR was
originally intended as a five-year program to develop advanced commercial
nuclear reactors for the domestic market. But the program has become a
corporate welfare poster child, financially benefiting major firms such as
General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, and Asea Brown Boveri/Combustion
Engineering. In 1994, these three companies alone had combined revenues of
$73 billion.
<P>
U.S. taxpayers have provided more than $275 million for this program
between fiscal years (FY) 1992-1996. The fifth and final year of funding
ends in September, but the Energy Department has requested an additional
$40 million for FY 1997, and Westinghouse envisions itself on the receiving
end of funding through FY 1999.
<P>
Now, however, even the monolithic nuclear industry is wavering on the
ALWR's worth. In February, GE, one of the primary recipients of tax funds
for the ALWR program, announced that it was abandoning its Simplified
Boiling Water Reactor program (one of the reactor programs within the ALWR
program), which has received more than $50 million in taxpayer subsidies.
GE defended its withdrawal, stating that "extensive evaluations -- have not
established the commercial viability of these designs," a clear-cut
repudiation of the program's original rationale if there ever was one.
Taxpayers will most likely never recover this investment.
<P>
But there's more. Besides lining corporate pockets for dead-end research,
taxpayer funds have also been used to reimburse the above-named companies
for a portion of the fees charged by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) for its costs to license and certify reactor designs. In other words,
taxpayers are covering the fees which were imposed in order to help offset
the costs of the NRC's services.
<P>
The ALWR program was intended to assist in the design of reactors to be
built in the United States. But since there is no domestic market, U.S.
taxpayer-supported reactor designs -- whose certification by the NRC has been
partially subsidized by the taxpayer under this program -- are being marketed
and sold in Japan, South Korea and other countries. This is a violation of
the intent of EPACT, which stipulates that recipients of any ALWR funds
must promise to construct and operate the reactor in the United States.
<P>
Fortunately, a bipartisan coalition in Congress, spearheaded by Reps. Mark
Foley (R-FL) and David Obey (D-WI) has formed to block any proposals for
continued funding the ALWR. Whether these federal purse-watchers will
succeed depends on citizens raising their voices loudly enough for Congress
to get the message.
<P>
Cutting this tax-vacuum would be an unequivocal statement that Members of
Congress are committed to cutting waste and redirecting budget priorities
to the nation's economic good. It's time to get this tax hog out of the
federal trough.

<title>Schatz:  Finders Keepers -- 12/21/95</title>

<h2>Finders Keepers</h2>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 

  
  
Picture this: You've been living beyond your means and have had to 
borrow a great deal of money over the years just to keep your bills 
paid and family fed.  Finally, after much procrastination and a few 
sleepless nights, you put yourself and family on a regimen, aiming to 
balance your books over the next seven years while still meeting your 
basic needs.  Tackling  the accumulated debt and interest comes next.  
Then one day, a psychic from the CIA tells you that there's a good 
chance -- but not a guarantee -- that you'll come into some money 
during that seven-year period. 
<P>
What do you do?  Do you spend that hypothetical money, reverting to 
the bad habits that put you in this fix to begin with, or resolve to 
stick to your seven-year plan, recognizing the slim margin of error in 
your calculations and questionable reliability of CIA psychics?   And 
if that psychic turns out to be correct, do you balance your budget 
faster, let's say in five years, and begin to reduce your massive 
debt?  Or do you blow the windfall as usual, costing you more money in 
the long run and imperiling the financial security of your family?  
The logical, responsible answer is to do everything in your power to 
balance your budget faster, start paying off your debt, and break 
free. 
<P>
That's what a reasonable person would do, particularly someone who is 
trying to overcome a lifetime of profligacy.  But in the logic-free 
zone of our nation's capitol, the moral of this parable doesn't 
necessarily track.    
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton continue their dance around the 
budget solution, there's talk of "finding" more money, either through 
revamped economic assumptions or a change in the calculation of the 
consumer price index.  And naturally, being a city of addicts, there's 
already talk in some quarters of spending what has yet to be "found," 
despite the fact that the two sides' budget plans are still hundreds 
of billions of dollars apart.  So while economic assumptions are 
always debatable, and the consumer price index is undoubtedly 
inflated, the idea that we can make things right just by juggling the 
numbers sends the message loud and clear that politics as usual 
continues to rule the roost.  For politicians searching for an easy 
way out, and an escape valve for mounting pressures, it is a nearly 
irresistible solution.          
<P>
So steeped is this city in the compulsion to spend, and so blurred can 
rhetoric and reality become, that it's always worthwhile reviewing the 
facts.    
<P>
Doomsayers have led those unfamiliar with Washington lexicon into  
believing that one, the Republican plan cuts spending, and two, does 
so in a way that will adversely affect the country.  Baloney all 
around.  First, spending will increase in each of the seven years even 
under the "radical" Republican plan. And second, the long-term 
economic benefits of getting the nation's fiscal house in order will 
be worth it.    
<P>
If the Republican plan is adopted, the federal government will spend 
$12 trillion over the next seven years -- an average of $1.7 trillion 
annually.  Medicare will increase 6.4 percent annually -- the most of 
any federal program -- and the per-beneficiary increase will be 47 
percent.  The earned income tax credit, which the president says is 
destroyed by the Republican budget, will increase by 150 percent.  
Student loan volume will increase by 50 percent.  Medicaid goes up by 
30 percent.   
<P>
Give, these projections, the real question is:  How much more do we 
really need to spend?  And what can we afford if, like the person in 
our parable, we're carrying around a $5 trillion debt? 
<P>
Already, interest rates have dropped in anticipation of a balanced 
budget agreement.  The effect on families for housing, car payments, 
education, and other expenses is enormous.  A two percent drop in 
rates can mean thousands less each year in such payments. 
<P>
If there isn't a deal, we will be violating one of Thomas Jefferson's 
moral precepts:  "We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle 
posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves."  
Nobel Laureate James Buchanan recently noted that up until the past 
several decades, balancing the budget was part of our "effective 
constitution," but that "we have lost the moral sense of fiscal 
responsibility to make formal constraints unnecessary." 
<P>
There's a great national debate over "family values."  What kind of 
standards are we setting for future generations?  Without a balanced 
budget, we will pass on a tax rate of 84 percent to our children and 
grandchildren just to pay our bills.  A child born today will pay 
$187,000 in taxes over a lifetime just to pay his or her share of the 
interest on the national debt.  Is that a legacy we can live with?   
<P>
<P>
We can avoid such a fate simply by living within the parameters of the 
Republican plan.   While priorities can always be negotiated, and 
should be negociated, $12 trillion is more than enough money to meet 
the nation's true needs over the next seven years.  And if additional 
funds surface in re-estimates of economic assumptions, let's make the 
moral and just decision to balance the budget faster, start paying off 
the debt, and save the future for our children and grandchildren.

<h2>No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 
There is no such thing as a "budget process" for the federal 
government.  
<p>
Any junior executive will tell you that a real budget is a financial 
plan; it controls how much money may be spent, both overall and for 
each spending category, before any checks are actually cut.  The Grace 
Commission called the federal budget "a political document, ... of 
limited usefulness as a vehicle for planning, control or evaluation."  
Here we are 12 years later and, as Yogi Bera said, "it's deja vu all 
over again." 
<p>
Money is often appropriated without regard to revenue, a practice 
which has been taken for granted for years, but which has lead to a 
federal debt of more than $4.9 trillion.  Even with better than 
average odds that Congress will reach a balanced budget by the year 
2002, the debt is still expected to top out at nearly $6 trillion.   
<p>
The government's fanciful accounting practices invite waste, lack of 
accountability, and gross mismanagement.  But the long-term danger is 
that these distorted budget practices seriously imperil all the hard 
work and political courage being demonstrated on Capitol Hill to bring 
the federal spending juggernaut under control.  
<p>
The annual budget battle over appropriations has become an 
exasperating exercise in futility.  This year, thanks to the tenacity 
of House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (D-La.), and 
many like-minded members of Congress, a significant number of wasteful 
government programs and pork-barrel projects will be purged from the 
13 appropriation bills.  But members who scour the bills looking for 
juicy bits of bacon complain, correctly, that it is the budget system 
itself that allows unwanted pork projects to filter through.   
<p>
In the next phase in the fight for sound government, fiscally 
responsible members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have 
offered budget reform bills to bring federal budget policies in line 
with reality and with private sector practices.  
<p>
A budget reform bill offered by Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and 
Steve Largent (R-Okla.) would reconfigure the process from the ground 
up, seeking an end to that mindless annual scramble for scarce federal 
dollars which passes for the appropriations process.  The bill's 
philosophy was summed up when Rep. Cox wrote recently:  "A budget, 
properly used, should provide a framework for the individual spending 
decisions that follow.  The adoption of a budget, therefore, is not 
the proper time to debate those individual decisions."  The 
Cox/Largent legislation would enact a "budget first, spend second" 
provision, reduce the federal budget to a one-page, 19-function 
resolution, and toughen the president's enhanced rescission powers. 
<p>
The spirit of the Cox bill is mirrored in a "truth in budgeting" act 
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) will introduce on November 8.  His bill would 
create a more workable and understandable budget process by 
introducing biennial budgeting, creating a reserve (rainy day) fund 
for fiscal emergencies, putting an end to the fanciful concept of 
baseline budgeting, and enforcing sequestration if spending goes over 
enacted budget and entitlement caps. 
<p>
Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) is proposing budget reform as well, 
including a Spending Reduction Commission. 
<p>
All of these efforts finally begin to liberate the federal government 
from baseline budgeting, the foundation of Washington's "weird 
science."  Baseline budgeting is an entrenched accounting gimmick 
which allows Congress and the President to say with a straight face 
that a reduction in the increase of an agency's budget is actually a 
"cut."   
<p>
The proposed changes may seem common sensical, but they represent 
dramatic change to the Kafkaesque world of federal spending.  Congress 
has been loath to make these "easy" choices in the past, even with 
solid bi-partisan support.  It is so much easier to crow about hard-
fought budget savings from program terminations, while still being 
able to take credit for redirecting the money into other programs and 
trust fund accounts.  This "carve and spend" will continue to 
frustrate real efforts to reduce spending unless Congress moves 
forcefully to overhaul the budget process itself.  The lock-box bill 
approved by the House earlier this year, which will permit saved funds 
to go toward deficit reduction, is a big first step.  But a major 
overhaul must follow, and soon. 
<p>
Reform-minded members like Reps. Cox, Largent, and Barton represent 
the next wave in the revolution that began last November.  Budget 
reform must be at the top of Congress' "to do" list for the next 
session.  Anything less than a full frontal assault on congenital 
budget gimmickry and accounting trickery will make a mockery of all 
the hard-fought gains achieved this session and guarantee that we will 
never get spending under control.

<title>Schlafly: Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention  -- 8/1/96
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<i>August 1, 1996</i>
<h2>            
Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


      The U.S. Senate should reject ratification of the Chemical
     Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that purports to ban chemical
     weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use.
     Contrary to its announced purpose, this foolish treaty would
     increase, not eliminate, the risk of chemical weapons use, and
     would seriously damage U.S. national security interests.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bad guys are deterred by force, the threat of force, or by their
     cold calculation that the costs of evil behavior are not worth
     the risk. Many dangerous countries, such as Libya, Syria, Iraq
     and North Korea, have not signed the CWC and would not be
     deterred by pieces of paper.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China and Iran, which have significant chemical weapons programs,
     are unlikely to comply. Of particular concern is Russia, which
     has the largest arsenal of chemical weapons; the actions and
     statements of its military leaders confirm that Russia would not
     comply at all.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Even though the CWC would not rid the world of chemical weapons,
     it would impose a terrible regulatory and reporting burden on
     every U.S. company that produces, processes, or consumes a
     scheduled chemical. The CWC would affect U.S. firms that make
     dyes and pigments, insecticides, pharmaceuticals, ceramics,
     nylon, paint and varnish, electronics, textiles, and soap and
     detergent.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimates that 2,175 U.S.
     companies would be saddled with reporting requirements and data
     declarations; others estimate that the burden will fall on 10,000
     U.S. production facilities. This time-consuming reporting could,
     in turn, produce additional government oversight and regulation
     by agencies such as OSHA, EPA, and IRS.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     No previous treaty has ever subjected U.S. private industry to
     international inspection. CWC is the New World Order closing in
     on American business.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The process of allowing teams of foreigners to investigate,
     inspect and challenge all facets of private U.S. businesses could
     open them up to industrial espionage and the theft of their
     proprietary information. Forcing them to spend unnecessary funds
     to hire more people to fill out more government forms, and submit
     to routine inspections, would reduce their ability to compete in
     world markets.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In addition to the costs to be borne by private industry, the
     treaty would require the United States to pick up the tab for 25
     percent of the costs of implementation and verification at an
     estimated cost of $200 million a year. Other countries would
     probably demand that the United States pay their costs of
     implementation, too.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the CWC would give birth to a new international
     bureaucracy. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
     Weapons is already headquartered in The Hague with a Conference
     of State Parties, an Executive Council, and a Technical
     Secretariat whose verification responsibilities extend over a
     hundred pages.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Every time we hear trendy slogans such as "global village,"
     "world economy," or "international cooperation," Americans should
     remember that other nations have no familiarity with or
     understanding of our Bill of Rights or our federal structure of
     government with separate state laws. Treaties are customarily
     written as though all power to make and fulfill international
     commitments resides in the head of state who signs the document.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If the CWC goes into effect, what happens to our Fourth Amendment
     rights? The CWC's Technical Secretariat, without a warrant, would
     be empowered to inspect virtually everything within the premises,
     including records, files, papers, processes, controls, structures
     and vehicles, and to interrogate on-site personnel.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Under CWC, what happens to our First Amendment rights? Freedom of
     Information requests will not be permitted under the proposed CWC
     implementing legislation, so Americans would have fewer rights
     under this treaty than if a U.S. agency, such as the FBI,
     investigated them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     As implemented by the Clinton Administration, the CWC would have
     a meddling effect in U.S. affairs. It would forbid U.S.
     commanders to use tear gas and other riot-control substances to
     protect our soldiers and minimize civilian casualties.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The CWC is unverifiable and unenforceable. Former CIA Director
     James Woolsey testified on June 23, 1994 that "the chemical
     weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective,
     that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
     to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In closed societies, factories making fertilizer,
     pharmaceuticals, or plastics can easily cover up their production
     of chemical weapons. After receiving notification of a challenge,
     a facility has six days to hide the evidence before inspectors
     are admitted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Small amounts of concealed chemical weapons can be militarily
     very significant. Used against critical military targets,
     chemical weapons can have dramatic consequences.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     To paraphrase a popular bumper strip, when chemical weapons are
     outlawed, only outlaw governments will have chemical weapons. Our
     World War II experience shows that the best way for civilized
     countries to prevent the use of chemical weapons is for the good
     guys to have their own deterrent arsenals of chemical weapons.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In any event, the Senate must not make matters worse by ratifying
     the unenforceable, costly, and probably unconstitutional CWC.

           Self-Appointed Monitors Of Corporate Responsibility
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The CEO of Cypress in Silicon Valley has just issued an
          eloquent put-down of the social-responsibility
          busybodies who are trying to intimidate corporations
          into selecting their boards of directors on the basis
          of racial and gender diversity. T.J. Rodgers wrote a
          letter to the Sisters of St. Francis in Philadelphia
          who had used their ownership of a little Cypress stock
          to engage in leftwing mischief-making.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Far from being put on the defensive by having a convent
          of nuns lecture him on corporate responsibility,
          Rodgers rejected their arguments as "not only unsound,
          but even immoral." He admonished them that Cypress's
          board of directors "is not a ceremonial watchdog, but a
          critical management function."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress's directors need to have experience as a CEO of
          an important technology company and direct expertise in
          the semiconductor business based on education (usually
          with a Master's degree in engineering science) and
          management experience. Contrary to the nuns' argument,
          Rodgers explained that "a woman's view on how to run
          our semiconductor company does not help us, unless that
          woman has an advanced technical degree and experience
          as a CEO."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Sounds like common sense, doesn't it. "I believe," he
          said, "that placing arbitrary racial or gender quotas
          on corporate boards is fundamentally wrong."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The nuns had tried to lay a guilt trip on Cypress by
          suggesting that it lacks corporate "morality" and
          Christianity by failing to appoint a board of directors
          with "equality of sexes, races, and ethnic groups."
          Rodgers didn't hedge in his response. "I am unaware,"
          he said, "of any Christian requirements for corporate
          boards; your views seem more accurately described as
          `politically correct,' than `Christian.' "
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
         Then, Rodgers went on to argue that the nuns'
          presumptuous requirements for corporate boards are
          "immoral," which he defined as "causing harm to
          people." He pointed out how all the retirees whose
          pension funds invest in Cypress would suffer if Cypress
          were run on anything other than a profit-making basis.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The letter from the nuns was so sanctimonious that it
          did not allow for any possibility that a CEO could be
          moral if he disagreed with their position. I found
          myself cheering when Rodgers told the sisters to "get
          down from your moral high horse."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress employees in San Jose averaged $78,741 in
          salary and benefits in 1995. All are Cypress
          shareholders, have a first-rate health-care plan,
          profit-sharing, and other goodies such as gifts of
          personal computers and employee education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rogers reiterated that "choosing a board of directors
          based on race and gender is a lousy way to run a
          company. We will never be pressured into it. We simply
          cannot allow arbitrary rules to be forced on us by
          organizations that lack business expertise."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers obviously warmed up to the challenge of do-good
          busybodyism. "The political pressure to be what is
          euphemized as a `responsible corporation' today," he
          said, "is so great that it literally threatens the well
          being of every American."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers listed some of the other special-interest
          groups that are harassing corporations about their pet
          issues. These include the complaints that corporations
          are not sufficiently "environmentally conscious," that
          they do business with certain countries, or supply the
          Armed Forces, or pay their CEO too much, or give to
          certain charities.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers cited a Fortune magazine report showing that
          the so-called "ethical mutual funds" that invest
          according to a social-issues agenda, which control $639
          billion in investments, produced an 18.2 percent return
          in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 returned 27.2
          percent. Thus, the investors in the "ethical funds"
          lost 9 percent of $639 billion, or $57.5 billion in one
          year, because they invested on a social-issues basis!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers lashed out at the current election-year frenzy
          in Washington to institutionalize the so-called
          "corporate responsibility" concepts promoted by Labor
          Secretary Robert Reich and Senators Ted Kennedy, Jeff
          Bingaman and Tom Daschle. Their proposals "provoke fear
          and anger against America's business," and are
          fundamentally wrong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          One Bingaman-Daschle proposal would grant a low federal
          tax rate of 11 percent to "responsible corporations,"
          i.e., companies that limit the pay of their CEO to no
          more than 50 times the company's lowest-paid employee.
          Such a rule would limit the pay of the CEO of the
          world's most important semiconductor company (Intel) to
          less than that of a second-string quarterback in the
          NFL.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Commenting on the double standards of the "leftist, out
          of touch with reality" Senators, Rodgers asked, "How
          long will it be before Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, and
          Daschle hold hearings on the `irresponsible
          corporations' that pay tens of millions of dollars to
          professional athletes? Or are athletes a `protected
          group,' leaving CEOs as their sole target?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers concluded by stating that he stands for
          "personal and economic freedom, for free minds and free
          markets, a position irrevocably in opposition to the
          immoral attempt by coercive utopians to mandate even
          more government control over America's economy." May
          his tribe increase, and may his forthright statement
          embolden other CEOs to speak up, too.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Whatever Happened To Competition in School?  -- 6/27/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>June 27, 1996</i><h2>                        
Whatever Happened To Competition in School?
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     When it comes to the Olympic Games, everyone seems to understand
     that competition produces the winners and the record-breakers.
     It's unlikely that the athletes could reach such heights of
     achievement and endurance if they were not competing against
     other athletes who are closely matched in skills and putting
     forth their very best.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some people, however, are at war against the whole concept of
     competition. They think it is undemocratic, unfair, and elitist.
     It's a sign of the times that, in Cecil County, Maryland,
     basketball is now played by some very unusual rules.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If one basketball team is ten points ahead of the other,
     additional baskets don't count until the underdog team catches
     up. No record is kept of who scores how many baskets, so no
     player can ever be recognized as the star of the team.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     This system should be called Outcome-Based Basketball because
     it's just like the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) that has spread
     through our public schools like a contagious disease. OBE is
     sometimes called Performance-Based Education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE's advocates mouth the mantra "self-esteem." Since the lack of
     self-esteem is postulated to be the cause of all social ills
     (crime, illegal drugs, teenage pregnancies, AIDS, and low SAT
     scores), OBE's primary goal is to inculcate self-esteem.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     There is no evidence that lack of self-esteem causes those
     problems, nor is there any evidence that having self-esteem
     causes students to score better in academic subjects. At best,
     teaching self-esteem is a waste of precious classroom time and,
     at worst, it's teaching the wrong lesson that it's okay to feel
     good about doing poorly in school.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Self-esteem should be the reward that comes from achievement and
     hard work. It should be earned. But lack of evidence doesn't slow
     down the self-esteem peddlers because this mantra advances their
     goal of eliminating all competition from the school experience.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Outcome-Based Education has been properly labelled a dumbing-down
     of public school education. But it's even worse than reducing the
     amount of knowledge covered and failing to teach essential skills
     such as reading.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    The combination of OBE and self-esteem eliminates competition as
     a learning mechanism. This destroys the students' incentive to be
     the best they can be, and it destroys the school's accountability
     because parents have no way to measure what their children are
     doing.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In an OBE school, the traditional A, B, C, D and F are replaced
     by letters that are meaningless in terms of specific academic
     achievement, such as S for Satisfactory (sometimes it just means
     Sometimes) or G for Growth. William Glasser's 1969 book "Schools
     Without Failure" led the charge against traditional grades.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Glasser also argued that giving homework is unfair and elitist
     because A and B students usually do their homework, whereas poor
     students don't, thus widening the gap between those who succeed
     and those who fail in school. He even opposed objective tests
     because they require students to give correct answers, in
     contrast to tests that ask questions for which there are no right
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The anti-competition movement is galloping across America.
     Schools are getting rid of their honor roll, honors courses,
     class rankings, academic prizes, and even valedictorians.
     Spelling bees are out. If fact, even correct spelling is out;
     it's replaced by inventive spelling (so students can spell words
     any way they want).
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Ability grouping, or tracking, is forbidden as elitist,
     undemocratic, or even racist. Pity the poor teacher who has to
     present a single course of study to eighth graders whose reading
     ability ranges from the second to the twelfth grades. This
     problem is getting worse with the mainstreaming of the learning
     disabled.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE does not allow any student to progress faster or farther than
     the slowest child in the class. This system conceals the fact
     that some children aren't learning much of anything.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     What is the teacher to do with the faster learners after they
     complete the assigned material? They are required to do peer
     tutoring (trying to tutor the slower pupils) or "horizontal
     enrichment." The former is a frustration for all students, and
     the latter is busywork.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Cooperative Learning, in which students receive a group grade, is
     another means of concealing who does the assignment accurately
     and who goofs off. The brighter students soon learn that their
     effort is not rewarded, and the slower students learn that
     there's no reason to try because someone will given them the
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The testing system has been corrupted. Not only do all students
     score "above average" (a marvel of statistical fakery), but many
     tests are peppered with questions that ask for non-objective
     responses about feelings, attitudes or predictions, or which have
     a built-in bias toward Political Correctness.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The response to the dramatic decline in SAT scores over the last
     two decades has resulted, not in toughening the curriculum, but
     in raising every student's score 100 points, so now students get
     perfect scores even if they have some wrong answers. This is one
     more way of concealing the distinction between average and
     above-average students.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Competition needs to be restored if schools are to prepare
     students for life. Children should learn early that life is
     competition, and the rewards go to those who work hard, persevere
     and achieve.

Phonics Boom
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It's many years overdue, but the scandal of widespread illiteracy
     has finally become a topic of general discussion and debate, from
     local newspapers to network TV news. Americans are at last being
     told the tragic fact that the public schools are failing to teach
     children how to read.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Our largest and trendiest state suddenly forced the facts of
     illiteracy into the national news stream. California came in last
     in national fourth-grade reading tests, set up a state task force
     to find out why, held legislative hearings, discovered that the
     state's Whole Language method is a disaster, and earmarked $100
     million for new textbooks and teacher training to switch the
     schools back to phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In order to receive their share of the money, schools will have
     to give students "systematic explicit phonics instruction, with
     phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relationships, and decoding."
     Governor Pete Wilson is even requiring that school districts
     spend their federal Goals 2000 money on reading instruction.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, was blunt. "Whole Language was an
     utter failure. Our curriculum taught to kindergarten to
     third-graders, quite frankly, stinks."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Whole Language system teaches children to guess at words by
     looking at the pictures on the page, to memorize a few dozen
     frequently used words, to skip over words they don't know, to
     substitute words that seem to fit, and to predict the words they
     think will come next. The child who is taught those bad habits,
     instead of how to sound out the syllables, will never be able to
     read big words or become a good reader.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many schools give high grades and happy report cards to children
     who are good at guessing and memorizing words, so parents don't
     realize that their children are being taught to guess instead of
     to read. Self-esteem is a higher priority than literacy.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A federal agency called the National Assessment of Educational
     Progress (NAEP) publishes what is called the Reading Report Card
     for the Nation and the States. Its recently released report on
     the 1994 test given to 140,000 students in grades 4, 8 and 12 in
     public and private schools proves that schoolchildren's reading
     skills are not only bad, but are getting worse.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Comparing 1992 and 1994, the NAEP results show a significant
     decline in the percentage of students scoring at or above the
     "proficient level" and at or above the "basic level," and a
     significant increase in the percentage of pupils performing below
     the "basic level." The NAEP tests also show a lack of any
     positive results from the expensive federal Title I program for
     the disadvantaged.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     How did it happen that the entire public school system abandoned
     phonics and substituted a guessing system? It's rather easy to
     date and track the Whole Language system from its official
     adoption by the state of California in 1987, because California
     is a model for other states that want to be "progressive."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     But Whole Language was not a new idea in 1987; it was just a new
     name for the system that was already in widespread use called
     "whole word" or "look-and-say." The mystery as to how that stupid
     system swept the country, starting in the late 1930s, was
     revealed in a report aired the first week of June on National
     Public Radio.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     "Look-and-say" came to dominate the schools as a result of a
     sophisticated marketing plan carried out by Scott Foresman, the
     publishers of the "Dick and Jane" series of elementary school
     readers. Scott Foresman sent slick salesmen to every school
     district to demonstrate how easily children could be taught to
     "read" the inane "See Dick run" stories that had color
     illustrations of Dick, Jane and Spot (the dog) doing whatever the
     one-syllable words described.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     By the 1950s, the Dick and Jane readers were, as Newsweek now
     tells us, "ubiquitous." Rudolf Flesch's 1955 landmark book, "Why
     Johnny Can't Read," fully exposed the fact that this system is a
     cheat on everyone.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The typical first-grader already knows the meaning of thousands
     of big words, such as hamburger, basketball, birthday,
     toothbrush, and even hippopotamus and Philadelphia. But the child
     will not be able to read those words unless he is taught the
     skill of sounding out the syllables. That's what we call phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    It is encouraging to see that California is making a massive
     attempt to abandon the failed Whole Language system and switch to
     the proven method of phonics. But changing the educational system
     today will be like trying to change the course of an aircraft
     carrier with a rowboat.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Parents who want to make sure that their children are not
     handicapped by the dumbed-down methods used in most public
     schools today should assume the task of teaching their own
     children how to read. It's easy to do if you use intensive,
     systematic phonics. I did it with my six children, and I urge all
     parents to do likewise.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Reject MFN For Communist China  -- 6/6/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>June 6, 1996</i><h2>                        
Reject MFN For Communist China
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bill Clinton's policy of cozying up to Communist China by
     granting Most Favored Nation (MFN) status is in shambles. The
     question of the moment is, will Bob Dole let Clinton dangle on
     the limb of his own mistake or save him from embarrassment by
     agreeing with this shameful policy?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It was all so inconvenient. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
     Firearms (otherwise known as BATF, the agency that played a fatal
     game of cops and robbers against Americans at Waco and Ruby
     Ridge) finally did something useful. They arrested Chinese
     Communist agents for smuggling 2,000 AK-47 automatic assault
     rifles into the United States.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Clinton Administration has such peculiar biases. The
     Administration engaged in hear-no-evil, see-no-evil as long as
     the Chinese Communists merely forced women to undergo late-term
     abortions, locked up citizens who dared to speak out for freedom,
     stole billions (not just millions) of dollars worth of U.S.
     intellectual property, thumbed their noses at signed trade
     agreements, and sold our weapons technology to rogue dictators.
     But when China violated our gun-control laws, that was just too
     much for the liberals!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The BATF arrest of seven persons in the San Francisco Bay area
     stopped a very profitable Chinese business of selling weapons at
     a 400 percent mark-up to U.S. big-city gangs that want to wipe
     out their rivals. It was a sophisticated worldwide operation that
     must have enjoyed the complicity of the Chinese government.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Those arrested have direct links to China's Defense Ministry and
     Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law. To conceal the source of the weapons,
     the money was laundered through Beijing's state-run bank in Hong
     Kong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In the 18-month U.S. sting operation, the Chinese discussed with
     our undercover agents the future sale of explosives, anti-tank
     rockets, and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft systems capable of
     knocking planes out of the sky. One Chinese boasted he could
     bring 300,000 AK-47s into the U.S.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Selling all kinds of weapons is big business for Communist China.
     It has sold missiles to Iran and nuclear reactor technology and
     materials to make enriched uranium to Pakistan.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China's expanding economy is financed by a $34 billion trade
     surplus with the United States that has cost Americans 700,000
     jobs. This trade surplus is partially based on stealing our
     products (computer software, video films, musical recordings,
     compact disks, other intellectual property, books, etc.) instead
     of buying them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Pirated CDs and CD-ROMs are made in China in an estimated 31
     government-licensed plants. China itself can use only about two
     percent of the CDs produced, so the rest go into the
     international market and cheat U.S. companies out of sales.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China signed an agreement to stop this theft in February 1995,
     but nothing has changed. China simply thumbs its nose at the
     whole concept of copyrights and trademarks.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China has made so much money from U.S. trade that it is now
     trying to buy SS-18 strategic missiles, components and technology
     from Russia or Ukraine. For those who've forgotten our worries of
     the Cold War, the SS-18s are the biggies that can reach the
     United States from a launch on the other side of the world.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China continues to persecute Tibet, use slave labor to produce
     goods for export, and show contempt toward any self-government
     for Hong Kong. China tried to threaten Taiwan's democratic
     election process by firing rockets at the island.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     U.S. big businesses, which want MFN because they lust after
     so-called "free trade" with China, should wake up and taste the
     chop suey that China served the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
     Douglas pursued China's aviation market with the passion and
     naivete of a teenage suitor, but ended up (in the word of one
     Douglas executive) being "betrayed."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Over a costly 15-year courtship, Douglas gave China 80 years of
     accumulated aircraft-manufacturing experience. That was the
     largest technology transfer in history. Douglas taught China how
     to build commercial planes, trained Chinese engineers, and even
     turned over powerful weapons-producing technology.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Like classic con men, Chinese officials schmoozed Douglas by
     dangling the prospect of multi-billion-dollar aircraft purchases.
     Then China turned around and gave its juicy contract to Europe's
     Airbus.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Hypocrisy about the demands for MFN status has reached new
     heights on both sides. In America, the internationalist claque
     that continually calls for "free trade" ignores the fact that
     China has slapped a 30 percent tariff on goods it imports from
     the United States. In China, the ruling clique threatens to
     "punish" U.S. companies if we dare to criticize the $2 billion
     piracy of our intellectual property.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It is ridiculous to allow Communist China to enjoy the same
     trading privileges with the United States markets that friendly
     countries have. Congress should reject Most Favored Nation status
     for Communist China, and Bob Dole should show leadership in
     calling for that rejection.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed  -- 5/30/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>May 30, 1996</i><h2>                        
Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed

</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The school establishment has suddenly discovered a bill that
     passed the House last year and is pending in the Senate which may
     interfere with plans to build files of personal information on
     public school pupils and their families. The Family Privacy
     Protection Act was noncontroversial when it sailed through the
     House by 417 to 7, but the school establishment has gone into
     panic and sounded phony alarms over a whole page of the May 19
     New York Times.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Designed to protect pupil and family privacy, the bill is
     straightforward in stating that schools may not, without prior
     written parental consent, ask minors to answer questionnaires
     about political affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological
     problems, sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or
     self-incriminating behavior, appraisals of other family members,
     or religious affiliations or beliefs.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     That's a reasonable rule because the schools have no business
     eliciting that kind of personal or family information from
     students. But in an era when schools assert their right, without
     parental knowledge or consent, to pass out condoms and to force
     little girls to undress and undergo intrusive genital
     examinations, it looks like the schools want to reject all
     accountability to parents.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The hysteria of the school establishment against this bill is
     encapsuled in the lead sentence in the New York Times news
     article: "Research into illegal drug use by American adolescents
     could be stifled by legislation pending in Congress." This is
     followed by quotations from several Ph.D.s ominously predicting
     that the bill "will leave us conducting the war on drugs largely
     in the dark."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     One of these Ph.D.s who is crying around about how the law would
     "cripple" his surveys of schoolchildren, said sarcastically, "We
     also couldn't find out whether they believe in God, which some
     people think is important." Pardon me, but I don't believe he
     should be allowed to ask public schoolchildren whether or not
     they believe in God. Where is the ACLU when we need it?
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires in the
     public school classroom started in the mid-1970s and resulted in
     the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment in
     1978, sponsored by former university president and Senator Sam
     Hayakawa. The public school establishment was powerful enough to
     prevent regulations from being written until President Ronald
     Reagan demanded them in 1984.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     National Education Association agents in the Department of
     Education and public school administrators nationwide circled the
     wagons against this law. Despite egregious violations, it has
     never been enforced.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which has
     been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th, 9th
     and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents were up in arms about
     it, not only because it was privacy-invading, but also because it
     assumed that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal
     tendencies are normal teenage behavior.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Another serious objection was that it encouraged pupils to inform
     on their parents. That sort of interrogation of children should
     not be tolerated in a free society. Here's a typical question:
     "Has drinking by any family member repeatedly caused family,
     health, job or legal problems? If yes, who? (Mark all that
     apply.) Parent who lives with me, Parent who doesn't live with
     me, Brother or sister, Other relative, Other person who lives
     with me." Here's another: "Has drug use by any family member
     repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems? If yes,
     who? (Mark all that apply.)" The same options are offered.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of teenagers
     are using illegal drugs. "If you use marijuana, how old were you
     when you started? If you use any other drug, how old were you
     when you started? How often do you get drunk?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions interrogated the child about his religion. "How
     often do you attend religious services?" "How important is
     religion in your life?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions would be downright traumatic for some children.
     "Have you ever tried to kill yourself?" "How often have you run
     away from home?" "Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that
     you wondered if anything was worthwhile?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the survey included lots of Peeping Tom sex questions.
     "Have you ever had sexual intercourse (gone all the way)? If you
     have sexual intercourse, how often do you and/or your partner use
     any birth control method? Have you been pregnant?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The public schools have no business requiring children to answer
     any of these nosy questions without prior written parental
     consent. To assert that restricting these surveys will hamper our
     "war on drugs" is ridiculous.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The purpose of the pending legislation is to extend the scope of
     the law to all surveys and questionnaires that are federally
     funded, not merely those funded by the Department of Education,
     and also to remove some vague language that has enabled the
     public schools to circumvent the law for the past ten years.
     Senators should say ho-hum to the hysteria of those who might be
     restrained from asking children about matters that are none of
     their business.

What's Going On With Bob Dole's Friends? 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Why are the so-called Republican moderates undermining Bob Dole's 
     presidential candidacy? Doesn't he have enough problems without 
     his friends planting mines on his road to the White House? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     First, Governors Christine Whitman and Pete Wilson gave cover to 
     Bill Clinton on his veto of the partial birth abortion ban, which 
     was overwhelmingly passed by Congress (with support from Bob 
     Dole) and was building to become a major Republican campaign 
     issue. When Whitman and Wilson said on national television that 
     they support Clinton's veto, they destroyed effective campaign 
     use of this issue by Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Whatever one thinks about the abortion issue, this support of 
     Clinton by two prominent Dole supporters was completely 
     unnecessary and grossly unhelpful to his campaign. Dole had just 
     honored Whitman by naming her one of the two temporary chairmen 
     of the Republican National Convention. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Secondly, we saw the incredible undermining of Bob Dole by his 
     longtime friend and fellow Kansan, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, as 
     well as the other moderates, Senators John Chafee, Slade Gorton, 
     Mark Hatfield, and even Kit Bond. What they did was to join the 
     Democrats on a motion (that passed 52-46) to remove Medical 
     Savings Accounts (MSAs) from Senator Dole's leadership amendment 
     to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     MSAs are not only sound policy and very popular, but they are 
     supported by Bob Dole. They help to define the difference between 
     the parties: Republicans support MSAs because they promote choice 
     in doctors and treatment, portability and affordability, while 
     the Democrats oppose them with dishonest class-warfare rhetoric. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Above and beyond the substance of the MSA argument, the Democrats 
     clearly recognized this vote as a crucial Clinton vs. Dole 
     political confrontation. Every single Democrat voted against MSAs 
     and Vice President Al Gore was rushed to the Senate Chamber in 
     case he was needed to break a tie vote. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The rejection of MSAs in the Senate bill was a rejection of Bob 
     Dole's leadership. When Dole has friends like this, he doesn't 
     need any enemies. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Third, Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed signaled his 
     willingness to accept a rewriting of the Republican Platform 
     plank on abortion. He gave talkative interviews that resulted in 
     front-page news stories in the New York Times for three days 
     running. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed may have been trying to help Bob Dole by putting the 
     Christian Coalition's imprimatur on a move long demanded by the 
     moderates, namely, the removal of or watering down of the pro- 
     life plank in the Republican Platform. But his contradictory 
     statements (such as denying that he is trying to rewrite the 
     platform language and the same week releasing a new book that 
     specifically presents new platform language) have the effect of 
     encouraging the pro-choicers to keep the political pot boiling in 
     the media and then push for a prime-time floor fight at the 
     Republican National Convention in San Diego. That is decidedly 
     not helpful to Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's proposed new platform language uses the word 
     "constitutional" in a slippery and deceptive way. Instead of 
     calling for constitutional protection for the unborn and/or 
     overturning Roe v. Wade, he suggests using "legal and 
     constitutional means to protect the right to life." Under this 
     language, all actions would have to be in conformity with Roe v. 
     Wade. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's new book, excerpted this week in Newsweek, also lectures 
     religious conservatives to "shun harsh language" in "Clinton- 
     bashing." That's strange advice in this presidential campaign in 
     which the Democrats are already conducting a no-holds-barred 
     media advertising campaign of Republican-bashing. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed is widely credited with clinching the nomination of Bob Dole 
     by using Christian Coalition troops to carry Iowa and 
     particularly South Carolina for Dole. But he's not helping Dole 
     now by fracturing the constituency that Dole desperately needs to 
     be elected. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Fourth, in a Sunday television appearance, one of Bob Dole's 
     closest associates, Senator Al D'Amato, aimed daggers at Newt 
     Gingrich and Pat Buchanan, accusing the former of setting the 
     wrong agenda for the 104th Congress and the latter of being a 
     "philosophical ayatollah." That is hardly the way to unite the 
     party and encourage broad-based support of Bob Dole, and an 
     experienced politician like D'Amato must know this. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Finally, Bill Kristol has weighed in with the argument that Bob 
     Dole can't win. That's one of the most hurtful slogans that can 
     be hung around the neck of any candidate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     What's going on? Why are the people who were once so determined 
     that Dole be the Republican presidential candidate now sniping at 
     him?

<h2>
The Reincarnation Of Clinton Care
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<p><BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the most obnoxious features of the Clinton health care
plan (which died the death of a thousand cuts in 1994) was its
creation of a long list of new federal "Health Care Crimes." 
It now appears that the Republicans, in their eagerness to
manifest their total capitulation to President Clinton, have
included an equally obnoxious crime section in their so-called
Health Reform bill (H.R.3160).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Somehow this section (Title II), which parallels the discredited
and (we thought) defunct Clinton bill, was passed by the House
without anybody discovering its far-reaching ramifications. 
Then, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), read the bill and
discovered that much of this health crime section was copied from
the Clinton bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AAPS is the organization whose lawsuit against Hillary Rodham
Clinton forced her to comply with federal law and make the
records of her Health Care Task Force public.  After two years of
litigation, Hillary's lawyers had to admit that they had lied to
the court in asserting that all members of the Task Force were
federal employees when, in fact, the Task Force included outside
special-interest groups with a direct financial interest in
passing the Clinton health care bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republican Health Reform bill (H.R. 3160) criminalizes what
are called "federal health care offenses."  The definition is
excruciatingly broad:  a violation or conspiracy that involves
"any public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce,
under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to
any individual."  "No proof of specific intent to defraud is
required."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill specifies monetary penalties of "up to $10,000 for each
instance" of "failure to comply with statutory obligations,"
for "incorrect coding," or for providing "a medical or other
item or service that a person knows or should know is not
medically necessary."  Big Brother will decide what health
services are "necessary."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new crime of "health care fraud" carries fines plus
imprisonment of up to ten years.  "If the violation results in
serious bodily injury," imprisonment can be up to 20 years, and
if death results it can be "for any term of years or for life."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A person who "intentionally misapplies" any assets of a health
care benefit program "shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; but if the value of
such property does not exceed the value of $100 the defendant
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one
year, or both."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Did you get that?  If you misapply a benefit that has a value of
less than $100, you can spend one year in prison and be fined,
too.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Whoever" makes a false statement to a health care plan is
liable to a five-year prison term.  "Whoever" can mean anybody,
patient or provider.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In any investigation relating to any act or activity involving
a Federal health care offense, . . . [the Attorney General] may
require the production of any records that may be relevant." 
The Republicans' passion to turn over more and more power to
Janet Reno (which started with the Anti-Terrorism bill) is a
curiosity to behold.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Failure to provide health information, "oral or recorded in any
form or medium," to a criminal investigator from any government
agency carries a five-year prison term.  Information extracted
under this provision can be used against the patient if "the
action or investigation arises out of and is directly related to
the receipt of health care or payment for health care.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill's exotic forfeiture provisions put health care offenses
on a par with racketeering and drug dealing, and are actually
broader than under the Clinton bill.  "The court, in imposing
sentence on a person convicted of a Federal health care offense,
shall order the person to forfeit property, real or personal,
that constitutes or is derived, directly or indirectly, from
gross proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill requires the Federal Government to "establish a
national health care fraud and abuse data collection program"
and specifies that "the information in this database shall be
available to Federal and State government agencies and health
plans" pursuant to any procedures set by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (that's Donna Shalala).  This will empower the
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal Government to use medical records to prosecute almost
anybody.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These provisions mean the end of patient privacy and
confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship.  Dr.
Orient asserts that they lay the foundation for forcing all
medical professionals to submit electronic information on every
medical encounter to a central computer, a practice that is
already required by a new Maryland law that takes effect this
July.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Maryland law will require all health care professionals to
disclose to the government the details of every patient
encounter, including diagnosis, test results, therapy, charges,
and 32 pieces of demographic data on every patient.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only Republican part of the Health Reform bill is the section
on Medical Savings Accounts.  The rest of it is ClintonCare.  So,
why are the Republicans fronting for Bill Clinton and Ted
Kennedy?

<h2> 
Books About What's Going On At Colleges 
</h2> 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Phyllis Schlafly 
</a> 
 
<P> 
Those who just learned about the dumbing down of our best colleges from the slashing  
report of the National Association of Scholars should do their homework by reading some  
of the excellent books written during the last several years.  Allan Bloom's "The Closing  
of the American Mind" was a trailblazer, but it was followed by several more informative  
books that failed to attract the attention they deserve. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Impostors in the Temple" (Simon & Schuster, 1992) is what Martin Anderson, a former  
Columbia University professor and now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, calls  
many of our nation's academic intellectuals -- that is, people who pretend to teach and  
pretend to do original, important work, but actually do neither.  He says that "the death of  
integrity in the heart of higher education is the root cause of the educational troubles  
which afflict us today." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. Anderson helps us to understand how it all happened at Stanford, one of the nation's  
most prestigious universities.  He describes how Stanford bilked the federal taxpayers out  
of millions of dollars and played a big role in the Political Correctness movement. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. George Roche, president of Hillsdale College, demonstrates in "The Fall of the Ivory  
Tower" (Regnery, 1994) how the easy availability of federal money channeled to colleges  
and universities has corrupted our entire educational system.  He sets forth chapter and  
verse of why and how this is so. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The flow of taxpayers' money has resulted in a large percentage of students being  
admitted to college who have no business being there at all because they are academically  
or emotionally unprepared.  The high rate of default on student loans is a national  
scandal. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One of America's most distinguished scholars, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,  
Thomas Sowell gives us a realistic look at the decline, the deception and the false dogmas  
of the U.S. educational system, which he charges is morally and intellectually bankrupt.   
In "Inside American Education" (Free Press, 1993), he exposes the ideological  
indoctrination and double standards about behavior and race practiced at the leading  
universities. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sowell says that they have presumed to be the conscience of society, while shamelessly  
exploiting college athletes, overcharging the government, organizing price-fixing cartels,  
and abandoning the teaching of undergraduates to student assistants while the tenured  
faculty pursue personal prestige. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Charles Sykes, author of "ProfScam:  Professors and the Demise of Higher Education"  
(St. Martin's Press, 1989), presents a devastating indictment of U.S. universities, which  
he calls vast citadels of waste, ruled with an iron hand by an oligarchy of arrogant,  
tenured professors who are overpaid and underworked. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes names specific universities, professors, dates and places, and asserts that a  
university education is a scam which cheats students, parents, and taxpayers.  He says the  
universities offer more and more courses of less and less importance, including a plethora  
of junk courses referred to by students as "guts" (slang for a course that can be passed  
with no more preparation than gut instinct). 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here are some examples he cites:  Anthropology of Play, Socio-Psychological Aspects of  
Clothing, Music Video 454, Sport and Political Ideology, Recreation and Leisure, Pocket  
Billiards, and Rock `n' Roll Is Here To Stay. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In his second book, "The Hollow Men -- Politics and Corruption in Higher Education"  
(Regnery Gateway, 1990), Charles Sykes explains the politicization of the college  
courses.  He tells how race, gender and class have been enshrined as the looking glasses  
through which all subject matter must be seen if one is to survive in academia. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes explains how colleges have gone overboard with institutionalized affirmative  
action, sensitivity training, and anti-free speech codes.  The second half of the book is  
devoted to a case study of Dartmouth College, which became a prime example of the  
intolerance of those who preach "diversity." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Tenured Radicals" (Harper & Row, 1990) is the expression Roger Kimball uses to  
discuss the radical politics of many in academia. His main focus is on the absurdity of  
what passes for scholarship on the campuses, and he describes the unintelligible jargon,  
or "ProfSpeak," which passes for erudition in the academic world. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Kimball explains the deconstructionist movement, which he calls a hoax perpetrated by  
academics in order to create more possibilities for papers, symposiums, specialized  
classes, and university teaching positions. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In "The Closing of the American Heart" (Probe Books, 1990),Ronald H. Nash describes  
how the decline of moral and religious standards over the past 25 years has contributed to  
the collapse of the nation's educational standards.  He charges that moral illiteracy is  
reflected and taught in academia through relativism, positivism, and humanism. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dinesh D'Souza, in "Illiberal Education:  The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus" (Free  
Press, 1991), explains Political Correctness (P.C.) on college campuses.  He shows how  
P.C. produces closed-mindedness and intolerance, which is to say an "illiberal  
education."  He explains how Political Correctness opposes the teaching of Western  
Civilization and demands that professors give their first attention to race and gender  
issues.

<title>The Social Consequences of Choice: Why It Matters Where Poor Children Go to School - Heritage</title>

<h3>THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF CHOICE: WHY IT MATTERS WHERE POOR CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL</h3>

Denis P. Doyle<br>
Senior Fellow in Education<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1088<br>
July 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress soon will be considering major legislation that would enable poor children to attend the schools of their choice. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) have introduced a comprehensive legislative initiative, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">H.R. 3467</a>).<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Title II, the Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would establish an education choice scholarship program that includes both private and religious schools in "renewal communities."  Each locality would determine the value of the scholarship for poor children, but the maximum value of the scholarship would not exceed the per capita cost of educating children in a local public school. The scholarships available to poor children would have a minimum value not less than 66 percent of the per capita cost of educating children in the local public schools or the tuition normally charged by the private school. Parents would not be forbidden from using scholarships to pay for tuition in religious schools, and local authorities would not be able to discriminate against parents or children who do so. The scholarship program would be supported from existing federal funds.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where their children go to school is a serious question for parents. President and Mrs. Clinton are willing to pay an annual tuition of more than $11,000 to send their daughter Chelsea to the exclusive Sidwell Friends School. Vice President and Mrs. Gore chose St. Albans School, a few blocks from Sidwell, for their son, as did D.C.'s Shadow Senator Jesse Jackson. The Clintons, like the Gores and many other parents among the nation's social and political elite, have made a conscious decision that the Washington, D.C., public schools, recently the subject of failed congressional reform efforts, are not good enough for their children. They also have decided that a school with religious affiliation is important.

While most Americans intuitively understand what is best for their children, public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose the school they prefer. Indeed, implicit in public policy is the assumption that where a child goes to school is unimportant. But the evidence is in: Where a child goes to school matters a good deal -- better a good school than a bad school.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More important, the empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority youngsters. Yet for more than a century, public policies in the United States have made it virtually impossible to provide public funds for children to attend private schools.<sup>3</sup>  In this regard, the United States stands virtually alone among the world's democracies.<sup>4</sup>  With enactment of the Watts-Talent bill, this dubious distinction would come to an end.
<p>
<b>THE CHANGING INTELLECTUAL CLIMATE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For many years -- in the 1960s and 1970s in particular -- a body of thought developed in this country which emphasized a child's "background" characteristics, which were assumed to be paramount. Success in school was the luck of the socioeconomic draw. It made little or no difference where children went to school, whether urban or rural, north or south, east or west, public or private; what was important was what they brought to school with them.<sup>5</sup>  If they were poor and dispossessed, they probably would do poorly. If they were poor and members of a minority group, they were almost certain to do poorly. By way of contrast, advantaged youngsters from enriched backgrounds did well. That was -- and is -- the argument. That it flies in the face of experience and common sense has done nothing to temper its enthusiastic reception among policymaking elites.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The modern incarnation of this general argument emerged from both the incomplete interpretation and the substantial misinterpretation of early work by James Coleman, a nationally prominent sociological researcher, then at Johns Hopkins.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In research conducted under the auspices of the U.S. Office of Education (predecessor to the U.S. Department of Education), Coleman and his colleagues initially found little in the way of school effects; factors like race, income, and parental level of education were stronger than school characteristics as predictors of school performance. What did seem to make a modest difference was who you went to school with; poor black youngsters appeared to do better in integrated settings. But as any competent policy analyst knows, absence of proof is not proof of absence. Because "school effects" were elusive or hard to find and measure did not mean they did not exist.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To the contrary, if "school effects" really were only weak (or worse yet, if they did not exist at all), the whole rationale of public education would come tumbling down. Indeed, so might that of private schooling. If nothing matters, there is no point in worrying about the right way to educate children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was, however, a widespread desire to believe a variation of such an unlikely interpretation. Among liberals who believed in vigorous, interventionist government, the lack of "school effects" was interpreted to mean that these effects were not sufficiently robust. What was needed was "more" impact: more money for schools. If race and socioeconomic status (or SES in the jargon of sociologists) were more powerful determinants of school performance than schools themselves, the schools must be weak. Other larger, even more ambitious government programs would be in order.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as geography was destiny in the 19th century, SES became destiny in the 20th. The ironies in this development were many. In liberal hands, it became an argument designed to bolster the theory that the only good school is a rich school (and a rich public one at that). At the same time, it became an argument that absolves the existing school of its obligations to its students. It "blames the victim."  The school is not at fault if students do not learn. Schools have little or no effect; it all depends on the raw material.<sup>7</sup>  This sentiment is nicely encapsulated in a song ("Gee, Officer Krupke!") from Leonard Bernstein's classic <I>West Side Story</I>: "Hey, I'm depraved on accounta I'm deprived."
<p>
<b>WHY SCHOOLS MATTER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such conventional liberal theory is bad pedagogy and worse public policy. Indeed, it fell to James Coleman, then a professor at the University of Chicago, to reopen the argument with extraordinarily powerful research that demonstrated the strong effect of Catholic schools, particularly on poor black children.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This research, widely reported in 1981 when it appeared in summary form in <I>The Public Interest</I>, is as valid today as it was then. Coleman also noted the embarrassing fact, still a stark feature of today's school choice debate, that "there are many who vigorously oppose making private school attendance easier and at the same time have their own children enrolled in private school."<sup>9</sup>  Coleman set out to answer three vital questions:
<p><ol>
<b><li></b> Do private schools provide better education?
<p>
<b><li></b> If they do, what is the public policy interest in denying poor children access to them?
<p>
<b><li></b> Is it true, as opponents of public funding allege, that private schools racially segregate children?
</ol> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first hurdle was methodological: how to distinguish "the effects of selection from the effects of the school itself" to control, "even to the extent of overcompensating," for selection into the schools. This he did. His academic findings are hardly surprising: "higher learning in the Catholic schools than in the public school."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The literature in this area is not restricted to Coleman's seminal work, as John Convey's 218-page <I>Catholic Schools Make a Difference</I> reveals.<sup>10</sup>  Convey reports that in a series of studies based on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data, Lee and Stewart "documented consistently higher scores of Catholic school students compared with public school students."  For example, the average Catholic school student in grades 4 and 8 scored significantly higher in reading and writing.<sup>11</sup>  In addition, Andrew Greeley's analysis of data from the High School and Beyond longitudinal study showed superior performance among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in Catholic school by every single category (Vocabulary, Reading, Math 1, Math 2, Science, and Writing), and Marks and Lee, writing in 1989, found higher scores in Catholic schools in grades 3, 7, and 11 among whites, blacks, and Hispanics in every single category for math, science, and reading.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most imposing studies, however, are those of Coleman and his colleagues. Catholic school sophomores, for example, scored 10 percent higher in science and 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading, and vocabulary. Catholic school seniors also consistently outscored public high school students: 10 percent to 17 percent higher in reading, mathematics, and vocabulary, and from 3 percent lower to 7 percent higher on three tests that measure ability more than achievement.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last finding strongly suggests that the explanation for higher scores lies not in some "ability" differential, but in what the schools do with what they have. Catholic schools expect much of their students, whatever their race and background, and expecting much, get much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Coleman found even higher scores in non-Catholic private schools, the more important sample is Catholic schools, which are the dominant force in the non-government school market. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman also was concerned with other issues, most notably the impact of choice on racial integration. Here the findings were equally unambiguous: A child is more likely to attend school with a child of another race in the private sector than in the public sector. The importance of this early finding would be hard to overstate; "suburban schools within the public sector are used as a haven to a much greater extent than in the private sector."  Counterbalancing "bright" flight to the suburbs is the behavior of students in Catholic school. Coleman's figures on dropouts are striking. Among white students in public school, 13.1 percent dropped out compared with 2.6 percent in Catholic schools; among Hispanic students, the difference was two to one (19.1 percent to 9.3 percent); and among black students, the difference was more than 3.5 to one (17.2 percent to 4.6 percent).<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Coleman's first finding concerning school effects should have been received with rejoicing by the professional educators who had endured their share of bad press. Their magazines and journals should have featured articles on why schools make a difference. So also should the nation's civil rights leadership have reacted positively to Coleman's finding about racial integration in the private sector. Indeed, the refusal of the U.S. Supreme Court to establish "metropolitan" remedies for past cases of racial discrimination makes the Coleman finding all the more important, because private school attendance is almost never geographically based. Private schools, already better integrated than public schools, offer more fertile fields for expanded racial integration over time than do the public schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Such reactions, however, were rare, and the reason is not hard to fathom. Had Professor Coleman's rigorous social science work revealed stronger public than private school effects, there would have been joy in the great halls of the education establishment.<sup>15</sup>  But because one of the bastions of "good schooling" is the private sector,<sup>16</sup> public school educators could not -- would not -- accept his findings. Coleman, on the other hand, did no such disservice to the authorities who run the public schools. He followed the evidence where it led and found that all schools that exhibit similar characteristics have strong school effects. All schools, whether public or private, that exhibit the same cluster of attributes -- high expectations, a focused curriculum, good order and discipline, caring teachers, enterprising students -- have relatively robust "school effects."  What is important is that these characteristics are found more readily and more often in private schools.
<p>
<b>THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to his school effects work, Professor Coleman returned to the questions that had intrigued him originally: Even if some schools are better than others, what difference does what the student brings to school make?<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What are the cultural and social traits that make a difference?  The potential for synergy is obvious, as are the public policy implications.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Social capital" is the cluster of skills, attitudes, and (to a lesser extent) knowledge that the student acquires in the non-school environment. Clearly, a child who is disruptive and unruly and who has only weakly developed academic interests is less likely to do well in any school, "good" or "bad," while youngsters who bring with them a love of learning, disciplined and orderly habits, and respect for themselves and other students, as well as for the teacher, are much more likely to do well, all other things being equal. These traits -- what might be called pro-academic traits -- are the product of caring and supportive communities, voluntarily created and maintained. Though they may include people who look alike, in the final analysis they are not defined by race, socioeconomic status, or ethnicity; they bridge all those gaps. They are associative communities made up of superficially similar or different people who share common values and virtues. In a school setting, to use a quaint term, they are "communities of scholarship."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Members of Congress and state and local legislators alike should recognize the public policy implications of "social capital."  The most important single thing they can do in this regard is to encourage its formation and continuance by underwriting education choice. Not only does choice permit the expression of "social capital;" it builds and reinforces the habits of mind that are essential to voluntary association -- the same habits of mind that are essential to civil society. In a school setting, choice imposes the burden of choosing; there is no escape. One must make one's bed and lie in it; no one else does it for you. School choice proposals, including the school choice component of the Watts-Talent legislation, foster democratic habits of mind that are essential to a free society.
<p>

<b>THE HIGH STAKES IN SCHOOLS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The reasons for the high quality of private schools are several and have to do largely with organization, incentives, and rewards. Most simply, voluntary association makes a difference. In the public sector, the organizational climate conspires against dedicated teachers and hard-working students; in the private sector, it encourages and rewards high levels of performance. In short, monopolies are no better in the public sector than in the private sector. They serve only the interests of the "owners," never the interests of workers or clients.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the public sector, of course, the "owners" do not literally own the schools. Rather, they are managers and bureaucrats, and the schools are run for them, not for teachers and students. This rather unappealing picture is not restricted to the public sector; managerial capitalism also looks a good deal like this, which is why it is under fire from liberal and conservative critics alike. The Watts-Talent legislation would permit parents of poor children to "own" their own schools instead of having to submit to the bureaucracy that runs government schools.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's policymakers seem willing to tolerate failures and weaknesses in education that they would not tolerate in any other area of public policy. Coleman's findings are so powerful that were he dealing with any other area of public policy -- health, welfare, housing, transportation, or juvenile justice -- shifts in public policy would begin to reflect the new knowledge he contributed. But public schooling is a nearly immovable object; public schools are run for the convenience of, and at the pleasure of, their managers, not for the benefit of students and their families.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	When they debate the issue of school choice, Members of Congress should consider the "school effects" literature in terms of academic outcomes; its conclusions are wholly unsurprising. In light of their "environment," one would expect private schools to "do better."  They must if they are to survive. All parents who enroll their children in private school go through at least a two-step process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>First</b>, they must decide to enroll their children in a non-government school and find the financial wherewithal to deliver on this decision. Almost without exception, this involves the payment of substantial tuition and fees out of pocket. Indeed, because people value what they pay for, "full-ride" scholarships are almost unknown in private elementary and secondary education. Even -- perhaps particularly -- schools like Father Clemens's Our Lady of Angels in Chicago charge at least a modest tuition.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Second</b>, the financial commitment families make to send their children to private school is a proxy for a personal commitment to education, the importance of which is hard to overestimate. It makes schools and their families partners in a way that the a public sector monopoly can never hope to achieve.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Probably the most important "school effects" issue is not the measured academic "outcomes" of schooling, but the school's impact in the market. In a market, a school must "sell" and parents must "buy."  That is the market<I>par excellence</I>. Goods and services that do not sell have no effect; indeed, they do not stay in the market. Only monopolists -- particularly government monopolists -- stay in markets when no rational consumer wants their product or service. Poor children, for all practical purposes, today have no options.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This issue came to a head this year when Congress considered school choice as part of the Washington, D.C., FY 1996 appropriations bill. Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) offered an amendment that would have given scholarships of up to $3,000 for students whose family incomes were at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for students whose family incomes were not more than 185 percent above the poverty level. The Senate, however, when presented with this opportunity to expand choice for children in Washington's failing public school system, refused to do so. Only four members of the Senate had sent their children to D.C.'s public schools.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The obvious assumption, of course, is that D.C.'s public school system is tolerable for poor children but not a serious option for members of the United States Senate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On the wisdom of these official restrictions, let the late Professor James Coleman answer the critics. His is an eloquent summation of the case for justice and dignity:
<p><blockquote>
	There may be a rationale for some protective barriers to encourage participation in the public schools, but certainly not those that exist now, which harm most the interests of those least well-off and protect most those public schools that are the worst. In short, the tuition barrier to private schooling as it exists now is almost certainly harmful to the public interest, and especially harmful to the interests of those least well-off.<sup>20</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Members of Congress consider the Watts-Talent school choice provisions, they have another chance to do the right thing.

<li>    The most important work in this field is that of the late sociologist James Coleman. A researcher of towering intellect and erudition who also was devoid of ideological predisposition, Coleman followed the data wherever they led, often at the cost of personal peace of mind. He was vilified by the American Sociological Association for taking the politically incorrect position that public support of private schooling was a defensible public policy option (although, to its credit, the ASA retracted its condemnation to award him a medal shortly before his death). Coleman never wavered in his quiet and determined defense of the truth as he understood it. While his prose style and the heavy quantitative emphasis of his major works are a bit daunting for the generalist, his articles are clear, concise, and lively. A perfect example -- as current today as when it was published -- is "Public Schools, Private Schools, and the Public Interest," <I>The Public Interest</I>, No. 64 (Summer 1981). Father Andrew M. Greeley's work is on point as well. In particular, see <I>Catholic High Schools and Minority Students</I> (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1982).<p>
<li>    In particular, see "Foreword," in Thomas Vitullo-Martin and Bruce S. Cooper, <I>Separation of Church and Child: The Constitution and Federal Aid to Religious Schools</I> (Indianapolis, Ind.: Hudson Institute, 1987).<p>
<li>       See Charles L. Glenn, <I>Choice of Schools in Six Nations</I> (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, 1989), and <I>Educational Freedom in Eastern Europe</I> (Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute, 1995). Glenn, one of the nation's leading authorities on public funding for attendance at private schools, for 21 years was the Massachusetts State Department of Education official responsible for civil rights and urban education opportunity. Recognizing the failure of busing, Glenn pioneered education choice programs.<p>
<li>   One long-standing trend, the concentration of high test scores in the Northern tier of states from Maine to Montana, led Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) to propose facetiously the following policy remedy to states concerned about low test scores: Move your state north.<p>
<li>    Coleman's first major study which permitted a systematic examination of this and related questions was prepared under the terms of a major grant from the U.S. Office of Education, part of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). Titled <I>Equality of Educational Opportunity</I>, it was released in 1966 and caused an immediate sensation. Coleman and his colleagues could find no school effects of consequence; indeed, any school effect seemed to be overwhelmed by student background characteristics. Policymakers were led in two different directions by this surprising "non-finding."  Many analysts concluded that school effects were minimal (at least from a public policy standpoint; they still put their own children in "good" schools). Needless to say, their public policy conclusion was a counsel of despair; after all, the whole American experiment in self-governance was based on the Founders' conviction that an educated citizenry is essential to democracy. The other direction, equally misleading, fueled the notion that black children could learn only if they were integrated with white children. While racial integration is a laudable objective, it is patronizing in the extreme to argue that black children must be integrated to learn. More to the point is the quality of facilities, books, teacher preparation, and the like.<p>

<li>    Although most Americans are convinced that private schools are simply better than public schools, this is not an altogether implausible proposition. It was true in Australia, leading the Australian Labour Party (similar to the Democratic Party in the United States) to support public aid to private schools. Sparked by the work of Father James Carroll, who later became Bishop of Sydney, public funding was made available on the basis of the following argument: Catholic schools are inferior (by almost any academic or fiscal measure) and will remain so unless public funding is provided; Catholics (and non-Catholics who attend these schools) will not abandon their schools; and no good public end is served by denying poor Australian children a quality education in the schools in which they chose to enroll. For more on this interesting situation, see Denis P. Doyle, "Family Choice in Education: The Case of Denmark, Holland and Australia," in <I>Private Schools and Public Policy: International Perspectives</I>, ed. William Lowe Boyd and James G. Cibulka (New York, N.Y.: Falmer Press, 1989), and "Why Congress Should Give Poor Children Choice of Religious Schools," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</i>, forthcoming.<p>

<li>  
 Not to put too fine a point on it, but private schools are a red flag to the public school bull. The intensity of the hostility most public school leaders feel for private schools is understood more easily in psychological terms than in logical terms. Private schools, for example, are accused of being "elitist," a sin as serious as racism or sexism in the modern pantheon of bad attitudes. But the facts, as Coleman and others have revealed, are otherwise. For a longer disquisition on this general subject, see "A Din of Inequity?  Private Schools Reconsidered," <I>Teachers College Record</I>, Vol. 82, No. 4 (Summer 198l).<p>

<li>   An example of more than passing importance, Father Clemens's school operates on an extended day and year, is in the middle of the ghetto, has a waiting list, accepts only children from families on welfare, and still charges tuition. His reasoning?  If they can afford a phone, a TV, sneakers, and Bulls jackets, they can scrape together some tuition. Moreover, all families are expected to give time to school projects -- not just the PTA, but painting and fix-up activities as well. Finally, families that really cannot afford any tuition are allowed to "work off" the obligation: Families that pay something are families that take school seriously.<p>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"We're not report takers. We're the police."<sup>2</sup>  This bold message greets visitors to the New York City Police Department's crime strategy center, where for three hours, twice a week, the city's 76 precinct commanders gather to report their challenges and successes. And during William J. Bratton's brief tenure as Commissioner of Police, the department achieved some stunning successes: since 1993, a 36 percent drop in serious crimes, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45 percent drop in murder.<sup>3</sup>  Bratton's winning strategy: Hammer home his aggressive, crime-fighting, morale-building message to his troops while demanding (and getting) measurable results in combating crime and disorder from his commanders in the field.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime. As a result of New York City's success, "Mayors, police chiefs, and scholars from San Diego to Singapore to Saudi Arabia come crowding into the NYPD's meeting room to learn first hand how this new technique works," says George L. Kelling, professor of criminology at Northeastern University.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, many other innovative local officials are enjoying successes similar to New York City's. "Police can reduce crime now, within constraints. They needn't wait for new cars or computers, more cops, bigger budget or more overtime," says Professor Kelling.<sup>5</sup>  More than anything else, local police need solid personnel management and a clear mission to combat crime and disorder, with serious backup from the public, the politicians, and the press. Bratton's stunning success in New York City is largely attributable to his progressive vision of what the police can do to control crime.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident. They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing. Among the lessons and actions taken:<ul>
<p><li>
<b>Police should target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> Successful police departments focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place. Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. They also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime.
<p><li>
<b>Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> While Americans want the best police protection, too many metropolitan areas around the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical, and character standards within the police force. Failure to maintain standards leads to a loss of ,lan among police officers themselves. Poor personnel practices result in bad, brutal, or incompetent police officers and a lowering of public confidence.
<p><li>
<b>Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies. These managerial and political decisions compromise the integrity and effectiveness of local law enforcement.

Local officials can learn from the experience of the growing number of cities and localities that have strengthened their police forces through their own efforts. These localities have improved personnel management, including direct accountability for police performance, while also employing the most effective strategies and the most sophisticated technical and information systems to track, prevent, and combat violent crime. Without waiting for official Washington, local officials can take decisive steps to improve their own police departments. These steps include<ul>

<p><li><b>Upgrading</b> recruitment and training standards;

<p><li><b>Aggressively recruiting</b> police officers from the ranks of the military (which would expand the number of well-qualified black and minority applicants);

<p><li><b>Improving</b> the techniques used to detect and prevent crime;

<p><li><b>Targeting</b> the small number of criminals responsible for most of the serious crime;

<p><li><b>Focusing</b> on urban "hot spots" where crime flourishes;

<p><li><b>Making</b> salaries commensurate with responsibilities and performance;

<p><li><b>Privatizing</b> and civilianizing non-police administrative functions;

<p><li><b>Promoting</b> community policing; and

<p><li><b>Demanding</b> direct accountability of police commanders in the field.

<b>Support from the State and Courts</b><P>

Even with excellent police work, violent criminals typically serve only a portion of their sentences, often as little as one-third.<sup>6</sup>  The tireless work of police officers and detectives often seems to be in vain, as repeat violent offenders are released from prison after spending minimal time behind bars. To back up the police, legislatures and courts must act to keep violent criminals and other perpetrators of serious crimes off the streets. Among the remedial measures needed are the reform of parole and probation systems and the adoption of truth in sentencing laws to make sure that violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.<sup>7</sup>  Police officers have a personal interest in such policies: Between 1988 and 1992, 20 percent of all persons arrested for killing law enforcement officers were on probation or parole at the time of the offense.<sup>8</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress also can support America's local police, but not in the ways that often characterize action in Washington. In response to the continuing escalation of violent crime, the 103rd Congress, with the support of President Clinton, enacted the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. The promise: 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets.<sup>9</sup>  But thus far, the program has meant little more than 17,000 additional police on the streets. Worse, the Administration's funding allocation does not target localities hardest hit by violent crime, and many local governments are finding it difficult to bear the required financial burden of the matching formula.<sup>10</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress could be far more helpful by:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Providing more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> This would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL).

<p><li><b>Reforming criminal procedure.</b> This means such things as enacting reform of the so-called exclusionary rule, which passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, to allow a good faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations. Hearings on the impact of the <I>Miranda</I> rule governing the taking of statements from suspects doubtless would prove enlightening and might build support for reasonable changes. In exercising their confirmation responsibilities with regard to the appointment of federal judges, Senators also could and should block the appointment of any candidate with a record of demonstrated insensitivity to public safety. Congress recently achieved a long-overdue reform by putting a stop to the judicial imposition of prison caps on state and local prisons. These court-imposed caps have been putting violent felons back on America's streets.<sup>11</sup>  Police officers and crime victims alike have been frustrated and demoralized by such liberal judicial policies. 

<p><li><b>Improving the social environment by replacing failed federal urban policies with a new neighborhood empowerment strategy.</b> Inner-city communities can be renewed through genuine enterprise zones. Scholarships and vouchers can help poor children escape crime-ridden schools and attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that respect parental responsibility, reinforce the moral teachings of their parents, and promote civilized conduct. Federal policies can encourage effective neighborhood social service agencies, including faith-based drug treatment and counseling activities, to improve the social climate. Strong community-based organizations, working closely with the police, also can help prevent crime. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) are sponsoring comprehensive legislation, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467), to accomplish these goals.<sup>12</sup>

<b>BACK TO BASICS: WHY PUBLIC OFFICIALS NEED TO RETHINK THE ROLE OF THE POLICE</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local police are invested with awesome public authority, yet they often lack the public respect or official understanding that their specific duties should command.<sup>13</sup>  They are expected to make instantaneous and complex decisions, to put themselves in danger, and to act calmly in the most terrifying circumstances, yet they are often underpaid and lack the status of other public officials in much less demanding occupations. Many police officers find this combination of demands and pressures demoralizing.14 <P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The inherent problem of police work is that the law often specifies what the police officer cannot do; it does not tell him what he should do.<sup>15</sup>  In virtually every public or private institution, the discretion available to a person is directly proportional to his rise in the hierarchy. Those at the top have the most discretion, while those at the bottom have the least. But discretion in the exercise of police authority increases as one goes <I>down</I> the hierarchy.<sup>16</sup>  Whether working alone or with a partner, the police officer usually is not subject to any immediate supervision, and his judgments under pressure are subjected to constant analysis and second-guessing by the public and the courts.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As former New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy has noted, the ideal police officer is in tune with the community and able to spot a likely problem before the fact, not just respond after the fact to something that already has become a local tragedy.<sup>17</sup>  Ideally, under circumstances less threatening than a life-or-death situation, a police officer functions best as a "streetcorner politician," peacefully settling disputes and using his social skills to assuage potential combatants and maintain order.<sup>18</sup>  Thus, the special challenge for local officials is to make sure that the recruit is a person of "quiet confidence" who can take control of a situation without identifying criminal resistance to established public authority as some sort of personal slight.<sup>19</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This constant need to exercise prudential judgment illuminates yet another paradox of police work. Police management is likely to give a cop "credit" for an arrest, and yet the resort to an arrest may very well represent a genuine failure to keep order. If a neighborhood dispute is resolved carefully, the police intervention is an unrecorded success.<sup>20</sup>  But if the officer fails to defuse the situation, and there is a crime leading to an arrest and prosecution, the cop who lets the situation deteriorate gets "credit" for the arrest.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For state and local officials, the heart of police reform is personnel management.<sup>21</sup>  The higher educational achievements of officers recruited during the 1940s contributed to the "professionalization" of the police from the 1950s on, and generally produced tougher standards in recruiting urban police officers. In New York City, for example, standardized tests, including IQ tests, were common during the 1950s and 1960s, and the performance of recruits in the Police Academy invariably was above the average for the population generally. As Arthur Niederhoff, a veteran officer and authority on the New York City Police Department, has reported, any recruit with an IQ below the normal range had only a small chance of being recruited either by the NYPD or by other major police departments.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1950s and 1960s, the New York City Police Department also undertook rigorous background investigations into the character, reputation, and medical and psychological histories of recruits. Approximately 50 percent of the applicants who passed the examinations eventually were eliminated.<sup>23</sup>  The rule was simple: Any doubt concerning an applicant's fitness for appointment was to be resolved in "favor of the department."<sup>24</sup>  The rules governing retention on the force were likewise rigorous: Officers were expected to refrain from any behavior (including immoral personal behavior) "that would tend to bring adverse criticism of the department."<sup>25</sup>  During the 1950s and early 1960s, the rate of acceptance in the NYPD was only 15 percent.<sup>26</sup>  In Tucson, Arizona, the acceptance rate during the same period was 6 percent; and in Los Angeles, California, the acceptance rate from 1950-1962 was only 4 percent.<sup>27</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With the recent trend in many cities back to community policing, the job requirements are likely to be even stiffer. One recent study of the competencies essential in "a community policing environment" concludes that "skills in effective verbal communication, listening and demonstration of empathy or understanding in a multicultural society are extremely essential. The ability to identify problems, make commitments, understand the reality of the police impact on crime, analyze situations, demonstrate persistence, employ situational strategies, and recognize solutions to problems are also extremely essential competencies."<sup>28</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In recent years, the working conditions for patrol officers have become tougher. As police departments have become more specialized and bureaucratic, officers have been moved from the street to staff jobs even as crime rates and the workload of patrol officers have increased. The result: "Odd hours, overtime, and off-duty court appearances, not to mention the most dangerous job in the organization, [have made] patrol work the least desirable policing assignment. Ironically, like the classroom teacher and the ward nurse, it is the lowest paid and least respected part of the operation."<sup>29</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials should be aware that demoralization is a serious and recurrent occupational hazard among police officers. In urban areas, the social and economic elites have largely abandoned the central cities, and inner-city communities themselves are often crime-ridden. Big-city police often feel they are fighting a losing battle against overwhelming odds. Far too many of the persons they arrest for violent crimes are out on probation, parole, or pre-trial release.

<p>
<b>Undercut by Lawyers and Judges</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Police also are frustrated with lenient judges and frequent plea bargaining arrangements. In 1993, for example, 90 percent of the 200,000 felony convictions in the United States were plea bargained.<sup>30</sup>  In one survey, 60 percent of police officers felt that criminal plea bargaining was "unfair to the arresting officer."<sup>31</sup>  Such frustration and cynicism, compounded by poor personnel management, fuel police demoralization. They also contribute to what is known as "the cop culture," the fraternal secrecy and mutual self-defense network thrown up to protect good and bad cops alike. Not surprisingly, studies also indicate that the suicide rate among police officers is more than twice that of the general population.<sup>32</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Americans strongly support putting more police on the streets.<sup>33</sup>  The popular assumption is that increasing the number of police will decrease crime rates, but the quantity of police does not make up for poor management of police or poor working conditions. In 1992, for instance, Washington, D.C.'s homicide rate was six times higher, and its overall serious crime rate two times higher, than San Diego's. Yet Washington had five times as many police officers per capita as San Diego. Moreover, in 1989, when Washington increased its overall police force by 19 percent under congressional mandate, serious violent crime actually rose by 15 percent, and homicide jumped 9 percent over a period of one year.<sup>34</sup>  Between 1952 and 1978, total police personnel in the United States rose from 254,000 to 689,000, an increase of 171 percent; between 1957 and 1978, incidents of reported crime rose from 1,422,000 to 11,141,3000, an increase of 657 percent.<sup>35</sup>  Overall, "More than a dozen major empirical studies over the last two decades have failed to demonstrate either that police manpower and crime rates vary inversely or that particular types of community-oriented policing practices prevent crime."<sup>36</sup>  Declares Dr. Gregory Berg, a veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, "We know that the number of police on the street and police methods in general have little effect on crime rates."<sup>37</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Fortunately, imaginative public policy is running ahead of public policy research. In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing. With the evolution of modern information systems and the application of improved strategic thinking on the part of police managers, much more fruitful research is possible.<sup>38</sup> Local officials can adopt strong empirical measures of police performance. But success rests ultimately on the intangibles: Courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community.

<p>
<b>COMPETENCE AND CONFIDENCE: KEEPING LAW AND ORDER</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Approximately 80 percent of the urban police officer's job is "restoring order."<sup>39</sup>  In practice, this means coping with such relatively minor things as drunken and disorderly conduct, loud noise in the neighborhood, fights and scuffles, or bar-room brawls. It is also the main interest of the public: "In focus groups, community meetings and surveys, citizens regularly report the biggest safety concerns to be things like panhandling, obstreperous youth taking over parks or street corners, public drinking, prostitution and other disorderly behavior. Such concerns cross class, race, and ethnic boundaries, and occur in all areas of the country."<sup>40</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In any given circumstance, restoring order involves intervening and settling a "dispute" about what is "right" or "seemly."<sup>41</sup>  Thus, the situation is governed not only by law, but by the social circumstances and prevailing "subculture" of the neighborhood or community. Indeed, custom is often more important than law in "street situations."<sup>42</sup>  While these incidents may appear to be minor, they can be dangerous, for they often involve personal "honor and dishonor."  Despite its importance to the public, police are often "defensive" in keeping order. They recognize that they are dealing, at least initially, with minor offenses or " misdemeanors" which are unlikely to result in jail or even significant fines. This means that the entire process of arrest, booking, and preliminary hearings is, in most instances, a waste of limited and valuable time; "[t]he most important consequence of this state of affairs is that with respect to routine police matters, the normal tendency of the police is to underenforce the law."<sup>43</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The best guide to making an arrest in such cases is the police officer's own experience and judgment, combined with a strong working knowledge of the law. A notorious neighborhood troublemaker, well-known to the police, for example, invariably is a good candidate for arrest and is worth the personal investment in the time and paperwork the arrest entails. Nevertheless, the police officer knows that very few of his arrests are likely to result in prosecution; for every 56 persons arrested by the police, only 1 goes to prison.<sup>44</sup>  Most of those arrested are released within 12 hours.<sup>45</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nowhere is deciding whether to arrest a suspect more difficult than in cases of domestic violence. In 1984, for example, a controlled experiment in Minneapolis found that male batterers arrested by the police were largely deterred by these arrests which were "more effective" than "peacekeeping strategies."<sup>46</sup>  Further analysis revealed, however, that while this strategy worked if the male batterer was employed, the arrest of batterers who were unemployed led to increased violence toward their partners.<sup>47</sup>  State and local officials must be mindful of the trade-off between arrest and police presence on the street, especially in view of the fact that "[t]he deterrent effects of an arrest and of patrol presence on the streets have never been compared."<sup>48</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The effectiveness of the police in maintaining order and quelling disorder has a broad impact on the prevention or reduction of more serious crime. "For decades," however, "most big city police departments have devoted little effort to combatting disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions."<sup>49</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Disorder is highest in neighborhoods characterized not only by loss of economic vitality, but also by social instability: broken families, fatherless children, and physically and sexually abusive criminal adults, the ultimate source of crime.<sup>50</sup>  Broken windows, graffiti, drunken and disorderly conduct, prostitution, and the like all say to the small criminal population responsible for most serious urban crime that members of the community are indifferent to the conditions around them and do not care enough to call the police to stop the disorder in their midst.<sup>51</sup>  These disordered territories become "hot spots," geographical areas open to illegal business and more serious crime such as the sale of crack cocaine, which is strongly associated with rises in violent crime. Moreover, most violent crime is the deadly work of a criminal class comprised largely of males aged 15 to 24 from broken families, with low cognitive abilities (particularly low verbal skills) and a history of anti-social behavior and multiple arrests: "The 5 to 7 percent of the population falling into the category of habitual offenders is responsible for no less than half of all arrests or police contacts."  <sup>52</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This spatial concentration has profound implications for effective urban policing: "Spreading more police out across a big city and lowering response time, the research shows, will have little effect on crime -- no matter what neighborhood groups think. But more police attacking the risk factors for crime -- like guns on the street in 'hot spots' street corners -- could make a substantial difference in crime."<sup>53</sup>  This is especially true of gun crime. Of the approximately 200 million guns in the United States, one-third are handguns; and about 2 percent of these handguns are used to commit crimes.<sup>54</sup>  Therefore, "Concentration of police crime prevention in places with the highest gun crime may be the most effective way to protect everyone, not just residents of the high crime locations."<sup>55</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton made the concerted attack on neighborhood disorder a top priority, combining modern management techniques with an older tradition of policing based on a perceived relationship between neighborhood disorder and serious crime. Bratton's "Police Strategy No. 5," for example, declares that "By working systematically and assertively to reduce the level of disorder in the City, the NYPD will act to undercut the ground on which more serious crimes seem possible and even permissible"<sup>56</sup> This neighborhood-based strategy involves an all-out attack on the components of neighborhood disorder, including prostitution, liquor sales to minors, and violations of noise ordinances, as well as felonies. Violators are cited, and persistent violators are arrested; moreover, these arrests are accompanied by probing police interrogations by officers looking for leads to more serious criminal activities, especially gun-related crimes. When Commissioner Bratton headed the New York City Transit Police, his aggressive methods re-established order on New York's subway systems, long a notorious crime "hot spot;" felonies in that system declined 75 percent in four years.<sup>57</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bratton's success in New York City is mirrored to a lesser extent in other metropolitan areas in which police have combined this aggressive neighborhood-based strategy with innovative community policing techniques. Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Sarasota, Florida, for example, are bringing police officers and their families back into troubled neighborhoods through low-interest home loans. Not only do the police live where they work, but the program also sends a positive message to law-abiding residents in these neighborhoods that the police are there to protect them. Chief Charles Austin of Columbia, South Carolina, says that the city's home loan program has contributed to a 16 percent decrease in crime.<sup>58</sup>  Similarly innovative community police programs can be found in cities throughout the United States, including Lowell, Massachusetts; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Indianapolis, Indiana; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and San Diego, California. 
<P>


<b>Enforcing the Law</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
For the officer on the street, enforcing the law or stopping the commission of a serious crime is more clear-cut than settling a dispute over what constitutes "disorderly" behavior. In practice, however, it is difficult to combat serious crime either by preventing it or by arresting the perpetrator after the fact. Police responding immediately to a case make an arrest in only 2.9 percent of all calls involving serious crimes.<sup>59</sup>  Only 25 percent of all calls to the police in cases of serious crime involve actual contact between the victim and the offender; 75 percent of all serious crimes are reported after the fact.<sup>60</sup>  And, as noted previously, almost half of America's violent crime is never even reported to the police.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the initial report is taken, the task of resolving serious crimes usually is reserved to the detectives, whose work requires the ability to ask the right questions, a sound capacity for deductive reasoning, and a keen sense of human nature. In most major metropolitan departments, regardless of the social changes that have taken place over many years, detectives are viewed as the professional elite of the police force.<sup>61</sup>  On the face of it, their work is daunting. They must identify, locate, and arrest the suspect and then prepare a careful report of the criminal investigation, replete with all the pertinent facts of the case. This is the crucial body of information to be used by the prosecution both in determining the charge and ultimately in proving its case in court. The detective must prepare for his own testimony and cross examination as a key state witness at the preliminary hearing and at the trial itself, seeing the case through to its ultimate resolution.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since the 1960s, this job has been complicated by a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that, in effect, have federalized state criminal procedure, including the rules of evidence, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and the original intent of the Framers. For example, in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> (1961), the Court mandated the exclusion of evidence in cases involving even the most technical violation of the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment. In <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> (1966), the Court held that a person held as a suspect in a criminal case must be informed of his right to remain silent and to have his lawyer with him during the interrogation.<sup>62</sup>  Again, the penalty for even a minor police mistake was exclusion of any statement made by the suspect. <I>Miranda</I> in particular was met with a storm of protest from local police officials, who argued that it would handcuff their investigative work. Congress responded by enacting a provision in the Crime Control Act of 1968 which allowed a judge, after looking at the totality of circumstances surrounding a confession in a federal case and finding that the confession was given to the law enforcement officers voluntarily, to admit the evidence even though not all of the procedural requirements specified in <I>Miranda</I> had been met. This provision has been all but unused by the U.S. Department of Justice.<sup>63</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given this situation, the detective obviously must be sensitive to the fine points of criminal procedure, since defense attorneys may be expected to seize upon the slightest error. Rigorous selection and training of detectives therefore must be among the most important personnel management priorities in any police department. Because uniformed patrolmen constitute the pool from which future detectives will be drawn, state and local officials must pay close attention to the entrance standards for police recruiting and staffing as well.<sup>64</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most common measurement of law enforcement success is the clearance rate. Technically, a "cleared" case is one in which a person has been arrested, charged with a crime, and turned over to prosecutors. Clearance rates for violent crimes known to the police have been declining for over two decades. In 1972, the clearance rate for reported violent criminal offenses was 48.8 percent. By 1993, it was 42.5 percent.<sup>65</sup>  In some of America's largest cities, including Chicago, Detroit, and San Francisco, according to 1994 FBI statistics, clearance rates for violent crime run as low as 20.7 to 38 percent.<sup>66</sup>  Over the past 30 years, the clearance rate for homicide nationwide has declined by 25 percent, and the ability of police to close cases of forcible rape has declined by 20 percent.<sup>67</sup>  Clearance rates for 1994, the most recent year for which figures are available, ranged from 64 percent in murder cases to 24 percent for robberies and as low as 13 percent for burglaries and 14 percent for motor vehicle thefts.<sup>68</sup>  Thus, a great many of the most serious crimes are never solved.
<p>

<b>Police and Community</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Walking "the beat" used to be the model for urban policing. Officers got to know the residents of the community, and the residents of the community got to know them. This made it relatively easy to maintain order and enhanced the ability of the police to fight crime. Direct or anonymous tips, a well-grounded experience with local troublemakers, a keen sense of the local powers present in the neighborhood, including the very worst influences, all gave police officers quick and often easy access to solid information that could serve as the basis for further questioning and the apprehension of criminals.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Over the past four decades, two developments changed the widespread use of this traditional model. The first was internal: a change in the style and philosophy of urban policing itself. Police officials determined that officers cruising urban or suburban areas in patrol cars would be in a better position to respond to calls for help or assistance. Aside from the speed and mobility of the well-equipped patrol car itself, the practice of using police cars in regular patrols created higher visibility over a larger geographical area. This, it was thought, would better deter crime and make the police, equipped with radios and other equipment, more effective in combatting it.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The second development was external: the dramatic social and cultural changes within the communities themselves. The legal revolution in civil rights and the racial conflict and social tension of the 1960s and 1970s left a legacy of hostility to the police that persists in certain neighborhoods to this day. While urban police in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in large cities, were overwhelmingly white and came from working-class or middle-class backgrounds, they often were policing non-white neighborhoods. This presented new challenges. "The problems created by the exercise of the necessary discretion," as Professor James Q. Wilson has written, "are least in communities that have widely shared values as to what constitutes an appropriate level of order and what kind of person or form of behavior is an empirically sound predictor of criminal intention; the problems are greatest in cities deeply divided along lines of class and race."<sup>69</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since the 1960s, police officers have found themselves responding in different ways to different communities. Disorder in some neighborhoods may lead to little or no intervention by the police, while similar problems in other neighborhoods may cause an entirely different response.<sup>70</sup>  The unspoken assumption is that "Various neighborhoods and subcultures have their own levels of tolerable disorder; what may appear to be weaker norms are only different norms."<sup>71</sup>  Too often, laboring under real or imagined suspicions of racial bigotry, the police have simply given up trying to quell disorder in many minority communities, thus tacitly accepting the academically fashionable premises of cultural and moral relativism and its tragic consequences.<sup>72</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem is aggravated by conflicting ideological pressures, particularly among black liberals and leftists, over the appropriate response to crime and disorder in black communities. Paul Butler, a professor of law at George Washington University and former D.C. prosecutor, argues that black jurors should acquit non-violent black criminals, including drug dealers and burglars, even if they are clearly guilty, precisely because they are black and victims of a racist social order.<sup>73</sup>  At the same time, however, in reacting against laws against disorder used by the police in the past as "tools of subjugation" to harass black males, many black citizens in the District of Columbia now find themselves vulnerable to levels of disorder that are not tolerated in middle-class white suburbs.<sup>74</sup>  Says Professor John DiIulio: "You can't have it both ways -- protesting that police are less responsive to black crime victims than white ones in one breath, charging that too many black victimizers get caught, convicted and sentenced in the next; spinning out conspiratorial theories of white acquiescence in letting drugs flow into black communities in the morning, complaining that efforts to crack down on the drug trade are motivated by racism in the afternoon."<sup>75</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Popular reactions to the Rodney King episode and the O. J. Simpson trial highlight the deep racial divisions in Americans' attitudes toward the police. Blacks are more likely than whites to complain about the behavior of police. Surveys also indicate that 49 percent of blacks, but only 22 percent of whites, believe whites get better treatment before the courts and at the hands of police.<sup>76</sup>  Moreover, while 50 percent of whites believe that the police and the courts treat blacks and whites equally, only 29 percent of blacks believe this to be true.<sup>77</sup>  The data on police brutality,<sup>78</sup> however, indicate that such incidents have not been widespread in recent years. According to Robert E. Worden, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at the State University of New York at Albany, "The incidence of the use of improper force is rare in the sense that aircraft fatalities are rare; it is infrequent relative to the large volume of interaction between police and citizens, just as deaths in aircraft accidents are infrequent relative to the large number of passenger miles flown."<sup>79</sup>  When these incidents do occur, they are associated with a variety of factors and, at least historically, more often than not are aggravated by class rather than racial differences.<sup>80</sup>

Many black leaders, both liberal and conservative, argue that the real problem is the absence of police in neighborhoods that are perceived by the officers as "dangerous."  The predominant fear is not of the police, but that the police will abandon the community to criminal predators, some of them mercenary agents of organized crime or drug cartels. "Why doesn't America keep the peace in inner cities?"  ask Glenn C. Loury, Professor of Economics at Boston University, and Shelby Steele, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. "Suppose there were several hundred gang-related murders every year in suburban Chicago or Washington or Los Angeles. Would there be a different public response?"<sup>81</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Young black males are far more likely to be victimized by violent crime than any other segment of America's population. A solid majority of blacks in one survey (57 percent) agreed that there were places in their areas "where they were afraid to walk alone at night."<sup>82</sup>  In a 1994 survey, more than 60 percent of blacks and whites agreed that government was spending "too little" on law enforcement.<sup>83</sup>  The misgivings of Loury and Steele echo the earlier complaints of the late Dr. Martin Luther King: "Permissive crime in ghettos is the nightmare of the slum family. Permissive crime is the name for the organized crime that flourishes in the ghetto -- designed, directed and cultivated by white national crime syndicates operating numbers, narcotics, and prostitution rackets freely in the protected sanctuaries of the ghettos."<sup>84</sup>  The color and ethnic composition of the predators may have changed, but for inner-city residents, the nightmare continues.

<b>LOWERING STANDARDS: <br>
THE HIGH PRICE OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Minority group spokesmen claim, often with justification, that they are "underrepresented" in the staffing of police departments. Police officers must understand the local people and their culture and mores. Neighborhood perceptions of insensitivity or a lack of diversity among police personnel can have a negative impact on police-community relations.<sup>85</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To cope with these social realities, beginning in earnest in the late 1960s, state and local officials attempted to break down long-standing barriers to the hiring of minorities in metropolitan police forces. Federal laws and regulations, particularly those issued by the Nixon Administration, reinforced these efforts. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, no person may be discriminated against or deprived of an opportunity for public service on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; the processes of recruitment, selection, training, and promotion are supposed to be "color-blind" so that all persons are given an equal opportunity. As a result of this combination of changing "social norms" and "the end of overt discrimination," blacks in particular made substantial gains: "Between 1970 and 1990, for example, the number of black police rose from 23,796 to 63,855; they constituted 41 percent of new hires."<sup>86</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the effort to increase diversity accelerated, liberal politicians and judges too often departed from the sound principle that individuals should never be rewarded or penalized on the basis of race or sex. To employ more minorities and women, police agencies frequently have adopted systems of quotas and preferences at the expense of quality, causing standards to be lowered and personnel decisions no longer to be based on selecting the most highly qualified candidates, especially in large metropolitan urban areas.<sup>87</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1966, for example, using federal funds under the Manpower Development Training Act, one of many liberal job training programs enacted during the 1960s, New York City officials planned to train 1,000 black and Puerto Rican youths to become policemen through a "Cadet Program."  Whatever the intended benefits of this program, it was a blow to the cause of professionalism within the NYPD, which had sought to attract new recruits who possessed college degrees, because it concentrated on enrolling "minority group drop-outs" to staff the city's police force.<sup>88</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Quotas are both logically incompatible with personnel management based on the principle of merit selection and a departure from the liberal tradition. In the words of the late Justice William O. Douglas, one of the most prominent champions of liberal views on the U.S. Supreme Court, "Minorities in our midst who are to serve actively in our public affairs should be chosen on talent and character alone, not on cultural orientation or leanings."<sup>89</sup>  The irony is that "Cities as a whole suffer from bad police diversity policies, but it is crime ridden minority communities in them that suffer the most."<sup>90</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Various metropolitan governments have deliberately lowered standards for the recruitment and hiring of police officers in recent years. During the early 1990s, for example, the rush to racial and ethnic "diversity" on the New York City police force resulted in the hiring of officers with low test scores and inadequate background investigations. City officials examining police corruption, including officers compromised by notorious drug dealers, argued that the problem was the "institutional culture" of the department. But the lowering of standards clearly contributed to the problem: "True enough, most bad cops have been white, but a disproportionate number of cops indicted in New York have been minority officers hired in recent years to make the city's force more reflective of its demographics."<sup>91</sup>  In other major cities, whether because of "rush hiring" or quotas, the consequences, both in terms of public safety and in terms of public confidence in the hiring process, have been equally alarming.
<blockquote>
	<b>Washington D.C.:</b> Between 1989 and 1990, under congressional authorization, Washington hired 1,500 police officers. As part of this effort, city officials deliberately reduced hiring standards: "Critical background checks on applicants were cut short, and investigators scrimped on visits to neighborhoods and interviews with former employers. Physical examinations were hurried, and some people who failed to meet minimum requirements were hired anyway. The psychological services unit, which had rejected one in five applicants in other years, rejected just one in 20."<sup>92</sup>
<p>
	Since 1989, 201 D.C. police officers have been arrested (some more than once) by their colleagues on charges ranging from drug dealing and shoplifting to rape and murder. Reporters from <I>The Washington Post</I> learned that the department kept a list of 185 police officers with criminal problems so severe that prosecutors could not put them on the witness stand to testify in criminal cases. And a number of the new police officers that they did put on the stand made such poor witnesses that they often injured the prosecution's case. Because of just one narcotics detective who tested positive for cocaine, the U.S. attorney was forced to seek the release of 32 prisoners convicted on the officer's testimony and the dismissal of 88 cases in which the detective was the key witness for the prosecution.<sup>93</sup>  ABC News correspondent Robert Zelnick has noted that "The police department of the nation's Capital has a notorious record of seeing felony charges dismissed because of police incompetence in filling out arrest reports and related records."<sup>94</sup>
<p>
	A D.C. Metropolitan Police training director found that many recruits had tested so low in reading comprehension tests that they needed "remedial classes."  District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry put a stop to such classes because, said the director, he "feared the classes would reflect poorly on D.C. public schools from which many of the recruits had graduated."<sup>94</sup>  As summed up by Edwin J. Delattre, Professor of Education and Philosophy at Boston University, "The part that Congress and top elected officials in the city government have played in this debacle is a disgrace."
<p>
Because of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) racial, ethnic, and gender "diversity" guidelines, D.C. officials have eliminated any meaningful standards for passing grades on te written examinations for police promotions. Candidates for police promotions now can receive "passing grades" merely by answering correctly "less than half" of the questions on the written examination, which costs taxpayers $1 million to administer.<sup>95</sup> Local officials defend this policy by claiming that certain officers do not test well, that tests are not the best indicator of which candidates would make good police officers, and that results in any case must reflect departmental diversity. But such excuses ignore practical reality. In the words of a police official who asked not to be identified for "fear of retribution," the fact remains that "You're talking about guys who can't get half the answers right. I just don't know how a street officer would feel taking orders from a supervisor who can't get half the answers right."<sup>96</sup> 
<p>
	<b>Miami, Florida:</b> In 1980, the city of Miami quickly hired 200 new policemen, with the specification that 80 percent were to be from the city's minority communities. Throughout the orientation and background investigation process, city officials were warned of the deficiencies of this class of future Miami police officers. The results proved disastrous. By 1988, more than a third of the class hired in 1980 were fired; 75 percent of Miami police officers accused of wrongdoing turned out to be members of this class; and 10 ended up pleading guilty to crimes as serious as murder and drug trafficking. "The frenzy of indiscriminate hiring, inadequate training, and poor supervision eroded personnel standards of the Miami Police Department until even illiteracy was no disqualification."<sup>97</sup>
<p>
	<b>Chicago, Illinois:</b> After promising to base police personnel decisions on merit, Mayor Richard J. Daley, Jr., recently reversed himself and determined that the city would use race as a consideration in promoting senior members of the police department. This would allow police officials to promote black and Hispanic candidates above white candidates who scored higher. In 1994, Mayor Daley authorized merit tests for police promotions, and the taxpayers of Chicago paid $5 million to have an outside company develop and administer these tests. Of the top 114 test scores, only 5 were achieved by minority candidates. Daley's decision has angered and demoralized members of the police force. "They told us it was all about merit," remarked William Nolan, President of the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police. "Now we hear it's not about merit, but about politics and race. So, the police force doesn't believe him anymore."<sup>98</sup>
<p>
	<b>Boston, Massachusetts:</b> Bypassing merit testing for appointment to the police force, the city of Boston has entered into a court-ordered consent decree mandating "diversity" in the ranks. While 42 percent of the residents of Boston are members of minority groups, the police department is 26.4 percent minority. The purpose of the new judicially imposed policy is to reduce the racial imbalance and make up for past "exclusion" by elevating minorities over white candidates taking the police examinations. In 1990, nearly 75 percent of white candidates who took the test scored 90 or above, compared to 36 percent of minorities; 11.4 percent of the white candidates scored 98, 99, or 100, compared to 2.9 percent of minorities. Liberal critics claim the police test is inherently discriminatory, and therefore a poor indicator of how a policeman will perform on the job. According to James Kelly, President of the Boston City Council, however, "There were whites who scored 100 on the tests, but they are not Boston police officers for one reason: the color of their skin. What we have now is a quota system."<sup>99</sup>

Poor personnel management has created serious problems in other major metropolitan areas as well. For example, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Police Department has been ripped by devastating charges of police corruption, and numerous convictions, including convictions in major drug cases, have been overturned because of falsified police reports, illegal tactics, and perjury on the part of police officers.<sup>100</sup>  In New Orleans, Louisiana, 50 police officers have been arrested, indicted, or convicted on criminal charges ranging from murder to drug-trafficking since 1993.<sup>101</sup>  In Baltimore, Maryland, the failure to retain experienced detectives with top-level investigative skills is compromising the quality of police investigations and hampering the efforts of prosecutors. "In court, it is a loss of an experienced detective who can explain to a jury how you go through an investigation," observes U.S. Attorney Katherine J. Armentout. "They have credibility with a jury that is just invaluable."<sup>102</sup>

<b>THE CLINTON "COPS" PROGRAM</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With the enactment of the $30 billion Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, President Clinton promised to put 100,000 additional police officers on America's streets to fight violent crime. Among its many provisions, the 1994 law sets aside $8.8 billion in funding for the hiring of police officers over a six-year period. Clinton's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, administered by a new office within the Department of Justice, gives funds to local jurisdictions, including smaller towns and larger urban areas, for "community policing" strategies.<sup>103</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under this, grants fund local police personnel for three years, and the federal contribution is set at 75 percent of the combined salary and benefits of each officer, up to $75,000 over a three-year period. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, average starting salaries for entry level police officers today range from $18,710 to $26,560, with "average operating expenditures" for each officer ranging from $31,500 to $63,400 per annum.<sup>104</sup>  In 1995, 8,000 of the nation's approximately 15,000 law enforcement jurisdictions applied for the new federal funding; 92 percent of those which applied were approved.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There has been some confusion over the exact number of police officers hired thus far under the Clinton plan. While the 100,000 figure is used routinely in the media, Attorney General Janet Reno recently cited a far smaller number of police on the streets as a result of the new grant program: 17,000.<sup>105</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's promise of 100,000 additional police is popular with local officials who can afford the matching contribution. But even if the promise were fulfilled, "the nation would go from having one officer on patrol at any given time for every 6,250 Americans (1.6 per 10,000) to one officer for every 5,208 Americans (1.9 per 10,000).... This 20 percent increase does not seem likely to make much difference in crime, at least under conventional theories of high visibility and rapid response time. Nor is it likely to produce the substantially higher arrest rates that some advocates argue will reduce crime."<sup>106</sup>  In addition, reported crime has been declining since 1992,<sup>107</sup> well before passage of the 1994 crime bill and well before the first cohort of newly funded officers hit the streets.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The available evidence clearly indicates that the Clinton program is poorly targeted to reduce violent crime.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a random sample of applicants conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office, for example, 84 percent of the jurisdictions cited "property" crimes as among their "top five ranked public safety issues," followed by domestic violence (78.3 percent); alcohol-related crimes, including drunken driving (63.3 percent); drug crimes (60.9 percent); and vandalism (51.2 percent). "Violent crimes against persons" ranked only sixth (50.7 percent).<sup>108</sup>  Other "top five public safety issues" included traffic violations (3.7 percent), disorderly conduct (19.8 percent), and gangs (19.3 percent). Overall, the GAO "found no relationship between crime rates and whether an applicant jurisdiction was awarded the grant."<sup>109</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

$7.2 million in COPS grant money ended up funding 86 police officers for state parks, including 30 additional officers in Florida to "keep watch over a coral sanctuary" and 19 park rangers for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.<sup>110</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Based on an extrapolation from the GAO data, the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee found that grant funding was not going to those cities and communities hardest hit by violent crime. In Oregon, for example, Portland accounts for 56 percent of all violent crimes but received less than one percent of the state's COPS funding.<sup>111</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many local jurisdictions simply cannot afford the Clinton plan, which requires them to assume a greater portion of the cost each year of the three-year grant period. According to the GAO, almost 7,000 local jurisdictions did not apply for grants, and over 600 turned down the opportunity to participate. Based on a review of jurisdictions that did not apply, the GAO found that in 62 percent of the cases, the reason was their inability to meet the program's financial requirements.<sup>112</sup>  Other reasons included local management decisions and excessive regulatory and paperwork requirements.<sup>113</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Instead of reinforcing merit selection, the Clinton plan encourages quotas. Upon withdrawing from participation in the COPS program, Oklahoma City Police Chief Sam Gonzales observed that the Justice Department's language on the hiring of women and minorities is "very significant" because "it states 'equal employment' of women and minorities rather than 'equal employment opportunity.'"  <sup>114</sup> The program is also inflexible: "There's nothing wrong with community policing, and many cities would be glad to spend federal dollars to implement it. But others, including some large cities, already have instituted community policing and need computers instead."<sup>115</sup>

<p>
<b>BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE LOCAL POLICE FORCE</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The federal government cannot improve local police personnel management. That is a job for state and local officials and, given the demands of public safety, is one of their most important responsibilities. They must, therefore, understand the realities of police work and the kinds of standards that should be applied both in recruiting new police officers and in evaluating police performance. They cannot safely indulge racial quotas or accommodate liberal political attacks on merit principles of personnel management.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials also must pay police officers for the job they do; they cannot expect to have a first-rate police department with bargain-basement pay scales or lowered mental and physical standards. The federal government cannot make police officers effective in their communities simply by throwing more money at the problem. At the same time, however, imaginative local officials have demonstrated some dramatic successes.
<blockquote>
	<b>New York City:</b> Taking over a demoralized 38,000-member department in 1994, William J. Bratton declared an all-out war on crime and disorder to reclaim neighborhoods literally block by block. Commissioner Bratton started decentralizing authority, tracked crime trends through a computerized system, and held commanders directly accountable for decreasing crime and disorder in their precincts. He also dismissed high-level police officials who were unable or unwilling to adapt to the new program.<sup>116</sup>  The result: In 1994, major felonies fell by 2 percent nationwide; in New York City, they dropped by 12 percent in 1994 and fell by another 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995.<sup>117</sup>  This dramatic reduction in major felonies over three years also included an almost 45 percent drop in the murder rate.
<p>
	<b>Houston, Texas:</b> In a remarkable experiment in community policing, Houston Police Chief Sam Nuchia started an innovative "citizens patrol program" to supplement the work of the city's police force. The result: Thousands of citizen patrollers have reported criminal activities to the police, arrests have increased, and police productivity has improved.<sup>118</sup>
<p>
	<b>Oxnard, California:</b> Using a sophisticated crime analysis and advanced gang-tracking computer data base developed by a team of experts during the Reagan Administration, police have been able to issue crime alerts to residents in high-crime areas and to target juvenile offenders effectively. The result: violent crime has fallen by 38 percent to its lowest level since the 1960s.<sup>119</sup>  Similar computerized identification and tracking techniques are being used in 130 other jurisdictions.
<p>
	<b>Charleston, South Carolina:</b> Police Chief Reuben Greenberg, widely known for innovative police management, concentrated his efforts on combatting the high level of crime and disorder in the city's public housing projects. Working directly with public housing tenants, Greenberg and his officers helped them screen prospective tenants for criminal records;, tenants engaged in illegal behavior, including drug trafficking, were evicted. The result: Charleston's public housing projects were transformed from one of the most dangerous places in Charleston to one of the "safest."<sup>120</sup>

<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR LOCAL LEADERSHIP</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the final analysis, the principal problems facing the police today are personnel management and how best to utilize the limited resources available to maintain order and enforce the law. To address these problems, state and local officials should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Get serious about personnel standards.</b> The police officer's job is unique; there is nothing comparable to it in the private sector. Many experts like former New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy therefore favor a four-year college degree, or at least a higher education requirement, as an ideal standard.<sup>121</sup>  Other experts do not see a college or university degree as a necessary condition of appointment, and argue that for persons with demonstrated maturity and diverse life experiences, a high school degree or equivalent may suffice.<sup>122</sup>
<p>
No matter what educational standards they adopt, responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical requirements, measured in physical strength and stamina, are also essential. Most important, background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, their current and past associations, and their financial and marital stability, as well as any evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse.<sup>123</sup>  Periodic re-investigations of personnel, particularly those assigned to specialized tasks such as drug enforcement, also are desirable. Continuing vigilance concerning the character and integrity of the police force is the best defense against the perennial threat of corruption.

<p><li><b>Improve the image of the police.</b> The image of the police officer on the street means a lot: "Cops deserve smart looking uniforms -- and should wear them smartly -- because they represent both the city and the profession."<sup>124</sup>  A police officer's personal appearance and demeanor can help instill respect and confidence among members of the community by creating an image of competence and strength. This is what taxpayers want in their police officers, and it is what they deserve.

<P><li><b>Draw recruits from every sector of the community.</b> Because the mission of the police is of vital concern to every citizen, the police department should represent the community and reflect its demographic composition. Such broader representation is particularly important in minority neighborhoods so that officers can understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit critical information vital to effective law enforcement. Local officials have a genuine public interest in making their police officers role models and champions of the local community.
<p>
This means that they should cast a wide net and recruit aggressively from every sector of the community. But they should not be deceived by the false god of "diversity at all costs" or by the politically correct premise that simple numerical "underrepresentation" is proof of racial or ethnic discrimination. Nor should they adopt race-based deployment, with only white cops in "white communities" and only black cops in "black communities."<sup>125</sup>  And in no case should personnel management policy make a mockery of merit selection or promotion: "When individual performance is undervalued, professional standards are bound to decline."<sup>126</sup>  Finally, while officials should draw police recruits from the minority community, they should not make membership in the community a condition of appointment: "It is easier to teach police about an area and its residents than to make good police from unqualified applicants."<sup>127</sup>

<p><li><b>Draw recruits from the military.</b> The United States Army recruitment motto "Be all that you can be" applies with equal force to the police. While military and police functions are fundamentally different, and good police work is often the product of an entrepreneurial spirit, military personnel have served in a disciplined organization and are trained in many skills that are useful in police work, including the use of firearms. Veterans preference in recruitment and hiring is being used in many departments, but officials should go further and actively recruit candidates from the military, a talent pool distinguished by high standards of performance. Moreover, for officials wishing to increase the number of minorities serving on the police force, they should realize that blacks make up 11.5 percent of America's civilian population between the ages of 18 and 44 but represent almost 30 percent of the American military, including a large number of senior officers, particularly in the Army: "The military is not free of racial problems found in the civilian world, but it has been more insulated from them because it is a closed and hierarchical society where rank is more important than race or gender."<sup>128</sup>

<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> The most effective police officer is not an outsider, but an insider; and the best way to establish effective "community policing" is for local residents to know the police and the police to know the local residents. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible; the more people the police officer knows, the more effective he will be not only in maintaining order and enforcing community standards, but also in obtaining the sort of solid information that is essential in controlling crime.
<p>
A police officer must get to know the community and its residents and be ready to share information with other officers patrolling the area. If the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors. In order to integrate police officers into the community, local officials should consider low-cost housing loans or housing vouchers to enable officers to move into the neighborhoods where they are needed. "The residency requirement is not very effective right now," says Hubert Williams, President of the Police Foundation. "We simply need another approach and police homeownership in high risk or deteriorating neighborhoods is proving to be a successful solution."<sup>129</sup>

<p><li><b>Modernize police management.</b> Too often, police management practices are outdated and do not work.<sup>129</sup>  Bureaucratic civil service rules and regulations and outdated labor/management models impede managerial flexibility and undercut accountability and performance. For example, officers appointed to the detective division should serve on a probationary basis to demonstrate their skills and commitment, just as physicians serve internships. Too often, also, there is little lateral entry into managerial ranks from outside the force. The police force is one of the few organizational cultures in which promotion is almost exclusively through the ranks. Success in the ranks, however, usually depends on responding to incidents, not on strategic planning.<sup>131</sup>  Strategic use of resources, which includes analyzing crime and devising of long-term and short-term solutions, requires an effective planning and research capability to support police management. But less than 1 percent of police budgets are dedicated to research,<sup>132</sup> and planning often is not coordinated effectively with operations leadership.
<p>
Sound personnel management is based on clarity of mission, direct accountability of line management and staff to see that goals are met, and reward for performance. While police work is hardly comparable to anything in the private sector, "Police executives must continually review private sector approaches to managing, developing and supporting people, and transport ideas into the public sector where applicable."<sup>133</sup>
<p>
Commissioner Bratton's success in New York City is partially attributable to the clarity of his goals: "`I don't want a 2 or 3 percent reduction in crime this year -- I want 15 to 25 percent.'  And he got it."<sup>134</sup>  He also devolved authority downward to police commanders in the field, holding them directly accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions and carefully measuring their success and the success of the officers working under their command: "We gave these first line managers the authority to run their precincts as miniature police departments without a lot of petty interference from headquarters. The best ones rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity."  <sup>135</sup> Commanders must know their precincts, take personal responsibility for conditions there, and respond quickly and effectively to the needs of the community: "As many private sector organizations have discovered, the further from the point of service delivery, the harder it is to make good decisions without good information."<sup>136</sup> 
<p>
<p><li><b>Use sound personnel management to combat police corruption.</b> Conventional wisdom holds that if an officer stays too long on one beat, he may become subject to corruption, particularly by organized crime syndicates. Police corruption can be met in two ways: through serious background investigations, particularly investigations into moral character, and through sound management practices that make commanders directly accountable for the integrity, as well as the performance, of their people. Everyone in the department, from the top executives down through the ranks, must accept responsibility for the integrity of the force: "Few actions erode the confidence of the public or of the police in their own department as much as the indifference of command officers to misconduct by their personnel."<sup>137</sup>  In New York City Commissioner Bratton adopted a highly public strategy of going out and personally arresting corrupt policemen, disgracing them by taking their badges from them for violating their oaths.
<p>
If commanders have to answer for a breakdown in the system's integrity, they also are more likely to ensure both the periodic background investigation of personnel assigned to sensitive details, such as narcotics or organized crime investigations where the temptations of corruption are higher, and the periodic rotation of personnel in such assignments. Police officials, in effect, should impose "term limits" on assignments to such highly sensitive investigative squads.

<p><li><b>Target hot spots.</b> Modern techniques for tracking crime give police officials an opportunity to anticipate and intervene quickly and effectively in high crime areas: "By plotting each homicide incident and using sophisticated mapping and statistical clustering procedures, the early warning system allows police to identify potential neighborhood crisis areas at high risk for suffering a spurt of gang violence. With rapid dissemination of information, police can intervene in hot spots to quell emerging trouble."<sup>138</sup>  Such intervention also can serve to disrupt the trade in illegal narcotics. "The key to making crackdowns work is to keep them short and unpredictable," advises Professor Lawrence Sherman. "Long-term police crackdowns all show a 'decay' in their deterrent effects over time. Short term crackdowns, in contrast, show a free bonus of residual deterrence after the crackdown stops, while potential offenders slowly figure out that the cops are gone."<sup>139</sup>  In Minneapolis, a controlled experiment in "hot spots" interventions in 1988 and 1989 resulted in a 50 percent decline in disorder, including neighborhood fights and other disturbances.<sup>140</sup>

<p><li><b>Target the criminal class and their guns.</b> The population engaged in the most serious crime is relatively small, composed generally of serious habitual offenders, often on probation and parole. They should be a routine target of the police. State lawmakers, for example, can enact laws which make all persons on probation and parole subject to "non-consensual" search for guns or other weapons as a condition of probation or parole.<sup>141</sup>  Stopping and frisking such persons, especially in hot spot areas, is an innovative way to combat gun violence.<sup>142</sup>  Local police officials also can create specialized units that "combine surveillance and sting strategies to catch the offender in the act of crime. The resulting evidence is stronger than arrests made after the fact, thus increasing the odds of the offender being imprisoned."<sup>143</sup>  Finally, as Craig Fraser of the Police Executive Research Forum has suggested, state officials should appoint police chiefs to parole and probation panels, giving them a direct role in the official decision to put prisoners back on the streets.

<p><li><b>Civilianize and privatize administrative and support functions.</b> Too many police officers are tied up with administrative, logistical, and other support duties. Officials should review positions held by police personnel to determine whether the job requires a sworn officer. Where possible, civilians should carry out ancillary administrative functions. Santa Clara, California, for example, established a system of community service officers -- personnel who are not armed and who can conduct traffic accident assistance and investigations, file reports, and serve in school crossing and traffic positions. Community service personnel also can serve as a good pool for recruitment into the regular police ranks.
<p>
Local officials also should consider the privatization of ancillary police services. Most police departments, for example, have a large fleet of automobiles that must be maintained; keeping police cruisers in top condition need not require police personnel, but could be contracted out to private bidders. Privatization is a healthy and growing challenge to police management generally: "Venture capitalists are now exploring the concept of policing corporations which provide policing services to contract cities."<sup>144</sup>

<p><li><b>Reduce the caseloads of detectives.</b> In many urban areas, the caseload for detectives is too high. This problem could be eased by training patrol officers to conduct the early stages of investigations, including the interrogations of witnesses and suspects at or near crime scenes. In order to gain the confidence of detectives on the force, experienced or retired detectives could be used for such training. In the investigation of certain crimes, specially trained officers easily can take over interviewing responsibilities normally reserved for detectives, especially in sensitive areas such as rape or child molestation.<sup>145</sup> 
<p>
Careful interviewing and questioning of informants, witnesses, and suspects is the key to resolving difficult cases. Officials therefore should thoroughly debrief retiring detectives before they leave the force to gather as much information as possible about their investigative techniques, experiences, and other tricks of the trade. Retiring detectives also should transmit to police intelligence units, consistent with respect for confidentiality and the sensitivity of the information, the names of good informants, contacts in the underworld, or other crucial sources of information.

<p><li><b>Improve police compensation.</b> "Bargain basement cops" invariably turn out to be expensive, especially in terms of morale and lost public confidence. Policing must be a desirable middle-class occupation. This means regularly reviewing police pay to make sure that it attracts the best candidates to the force. Officials also should consider pay for performance, at least for police managers,<sup>146</sup> as well as bonuses for officers assigned to dangerous or sensitive investigations. Monies secured from "drug busts," for example, could be used not only for drug rehabilitation and treatment, but also for bonuses for police officers temporarily assigned to narcotics investigations, undercover work, or other dangerous assignments. Nor should local officials neglect other forms of compensation: "Educational incentives, patrol bonuses, watch differentials and alternative work schedules are methods to improve the quality of service delivered and the job satisfaction of line personnel."<sup>147</sup> 

<p><li><b>Use advanced technology.</b> Modern, time-saving equipment can magnify the effectiveness of well-trained police officers. The concept of "working smarter, not harder" is particularly appropriate to police work and can free up the officer's time to maintain the neighborhood contacts vital to community policing. Lap-top computers can speed up the process of report writing and improve the legibility of field reports, making it unnecessary to write out the same information numerous times in order to complete the crime reports, arrest reports, property reports, witness lists, and other paperwork needed to record police incidents.
<p>
Some departments are using innovative electronic information systems to streamline the process of reporting and analysis. In St. Petersburg, Florida, for example, the police are experimenting with electronic docking mechanisms in patrol cars which would allow officers to use computers to receive and transmit information through the police radio system. This would allow all crime incident record keeping processes -- from the original taking of a telephone complaint, through the patrol officer's response and preliminary investigation, to the follow-up investigation by detectives -- to be automated. The resulting improvements in productivity, timeliness, and accuracy would provide multiple benefits both for the police department itself and for the citizens who rely on its services.
<p>
Other advanced electronic devices, such as cellular telephones and facsimile transmission equipment, can enhance patrol officers' ability to communicate while minimizing their time away from the neighborhoods they serve. Automated fingerprint identification systems greatly improve criminal investigations and the apprehension of suspects. Closed-circuit television has many uses, from "line ups" identification to traffic surveillance and physical location security. Advanced simulation technology and computer-generated audio-visual equipment can provide "virtual reality" in police training and increase the accuracy of officer evaluations.
<p>
Even though many municipalities may find it difficult to provide funding for the major capital expenditures necessary to obtain such equipment, they should make a special effort in this direction as a way to improve public safety. Special law enforcement bond issues, private sector contributions, or other innovative means of financing could be used. Likewise, if Congress wants to provide federal funds to local law enforcement, it would be far wiser to make those funds available for capital expenditures on technological improvements which provide long-term value<sup>148</sup> instead of simply paying part of the costs of local police operating expenses, which offer only temporary and limited benefits.
</ol><p><b>
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

State and local officials bear the primary responsibility for combatting most crime, especially street crime. Nevertheless, both Congress and the executive branch can play a supporting role. Among the 15,000 law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States, the challenges to law enforcement are as different as the communities they serve. Therefore, any federal assistance should ensure maximum flexibility for state and local officials in fighting crime in their communities. Specifically, Congress should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety.</b> The United States Senate has the constitutional responsibility to give its advice and consent to the appointment of federal judicial nominees. A number of liberal judges appointed to the bench have issued creative rulings to advance the rights of criminal suspects, even to the point of embarrassing the Presidents who appointed them. The Senate should scrutinize judicial candidates more carefully, rely more heavily on the formal advice and testimony of police representatives in the confirmation process, and block the appointment of nominees with records of insensitivity to public safety.

<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those which impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: "Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities. Federal crimes now range from serious but purely local crimes like carjacking and drug dealing to trivial crimes like disrupting a rodeo."<sup>149</sup>  The Clinton Administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more federal crimes, duplicating offenses already illegal under state and local statutes. Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- a process that has been promoted by representatives of both political parties.

<p><li><b>Reform the exclusionary rule.</b> A "good faith" exception to the exclusionary rule would enable prosecutors to introduce incriminating evidence at trial which has been gathered in good faith but otherwise would be ruled inadmissible because of technical violations of procedure by police officers. A process also should be established to discipline officers who abuse proper procedure. As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of the police. This problem is aggravated by tortured interpretations of the law by liberal judges: "If an officer stops a car without adequate reason and finds the butt of a marijuana cigarette on the floor," for example, "there is little public concern when the offense goes unpunished. But if the officer finds a gun that proves the driver committed a murder, the suppression of the gun may set a killer free and outrage the public. The officer's conduct in both cases is the same, but the consequences to the public vary drastically."<sup>150</sup>  A congressionally enacted good faith exception to the exclusionary rule for federal jurisdictions also could encourage state legislatures to enact similar statutes affecting local jurisdictions.

<p><li><b>Review the impact of the Miranda ruling.</b> For three decades, police officers have been operating under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> requiring officers to inform suspects of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney. Statements made by suspects can be excluded as evidence if the technical rules are not followed precisely. Congress should revisit this ruling to determine its impact on the ability of prosecutors to achieve justice in criminal cases. Professor Paul G. Cassell of the University of Utah College of Law, for example, argues that <I>Miranda</I>, at least as currently enforced, is responsible for thousands of lost criminal cases.<sup>151</sup>  Congress should conduct hearings and enact remedies for any deficiencies in the application of <I>Miranda</I> rules, including an alternative to the exclusion of valid probative evidence.

<p><li><b>Make federal funding of local law enforcement user friendly.</b> Neither federal programs nor increases in federal anti-crime spending have had much impact in reducing violent crime at the local level, and early indications are that President Clinton's multibillion dollar COPS program will follow this pattern. If Congress wants to help state and local officials, it should break away from outdated and ineffective patterns of federal spending.
<p>
Under an innovative proposal by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), for example, 2 percent of the federal personal income tax taken from the residents of each state would be returned to the state to fight crime. These tax rebates would be free of the federal intrusions that accompany categorical grants and would allow state officials to use the money for their specific needs, such as police staffing and equipment, community policing, crime prevention, or prison programs. These rebates would amount to $55 billion over a five-year period, a steady stream of funding both more flexible and more generous than that contained in the Clinton Administration's crime bill.<sup>152</sup>  The tax rebate strategy also has the advantage of creating strong incentives for local officials to spend the money wisely, targeting what is necessary rather than what is merely desirable. The reason: Under the Sensenbrenner proposal, state officials also would have the option of giving money back to the taxpayers directly in the form of tax cuts. 

<p><li><b>Review D.C. police pay and personnel management practices.</b> Since Congress in the late 1980s and early 1990s contributed directly to the problems of the police in the nation's capital, it should work cooperatively with local officials to make the D.C. police force the national model it once was. This includes reviewing pay and personnel management practices, particularly the recruiting and hiring of police officers. Washington Police Chief Larry Soulsby already has embarked on a comprehensive retraining program for 2,700 officers, nearly 75 percent of the force. This retraining covers everything from ethics and criminal procedures to street tactics and the preparation of police reports, a critical subject since "Unclear or misleading statements in those documents can jeopardize prosecution of criminal cases."<sup>153</sup>

<p><li><b>Pursue an innovative empowerment strategy to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods plagued by crime and disorder.</b> Over the past 40 years, Congress has enacted numerous social programs aimed at crime "prevention," including federal programs for "at risk" and delinquent youth. The General Accounting Office recently identified 131 such overlapping federal programs for "at risk" youth alone, administered by 16 federal agencies at an annual cost of over $4 billion.<sup>154</sup>
<p>
Innovative community policing strategies should be combined with imaginative new social policies. Representatives James Talent (R-MO) and J. C. Watts (R-OK), for example, are sponsoring Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467). This comprehensive initiative would establish a new federal policy to empower parents and neighborhood organizations, such as black churches and other religious institutions, to educate children trapped in poorly performing inner-city schools, in addition to encouraging faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation and other private social service programs that work.<sup>155</sup>  Dr. Richard Freeman of Harvard University has found that black inner-city youth who have religious values are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values.<sup>156</sup>
<p>
One final recommendation applies specifically to the executive branch: 
<p><li><b>Improve the sharing of information with state and local officials.</b> In carrying out their constitutional responsibilities to combat interstate and international crime, as well as to control United States borders, federal law enforcement agencies should maximize their coordination and cooperation with state and local police. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in particular can provide valuable technical assistance and training, specialized support in the fields of identification and scientific investigation, and central facilities for the collection and dissemination of statistical data, criminal intelligence, and other relevant information on a national basis.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

No American family is safe from the threat of crime. In some inner-city neighborhoods, the situation is positively desperate. And with the rising tide of violent juvenile crime, millions of Americans will be locked behind their doors, imprisoned in their own homes in deteriorating neighborhoods. In far too many urban areas, law-abiding citizens cannot go to the store, take a stroll in the park, or even visit friends and relatives without fear of violent assault. These people need the best police protection they can get. It is the job of state and local officials to give it to them.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To do this, they must get serious about the mission of the police and expand their use of the kinds of personnel management principles that can attract and hold first-rate police officers. This includes setting and maintaining high standards for appointment; drawing from every sector of the community; drawing from the military, particularly to broaden minority representation; aggressively targeting both hot spots and the criminal class; anchoring police officers in the community; modernizing police management and privatizing and civilianizing support functions wherever possible; and improving police compensation.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress can play a supportive role in this drama, but not a definitive one. This means repealing federal laws which impede the ability of local police to enforce the law. Specifically, Congress should reformulate the exclusionary rule to allow the inclusion of evidence gathered in good faith by police officers; review the impact of <I>Miranda</I> on police criminal investigations; stop the appointment of lenient federal judges; and change the funding formulas for federal financial assistance to the states, replacing the current grant-in-aid system with a more generous tax rebate that allows state and local officials maximum flexibility to combat violent crime.

<p><li>    The problem is long-standing: "The police feel that they deserve respect from the public.

   <p><li> Commenting on the professional culture of the famed New York City detective division in the 1950s and 1960s, Arthur Niederhoff, a former New York City policeman, observes that "Detectives are the upper class of police society and haughtily guard their special status and privileges. Their quarters are separate from those of the uniformed police. Within this private domain democratic camaraderie eliminates the social distance that ordinarily divides the various ranks of a bureaucratic hierarchy.... It is of special significance that this high status unit, to which every member of the lower echelon aspires, performs best when disregarding formal regulations and official procedures." Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield</I>, pp. 83-85.
 <p><li>   The Supreme Court qualified its <i>Miranda </i>ruling in <I>Harris v.

 <p><li>   "A good detective must be suspicious; he needs the intuitive ability to sense plots and conspiracies on the basis of embryonic evidence," says Niederhoff, but the qualifications are hard to establish: "A strong minority on the [New York] police force asserts... that a detective's value and future success depends on the private sources of information at his disposal, and his willingness to do the necessary legwork. They support this opinion by citing the many brilliant detectives in police history who could never have passed an IQ test, could hardly write an intelligible report, and whose techniques of investigation violated every recommended principle of scientific detection."

  <p><li>  "This doctrine encourages an observer from one culture to respect the integrity of another, although its standards of behavior may be different from his own. The implication is that the policeman has some justification for accepting a minority group's way of life on its own terms, and thus for acting the way he does. There is no easy answer to this paradox." Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield</I>, p. 66.
  <p><li>  Professor Butler's basic argument is that since the United States is "structurally" racist, blacks are victimized by the American system, and black jurors have, therefore, no obligation to up hold its system of justice, at least as applied to blacks who commit non-violent crimes.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This ancient practice, however, is beginning to change. Motivated by mounting evidence that death-related taxes may hold back the economic well-being of the living, several countries and American states recently have repealed their taxes on estates or significantly scaled them down. The U.S. Congress also is reexamining the wisdom of these taxes. Two bills, one in the House and another in the Senate, call for outright repeal of the estate and gift tax,<sup>1</sup> and dozens of others in both chambers propose significant modifications that give taxpayer relief.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Support for these proposals still comes primarily from advocates of limited government. But a growing number of liberals recently have shown a keen interest in repeal. Like so many critics of the estate tax, these new critics are disturbed by the growing evidence that this tax:
<ul>
<p><li>Reduces economic growth, hurting the jobs and incomes of the very people that wealth redistribution was intended to aid;

<p><li>Increases the cost of capital, slowing down research and development and the use of machines that would increase worker productivity -- and thus wages;

<p><li>Keeps interest rates on home loans and other major purchases higher than they should be; and

<p><li>Raises very little money -- in fact, it may cost the government and the taxpayers more in administrative and compliance fees than it raises in revenue.
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current wealth taxation policy stems from the mistaken view that redistributing income leads to the redistribution of economic power. Nearly a century of wealth taxation, however, shows that well-to-do Americans (including a great number of middle-class families) simply find ways of legally avoiding the tax collector. Not only do they save less and consume more of their income, thus benefiting from the lower taxes on consumption, but they also make less productive investments, such as large life insurance policies and substantial charitable contributions, thus reducing the chances that their death will leave a large taxable estate. The policy of using the estate tax to redistribute economic power actually leads to a distorted distribution of consumption and a less productive economy. Both of these unexpected outcomes worsen the economic condition of the less economically powerful.
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Founders understood the critical importance of reducing legal barriers to economic opportunity as the best public means of allowing every citizen to achieve economic fulfillment. This understanding found a home in the original U.S. Constitution, where direct taxes on wealth and income were prohibited except in time of national emergency. But soon after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (which lifted the ban on federal income taxation) in 1913, the federal government began a 60-year effort to create a more democratic economy through the forcible redistribution of wealth. That policy has imposed costs on economic growth as well as fundamental liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is time to repeal the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax. The case for this turns on three factors: the diminishing importance of the estate tax as a federal revenue stream; the failure of the tax to achieve its public policy objectives, principally the creation of economic benefits for lower-income Americans; and the continuing damage the tax exacts on the economy in terms of jobs, output, and growth. Transcending all of these factors is the growing appreciation that wealth taxation infringes on fundamental liberties and is inconsistent with the principle of limited government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the estate tax were repealed, the effect on the economy would be significant. According to an econometric study conducted by Professor Richard Wagner of George Mason University, the effect of the estate tax on the cost of capital is so great that within eight years, a U.S. economy without an estate tax would be producing $80 billion more in annual output and would have created 250,000 additional jobs and a $640 billion larger capital stock.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An analysis by The Heritage Foundation using two leading econometric models also found that repealing the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect on the economy. Specifically, the Heritage analysis found that if the tax were repealed this year, over the next nine years:
<ul>
<p><li>The nation's economy would average as much as $11 billion per year in extra output;

<p><li>An average of 145,000 additional new jobs could be created;

<p><li>Personal income could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current projections; and

<p><li>The deficit actually would decline, since revenues generated by extra growth would more than compensate for the meager revenues currently raised by the inefficient estate tax.
The estate tax has few friends, other than tax attorneys, and raises very little revenue at a heavy cost to the economy. It generates complex tax avoidance schemes. The hardest hit by the tax are small businesspeople who work hard to pass on an enterprise of value to their children. And its bias against saving and wealth generation is the antithesis of the American dream.
</ul><p>

<b>HOW WEALTH TAXES BEGAN IN AMERICA</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current public policy on the taxation of intergenerational wealth stems from roots laid down in the American Revolution and, oddly enough, in the Revolutionaries' efforts to create a society in which all citizens would be free to become as wealthy as their talents allow. As with so many principles that trace back to the Revolutionary period, the liberty to acquire and dispose of personal property became, by the 20th century, subsidiary to another element of the country's founding: the drive to create democratic equality of economic opportunity.<sup>2</sup><p><b>The Early Years</b><p>Alexis de Tocqueville paid considerable attention to the views Americans held about wealth and economic opportunity when he made his famous tour of the early Republic in 1831. On the one hand, Americans had a nearly universal disdain for aristocracy and any non-republican show of wealth. But on the other hand, nearly everyone with whom Tocqueville became acquainted wanted desperately to be rich:
<blockquote>
	I do not mean that there is any lack of wealthy individuals in the United States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of men and where a profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it.<sup>3</sup></blockquote><b>Removing Barriers to Wealth.</b> The democratization of acquiring wealth constituted the touchstone of the new civilization that the Revolutionaries sought to build. Theirs was a battle against barriers erected in the Old World to prevent the rise of the common man. For centuries, laws had been applied differently to rich and poor people. The Revolutionaries overturned this by embracing the legal principle of equality before the law, extending it to all free Americans, and giving it the sharp legal teeth of natural liberty in one's life and property. They freed labor and capital from taxes, turned over to communities virtually all regulation of commerce, and tried in many other ways to remove government from everyday life. This truly was the age of the individual. Liberated from the oppressive economic and social networks that had surrounded the Crown and that prevented ordinary people from rising, the Revolutionaries emphasized the importance of allowing the marketplace rather than birth and influence to be the measure of personal worth. As Gordon Wood writes in his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of this period,
<blockquote>
	A man was now praised for having arrived and risen "without friends," for having been "the architect of his own fortune," or for never having been "borne on the shoulders of patronage."  For many Americans the ability to make money -- not whom one knew, or who one's father was, or where one went to college -- now became the only proper democratic means for distinguishing one man from another.<sup>4</sup></blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing epitomizes the zeal of the Revolutionaries for fundamentally altering the process of acquiring wealth better than the rapid abolition of primogeniture and the narrowing of entail. The ancient practice of primogeniture settled the entirety of an estate on the first-born male, thus leaving the remaining male children and all female children without inheritance. Primogeniture made birth order rather than merit the principal cause of wealth. Thus, dullards were as likely as commercial geniuses to end up ruling vast properties and exercising immense social and political influence. Entail nicely complemented primogeniture by making it all but impossible for real estate to leave a family, no matter how desirous a family one day might be to part with the property or how badly they managed their estate. Together, primogeniture and entail put a gigantic weight around the neck of economic progress and reduced the rate of commercial improvement to an obese creep.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thomas Jefferson, himself initially a victim of primogeniture and then its beneficiary upon the death of his older brother, vigorously opposed both practices and saw legislation that he had written in 1777 abolishing primogeniture passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1785. Within a few years, every new state government had followed Virginia's lead, and no subsequent state ever seriously considered allowing it. For Jefferson, the reform of entail and abolition of primogeniture were two of the most important actions taken in the early Republic to create "a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy, and a foundation laid for a government truly republican."<sup>5</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even a cursory reading of the Revolutionary texts underscores this unrelenting focus of the Founders on removing barriers to the wealth-creating process. Early American public policy was not aimed at redistributing wealth or at restraining its growth. Rather, the early Republic pursued a public policy of removing obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic self-improvement. If an egalitarian theme was present in early American public policy, it was the theme of equality before the law, which often meant the elimination of legal privileges that gave one class an economic advantage over another.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This attitude to wealth creation can be found in the Constitution of the United States. A straightforward reading of the following paragraph from Article I, Section 9 appears to prohibit all direct taxes, which would include a prohibition against taxes on income and wealth: "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken."<sup>6</sup><p><b>Changing Attitudes Toward Wealth and Taxation</b><p><b>National Emergencies.</b> It was generally accepted during the 19th century that Congress had extensive authority to bend the Constitution during times of national emergency. For example, the writ of <I>habeas corpus</i> could be suspended in times of war or rebellion in order to advance the public good. Thus, it appeared well within Congress's emergency powers to impose taxes on wealth and inheritance to meet the wholly unexpected revenue requirements of the federal government during dangerous times.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress wasted no time in testing its expansive wartime authority: Taxes on estates were imposed first during the Quasi-War with France (1797-1799), but repealed in 1802. Still, had it not been for the Civil War, it is possible that after 1802, the 19th century would have been an uninterrupted period of no estate or intergenerational wealth taxation. But the expenses of the Union government exhausted its revenue sources so quickly that President Lincoln and the war Congresses employed the emergency clauses of the Constitution to enact the first modern intergenerational wealth tax. The Revenue Act of 1862 revived the death tax of the Quasi-War Congress and recrafted it into a true inheritance tax. Congress repealed the tax on wealth in 1870.<sup>7</sup><p><b>Wealth Seen As an Obstacle to Economic Opportunity.</b> While costly national emergencies occasionally challenged the idea of unrestricted wealth creation and ownership, more important in the long run was a change of attitude in some circles toward the relationship between wealth and economic opportunity. Between 1880 and 1916, the party of Lincoln overflowed with political warriors who saw no American problem that could not be solved by righteous citizens wielding the policy tools of the newly powerful federal government. Just as they had overcome the Southern assertion of states' rights, they would be victorious over the growing concentrations of private economic power that they viewed as fundamentally threatening the bedrock American value of equal economic opportunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reform Republicans created many tools for achieving their "new economic democracy," but perhaps none was so important to this project as the income tax. If the principal post-war threat to the Republic came from the great wealth that industrialization created for a few privileged people, and from the opportunities this wealth provided for corrupting political institutions, reformers needed above all else a legal means of redistributing wealth, thus diffusing the political power that great wealth provided. In 1894, Congress took its first tentative step in this direction by passing the Income Tax Act. Significantly, the heart of the Act was a definition of gifts and inheritances as income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Supreme Court wasted little time in striking down the Income Tax Act. In 1895, the Court ruled<sup>8</sup> that the Act constituted a direct tax on certain forms of income that did not meet the Constitution's requirement of apportioning such a tax according to population. Without a change in the Constitution, the Court concluded, all such efforts at taxing income would fail to pass constitutional review.<p>The constitutional obstacle was removed in 1913 with ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment.<sup>9</sup>  Congress quickly passed an income tax in 1914 that levied a 3 percent rate on all incomes above $30,000 (about $900,000 in 1996 dollars).<sup>10</sup>  It then launched the modern period of estate and gift taxation through the Revenue Act of 1916.<p>The Revenue Act of 1916 established rules for valuing a decedent's estate, for capturing taxable lifetime transfers into the estate, and for determining those transfers made for inadequate consideration and those that became effective only upon death. It created exemptions and deductions that continue to be a part of estate tax law today. Most important, the Act introduced progressive taxation into estate tax policy.<sup>11</sup>  This element clearly distinguished its public policy objective from earlier death taxes: The central mission of federal estate and gift taxation would be the redistribution of wealth.<sup>12</sup><p>After 1916, and despite a few efforts to retreat from estate and gift taxation immediately following World War I, taxes on intergenerational wealth transfers became a permanent feature of U.S. tax policy.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The history of wealth transfer taxation between 1920 and 1976 consisted largely of expanding the tax base for estate and gift taxes and increasing the tax rates. Congress raised the top marginal rate for estate taxes to 40 percent in 1924. In 1932, the top rate rose to 45 percent and the gift tax became permanent. The imminence of hostilities in 1941 caused Congress to search for additional revenues and led to a further increase in the top rate on estates to 77 percent.<sup>13</sup><p>Figure 1 shows the rapid increase in estate and gift tax collections after the end of World War II. Intergenerational taxes grew significantly in both amount and rate, even when adjusted for inflation. This growth probably stemmed as much from the demographics of the transfer taxes as from high tax rates: The late 1960s saw the beginning of generational transfers from those Americans who had weathered the storms of depression and world war. Transfers increasingly consisted of small businesses and farms as well as stocks, bonds, and liquid assets. And as the number of taxable estates containing businesses grew, so did the pressure for estate tax relief.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress recognized in 1976 that a tax intended to diminish the power of great wealth more frequently ended up taxing ordinary Americans who had accumulated taxable estates through nothing more than frugality, entrepreneurship, and plain hard work. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 addressed the concerns of these people through a number of policy changes. Specifically, the Act:
<ul>
<p><li>Unified the estate and gift tax, enabling taxpayers to apply unused gift tax allowances as deductions against their taxable estates;

<p><li>Lowered the top marginal rate to 70 percent and expanded the marital deductions for estates of moderate size; and

<p><li>Created special rules for estates consisting primarily of small businesses and family farms that allowed more of these entities to escape estate taxes altogether.<sup>14</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress's eagerness in 1976 to address problems with intergenerational taxation coincided with a growing understanding among many academics and politicians that high tax rates retard economic growth.<sup>15</sup>  This growing awareness led the Congresses of the 1980s to reduce the economic influence of intergenerational taxes, largely through tax cuts and more generous deductions. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 in particular reflected this redirection in public policy. For example, the Act created the unified credit that currently exempts the first $600,000 in an otherwise taxable estate from any tax liability,<sup>16</sup> and it cut the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. In addition, the Act further liberalized the rules governing the tax valuation of closely held businesses and farms, and lengthened the period of time for the payment of estate taxes by estates that contain such businesses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With few exceptions, tax and budget bills passed between 1981 and 1992 adhered to the policy changes contained in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.<sup>17</sup>  Even in the largest tax increase in U.S. history -- the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- it was apparent that revenue goals and not class warfare was the basis of the wealth tax provision. While Congress added two new rates (53 percent and 55 percent) to the estate and gift tax, these still did not go above Ronald Reagan's top rate. And while two new income tax rates (35 percent and 39.6 percent) were enacted, they still were just over half as high as the nearly confiscatory rates that prevailed during the administration of Dwight Eisenhower. In fact, without notice, wealth transfer tax policy has lost its ideological thrust. Its philosophical justification is disappearing; its roots in public policy are growing shorter every year; and its retention depends on its value as a revenue-raiser. But as we shall see later, besides its damaging impact on wealth creation and economic well-being, as a source of revenue it is more trouble than it is worth.<sup>18</sup><p><b>THE ESTATE AND GIFT TAX TODAY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current federal wealth transfer law is a confusing maze through which only the bravest taxpayers will travel without an experienced guide. The federal government taxes intergenerational wealth transfers through the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax systems.<sup>19</sup><p>

<b>The Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The largest component of the federal government's three-part wealth taxation system is the estate tax. Current estate tax law itself has three basic elements: 1) definition of the estate tax base, or the gross estate of a decedent; 2) deductions that can be made from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate; and 3) the computation of estate tax liability.
<ol>
	<p><li><b>The Tax Base</b><p><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estate tax law defines the gross estate of a decedent as the "fair market value"<sup>20</sup> of all personal or real property, wherever situated and however tangible, at the time of the decedent's death.<sup>21</sup>  This valuation of an estate's property attempts to quantify such property at its "highest and best use."  However, the valuation of a business or a farm on a "fair market value" standard may actually result in an artificially low value of an ongoing enterprise. For example, consider a start-up business in a good part of town. The owner suddenly dies, and his son wants to continue the business. If the estate tax value is determined by recent sales of other businesses located near it, then it may be valued at an amount well above its actual worth based on the cash generated by the business (which may even be operating at a loss in this early phase). This makes a big difference to an estate, since the business may have to be sold in order to pay the estate tax because the son is unable to raise a loan to pay the tax. In 1976, Congress recognized this negative potential of the "fair market value" rule and permitted estates containing small businesses and farms to be valued at their present use rather than at their "market value."<sup>22</sup><ul><p><li><b>Insurance Policies.</b> Special rules apply to the value of insurance policies contained in the decedent's estate. If the life insurance policy is paid out to benefit the estate, of if the decedent either held a property right in the policy or conveyed this property right within three years of death, then the value of the policy is added to the gross estate. A similar rule applies to annuities.<sup>23</sup><p><li><b>Joint Property.</b> A property rights rule also applies to property owned jointly by the decedent and someone other than the decedent's spouse: Such jointly owned property is included in the gross estate to the extent of the ratio of consideration furnished. With respect to property owned jointly with a surviving spouse, only 50 perc
ent of such property becomes a part of the gross estate.<sup>24</sup><p><li><b>Gifts.</b> Gifts and other transfers of property made by the decedent well before death also may be included in the gross estate if the decedent retained the ability to influence the disposition and use of such property. Similar inclusion in the gross estate applies to gifts that occur only upon death. However, sales of property and other alienation of property from the decedent's control made throughout his or her life are not included in gross estate.</ul>	

<p><li><b>Deductions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the total value of an estate has been calculated, numerous deductions may be applied. The result of these subtractions from the gross estate is the taxable estate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	
The first category of deductions relates to direct expenses of the estate: All costs of the funeral, of legal claims against the estate, of the executor's administration of the estate, and of mortgages paid by the estate may be deducted.<sup>25</sup>  Second, the value of property passing to the decedent's surviving spouse may be deducted. Finally, the estate may deduct the value of all charitable bequests to organizations recognized by the federal government as tax-exempt.

<p><li><b>Tax Liability</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The taxable estate that results from the application of these gross estate deductions is taxed according to a somewhat cumbersome four-step process. First, the value of all taxable gifts made over the decedent's lifetime is added to the net estate. Second, a before-credits tax is calculated by multiplying this "grossed up" estate by the relevant tax rate. Third, this before-credits tax is reduced by subtracting the tax on all gifts made after 1976. And fourth, various credits are applied to the remaining sum.<sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are four credits available for estate tax reduction, but by far the most significant is the unified transfer tax credit.<sup>27</sup>  This credit is a flat $192,800, which equates to a $600,000 net taxable estate. Thus, the unified transfer tax credit means that current law exempts from taxation all otherwise taxable estates up to $600,000 in value.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Above $600,000, estates face a tax rate table that contains no fewer than 17 different rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent. There is a 5 percent surcharge for estates between $10,000,000 and $21,040,000, intended to phase out the unified transfer credit. Thus, estates up to $21 million in value face a 60 percent marginal rate.<sup>28</sup></ol><p><b>The Gift Tax</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second layer of federal wealth transfer taxation is the levy made on lifetime property gifts. Like the definition of gross estate, current law contains a host of decisions that the courts and executors must make in determining the value of taxable gifts.<ol>	<p><li><b>The Tax Base.</b> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most difficult decision of all is the one that must be made first: determining the value of the decedent's lifetime giving. This difficulty arises on two fronts:
<ul><p><li>
<b>First,</b> a gift is the transfer of property for something less than full legal consideration to a party generally within the donor's family. On the one hand, the executor must determine which gift transfers meet the test of insufficient legal consideration. On the other hand, the executor must distinguish gifts made for income tax purposes that require "detached and disinterested generosity" from those that qualify for the gift tax.<sup>29</sup><p><li><b>Second,</b> the executor or the court must wrestle with the question of "fair market value."  The federal gift tax requires that <i>all</i> wealth transfers made as gifts over the decedent's entire life be valued for taxation. That means, incredibly, that appraisals of value must be made for gifts made decades before the decedent's death. Moreover, these gifts must be appraised in terms of their "fair market value" at the time they were made, which is a task that often stretches the frontiers of property appraisal to its breaking point.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such extraordinary efforts at valuation and record reconstruction must be made in order to determine whether the annual level of gift giving exceeded the allowed limits. An estate may exclude from the gift tax base all annual present interest gift transfers of $10,000 or less per donee.<sup>30</sup>  But if the donor made the gift to meet the donee's tuition or medical expenses, the limit does not apply. Furthermore, if the donor's spouse elects to make a similar gift to the same donee (a practice known as gift-splitting), the annual limit rises to $20,000. All gifts above these limits become part of the gift tax base.

	<p><li><b>Deductions.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 

Like the estate tax base, the gift tax base can be reduced by certain deductions. Besides gift-splitting, certain gifts to one's spouse may be deducted. Also, gifts to charities recognized by the IRS as tax-exempt organizations can be deducted from the gift tax base.<sup>31</sup>  Finally, special rules apply to the division of property in a divorce or separation, and this leads to more gift tax deductions.<sup>32</sup>	<p><li><b>Tax Liability.</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Computing the amount of gift tax is relatively simple. First, taxable gifts for the current and all previous calendar years are summed and taxed using the tax rate table for estates. Second, this total amount of gift tax then is reduced by any unused unified transfer tax credit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To illustrate, suppose that a married couple gave their only child $10,000 a year for a period of 20 years, for a cumulative total of $200,000. These gifts equal the maximum annual amount that taxpayers may exclude from the federal gift tax base. However, for four years this couple made additional gifts to their child of $100,000 a year, for a total of $400,000. This latter amount is above the limit and is taxable. Now suppose that the gross taxable estate of this couple equals $1,000,000, which includes the taxable gifts. The executor of the estate will use the unified credit of $600,000 to reduce the taxable amount and will pay taxes on the remaining $400,000, or the additional gifts the couple gave their child.
</ol><p>

<b>The Generation-Skipping Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wealth transfer taxes have been so consistently high throughout this century that a substantial cottage industry devoted to estate tax avoidance has blossomed within the legal and financial communities. One of their cleverest inventions was a trust established by a parent for the lifetime benefit of his or her children that passed tax-free to the parent's grandchildren upon the parent's death (or bypassed the children completely and went directly to the grandchildren). The trust avoided estate taxes altogether because such taxes are never levied on amounts that cannot be controlled by the taxpayer. However, some trusts were designed to pay out to the grandchildren upon the death of the taxpayer's children. Thus, the taxpayer could target specific individuals to receive benefits from the estate if the taxpayer could skip a generation through the creative use of a tax-free trust.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress enacted a cumbersome tax law change in 1976 to close the indirect generation-skipping transfer, but it left unaddressed the trust or bequest that directly skipped the parent's children. Both of these loopholes were addressed by Congress in 1986. As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress established a flat-rate tax of 55 percent on all generation-skipping transfers. Transfers subject to the tax are those made from a trust to a "skip person" (someone two or more generations removed from the donor); those made by a donor directly to a "skip person" without going through a trust; and those that result from termination of an interest in a property or trust, which usually happens upon the death of the donor.<sup>33</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with the estate tax and the gift tax, several exclusions and exemptions apply. The same $10,000 annual exclusion and tuition and medical exemptions found in the gift tax law apply to generation-skipping taxes. A total lifetime exclusion of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 for married couples) is allowed. Finally, transfers made prior to January 1, 1990, are exempt up to $2,000,000 ($4,000,000 for married couples).<sup>34</sup><p><b>THE LIBERAL CASE FOR REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This complex tax edifice rests on the foundation that taxing intergenerational wealth transfers results in less concentrated wealth holdings and that this leads in turn to greater economic opportunity and a more democratic society. Certainly simplicity cannot be raised in support of this tax policy, as the above discussion indicates. And, as Figures 1 and 2 show, the estate and gift tax cannot be justified as playing an important role in financing government: The unified estate and gift tax now brings in less than 1.7 percent of total federal revenues.
<p>

<b>The Liberal Egalitarian Argument for Intergenerational Wealth Taxation</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The case for the estate tax turns on the tax's effectiveness in achieving greater economic democracy through the redistribution of wealth. If its supporters cannot sustain the argument that the estate tax improves equality of economic opportunity, then there exists little else (except perhaps inertia) to recommend continuation of this part of U.S. tax policy. Other, simpler taxes could meet revenue objectives far more efficiently.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Academic support for intergenerational wealth taxation remains warm, in large part because of the role it plays in the most important theoretical treatise on liberal egalitarianism, John Rawls's <i>A Theory of Justice.</i><sup>35</sup>  Since its publication in 1971, this careful, magisterial presentation of the case for liberal democracy infused with just institutions has permeated thinking on most issues in social and political theory. It is fair to say that no stronger theoretical case for intergenerational wealth taxation exists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the center of Rawls's case for wealth taxation is the principle that "[a]ll social primary goods -- liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect -- are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the least favored."<sup>36</sup>  While at first blush this principle would appear to suggest radical egalitarianism in economic and political life, Rawls recognizes the superiority of "free" over socialized markets to produce benefits for the least advantaged citizens, which leads him and many like-minded political theorists to support significant differences in the economic conditions of individuals within a generation. After a century of economic experimentation, there can be little doubt that everyone achieves greater economic benefit when individuals are allowed to discover their own comparative advantage and focus their labor in the area where they can make the greatest economic difference.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tolerance for intragenerational differences leads Rawls to oppose all income taxes, since economic income stems from natural differences in talent and from differing propensities of individuals to apply themselves to hard work.<sup>37</sup>  However, two principled considerations compel Rawls to take substantial exception to intergenerational differences in economic condition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>First,</b> Rawls opposes the transfer of accumulated property to succeeding generations because it undermines the first principle of a just society: that everyone has "an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all."<sup>38</sup>  Those who begin with a significant unearned endowment of property resources place others not so advantaged in a less equal condition, and this undermines the principle that everyone should have access to the same system of equal basic liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Second,</b> this difference might be tolerated if it produced greater benefits for the least advantaged than for the advantaged. However, intergenerational wealth transfers create benefits that flow in the opposite direction: Over time, they enhance the advantages of inheriting generations and generally degrade the liberties of the unbenefitted. Thus, "[t]he taxation of inheritance and income at progressive rates (when necessary), and the legal definition of property rights, are to secure the institutions of equal liberty in a property-owning democracy and the fair value of the rights they establish."<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While Rawls does not advance confiscatory taxation of intergenerational wealth transfers, his argument does imply substantial taxing discretion by the state. In his universe, the state guides the institutions of distribution; should government determine that wealth transfers constitute significant barriers to the equal enjoyment of liberties (as defined by Rawls), it clearly has the power to tax away as much of the wealth that moves between generations as it deems necessary to restore justice.

<p>
<b>Objections to the Liberal Egalitarian Case for the Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A number of objections could be raised against the Rawlsian case for wealth transfer taxation, not the least of them being the questionable assertion of government authority over the intergenerational disposition of private property. If wealth is acquired legally and transferred peacefully (that is, in some non-tortious fashion that breaches no contract pertaining to the property), government has no ethical standing to interfere with its disposition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, liberal egalitarians claim a more expansive role for government, a principal element of which is the progressive enhancement of equality of condition among citizens. Thus, it is important first to consider the estate tax within the context of the argument that justifies the tax's existence. If it can be shown that the estate tax does not advance the ethical program of the liberal egalitarians, then other objections to this tax that can be raised without assuming this ethical and moral framework become more compelling.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This approach to analyzing the estate tax was taken in a seminal monograph by Edward J. McCaffery published in <i>The Yale Law Journal</i> in 1994.<sup>40</sup>  Professor McCaffery comes to the debate over the estate tax with impeccable political credentials. Unlike many critics of intergenerational taxation who frame their objections within a larger, politically conservative analysis of contemporary government, MaCaffery formulated his critique of the estate tax within a liberal framework. As he stated last year before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance:<blockquote>	I am an unrequited liberal, in both the classical and contemporary political senses of that word, whose views on social and distributive justice might best be described as progressive. I used to believe in the gift and estate tax as a vehicle for obtaining justice. As to the latter belief, only, I am now prepared to confess that I "was blind, but now can see."<sup>41</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;McCaffery raises five general objections to the liberal egalitarian argument supporting intergenerational wealth taxation. Each of them assumes the ethical and moral objectives of the liberal political program.
<ol>
<p><li><b>The currently combined income and estate tax system encourages large <i>inter vivos</i> gift transfers, which have the effect of creating a greater inequality of starting points or a less level economic playing field.</b> This predictable effect of the estate tax law is aggravated further by the fact that high estate tax rates encourage the consumption rather than the transfer of wealth. Purchasing goods and services instead of saving the funds that support that consumption produces larger differences between rich and poor people. Thus, the estate tax is illiberal because it undermines rather than advances the liberal egalitarian objective of equality of economic opportunity.

<p><li><b>While higher wealth transfer taxes might reduce the level of <i>inter vivos</i> gifts, and other tax law changes could be made to penalize the spending behavior of rich families, it currently is both practically and politically impossible to do so.</b> On the one hand, analysts are becoming increasingly aware of the intergenerational focus of much current saving behavior at all income levels. Liberals should promote the creation of transferable wealth among the less advantaged. On the other hand, politicians are becoming increasingly aware of how much voters want taxes to fall, not rise. The estate or inheritance tax has been repealed in Australia, Canada, Israel, and California; and the movement for tax reform is a spreading, worldwide movement.
<p>
<p><li><b>There will always be differences between the starting conditions of people in a non-ideal world.</b> If liberal egalitarians attempted to eliminate all the differences that stem from intergenerational wealth transfers, they would risk leaving the least advantaged even worse off than they were before. Not only would confiscatory taxation reduce the consumption behavior of wealthy people, thereby also reducing employment and incomes among poorer citizens, but it would depress the amount of economic capital as well, thereby reducing economic expansion and income growth, both of which are central to improving the conditions of the least advantaged.
<p>
<p><li><b>"[It] is the use and not the mere concentration of wealth that threatens reasonable liberal values."</b><sup>42</sup>  Generally speaking, the accumulation of savings and the promotion of earnings that underlie the growth of savings are "goods" that liberals like. Earnings and savings create a "common pool" of resources that can be used to promote improvements in the general welfare through public and private means. Liberals generally regard the consumption behavior of the wealthy as objectionable; thus, wealth transfer taxation, which attacks savings and promotes wanton consumption, is wholly ill-suited to the attainment of an ideal liberal society.

<p><li><b>The best tax policy that liberal egalitarians could pursue, if attaining liberal social and political objectives truly motivates the liberal program, is one that taxes consumption, not savings.</b> McCaffery writes that:<blockquote>

	[b]y getting our reasonable political judgments wrong -- by taxing work and savings while condoning, even encouraging large-scale use [consumption] -- the status quo impedes the liberal project....  The real threats to liberty and equality from private possession alone turn out, on closer scrutiny, to relate to possession <i>qua</i> potential or actual use, each of which can be addressed -- indeed, can <i>best</i> be addressed -- in a tax system without an estate tax.<sup>43</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not only, then, is the estate tax inconsistent with a liberal program of promoting equality of economic condition, but it encourages behavior that works against liberal objectives. It supports consumption and depletion by penalizing savings and earnings. It encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment upon which he will pay a 55 percent transfer tax as opposed to a campaign expenditure upon which no additional taxes are ever levied. How many new jobs and new businesses did Mr. Forbes's campaign create as opposed to the same amount saved in a bank that lends the funds to entrepreneurs and business managers?  Liberals and conservatives are beginning to answer this question in precisely the same way.
</ol>
<b>Few Friends.</b> The weaknesses of the estate and income tax system as a tool for redistribution long have been known, even to its academic friends. Joseph Stiglitz, who now serves as the Chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, concluded in 1978 that the estate tax effectively transfers resources from the saver to the spender, which, absent any offsetting tax policy change, reduces the stock of capital and leads to lower levels of national wealth.<sup>44</sup>  Furthermore, wrote Stiglitz,
<blockquote>
	because of capital accumulation effects, the estate tax may not achieve the objective to which it is presumably directed, that is, equalizing the distribution of income; if the government takes actions to offset these accumulation effects, the tax will lead to an increase in equality of income and wealth. The desirability of the estate tax may still be questioned, not only because of the distortions which it introduces but also because it may actually increase inequality in the distribution of consumption.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Alan Blinder, another member of the President's initial Council of Economic Advisers and subsequently Vice-Chairman of the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors, also has raised serious doubts about the redistributional promises of the estate tax.<sup>46</sup>  He has been joined by Michael Boskin, Martin Feldstein, Gary Becker, Laurence Kotlikoff, Lawrence Summers, and many other economists with prominent connections to mainstream economics.<sup>47</sup>


<p><b>THE ECONOMIC CASE AGAINST THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the Left's declining enthusiasm for the ideology of wealth taxes, two economic issues have added to the momentum for repeal. One is the mounting weight of economic and financial evidence against the estate and gift tax as such. The other is the rapidly spreading general view that income taxes and the multiple taxation of savings reduce economic growth, which in turn slows the rate of economic improvement by the least advantaged. Among the economic problems associated with the tax:
<ul>
<p><li><b>The estate tax raises little money and encourages inefficient tax-avoidance schemes.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Bolstering the skepticism about the efficiency of the estate and gift tax is the striking fact of how little revenue it raises for the federal government. Despite the tax's broad reach, theoretically touching upon nearly all transferable wealth, the unified tax raised only $14.7 billion in 1995.<sup>48</sup>  As Figure 1 shows, the estate and gift tax consistently has fallen as a percentage of total federal revenues, while at the same time the total amount of wealth has risen dramatically.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When a tax raises significantly less than the estimate of its potential, it is often because taxpayers have discovered ways to avoid the tax and have changed their economic behavior in ways that reduce the pool of funds from which the tax is drawn. To understand the extent to which this happens, it is necessary to estimate just what estate tax collections theoretically should look like.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Public finance economists have struggled for a long time with this question. Producing an adequate answer, however, requires knowing a great deal more than we now do about the size of legal tax avoidance and the degree to which taxpayers change their economic behavior in order to reduce their estate tax liabilities. Moreover, economists do not know the size of the wealth pool within which estates are formed. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically estimates household net worth, or the sum of durables, savings, and equities held by households.<sup>49</sup>  The Bureau currently estimates this net worth to be about $26.4 trillion, of which $8.4 trillion is in equities. While this amount by no means constitutes the tax base for the estate tax, a portion of this enormous sum most certainly does. For example, Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that slightly more than 50 percent of household wealth is held as intergenerational savings.<sup>50</sup>  If one assumes that this 50 percent (or $13.2 trillion) is transferred in equal amounts over two generations, or 46 years, then about $290 billion annually is moving to the next generation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even this figure probably overstates the tax base for the estate tax. Many economists argue that taxpayers who believe they will pay estate taxes will change their economic behavior in ways that result in a huge shrinkage of the estate tax base.<sup>51</sup>  B. Douglas Bernheim argues that high estate tax rates lead taxpayers to make far more cash gifts to their children than they otherwise would, in large part because their children pay taxes at lower rates than they do. Bernheim estimates that 50 percent to 75 percent of all intergenerational gifts are made because of the estate tax. Charitable gifts and other revenue losses are between 70 percent and 80 percent of total estate tax revenue. Put another way, indirect revenue losses in 1995 might have been $11 billion on revenues of $14.7 billion.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue data strongly imply significant tax avoidance and other economic behavior that responds to high tax rates by moving national wealth (and thus taxable estates) from savings to consumption. It is exceptionally difficult, however, for analysts to go from implication to quantification. Recent breakthroughs in the economic understanding of household savings may lead ultimately to convincing estimates of how much savings behavior stems from income and estate tax policy. Even so, economists can offer a number of important insights about the deleterious economic effects of tax policy on economic performance.
<p>
<li><b>The estate tax discourages savings.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Savings take many different forms -- cash reserves in a bank, stock in a corporation, art, land, housing, ownership of a business, and so forth -- that serve many different purposes. Households hold cash in a bank largely to finance future consumption, like the purchase of a house, or as a hedge against unanticipated household expenses like costly medical care. Similarly, the equity component of a mortgage is designed to be used to purchase future housing. These two forms of savings are largely liquid and thus earn relatively low rates of return. Households put money in a bank with the understanding that their funds can be withdrawn virtually at any time the household prefers. The bank, in turn, lends these savings with this same understanding in mind, and therefore prefers relatively short-term, low-risk loans that contain significant liquidity for the bank. So if a household saves in a long-term time deposit (for example, a 10-year certificate of deposit), it will demand a higher rate of return as compensation for not having these funds available for consumption. The bank, in turn, is freer to invest in riskier ventures for which it also can demand a higher rate of return. The bank's cost of a loan failure also falls when it is working with longer-term savings: It knows it has a certain period of time to make successful loans that cover its contract with the saver and yield the bank a profit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The decision to save largely follows this simple story. When households consume most of their income, any long-term investment must earn a high return. However, when they increase their savings relative to their consumption of income, they require less compensation for foregone consumption, and the required rate of return falls. Economists are divided between those who believe that households have a relatively fixed savings percentage over their lifetimes (which implies relatively fixed time preferences) and those who see the percentage of savings as something that fluctuates as certain preferences (including time or consumption) and costs (particularly taxes) change. It is this latter viewpoint that is particularly relevant to estate tax analysis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taxes play a role in savings decisions because they increase the cost of saving relative to consuming income. For example, if a household invests 25 percent of its income after taxes in a bank account that earns interest, it will pay additional taxes on any interest it takes as income. If another household decides to invest its 25 percent in corporate stocks, it will pay additional taxes on any capital gains it takes as income. However, if both households take that same 25 percent of after-tax income and buy expensive shoes, no additional income taxes will be collected. No doubt sales taxes will be collected on the shoe purchases, but sales tax rates are almost always less than the income tax rate one would pay on the same amount of money. Thus, taxes discourage saving by increasing its cost relative to consumption. If the household saves anyway, it will demand a higher rate of return to compensate it for the taxes it must pay on interest earnings. Likewise, a household purchasing stocks will demand a higher and more secure rate of return on its stocks. In both cases, the cost of capital to the borrower -- to the bank or to the corporation -- has risen because of taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One way for a household to save and avoid additional taxation is to purchase an asset like art or land that appreciates slowly over a very long period of time. This kind of purchase, however, also increases the economy-wide cost of capital by reducing the fund of money available to banks and businesses. Still another way to reduce the tax cost of saving is to invest in tax-advantaged funds, such as IRAs or 403(b) and 401(k) plans. These types of funds annuitize savings, which means essentially that only low-risk, long-term, low-yield to medium-yield investments will be supported by them. While they do reduce current tax liabilities, they are especially costly for the saver in two ways: In addition to shrouding these plans in penalties and taxes should they be liquidated before the saver reaches a certain age, the government has significantly discounted the future value of these savings by delaying taxes on earnings until they are at their highest level.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The unified estate and gift tax adds yet another layer of taxes on any savings decision a household makes. Successful saving always raises the possibility of creating a taxable estate, at which point the tax cost of a dollar saved increases by an amount somewhere between 7.4 cents and 55 cents. So if the household persists in its decision to save, it will require some long-term premium return on its investments roughly equal to its estimate that estate taxes will not be avoided. Naturally, this premium further increases the cost of capital.

<p><li><b>The estate tax hurts small business.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Investing in a business is one of the many forms of saving -- for some families, the only form. For most small firms, every available dollar goes into the family business -- the dry-cleaning business, the restaurant, the trucking company -- because the business creates an asset for the children and incomes for the owners. Women re-entering the work force after raising children often find self-employment the only entry-level employment open to them. Minorities know the reasons for self-employment only too well.
</ul><p><b>
Minorities Hit Hard.</b> All of the financial security provided by these businesses is put at risk if the owner dies with a taxable estate. In an important 1995 study of how minority businesses perceive the estate tax,<sup>53</sup> Joseph Astrachan and Craig Aronoff found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Some 90 percent of the surveyed minority businesses knew that they might be subject to the federal estate tax;

<p><li>About 67 percent of these businesses had taken steps (including gifts of stock, ownership restructuring, life insurance purchases, and buy/sell agreements) to shelter their assets from taxation;

<p><li>Over 50 percent of these same businesses indicated that they would not have taken these steps had there been no estate tax; and

<p><li>Some 58 percent of all the businesses in the survey anticipated failure or great difficulty surviving after determining their estate taxes.<sup>54</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Astrachan/Aronoff study echoes findings in a 1994 study by Patrick Fleenor and J. D. Foster of the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based tax policy organization,<sup>55</sup> who presented estimates of lifetime effective tax rates for a taxable corporation, a non-corporate business, an individual earning high amounts of labor income, and a large business. In each case, Fleenor and Foster found that the presence of the estate tax raised the lifetime tax rate to a figure above 65 percent. The large business simulation determined a tax rate of 72 percent. Nearly every public finance economist of the last 50 years has concluded that tax rates of this magnitude significantly reduce the taxpayer's willingness to earn more and take entrepreneurial risk. And these two effects -- reductions in labor and in new business formation -- directly depress the rate of general economic growth, which should deeply concern everyone interested in improving economic welfare in the United States.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Professor McCaffery appears unaware of the Fleenor/Foster study, it includes precisely the kind of evidence he has marshaled to assail the estate tax as inimical to the expansion of economic opportunity. He is not, however, unaware of Richard E. Wagner's important 1993 monograph, <i>Federal Transfer Taxation: A Study in Social Cost,</i> which ties together the many threads of this emerging theoretical canon on estate taxation.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Professor Wagner's study stands virtually alone in presenting macroeconomic estimates of the estate tax's effects on individual decisions to work and save. Using a model that trades labor for capital according to their relative costs and that represents this dynamic interaction through key indicators of macroeconomic activity, Wagner found that the tax premiums created by the estate tax raise the cost of capital sufficiently to reduce national output, employment, and capital stock by measurable amounts. In a simulation that modeled the U.S. economy without the current estate tax, Wagner found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) would have been $80 billion higher after eight years than in an economy without the estate tax;

<p><li>228,000 more jobs would have been created;

<p><li>The capital stock would have been $640 billion larger;<sup>57</sup> and

<p><li>The larger economy resulting from the repeal of estate taxes produced increases in all other taxes over the eight-year simulation period, though not quite by an amount equal to the loss of the estate tax.<sup>58</sup>
</ul><p>

<b>THE IMPACT OF REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While analysts have made significant progress in understanding the microeconomic effects of intergenerational taxation, the dearth of studies similar to Wagner's shows that much work still needs to be done on measuring the tax's macroeconomic effects. It is little wonder, however, that such studies are not more numerous. As Stiglitz noted, there are many remaining questions about the tax's effects on wealth accumulation. And without a good knowledge of these effects, economists cannot create that most elementary but crucial of concepts in any tax analysis: the tax base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bearing in mind these limitations, the author and Heritage Foundation analysts have estimated the economic impact of repealing the estate and gift tax beginning in 1997. The Heritage analysis made certain assumptions about the effect of repeal. Each of these assumptions was introduced into two leading models of the U.S. economy: the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 macroeconomic model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates.<sup>59</sup>  These two statistical models of U.S. economic activity are highly regarded, exceptionally accurate tools for estimating the effects of public policy changes on the general economy and are widely used for this purpose by America's leading corporations and government agencies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the substantial doubt that annual estate tax filings fully reflect the size of the tax base,<sup>60</sup> estimates of the tax's economic effects must start from another foundation. The macroeconomic estimates presented here were built from estimates of changes in the U.S. labor force and domestic capital stocks associated with removing the estate tax portion of the after-tax cost of labor and capital. These estimates then were introduced into the macroeconomic models to compute the effects.

<p>
<b>Cost of Capital Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The cost of capital (the so-called rental price of investment) results from at least three factors: 1) the cost of attracting investors to supply capital funds and not do something else with their money, 2) the ratio of a capital good's depreciation relative to the value of output it produces, and 3) taxes. If a business or a household borrows money, it must pay the lender or investor enough to attract that lender or investor away from other opportunities. A portion of this "opportunity cost" payment is the tax that the lender expects to owe on the loan's earnings. Under current law, a business may offset some of this tax premium by deducting its annual depreciation and interest payments. In some cases, businesses also may claim various investment tax credits that further reduce the tax premiums they have had to pay to lenders. However, a substantial portion of the cost of operating a business is not tax deductible, and this results in a positive, residual tax premium in real-world capital costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, taxes on ordinary income constitute a substantial percentage of the tax premium in the cost of capital. Every investor attempts to earn the highest possible return on every investment so that his earnings cover the income taxes the investment incurs. The estate tax, however, also is a part of this premium. Just as households are the source of all investment funds, they also are the source of all estate taxes. When individuals begin to see that their income and investment efforts will produce a future taxable estate, they generally do two things: see a financial advisor or estate planner, and increase their earnings requirements to build the funds needed to pay the wealth transfer taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Using data associating incomes with tax liabilities and holdings of corporate paper and equities, Heritage analysts estimated that the present value of future estate tax liabilities for the class of households that holds most corporate debt is slightly more than 3 percent of the average yield on corporate bonds. Thus, if corporate bonds currently yield 10 percent, eliminating wealth transfer taxes would reduce the required yield to 9.7 percent. This estimate of the estate tax component of the tax premium was used to adjust projected corporate bond yields over the period 1997 through 2005.

<p>
<b>Labor Effect Assumptions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economists also argue that high taxes reduce the supply of labor. At a certain point, when faced with rising taxes, workers decide to consume more leisure and produce less labor. Wealth transfer taxes are widely assumed to produce this effect, particularly among a class of individuals who clearly perceive the adverse tax consequences of working harder and building greater taxable net worth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To capture this effect of estate taxes and introduce it into the U.S. macroeconomic model, Heritage analysts estimated the number of wage or salaried workers and self-employed individuals in this same class of households that hold most of America's corporate debt. Eliminating the estate tax would be equivalent to increasing after-tax lifetime earnings by the average effective estate tax rate, or by 18 percent. This percentage, of course, is the minimum amount of earnings change that estate tax repeal would cause: A significant but unknown amount of time and income now is devoted to positioning assets and paying accountants in order to avoid significant estate tax liabilities. This estimate also fails to capture the substantial costs borne by taxpayers and relatives when businesses fail because of estate tax liabilities. In any event, multiplying a standard labor supply elasticity of 0.3 percent by this percentage reduction in taxes, and then multiplying this product times the 18 million individuals in this class of households, yields a labor supply effect of 97,200. This number was used to adjust upwards all estimates of the civilian labor force for the period 1997 through 2005.
<p>
<b>Budget Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Besides introducing new labor force and capital cost settings into the macroeconomic model, Heritage also made two adjustments in the federal government's budget for the period 1997 through 2005. First, the total amount of federal revenues was reduced by the forecasted amount of the estate tax. Second, expenditures for non-defense purchases were reduced by an amount exactly equal to the "lost" estate tax revenue. Thus, repealing the estate tax is assumed to be offset by spending reductions, so there is no net contribution to the deficit because of lost estate tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is highly likely that eliminating the estate tax would result in slightly greater federal income tax receipts. Without an estate tax, taxpayers would make fewer gift transfers to their children, who commonly pay income taxes at rates lower than their parents. However, estimating the size of this effect on income tax revenues involves overcoming a host of problems raised by incomplete estate tax data. The IRS simply is unwilling to disclose important details on intergenerational giving. Thus, the following analysis does not contain estimates of the positive effects of estate tax repeal on income tax receipts. If we had made these estimates, the macroeconomic effects of repeal would have been even more positive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By adapting the macroeconomic models in the manner described above, the resulting estate tax simulation measures the economic effects of repealing this tax on December 31, 1996. That is, it shows how differently the economy would have behaved had taxpayers not faced the prospect of estate taxes beginning in 1997. This simulated economy is compared to a "baseline" economy in which the current estate tax is still present. The differences between the baseline and simulated economies are the dynamic impacts of estate tax repeal. Again, these estimates should be viewed as a minimum assessment of the tax's economic effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Table 2 indicates that a stronger economy would result from the repeal of wealth transfer taxes.
<ul><p><li>
The most general measurement of economic health (GDP adjusted for inflation) quickly jumps above baseline by as much as 0.4 percent in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. The increase in real GDP averages $11.2 billion per year over the nine-year period between 1997 and 2005. Figure 3 shows the effects on GDP caused by estate tax repeal. When the Heritage assumptions are fed into the WEFA model, the economy grows above baseline by an average of $2.83 billion over this period.<sup>61</sup>
<p><li>
Behind the growth in GDP is a strong increase in investment. A drop in the cost of capital caused by estate tax repeal leads to increased business purchases of buildings and machines. Investment in the goods that make labor more productive grows 2 percent faster between 1997 and 2005 than it otherwise would. Using the WEFA model, investment grows 0.9 percent faster over this same time period. Economists widely believe that growth in capital goods is closely related to economic growth, and that this helps explain the higher growth in GDP.
<p><li>
In addition to stimulating the growth of private investment, repealing the estate tax reduces the tax costs that workers face. Lower taxes on income are widely believed to result in a larger labor force. The Heritage estate tax simulation results in a significant growth in non-farm private employment, whichever model is used. Total non-farm employment grows by an average of 145,000 above baseline during the nine-year period using the WUMM. This growth subsides in subsequent years as wages rise to reflect the greater productivity of labor caused by the greater amount of capital per laborer. By 2003, total non-farm employment has returned to its long-term growth trend. The Heritage analysis using the WEFA model estimates average employment growth to be 86,000 over this period.
<p><li>
Not only do businesses take advantage of lower capital costs to buy new plant and equipment, but families increase their purchases of new homes. Housing starts jump sharply during the first two years after repeal. The Heritage simulation using the WUMM model predicts that estate tax repeal would lead to a first-year increase of 49,000 in housing starts. This effect is caused by a significant drop in the mortgage interest rate. The fact that it does not drop more in subsequent years explains why housing starts return to baseline after the third year following repeal.
<p><li>
The boost in housing and the growth in business investment expenditures reflect the lower capital costs that result from removing the estate tax premium on capital. The cost of corporate capital and the secondary mortgage rate fall by an average of 21 and 27 basis points, respectively, in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. While this decline is less dramatic in the WEFA model, the user cost of capital remains solidly below baseline throughout the nine-year period. As economic activity builds following repeal of the estate tax, demand for capital rises, leading to small increases in both the long bond rate and the federal funds rate. Subtle elevations in these market lending rates would be the expected result in an economy that is adding more jobs and creating more capital goods than an economy still burdened by high tax rates.
<p><li>
The growth in household income also supports the increase in housing starts. Between 1997 and 2005, inflation-adjusted household disposable income (broadly, what is left after taxes) grows by an average of $12 billion per year in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM model. Similar growth also occurs in total personal income, which increases by an average of $8 billion per year. Both of these income indicators rise because of higher levels of employment, greater worker productivity, and stronger household and business consumption. The WEFA model shows inflation-adjusted disposable income rising by an average of $9 billion per year and personal income growing by an average of $5 billion per year over this nine-year period.
<p><li>
Despite the loss of $15 billion in annual revenue and $15 billion less in government spending, the federal deficit does not worsen over this nine-year period. In fact, the WUMM simulation shows that a stronger economy leads to deficit improvement. For each of the first seven years in the estate tax simulation, the deficit is slightly less after estate tax repeal than in an economy with an estate tax. During the last two years of the simulation, higher interest rates cause a gentle rise in federal expenditures. Te WEFA simulation indicates minor deficit changes throughout the nine-year period. Both simulations, however, point to the same conclusion: The economic benefits from estate tax repeal should not be sacrificed because of concerns about a federal deficit.
</ul><p><b>
CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is easy in this season of big tax reform proposals to overlook the federal estate tax. This tax, after all, is a relatively minor source of federal revenue that has been declining for the past 20 years. Indeed, many of those involved in the ongoing tax policy debate simply ignore it.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is a mistake. As this study has shown, the economic cost of the estate tax is many times greater than the revenue it produces, and its reach into American households extends far beyond those few which pay it. Every day, social and economic decisions are made with the estate tax in mind. Minority businesspeople suffer anxious moments wondering whether the savings they have built in their businesses, and that they plan to hand to their children, will be destroyed by the estate tax bill. Poor people, for whom the estate tax has no immediacy, wonder at the scarcity of entry-level jobs or the absence of low-cost educational loans. Factories drone on with worn-out equipment that would be replaced if capital costs fell. Women who have raised their children struggle to find ways to re-enter the work force without upsetting the family's estate tax avoidance plan. Rich people buy vacations in Vail and fine art in Lisbon, rather than new businesses that create jobs and incomes, because the government has a claim on more than half of everything they cannot spend.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The estate and gift tax does much to perpetuate the social and economic distortions produced generally by taxes on income. Should Congress repeal this tax, however, the result would be a growing economy, more abundant jobs, and offices and factories with the kind of new equipment that elevates productivity and supports higher wages. Lower capital costs also would mean new small businesses, which traditionally have served as economic havens for minority families and launching pads for young workers. By repealing the estate and gift tax, Congress would be making significant progress toward creating a tax policy that complements rather than undermines other efforts to expand economic opportunity by creating a growing economy.

    "Fair market value" apparently means the value of an asset that a fully informed buyer would pay in a market for the asset. The concept implies the existence of a willing seller and able buyer, which is rarely the case when an estate is valued for tax purposes. Thus, executors must rely on various proxy prices for an estate's assets, such as recent closing prices for stocks and bonds and property sales of similar assets that are contemporary with the death of the decedent. The value of "good will" is a particularly vexing problem in estate tax valuation. Due to the numerous artifices that executors and courts must employ to place a value on estates, the resulting "gross estate" frequently bears little relationship to its market value. For example, an estate consisting solely of art that has been held for many years may have little market value if the tastes of the art-buying public have changed dramatically during the holding period.
<p><li>
    While "fair market value" at the time of death is the most common method of quantifying a decedent's death, an executor of an estate paying tax can elect an alternative valuation date that is somewhat earlier or six months after the date of death. This alternative date method applies particularly to estates dominated by bonds or stocks in companies whose value is significantly affected by the death of the decedent. See 26 U.S.C. Secs. 2031(a) and 2032(a).

    This Study was prepared by The Heritage Foundation using tax simulation models developed by The Heritage Foundation and the Washington University Macro Model and the Mark 11 U.S. Macro Model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates. The methodologies, assumptions, conclusions, and opinions herein are entirely those of The Heritage Foundation. They have not been endorsed by, and do not necessarily reflect the views of, the owners of these two macroeconomic models.
<p><li>
    From an economic standpoint, a tax's base is composed of some quantifiable behavior that is being affected by the tax. The estate tax base could be viewed as the sum of all those dollars that are managed annually so as to avoid paying the tax, plus those that end up on a tax form.
<p><li>
     Even though these two estimates of additional GDP are different, the two models indicate the same general result: The economy grows more without the estate tax. The outputs of econometric models often differ, even when employing the very same assumptions, because of subtle differences in the theoretical viewpoints upon which the models are constructed. After all, such models are intended to give analysts insight into how changes in specific economic relationships affect the macroeconomy. The differences between the two models used in this study stem largely from WUMM's greater emphasis on the rental price of investment as a driver of economic activity.

<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Last winter's budget battle between Congress and the President was seen by most observers as a victory for the President and a defeat for fiscal conservatives in Congress who were attempting to make major reductions and reforms in government spending programs. But when the smoke cleared and the fiscal year (FY) 1996 budget process finally came to a close, it was apparent that while a rhetorical battle was lost, the budget war was won by the fiscal conservatives. And the victory was unprecedented in scope.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How complete was the victory?  The 104th Congress:<ul>

<p><li>Reduced year-over-year discretionary spending for the first time since 1969.

<p><li>Reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices between 1994 and 1996.<sup>1</sup>

<p><li>Eliminated over 270 programs, agencies, offices, and projects.

<p><li>Helped reduce the deficit to the lowest level in 14 years. Only President Reagan's FY 1982 budget deficit was lower.

<p><li>Enacted into law more privatizations in just one year than occurred during the entire eight years of the Reagan Administration.

<p><li>Forced a national debate on structural welfare reform and encouraged states to continue to overhaul their welfare systems. Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent-- reducing the demand for federal as well as state dollars. The 104th Congress included as part of welfare reform legislation much of the Wisconsin plan. Unfortunately, President Clinton chose to veto the bill.

<p><li>Deregulated the agriculture and telecommunications industries. Congress passed a 1996 farm bill that begins to bring an end to costly Depression-era agriculture programs by getting government out of the business of telling farmers what to grow. This was the most sweeping reform in 60 years. Farmers increasingly will be able to grow to meet the demands of the market rather than the federal government. In addition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminates decades worth of outdated rules and restrictions on the telephone, cable, and broadcast industries. It will expand job and export opportunities within the industry, lower the cost of basic communications services, and free consumers to choose between competing providers of service.</ul><p>



<b>WHAT BUDGET DEFEAT?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although many in Congress have come to believe that they lost the budget war, the facts indicate otherwise. As the final FY 1996 budget reveals, this Congress accomplished an unprecedented reduction and elimination of unneeded federal programs, federal bureaucrats, and federal spending. To be sure, Congress did not close any of the four Cabinet departments -- Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development -- it targeted. Nor did it see its ambitious national reforms in welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare signed into law. But the hundreds of reforms it did accomplish were comprehensive and far-reaching. Indeed, many of its accomplishments were far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan Administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the discretionary budget accounts alone, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969 as a result of program terminations and major cuts. More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. These include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts, the Office of Technology Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, the Administrative Conference of the United States, and hundreds of other programs throughout the government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	And whereas Congress fell short in its efforts to terminate such targeted programs as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Legal Services Corporation, it cut their budgets substantially and forced them to curtail activities. Indeed, even by early Reagan-era standards, the reforms are unprecedented. Examples:<ul>

<p><li>The first Reagan budget proposed to cut the National Endowment for the Arts by 27 percent, but achieved a 17 percent reduction. This Congress cut the Endowment by 38 percent. 

<p><li>Reagan wanted the National Endowment for the Humanities cut by 23 percent in his first budget, but achieved 20 percent. This Congress cut it by 36 percent.

<p><li>Reagan proposed to cut mass transit subsidies by 10 percent; this Congress cut them by 43 percent.

<p><li>Congress cut the Appalachian Regional Commission by 39 percent and the Legal Services Corporation by 33 percent. Both agencies were slated for termination by the Reagan Administration and by this Congress, but both survived, albeit with significant reductions in funding. 

<p><li>HUD's budget was cut by $2.6 billion -- or by 10 percent compared with spending for the previous year. 

<p><li>Both this Congress and the Reagan Administration failed in their plans to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which once again demonstrated its impressive skills at self-preservation, but this Congress made a real and deep cut. Reagan proposed a 25 percent cut, but CPB's budget rose $10 million in his first year. This Congress substantially reduced CPB's spending last year through the rescission process, cutting planned spending by $37 million in 1996 and $55 million in 1997.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


As a result of these and hundreds of other cuts, freezes, and terminations, this year's budget deficit is expected to total $146.3 billion, in contrast to the $193.8 billion expected for this year by President Clinton as part of his budget plan in 1993, and the $196 billion projected in the FY 1996 baseline. Importantly, three-quarters of this deficit improvement is due to the spending reductions enacted by the 104th Congress. As noted earlier, FY 1996's projected deficit will be the lowest since President Reagan's FY 1982 budget.
<p>

<b>HOW CLINTON HAS TRIED TO STOP ENTITLEMENT REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Obviously, the deficit would have been much lower had Congress been as successful with the federal entitlement programs as it was with the discretionary spending accounts. Unfortunately, multiple vetoes by the President of repeated congressional efforts to enact reforms in major entitlement programs like welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid have left federal spending higher than it could have been and rendered future reform efforts more difficult.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But in welfare, at least, the congressional emphasis on welfare reform, including its passage by the House as part of the Contract with America, has encouraged many states to press the White House for waivers of current rules to enable these states to reform their welfare systems along the lines proposed by the House and Senate. President Clinton, fortunately, has agreed to many of these waiver requests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	As a result of these reforms, and despite the lackluster national economy, the number of Americans on welfare has fallen by 1.3 million between 1993 and the present, for an overall decline of 9 percent. <sup>2</sup> Since taking office, Wisconsin's Governor Tommy Thompson has effectively reformed his state's welfare program and reduced caseloads by 40 percent.Unfortunately, President Clinton has blocked the rapid expansion of successful state programs like Wisconsin's to the rest of the nation by vetoing federal welfare reform legislation that would have removed the need for cumbersome waiver requests.
<p>

<b>PRIVATIZATION FINALLY MOVES FORWARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Perhaps in no other area was the difference between past and present performance as dramatic as it was in the 104th Congress's success in privatizing government-run enterprises. Spurred forward by the House Speaker's appointment of Representative Scott Klug (R-WI) to head up the House's privatization effort, numerous privatizations have been successfully concluded, often with bipartisan support and White House cooperation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The Reagan Administration was able to privatize only Conrail and the National Consumer Cooperative Bank, because of intense congressional opposition during the 1980s. But in one year, this Congress has enacted legislation to privatize four major government programs. Although first proposed and developed in the mid-1980s by the Reagan Administration, it took this Congress to pass the legislation (which the President signed into law) to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval Petroleum Reserve, and the Alaska Power Marketing Administration. Passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate is legislation to privatize the government's National Helium Reserve in Texas. Although final transfer prices remain to be determined, the estimated revenues to the federal treasury from these four sales will be several billion dollars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In addition to these asset sales, this Congress has initiated many contracting out opportunities which will allow the government to provide better services at lower costs. During the first session, for example, Congress enacted legislation to contract out the Internal Revenue Service's debt collection efforts, the General Services Administration's commercial real estate brokerage functions, the special forecasting functions of the National Weather Service, and selective map-making functions throughout the federal establishment.

	Perhaps encouraged by the more favorable privatization environment in Congress, the Clinton Administration dusted off and improved a Reagan Administration proposal -- called Fed Co-Op -- to set in motion an employee buyout of the background investigations functions previously provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.<sup>3</sup>  Involving approximately 700 federal employees, and structured as an employee stock ownership plan with a projected 90 percent employee ownership share, the transfer is scheduled to take place in mid-July. Unfortunately, there are concerns that some House lawmakers may attempt to thwart it in an effort to preserve the civil service status    quo.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	More generally, Congress included in this year's defense authorization bill (Section 357 of P.L. 104-106) language that mandates a more systematic appraisal of contracting opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD). Although Defense has been one of the few government agencies to take advantage of contracting opportunities, much more could be done. DOD estimates that its cost savings through contracting have averaged 31 percent on contract competitions between 1978 and 1994, and that the savings now total nearly $1.5 billion per year. <sup>4</sup> 
<p>

<b>OTHER POLICY CHANGES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Both the telcommunications and agriculture sectors of the economy were the targets of significant legislative reforms that will place more responsibility and decision making in the hands of private participants operating in the competitive marketplace. And just getting underway in Congress are a series of efforts to overhaul the federal government's involvement in virtually all facets of America's national and local transportation systems. Perhaps indicative of the shape this effort will ultimately take are some innovative pieces of legislation that have been or soon will be introduced in Congress. These include prospective legislation that would devolve much of the federal highway program to the states, as well as existing legislation that would privatize the airports, transfer Amtrak responsibilities to regional compacts created by the states, and remove the trouble-plagued Federal Aviation Administration from the Department of Transportation.
<p>

<b>THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 As impressive as this Congress's performance was, it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervades the federal government. As noted earlier, largely untouched were the costly entitlement programs for welfare, Medicaid, and Medicare. These should be revisited during the FY 1997 budget process and should be campaign issues at all levels of government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Furthermore, opportunities for extensive and cost-saving privatization remain, with the four power marketing administrations prime candidates for commercialization and self-sufficiency. Potential revenues to the government from their sale have been estimated at between $8 billion and $20 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Other areas for privatization include all facets of government's role in the transportation sector, including airports, air traffic control, highways, mass transit, and Amtrak. And building on the progress described earlier, Congress and the Administration should be more aggressive in seeking contracting opportunities to improve service at reduced costs. As noted in a Heritage study published last year, budgetary savings of at least $9 billion per year could be achieved through contracting.<sup>6</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 Finally, and notwithstanding the impressive reforms made in the thousands of discretionary government programs, much more could and should be done. Savings of an additional $20 billion should be the goal of the FY 1997 budget. As a casual reading of the hundreds of reports produced by the government's Inspectors General reveals, waste and mismanagement are still pervasive throughout the federal establishment and have largely survived the first round of budget cuts. Indeed, there is recent evidence to suggest that in response to budget cuts, government bureaucracies have engaged in the traditional "Washington Monument" ploy -- cut services to the public instead of making efficiencies in program overhead.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	For example, the National Park Service has been highly resistant to the use of contractors to provide routine services such as entrance fee collection, janitorial work, and campground management, preferring instead to use more costly uniformed personnel to perform these services. As a result, and in response to limits placed on the growth of its budget, the Park Service has announced a series of service cutbacks in the form of reduced hours and closed campgrounds just as vacation season is getting underway. Such bureaucratic games should not be tolerated by Congress. Lawmakers should require the Park Service to seek savings through management efficiencies rather than service cutbacks. 
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The record of the last year's budget battle clearly demonstrates that, although the tactical victory may belong to the President, the strategic victory belongs to the 104th Congress. Many of its members, particulary the freshmen, arrived in Washington with an electoral mandate to cut the budget. It was a mandate they honored, and in doing so they accomplished the first reduction in discretionary spending since 1969.

<center><h2> The Naturalizers </h2>
<b>By John J. Miller</b>
<p>
<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
<a href="toc.html">July-August 1996, Number 78</a></i>
<hr width=50%></center>
<blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Come November, hundreds of thousands of immigrants are likely to cast their first votes in a presidential election. That's because record levels of foreigners have filed applications for citizenship with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Last year, 1.2 million of them formally sought citizenship, up from an annual average of only 230,000 in the 1980s. To handle these numbers, the INS has pumped an extra $80 million into its naturalization budget. But the waiting list continues to grow.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This rush to citizenship offers us both opportunity and danger. We have the opportunity to help more immigrants become Americans, and thus protect our country from the dangers of Bosnia-style multiculturalism or Quebec-style separatism. The danger is that, to cope with the volume of applications, the INS will lower its naturalization standards and devalue citizenship like a worthless peso.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Preparation for the tests and ceremony of citizenship has long been a powerful instrument of unity, an engine of assimilation that turns newcomers into U.S. citizens who understand our political traditions and are proud to be Americans. A citizenship ceremony is among the most moving events in American public life. Patriotic songs and colorful speeches about freedom and opportunity fill the program. The event concludes with a duty-bound oath in which immigrants forsake foreign political allegiances and pledge themselves wholly to their new country. As new citizens pick up their official citizenship papers, they also receive small American flags and voting information. Friends and family greet them outside. The day will be remembered the way most Americans remember graduations, weddings, and the birth of children.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; All of the difficult moments leading up to citizenship reinforce its meaning for the participants. In order to naturalize, immigrants must  live in the United States for five years. They must pass an FBI criminal background check. Ultimately, they will have to be interviewed by an INS officer and demonstrate the ability to speak, read, and write in English (with some exceptions for elderly applicants) and pass a test on U.S. history and government. Only those who really want citizenship will get it. And when they do, they enjoy a satisfaction that most other Americans can never experience. "Citizenship makes me feel at home in America, like I really belong here," said Mohsen Borhani, an immigrant from Iran, shortly before he became a citizen last fall.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This process of naturalization, and the accumulation of enough cultural capital to acquire citizenship, ultimately yields more than a set of political entitlements. It infuses new citizens with a sense of duty and loyalty to their new home. "I am no longer a Canadian and it is long past time to assume the responsibility that comes with American citizenship," said Adele Hardwick, a Canadian immigrant, right before she naturalized last November. "The right to vote is a great privilege," added the German-born Erling Hans Ulstein. "I would like to take part in the democratic process and know that I didn't just live and work here, but did my part as an American citizen," he said.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; With so many new applications for citizenship, however, the INS is threatening to lower its standards to the point where naturalization is no longer a meaningful experience. Naturalization receives little sustained attention from academics, politicians, and the media. Perhaps as a consequence, our notion of citizenship has cheapened since the turn of the century. Like a school that advances failing students to the next grade, the INS now pressures its examiners to push potential citizens through the system quickly, even if they are questionable candidates. Agents hint that their superiors are more concerned about meeting a quota than making sure everybody does a good, thorough job.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"We have about 15 minutes for each interview," says Dan Childs, an INS officer based in Arlington, Virginia. "If I want to take a little extra time to check something, it really backs things up. We're always behind, even if things go smoothly. I usually skip my lunch hour just to catch up. You can guess what you want about the INS giving us so many appointments and so little time." What's more, the tests on U.S. history and government are hardly demanding. In the Arlington office, successful applicants need to score only seven out of 12, or 58 percent. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The INS is now considering lowering its standards even further. The agency is reviewing proposals to water down the language requirements and exempt entire classes of immigrants from the test on U.S. history and government. INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has even suggested eliminating altogether the mandatory personal interviews in order to save time, and a battery of civil-rights organizations have egged her on. Hispanic activist Harry Pachon says that the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which he used to head, promotes naturalization because citizenship "is the missing ingredient to Latino empowerment strategies."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For activists like Pachon, naturalization is not an important aspect of the complicated assimilation process, but a political power grab. The easier, the better. Leticia Quezada of the Los Angeles School Board wants to break down the distinction between citizens and noncitizens entirely by giving the vote to people who have not naturalized. "At one time only white males could vote," she says. "My position is that it's time we cross the line in terms of citizenship." Illegal aliens are already counted as constituents in congressional apportionment under the rules of the 1982 Voting Rights Act, even though they can't vote. California, for example, may have as many as three extra seats in Congress because of its illegal immigrant population.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Statements and policies like these won't calm Americans' jitters about immigrants. In one recent poll, 66 percent said that the United States is no longer a melting pot. Around the globe, they see cultural differences tearing countries apart. Many Americans are beginning to wonder: If immigrants in all of their racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity fuel the "balkanization" of America, then what good are they? Naturalization is the only legal instrument that allows the United States--a "nation of immigrants"--to decide who is an American and who is not. Without it, the cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Americans once expected immigrants to naturalize--and to do it for the right reasons. In the early part of this century, a broad social movement set its sights on the "Americanization" of the U.S. foreign-born population. The Americanization Movement was in essence an educational drive to promote the assimilation of the millions of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe who swarmed to the United States on the eve of the First World War. The Americanizers, according to historian Edward George Hartmann, encouraged a barrage of "special classes, lectures, and mass meetings, where [immigrants] might be instructed in the language, the ideals, and outlook on life which had come to be accepted as the traditional American point of view." They made naturalization central to their efforts, since it would help transform foreign nationals into patriotic Americans.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This was the vision of the Founding Fathers for their new republic. Their main concern regarding immigration was whether newcomers would rid themselves of any undemocratic principles that they might have learned in unfree lands. Would America's openness ultimately usher in people with opposing values?	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"To admit foreigners indiscriminately to the rights of citizens, the moment they put foot in our country," wrote Alexander Hamilton, "would be nothing less than to admit the Grecian horse into the citadel of our liberty and sovereignty." The solution, according to Hamilton, was to draw immigrants gradually into civil society, "to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American attachments; to learn the principles and imbibe the spirit of our government; and to admit of a philosophy at least, of their feeling a real interest in our affairs."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Americanization Movement drew from these principles. When President William McKinley fell in 1901 to the bullet of anarchist Leon Czolgosz--an American by birth but of obvious foreign parentage--people looked to naturalization, not restriction, as an answer to their so-called immigrant problem. After McKinley's death, the Sons of the American Revolution rushed to print a small leaflet entitled <i>A Welcome to Immigrants and Some Good Advice.</i> It urged immigrants to become citizens as soon as possible. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Since 1907, more than 13 million immigrants have become citizens. According to the 1990 Census, more than half of all adult immigrants who had arrived before 1985 were citizens in 1989. Even so, few immigrants come to the United States because they want to be Americanized. The vast majority migrate to improve their economic status. Assimilation, however, starts to work on newcomers immediately as they pick up a few words of English and become familiar with American customs and mores. Any decision to naturalize comes gradually. The choice is very difficult, because it involves thorny questions of loyalty, identity, and family. Naturalization may lead to full membership in American society, but it can also seem like a betrayal of one's heritage.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; But as the years go by, immigrants form families, buy homes, and sink roots in the community. They begin to understand how citizenship can improve their quality of life. Like any characteristic of assimilation, the rate of naturalization increases over time. By the end of 1993, about 38 percent of immigrants who arrived in 1982 had naturalized, as had about 41 percent of those who came in 1977. Immigrants who naturalize typically do so after living in the United States for about 10 years. Asians and Africans tend to naturalize more quickly than other groups. Canadians and Mexicans tend to wait the longest.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The bureaucratic inefficiencies of the INS--which has a reputation for being one of the worst-run federal agencies--stand in the way of many applicants. One study estimates that a third of all applicants abandon their quest for citizenship before any formal resolution. In some INS districts, the wait between the first application and the actual citizenship ceremony can be two years. With dozens of forms, questions, and interviews to navigate, it is easy to give up.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For those who persevere, the formal citizenship interview is the cornerstone of the process. The one-on-one encounter with an INS officer lasts for about 15 minutes. Nobody but a lawyer may accompany the naturalization applicant. The INS examiner's first priority is to make sure that every form in the citizenship application is complete and that the FBI criminal background check has not turned up anything unsavory. His second task is to determine a candidate's English-speaking ability.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The test on U.S. history and government is next. The exams all draw their content from a series of short books published by the INS. Their actual administration, however, can vary considerably among the INS districts, which are allowed to develop their own testing procedures. They may be conducted orally or in written form. Applicants who pass a fill-in-the blank test generally are assumed to have met the English-language reading and writing requirements. The questions are simple enough: "Who was the first president of the United States?" "Why do we have a holiday on the 4th of July?" "Who makes the laws in the United States?" They also may ask applicants to name their governor or one of their senators. Some questions have several possible answers. If a test asks "Who was Abraham Lincoln?", an INS examiner will accept any of these responses: the 16th president, author of the Emancipation Proclamation, deliverer of the Gettysburg Address, president during the Civil War, the president who freed the slaves, and so on. Some of the questions are a little tricky. If asked "Who elects the president?", most Americans will say, "the people." The correct answer, however, is the electoral college.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Passing the exam does not require a perfect score. The INS office in Seattle, for example, uses an oral test with 16 questions--eight in history and eight in government. Four correct in each category earns a passing grade. In truth, the majority of test-takers do not squeak by--they do quite well. Most score in the 80 to 90 percent range. Scores of 100 percent are common.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Americanization Movement of the early 20th century viewed the classroom as an important tool, both to teach newcomers how to speak English and to instill them with the value of citizenship. Immigrant-aid organizations, community colleges, and adult education programs continue to offer citizenship training courses today, but their impact on the foreign-born population is probably not as great as it was 80 years ago. Part of the problem is that public agencies like the INS do not encourage immigrants to enroll in citizenship education. Cost is not the reason, since civics instruction is cheap. Rather, they generally have not engaged in the types of innovative partnerships with local groups that can boost interest in naturalization, streamline the INS, and ultimately Americanize people who might otherwise be left out of the system. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; One exception, however, can be found in Seattle, Washington. A program there could serve as a model for the whole country and allow a new spirit of Americanization to regain a foothold in the naturalization process.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Students who enroll in one of the 21 citizenship classes offered by community colleges, churches, and immigrant-aid organizations in the region receive special consideration from the INS. They are screened for English fluency and pay a tuition of $60 to $120, depending on where they learn, in addition to standard INS application fees. But instead of waiting half a year for their INS interview, as is common in Seattle, students wait just 10 weeks. During this period, they attend citizenship class and prepare for the INS exam, which they take in the 10th week. The waiting list for the initiative has hundreds of immigrants on it.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; For three hours a night, four nights a week, Greg Gourley serves as an an instructor in the program. He tells his students what they will need to know in order to pass the INS naturalization exam--plus a lot more. Like test-takers everywhere, many naturalization applicants simply want to earn a passing grade. Gourley teaches to the test, but includes a lot of information that probably will not be on it. "Being a citizen is about more than just passing an exam," he says. For example, he instructs the class in the Pledge of Allegiance. By the third or fourth week, everyone has memorized it. They recite it at the start of each class, even though none will be asked anything about the pledge during their naturalization interview. "Just about every kid in the United States knows that pledge," says Gourley. "It's important for these people who are going to be citizens to know it, too."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Students take the classes because they have some learning to do. "The Soviets didn't teach us anything about America--nothing true, anyway," says Viktor Bozhko, a Ukrainian in a citizenship course at Lake Hills Baptist Church, in Bellevue. "This is the best way for me to learn about my new home." Says the Cuban-born Ramon Negrin, one of Gourley's students at Bellevue Community College: "This is a good refresher course. It's making me proud to be an American."	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; These citizenship courses deepen immigrants' understanding of U.S. history and government. They turn borderline cases into applicants who ace their exams. They also can bring new people into the system by instilling those who otherwise would hesitate to apply with the knowledge and confidence they need to pass. Receiving 20 to 30 hours of citizenship instruction over 10 weeks' time would teach something to just about anybody, from a thoroughly assimilated immigrant to a well-educated native. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Immigration and Naturalization Service doesn't have the resources to provide this education itself. What is needed is a modern-day Americanization Movement of private and local public institutions that would revive the old-fashioned ideal of civics instruction for immigrant adults, at a time when millions of them suddenly want to naturalize.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; This mission is doubly important for immigrants, most of whom cannot fall back on childhood stories about patriot Nathan Hale's regret that he had "but one life to give" for his country, or President Lincoln's determination that government "of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth." Yet they must learn such stories, for this is the stuff of which citizens--citizens of a nation dedicated to a proposition--are made. Ben Franklin once remarked that our Constitution offers Americans "a republic--if you can keep it." Turning immigrants into citizens, into Americans who cherish both their freedoms and their responsibilities, may be the surest way to keep this republic safe through the ages.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

"Today our federal [work force] is 200,000 employees smaller than it was the day I took office as President."

<p>-- President Bill Clinton, State of the Union Address, January 23, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
President Clinton wants to convince the American people he has pared back the bloated federal work force. The American people certainly have every reason to resent the large number of federal bureaucrats whose apparent mission is to turn their daily lives into the sort of nightmares described in the novels of Franz Kafka. These bureaucrats include auditors from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) scrutinizing tax returns, regulators from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undermining productive enterprises, and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) trying to seize the guns of law-abiding citizens. Reducing the numbers of these bureaucrats should and will be popular with the American people.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The disturbing thing is that most of the eliminated positions cited by President Clinton are not coming from the IRS, the EPA, the ATF, or similar regulatory or enforcement agencies. The vast majority of the positions being eliminated belong to the people who helped win the Persian Gulf War. In short, most are from the Department of Defense. For example:<ul>

<p><li>Some 60 percent of the 200,000 eliminated positions cited by the President come from a single department, the Department of Defense.<sup>1</sup><p><li>Personnel reductions at the Pentagon are even more severe than the President would have Americans believe. The personnel reductions cited by President Clinton include only federal civilian employees, including those at the Department of Defense, but not active duty or reserve component military personnel. In fact, total federal employment, including both civilian and military personnel, as of the end of fiscal 1997 will have dropped by 849,000 positions from levels prevailing at the end of FY 1992.<sup>2</sup><p><li>Of all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of FY 1992, over 89 percent (almost 760,000) will have come solely from the Department of Defense (see <a href="bgup278c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).

<p><li>President Clinton's cuts in defense jobs have not been limited to the public sector (see <a href="bgup278c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Defense industry jobs by the end of FY 1997 will have dropped by 795,000 positions from levels prevailing at the end of FY 1992.<sup>3</sup><p><li>In 1997, there will be 1.5 million fewer defense jobs (including those in the military, the civil service, and industry) than in 1992 (see <a href="bgup278c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).<sup>4</sup>  In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. Meanwhile, IRS employment has dropped by only 6 percent, ATF positions have dropped by less than 5 percent, and EPA positions have <i>increased</i> by over 2 percent (see <a href="bgup278c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).</ul>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The President's policies punish defense employees in the private sector as well. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA, and ATF watching their every move and telling them how to live their lives. But they do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War.
<p>
<b>RESTORING BALANCE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICY</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
To restore balance to federal employment policy, the Clinton Administration should:<ul>

<p><li>Freeze military personnel reductions at the level recommended by the Clinton Administration in its 1993 "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy. This amounts to about 2.4 million positions, including active troops and reserves. A military of this size should be adequate to handle the nation's future military requirements. However, within these limits, the Pentagon should be flexible in dividing the number of billets for active and reserve forces. The Administration should decrease personnel strength in the Army National Guard and increase the number of active duty personnel, who are better suited to addressing the short-notice conflicts likely to arise in the post-Cold War world. Moreover, since the Navy's power projection capabilities are particularly suited to the post-Cold War security needs of the U.S., the Administration should ensure that the number of naval personnel is relatively higher than the number for other services.

<p><li>Limit further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts. The current excessive reliance on public sector civilian employees to perform such routine services as depot maintenance of equipment for the Department of Defense and the military services should be reduced. Current law requires that public employees perform no less than 60 percent of this work. The private sector certainly is more efficient in performing maintenance and other services. Savings can be achieved by privatizing a significant number of services and allowing defense contractors greater flexibility to do the work. Additional civilian work force reductions outside the privatization effort, however, should be limited. This will ensure that civilian support and management positions within the Department of Defense are adequate to meet the needs of the military force required for U.S. security in the post-Cold War world. 

<p><li>Increase the Department of Defense procurement budget. Procurement funding -- the money the Pentagon spends to buy new weapons -- has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985. This has caused the loss of over 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the employment peak in 1987. Annual real increases in the procurement budget, which provides much of the money for defense industry jobs, will reverse this trend and help preserve the defense industry jobs that are necessary for a strong national defense. These increases are needed to replace aging weapons and equipment that will become obsolete by early in the next decade.

<p><li>Concentrate federal work force reductions within non-defense departments. Further reductions in non-defense civilian positions in the federal government should result from a policy of eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies. Putting caps or ceilings on the federal civilian work force does little to reduce the size or scope of government. In fact, it may lead to the poor delivery of government services by failing to distinguish between successful and failed federal programs. Instead, work force reductions should come from eliminating unnecessary agencies, consolidating similar programs, devolving authority to the states, simplifying taxes, and pursuing a policy of deregulation. The Heritage Foundation's budget plan, <i>Rolling Back Government</i>, would reduce the federal government from its current level of 14 cabinet-level departments to five.<sup>5</sup>  The plan also would reduce the non-defense federal work force by approximately 10 percent over the next five years (FY 1997-2001).</ul><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Reducing the federal work force is an appropriate goal. The American people should demand the elimination of wasteful bureaucracies. But cutting into America's fighting force and then claiming credit for downsizing the government is not only misleading, but damaging to national security. In essence, Clinton's federal employment policy is a cloak hiding the Administration's policy of weakening America's military strength.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Now that the true impact of President Clinton's federal employment policy has been revealed, Congress should set about the task of restoring balance to the federal work force. It should limit further reductions in the defense sector and focus instead on dealing with the real cause of waste in government: the bloated non-defense federal bureaucracy.

<h3>THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION: NEW FUNDING, NEW LOOPHOLES, OLD GAMES</h3>

(Updating <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1057.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1057</a>, "Why the Legal Services Corporation Must Be Abolished,"  October 18, 1995.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, supporters and employees of Legal Services Corporation (LSC) grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation, both by mounting a massive lobbying campaign -- paid for in part by federal funds -- and by devising loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. Faced with renewed pressure to reform and cut spending in 1995, the LSC responded with a new set of subterfuges and strategies designed to assure business as usual.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The LSC's actions during the past year prove that the legal services network is fundamentally unreformable. In addition, the efforts of LSC grantees to secure new funding sources indicate that subsidized legal services for the poor would continue to be available even without federal aid. It is therefore time to abolish all federal funding for legal services.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders struck a compromise which included reduced, though still significant, funding for the LSC coupled with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. In light of the past year's events, Congress should reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998 in the FY 1997 Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.
<P>
<b>Background</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federally funded civil legal assistance to the poor, first offered under Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, was institutionalized in the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974. From its inception, the Legal Services Corporation, with its 323 local affiliates and 17 support centers, has been viewed as one of the most politicized of federal programs. Liberals have cheered LSC as a force for "social justice," but conservatives have criticized it as offering taxpayer funding for radical activism and expansion of the welfare state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Though President Ronald Reagan's attempts to abolish the LSC -- the first full-scale effort by conservatives to end the program -- failed in the face of congressional opposition, in the 1980s abuses uncovered by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) and a Senate committee led to some restriction of political activity by grantees. Predictably, legal services programs fought even the most modest attempts to rein in their political activities. Grant recipients, for instance, fought a protracted battle in the federal courts over a regulation forbidding the use of federal funds for congressional redistricting litigation and lobbying. <sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the seating of the 104th Congress in January 1995, the legal services program found itself for the first time under the jurisdiction of a largely conservative Congress. Given the LSC's history, conflict was inevitable. Conservatives sought to eliminate federal funding for both policy and budgetary reasons. LSC grantees are among the leading opponents of welfare reform and chief litigators for left-of-center causes; moreover, the LSC budget, as part of discretionary domestic spending, offered a prime target for almost every plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a full-scale lobbying effort launched by LSC grantees and their allies, Congress approved a phased elimination of all federal LSC funding. The omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in late April 1996 reduced LSC's budget from $400 million in FY 1995 to $278 million in FY 1996. Further reductions are planned for next year, with an end to federal funding in 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Additionally, the 104th Congress imposed numerous restrictions on the types of cases in which LSC grantees could be involved. The Clinton-appointed Corporation and its grantees responded by returning to the strategy LSC had used effectively in the Reagan years: exploiting all possible legal loopholes. The efforts of legal services lawyers to avoid compliance with new restrictions have reinforced the conviction of many congressional critics that the politicized legal services fund must be eliminated from the federal budget.
<p>
<b>The 104th Congress: Phased Elimination and New Restrictions</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Intent on cutting the deficit in early 1995, the new Congress proposed a recission of $17.1 billion in federal spending, including $15 million from the LSC. Legal services supporters responded with vitriol. In February 1995, for example, American Bar Association President George Bushnell attacked conservative critics of legal services as "reptilian bastards."<sup>2</sup>  Congress and President Clinton eventually agreed to rescind $15 million of the $415 million FY 1995 LSC budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general commitment to achieving a balanced budget placed heavy pressure on moderate Members of the 104th Congress, who otherwise might have spared the LSC, to go along with significant cuts. The May 1995 budget resolution, which passed along party lines, therefore endorsed a phased elimination of LSC spending in which the adjusted funding level of $400 million for 1995 would be reduced to $278 million for FY 1996, $141 million for FY 1997, and zero for FY 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although the budget resolution sets forth the general budget plan for LSC, actual appropriations are made through a separate process. The House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Harold Rogers (R-KY), recommended an FY 1996 funding level of $278 million -- the amount specified by the House budget resolution. House conservatives, however, mindful of how legal services groups might thwart welfare reform and other key elements of their agenda, advocated an immediate end to all LSC funding. The fact that the Legal Services Corporation Act had not been reauthorized since its expiration in 1980 gave LSC's foes an opportunity to use House rules to challenge funding for an unauthorized program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within this framework, the House Republican leadership met with the interested parties and struck an agreement to protect legal services appropriations from a floor challenge with the further understanding that the terms of a planned reauthorization bill would be added as an amendment, or rider, to LSC appropriations. The reauthorization legislation then under consideration included elimination of the LSC coupled with block grant funding to the states, to be used to provide legal services, and far stricter prohibitions on political activities than in prior legal services legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In mid-1995, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, chaired by Representative George W. Gekas (R-PA), held hearings and voted out a bill containing many of the needed reforms, including elimination of the LSC and the block granting of legal services funds. However, the full House Judiciary Committee -- reflecting both its more liberal membership and the influence of the organized bar -- narrowly passed a number of amendments extending the life of the program and increasing its spending levels. This new bill, unacceptable to House conservatives as well as to the Republican leadership, was never brought to the floor for a vote.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Senate, Phil Gramm (R-TX), a longtime critic of the LSC, chaired the Appropriations subcommittee that reported out an even lower funding level for LSC than had been reported by the comparable subcommittee in the House: $210 million. That figure survived a vote by the full committee, but an effort on the Senate floor -- led by Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM), aided by the votes of 15 other Republican Senators and most Democrats -- narrowly defeated the Gramm proposal, replacing it with a much higher funding level of $340 million.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A House-Senate conference committee agreed to $278 million for LSC along with restrictions on lobbying, prison litigation, class action suits, illegal alien representation, and lawsuits against welfare reform, but President Clinton vetoed the appropriations bill on December 19, 1995. The LSC appropriations thus became part of a long series of continuing resolutions which contained none of the proposed new restrictions, leaving legal services programs free to continue many of the same ideological and political activities that had motivated the 104th Congress to cut the program.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On April 24, 1996, the President signed a new appropriations bill which reduced LSC funding to $278 million, the figure reported out by the original House-Senate conference committee. This bill also eliminates all funding for LSC's 17 support centers, some of which have engaged in litigation supporting the provision of government services to illegal aliens and opposing parental consent requirements for adolescents seeking abortions. These major cuts in the LSC budget are clear victories for congressional conservatives.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nearly as significant as the cuts in LSC funding are the restrictions placed on the types of cases LSC grantees may pursue. Grantees no longer may file challenges to welfare reform, for example, and class action lawsuits -- traditionally a major weapon in the grantee arsenal -- now may be filed only with the approval of the Corporation. Moreover, legal services lawyers are barred from representing prisoners, illegal aliens, and public housing residents being evicted for drug-related crimes.
<p>
<b>Replacing Federal Funds and Avoiding New Restrictions</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the fight over the future of legal services, the LSC empire's 4,000-plus attorneys, many with activist backgrounds, organized rallies, lobbied Congress, wrote op-eds, held demonstrations, and undertook direct-mail campaigns. A similar lobbying effort to counteract the Reagan Administration's effort to eliminate the LSC in the 1980s was investigated by the GAO, which found that federal funds intended for the provision of legal services to the poor were diverted to the LSC's political "survival campaign."<sup>4</sup>  Perhaps even more significant than their lobbying efforts was the fact that grantees sought additional non-federal funding and sought to create new loopholes by which to avoid federal restrictions.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal budget numbers do not begin to reflect the actual funding available for legal services programs. The 323 programs funded by LSC also receive in excess of $250 million a year from other sources, including foundations, state governments, legal fee awards, and the organized bar's Interest on Lawyers Trust Account programs. Without exception, in each of the last ten years, combined funding for legal services grantees from non-LSC sources has increased.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to raise non-federal revenues have increased significantly over the past year. According to the LSC, at least 27 states are studying ways to provide additional funding for legal services programs.<sup>5</sup>  Typically, most proposals seek an increase in filing fees for civil cases, with the proceeds earmarked for legal services:
<p><ul>
<li>In May 1995, Tennessee increased the filing fee for civil cases by $1 and designated the increased revenue for legal services programs.
<p>
<li>In February 1996, a bill was introduced in the Maryland legislature to raise $4.5 million for programs, including legal services, by adding a surcharge to civil case filing fees.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li>In New Jersey, a proposal to increase fees for filing civil motions from $135 to $160 was endorsed by the New Jersey Bar Association and the head of Legal Services of New Jersey. The entire $25 increase in filing fees is slated to be turned over to Legal Services of New Jersey. If the proposal is enacted, legal services will receive a projected $8 million increase in funding.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>New Loopholes</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because President Clinton has signed the appropriations bill, the new restrictions on legal services are now in effect. Many of the activist lawyers who lead legal services programs resent these regulations, which will bar a wide range of controversial activities undertaken by LSC-funded lawyers in the past, including lobbying, class action suits, and the representation of illegal aliens, drug dealers, and other criminals.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even more upsetting to opponents of reform, the new prohibitions would close the largest loophole in the legal services program by forbidding the use of non-LSC funds to support activities for which LSC funds also may not be used. In the past, legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, non-LSC funds which are not subject to this limitation. Critics of legal services note that money is fungible, as is a lawyer's time. The absence of mandatory timekeeping, along with the fact that case files are closed to outside monitoring, made it easy for legal services programs to use federal funds for restricted activities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The new restrictions have left legal services activists looking for new ways to continue their controversial activities. Using a variation of a strategy tried in the 1980s, grantees are seeking to evade the restrictions by setting up new closely affiliated but legally separate entities. A 1985 GAO investigation determined that such affiliated groups often engaged in activities prohibited to LSC grantees and that the relationships between these two sets of groups were so close that LSC should consider them one group for purposes of complying with restrictions.<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Growing numbers of legal services groups have announced they will refuse LSC funds because of pending restrictions. Foremost among these are Community Legal Services (CLS) of Philadelphia; the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara, California; three Washington State grantees; and Greater Boston, Massachusetts, Legal Services. The strategy is simple: Such "former" grantees will continue to receive bar support, private funds, and state support for soon-to-be-restricted activities; meanwhile, new organizations will apply for and receive LSC funds to use in non-prohibited cases. Many of the new organizations have been created by attorneys affiliated with the "former" grantees, which would be free to handle political and ideological cases.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused. Early signs of close ties between former and current grantees, however, are already apparent:
<p><ul>
<li>The Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center, for example, was formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services to assume CLS's non-prohibited cases, setting up shop in the same building as CLS.<sup>9</sup>
<p><li>Members of the Legal Aid Society of Santa Clara's executive committee opted to refuse LSC funds and set up a new organization to take LSC funds. LAS Vice President Elizabeth Shivell explained the tactic in an unguarded moment: "If [Congress] can screw people with technicalities, we can unscrew them with technicalities. That's why we're lawyers and not social workers. Two can play this game."  A bar publication reported that many poverty lawyers worried that her remarks could cause trouble with Congress.<sup>10</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A top LSC staff member, Robert Echols, was quoted as describing the rash of new groups as a perfectly appropriate approach.<sup>11</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Legal Services Corporation -- run by a Clinton-appointed board and run by senior-level staff with strong ties to the groups they are charged with regulating -- has provided guidance to its programs on this issue. In a December 1995 memo to its 323 field programs on "Applicability of Restrictions to Interrelated Organizations," LSC set forth the factors to be considered in determining whether one group controls another, thereby subjecting both groups to the new restrictions. Among the eight criteria used to determine control are:
<p><ul>
<li>Any overlap of officers, directors, or managers;
<p>
<li>Contractual and financial relationships;
<p>
<li>A close identity of interest; and
<p>
<li>A history of relationships among organizations.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The LSC memo pointed out that any determination as to whether two groups are subject to common control would consider the "totality of circumstances," with the "presence or absence of any one or more of these factors" not necessarily determinative. Translation: LSC staff, with close ties to LSC grantees, will be the sole judges of whether two groups sharing office space, staff, and other resources are subject to common control, and therefore to the new restrictions.

<p>
<b>Other New Loopholes: "Restriction" of Drug Cases and the Cohen Amendment</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Legal services lawyers have incurred the bipartisan wrath of Congress by representing public housing tenants in drug-related eviction cases. LSC-funded lawyers, for example, thwarted attempts by then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp in 1991 to expedite evictions to clean up the serious drug problem in public housing.<sup>12</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, the poor -- those whom these programs ostensibly are designed to help -- have lined up almost uniformly in opposition to legal services and in favor of expediting drug evictions. In a major case now pending in New York City, representatives of New York's 500,000 public housing tenants have entered a court case on the side of their landlord, the New York Housing Authority, to support expedited drug evictions. On the other side is the Legal Aid Society, an LSC grantee once chaired by the Corporation's current President, Alex Forger.<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Faced with the likelihood of tough new restrictions imposed by Congress, the LSC board made a virtue out of necessity: It promulgated a new regulation purporting to restrict representation in drug-related eviction cases. This regulation appeared in the <I>Federal Register</I> on April 1, 1996. While appearing to crack down on one of the most indefensible of legal services activities, however, the new regulation actually is filled with loopholes.
<p><ul>
<li>It allows family members who knew about and benefited financially from drug activity to be represented, provided they are not charged with a crime.
<p>
<li>It specifically allows legal services lawyers to use non-LSC funds to represent the drug dealer.
<p>
<li>But nothing in the regulation prohibits legal services lawyers from filing actions to challenge attempts by federal, state, and local governments to expedite drug-related evictions from public housing.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Proponents of legal services have tried to minimize this issue by claiming that such cases are rare; critics, on the other hand, point to the action against Secretary Kemp and the case pending in New York City to show that legal services' involvement delays drug-related evictions, thereby harming hundreds of thousands of low-income tenants.<sup>14</sup>  In short, the new regulation offers the perfect metaphor for the claim that the legal services program finally is reforming itself: While doing nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from continued involvement in drug-related evictions, it gives LSC a pretext for telling Congress that it has cracked down on such representation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the LSC's obvious failure to follow the new restrictions, the legal services empire scored a major victory in 1996 with the inclusion of the Cohen amendment in the omnibus spending bill. This amendment, sponsored by Senator William Cohen (R-ME), allows grantees to comment on legislation and participate in legislative rulemaking. The effect of the Cohen amendment is to provide a major loophole for legal services lawyers disposed to engage in lobbying activities.
<p>
<b>Conclusion: Looking to the 105th Congress</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although LSC escaped total defunding in 1995, it lost nearly one-third of its federal appropriation. Fearing that Congress would impose several important limits on grantee activities, the LSC, its grantees, and their affiliates worked to devise new strategies to avoid complying with such restrictions. As a result, conservatives in Congress remain determined to push for phased elimination of all federal LSC funding.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House Republican leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached last summer, is expected to ensure that the Rules Committee will not protect LSC from a point of order when the full House considers the FY 1997 appropriations bill containing LSC funding. This could open the opportunity for the House to "zero out" LSC. So far, there is no reliable head count, but it should be remembered that whatever happens, the Senate -- given last year's performance -- is not likely to go along.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The major battle in Congress therefore will be over whether the budget resolution's FY 1997 figure of $141 million for LSC will be followed. This would represent a sharp cut from the $278 million voted for FY 1996. If Congress approves $141 million, the stage will be set for the final showdown on legal services. The 105th Congress, to be elected this November, will decide whether it has the political will to vote for the final installment of the budget resolution plan for LSC: zero support from the American taxpayer by FY 1998.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reducing LSC's appropriation by one-third while placing significant restrictions on the allowable activities of LSC grantees, the 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of grantees to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense. LSC grantees responded by attempting to blunt the impact of congressional efforts, primarily by seeking new, non-federal revenue sources or by restructuring their organizations to circumvent the new regulations. Through these actions, grantees have shown once again that legal services cannot be reformed. It is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Henry Cisneros's bold plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the troubled public housing industry has been stymied in Congress by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. Yet, despite the opposition, these ideas -- which first took hold during the Reagan and Bush Administrations (especially during Jack Kemp's tenure at HUD) -- have shown remarkable resiliency. With the support of House reformers and leaders, and with bold intervention from the federal courts, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ensuring this will be no easy task, however, as both the House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over housing policy already have produced bills that would reverse 25 years of market-based reform and, in the process, serve fewer needy families for the taxpayer dollars spent. The Senate's version (S.1260) has passed the floor. The companion version in the House (H.R. 2406) is scheduled for a vote in early May, but confronts a competing reform bill (H.R. 2198) developed by freshman Representatives Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS). Significantly, the freshman bill is co-sponsored by the House leadership. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. It is a dispute over how government should help the poor and a chance for the new congressional leadership to end the public housing industry's stranglehold -- a stranglehold that has hurt tenants as well as taxpayers and turned many of America's public housing projects into costly disasters. The leadership's attention, support, and intervention will be essential, both in defending reform against the public housing industry's lobbying juggernaut and in focusing lawmakers on the issues at stake.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is at stake today is what has been at stake in every year since the early 1970s, when HUD first attempted to extract itself from the costly housing policies of the New Deal: the choice between <I>tenant-based</I> assistance and <I>project-based</I> assistance. Rent vouchers and certificates, the primary means of tenant-based assistance, provide eligible families with the cash equivalent to rent the apartment of their choice, subject to a cap based on local "fair market rents."  They empower tenants and introduce market discipline into the assisted-rental market, forcing landlords and developers to seek to provide the best value for money.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, with project-based assistance (including public housing), the eligible family is offered an apartment in a building constructed and operated exclusively to house the poor. With its origins in the Depression, project-based public housing was developed as much for its direct job-creating potential as it was to meet the housing needs of the indigent; it is this dual purpose, among other factors, that explains why project-based assistance, on average, costs up to twice as much as vouchers for each family assisted. These units typically are owned and operated by government or nonprofit organizations, although some for-profit developers have been given significant tax and other financial incentives to provide such buildings. This approach empowers landlords and developers, whose incentive is to lobby Washington and produce housing as expensively as possible, not to provide value to tenants or the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>TIME TO GIVE THE POOR A CHOICE</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The significant cost difference is one of the key reasons for the shift, under both Democrat and Republican Administrations, toward vouchers and away from public housing. But the different approaches also have led to dramatic differences in the quality of life for assisted families, and this has been another compelling reason for HUD's repeated attempts to extract itself from this Depression-era program. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because public housing serves only the poor, typically in large complexes of a hundred or more units, families assisted by this program are rigidly segregated from the rest of society, always by income class and also by education and workforce participation. In the major urban areas, public housing residents are segregated almost exclusively by race. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find another American institution that induces measures of racial segregation as effectively as does public housing.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Apparently the courts agree. In April of this year, in settling a desegregation suit brought against HUD by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several Baltimore public housing tenants, HUD agreed to desegregate its Baltimore public housing projects, to tear down the decrepit buildings, and to provide the majority of the displaced tenants with vouchers that can be used to rent privately owned apartments within the greater Baltimore metropolitan area (see <a href="bg1081b.html">box</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast with public housing, vouchers allow the assisted family to choose its place of residence from private landlords in the community, provided that the required rent stays within the established limits. This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities. As a 1994 congressional report observed, "Studies have found that recipients of tenant-based rental assistance were less likely than public housing residents to live in concentrated poor urban communities.... "<sup>1</sup> With vouchers, a family with children can choose a safer neighborhood with good schools; an unemployed individual can relocate to a part of the community with better job prospects; and an elderly couple can choose a place close to family, friends, and convenient shopping. Whatever their specific needs, families can "self-tailor" the assistance in ways that provide the greatest benefits for a given cost. Moreover, because vouchers are a fixed amount of assistance, tenants have a strong incentive to "shop around" for the best value, and landlords and developers have the incentive to provide good value to the tenants (which does not happen when tenants must live in designated projects). 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recognizing these advantages, President Clinton's FY 1996 budget wisely proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from the project-based form to tenant-based vouchers. Under this plan, HUD would end the multibillion-dollar direct payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with indirect support through vouchers that would be provided directly to the tenants now living in these projects. In turn, the tenants could use these vouchers to continue to pay rent to the PHA, rent better quarters elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better managers. In any case, PHAs would lose their government-sponsored monopoly status, and instead would have to compete for assisted tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. Confronted with the prospective loss of revenue, PHAs would have no choice but to improve their performance and lower their costs.
<p>
<b>HOW A MISUNDERSTOOD STUDY DROVE A POLICY FLIP-FLOP</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The FY 1996 HUD plan was the most innovative housing proposal in 25 years and relied heavily on both privatization and competitive market forces. But Congress rejected this proposal, and instead drafted new legislation that largely shifted the housing assistance emphasis back to public housing while merely paring back some of the programmatic <I>impedimenta</I> that had accumulated over the 30 years of HUD's existence. In making this decision, both committees said nice things about vouchers but then went on to cite the findings of a June 1995 GAO report<sup>2</sup> that questioned their cost, with the Senate committee stating:
<blockquote><P>
	The Committee believes that a total conversion to a voucher system is a "One-size-fits-all" approach that is not appropriate or will not work in all markets or in all circumstances. For example, a June 1995 study by the General Accounting Office determined that while nationwide the cost of vouchers versus the cost of operating public housing is similar, the averages conceal wide differences in these two options in different market areas.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House came to a similar conclusion. It acknowledged that on average vouchers were 10 percent cheaper than public housing per household served, but added: "As GAO noted, these wide variations in cost raise a number of important issues.... "<sup>4 </sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The GAO's acknowledgement that sample observations are distributed around their mean (in other words, a bell curve) would hardly have surprised a high school math student, but this commonplace point was sufficiently alarming for both congressional housing committees to reject the HUD reform plan and continue the six-decade reliance on public housing as the primary vehicle for providing assistance to the poor. Yet the findings presented in the GAO report do nothing to support Congress's action; instead, they support the 1995 HUD proposal to "voucher out" the public housing projects.
<P>
<b>WHAT THE GAO REPORT REALLY FOUND</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the reasons HUD recommended a wholesale shift from public housing to vouchers was the significant cost difference in favor of vouchers. As acknowledged in the GAO report, HUD determined "that it cost $440 per month on average to house a family with a housing certificate, compared to an average of $481 per month in public housing."<sup>5</sup>  If spread over the 1.3 million families now in public housing, this difference, described as "similar" by the Senate, would lead to an annual savings of $640 million per year. In turn, if the savings were applied to additional vouchers, Congress would be able to assist another 118,000 poor families now eligible for HUD assistance but unable to obtain it because of limits on HUD funding.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The prospect of a GAO-acknowledged savings of $640 million alone should have encouraged Congress to begin the prompt yet orderly shift recommended by HUD Secretary Cisneros. But the GAO report presents plenty of additional information to demonstrate that the potential long-term savings from shifting to vouchers are even greater than the acknowledged 10 percent. Indeed, the true cost difference may be as much as ten times the amount HUD and GAO presented when a full accounting of all public housing costs is compiled.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For example, the same section of the GAO report that acknowledges the 10 percent difference also says, in a sentence apparently overlooked by both the House and Senate committees, that "because HUD's analysis considered the capital costs of public housing as sunk costs, it made no attempt to add an imputed debt service charge to the cost of public housing."<sup>6</sup>  <I>In other words, if we assume that public housing costs nothing to build, then public housing has only a 10 percent cost disadvantage when compared with vouchers</I>. The GAO comparison is a classic case of apples and oranges because the cost of the voucher, as related to the rent it pays, embodies all costs, including operating, capital, and debt, as well as other expenses from which public housing is exempt, such as federal, state, and local income taxes, local property taxes, and local licenses and fees. No such costs are included in GAO's representation of public housing's expenses.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Fortunately, the Senate Banking Committee and the GAO provide additional information in their respective reports that can be used to establish a fuller accounting of the costs associated with public housing and allow for a more accurate comparison of these costs with the cost of vouchers. When this is done, it is apparent that, on average, the true cost of public housing is as much as twice the cost of a voucher. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The search for a more accurate assessment of public housing's costs begins with an estimate of the federal government's investment in public housing, an investment comprised largely of the cost to construct and the cost to renovate and modernize the units periodically as they deteriorate over time. An estimate of this total is included in the Senate report, which states that "the Committee is committed to safeguarding the federal taxpayers' $90 billion investment in the nation's public housing industry.... "<sup>7</sup> 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Combining this $90 billion estimate with the GAO's observation that there are approximately 1.4 million public housing units in existence<sup>8</sup> yields an average per unit historic investment/cost of $65,000. Of course, today's per unit costs are much higher than the average of costs cumulated over past years. HUD estimates current public housing development costs at an average of $88,073 per unit.<sup>9</sup>  For example, HUD has just announced the planned construction of a new project in Washington, D.C., that will have an eye-popping estimated expenditure per unit of $186,500, and a new project in Baltimore entailing expenditures of $340,000 per unit when the cost of other amenities at the project is included.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to pro rate this historic $65,000 cost over the useful life of the project, as well as establish an estimate for the costs associated with the debt service charges that would be incurred for this estimated average investment, a useful proxy is the monthly payment associated with a 30-year fixed rate, level payment, fully amortized mortgage. Using an interest rate of 7.5 percent as a conservative average for the government's long-term borrowing rate over the past several decades, this approach yields an additional monthly cost of $454.49.<sup>11</sup>  When added to the HUD/GAO monthly operating cost estimate of $481, this yields a more accurate total monthly public housing unit cost of $935.49, a figure that is more than twice the cost of vouchers. Using the current cost of building a new public housing unit -- $88,073 -- the monthly debt service charge would rise to $615.82 and the total monthly cost of that new unit would be $1,096.82.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With a cost difference of this magnitude between the two programs, the rationales for the policies embodied in both the housing bills developed by both the Senate and House committees (S. 1260 and H.R. 2406) fall apart. Specifically:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Vouchers are by far the better form of assistance. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With full program costs exposed as not "similar," public housing no longer merits the benefit of the doubt, and vouchers no longer deserve the skepticism that characterizes their treatment by Congress. As a result, the policy emphasis in both these bills must be reversed and the burden of proof placed on public housing, not on vouchers. Specifically, vouchers should be the chief vehicle for housing assistance, except when a particular public housing project is not used as a vehicle for racial segregation and can be demonstrated to be less expensive as a result of an independent audit covering <I>all</I> costs.
<p>
<b>2. There are no regional cost differences of consequence once total costs of public housing are included. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If public housing overall is twice as expensive as vouchers, the assertion that there are widespread regional differences in costs is also invalid. When the excluded capital costs presented by the GAO are added, each of the examples which purport to demonstrate the lower cost of public housing actually demonstrates just the opposite; not one of these examples survives the re-estimation.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>3. An independent study commission should be established to settle the cost issue once and for all. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To date, all cost comparison studies have been conducted by institutions, or contractors to institutions, with a vested interest in the outcome of the debate. As a result, and regardless of the quality of the studies, the analysis is perceived to reflect inherent biases, or at least to be tainted with the view of its benefactor. As a congressional agency, for example, the GAO cannot be seen as wholly neutral. The reason: It carries out research according to specific requests from Members of Congress and sometimes is constrained by the requesting lawmaker in the approach it can use to explore issues and evaluate costs. Nor can studies conducted by HUD be seen as free of bias in regard to prevailing HUD policy preferences.
</blockquote><P>
<b>THROWING BAD MONEY AFTER GOOD</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the cost differences cited above should leave no doubt that all future and incremental housing assistance should be delivered through vouchers for reasons of both cost and quality, there remains the question of how to make the best use of the existing public housing stock, estimated by GAO at 1.4 million units. Although the taxpayers have invested an estimated $90 billion, this sunk cost does not justify any further investment in the system, since spending any additional dollars on public housing reduces by more than half the number of families that can be assisted, when compared with those that could be assisted through vouchers
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, investing no more money in public housing does not mean that the existing stock of public housing units has no role to play in an orderly transition from New Deal paternalism to more cost-effective tenant empowerment. In its present state, but under proper management,<sup>13</sup> much of the inherited public housing stock can provide adequate and cost-effective shelter for those in need, and the assisted tenants should be allowed to live there if that is their choice. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Providing tenants with the choice, and providing <I>them</I> with the funding rather than the landlord, puts tenants in a position to get the maximum benefit from government assistance. Providers of housing, including the public housing authorities, must compete with others in offering quality services to secure their operating revenue, which previously came directly from HUD with no effective requirement that minimal quality standards be met or cost efficiencies established.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If all public housing operators were funded only by the revenues available from federally assisted rent-paying tenants, financial survival would compel these operators to provide better services. Just as important, tenant-based assistance would force public housing authorities to decide which units to continue in operation and which to close down. Units in extreme disrepair would be rejected by voucher-bearing tenants with the right to choose. Ultimately, they would be shut down, as the federal courts forced HUD to do in Baltimore, and the money that otherwise would be wasted on uneconomic modernization could be used to assist a larger number of beneficiaries directly.
<p>
<b>THE HUMAN COST OF WASTING MONEY </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for Members of Congress to keep in mind that federal housing assistance is not an entitlement, and that the level of housing assistance serves only a fraction of the eligible population. As the Congressional Budget Office has pointed out:
<P><blockquote>
	In 1989, the most recent year for which the detailed data used in this study were available, about 4.1 million households received assistance from the federal government in meeting their housing needs. Under the program rules in effect in 1994, almost 14.5 million additional households would have been eligible for aid; that is, their incomes were sufficiently low to qualify them. Not all of the households that were eligible, however, applied for aid, whereas many of those that did apply were placed on waiting lists because sufficient aid was not available.<sup>14</sup> 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In other words, for every one household served by HUD, more than three eligible ones were not. Thus, within the confines of current budget limits, the money saved through program efficiencies could be reallocated to assist the most needy of the 14.5 million poor yet unserved families now on waiting lists. The per-unit expenditures of $186,500 and $340,000 for new buildings in Washington and Baltimore, noted earlier, represent an egregious waste of money and perpetuate the long waiting lists which characterize HUD programs. 
<blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> If the $115 million that HUD intends to spend to construct just 338 new units in Baltimore was applied to vouchers, HUD could have provided a year's worth of safe and decent privately owned apartments to 21,000 of the 25,000 poor Baltimore families on the housing assistance waiting list.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given such trade-offs, Congress's continuation of new public housing funding defies reason -- and merely rewards the construction and public housing industry lobbies.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> Consider the $2.5 billion that the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies proposes to modernize portions of the existing public housing stock. Had this been allocated directly to certificates or vouchers, this $2.5 billion could have provided needed help to more than 475,000 poor households currently on waiting lists for government housing assistance. 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While some in Congress may defend this multibillion-dollar modernization expenditure as necessary to provide additional housing units for the poor, the government's own statistics demonstrate that it is a waste of money. According to the government's American Housing Survey (see <a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">box</a>), there are approximately 2.6 million vacant rental units in the United States, and about 39 percent of them, or just over one million, rent for $400 or less per month -- well within the $440 range of the average HUD voucher. About 49 percent, or 1.3 million units, rent for $500 or less, also within HUD's range given that most assisted tenants are expected to supplement the voucher with their own financial resources.<sup>15</sup>  In central cities, the vacancy rate is much higher because of continuing depopulation. 
<P>
<b>MORE AUTONOMY AND LESS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PHAS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although public housing authorities are financially dependent upon the federal government for virtually all aspects of their operations, Congress has not had much success in using the leverage this dependency should provide to induce improved performance. Despite numerous financial concessions, its not-for-profit status, exemptions from all taxes, and exhortations to better management, public housing still costs more than vouchers on a per unit basis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The difficulties that both HUD and Congress have had with public housing are underscored by the 15 percent of the units under the control of authorities formally described year after year as "distressed."  Although the Cisneros voucher plan would have transferred the hapless tenants in these units to private sector housing and put the poorly managed PHAs out of business, Congress chose instead to rely on modified versions of Washington-managed solutions. Yet, what little management and oversight of public housing there is comes from HUD. And it was Secretary Cisneros's understanding that trying to manage from Washington is not the answer that contributed to his voucher plan to replace failed central planning and management with the discipline of the competitive marketplace. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Aspects of both congressional committee bills could make this situation worse by diminishing executive branch oversight of the housing industry and key decisions in the choice of assistance. For example:
<ul><p>
<li>HUD's oversight of the PHAs would be diminished by the House committee bill's creation of an independent Housing Foundation and Accreditation Board, comprised largely of the recipients and beneficiaries of federal spending on housing. This board would establish benchmarks for local housing and management authorities, establish procedures for accrediting authorities, and classify authorities. It is through board accreditation that a PHA would become eligible to receive the proposed block grants under this bill. This proposal creates a legislative precedent by turning over executive branch spending authority to an independent board comprised of individuals whose chief qualification for eligibility is the possession of a conflict of interest.
<p>
<li>Both bills move the responsibility for determining the future course of federal housing policy from Congress and the executive branch to the PHAs by granting to PHAs the responsibility for conducting cost comparison studies on vouchers and project-based assistance. The bills then give PHAs the discretion to act on the outcome of their own studies. With so much turning on a single cost comparison, it is hard to understand how Congress can place responsibility for cost comparison studies on the bodies that stand to benefit or lose financially from the outcome of such studies. As recommended earlier, these comparisons should be conducted by a blue ribbon commission of independent experts. 
  </ul><p>
<b>DISTORTING THE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT WORK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the taxpayer bears an indirect burden for having his money wasted on poorly conceived programs, the brunt of the failure is born by society's most vulnerable households, including millions of children who are condemned to live in these public housing units or, worse, are denied any housing assistance at all because billions of dollars are wasted on costly and inefficient housing programs. As noted above, the Senate's proposed $2.5 billion modernization program will be at the expense of nearly 500,000 eligible households who will receive no assistance this year because of budget shortfalls in other program accounts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Added to this is a Republican-endorsed change in public housing regulations that will shift the government's limited housing resources away from the poorest segments of the population by allowing local public housing authorities to "serve residents with a greater range of income."<sup>16</sup>  As the Senate Committee report puts it: "The Committee's bill promotes mixed-income conditions by repealing federal regulations that prescribe strict occupancy preferences and deregulating well-run public housing authorities."<sup>17</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If these proposed changes are enacted into law, the government's long-standing commitment to use its limited housing assistance funds to help those in greatest need first will be rejected in favor of policies that enforce notions of economic diversity. With 14 million eligible but unserved households, of which about 8.4 million are categorized by the CBO as "very low income renter households,"<sup>18</sup> this policy change, at least on the surface, would appear to be ethically odd. But upon closer inspection, it can be justified by the sort of "burn the village to save it" logic often compelling in the narrow factual confines in which government discourse is engaged.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although they have not yet been enacted into law, HUD has wasted no time in putting these ideas into practice. In announcing, in early April 1996, a grant of $25 million to build 134 new units (equaling $186,500 per unit) near the U.S. Capitol, HUD also noted that households with incomes as high as $78,430 would be eligible to move into this project.<sup>19</sup>  HUD made no mention of its plans for the 15,983 poor people in the District of Columbia who are on government waiting lists for housing assistance.<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As noted earlier, one of the more serious drawbacks of public housing, and indeed of any government bricks and mortar housing program, is that it serves to segregate households by race and income. By warehousing such large concentrations of the poor, often in deteriorated inner-city neighborhoods where much of the nation's urban public housing is located, Congress has created volatile social environments characterized by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect, and other social pathologies that tend not to occur as frequently with the less costly voucher program that allows assisted households to self-integrate into the community at large. But rather than blame a fundamentally flawed program, Congress blames the victims, and proposes to solve the problem by serving fewer of the poor.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House committee bill would allow public housing authorities, once compelled to take the poorest and most vulnerable on a priority basis, to rent to higher income families, and would require that no more than 25 percent of a project's units be dedicated to the very poor, characterized as those with incomes below 30 percent of the area's median family income. Expressed another way that better quantifies the human cost of the proposed change, Congress will allow public housing authorities to set aside no more than 350,000 units to serve a population that the CBO estimates at 11.9 million eligible households, of which about 8.4 million receive no housing assistance at all, in part because of programmatic financial limits. With public housing authorities allowed to discriminate against the poor, the worsening situation will likely deteriorate even further.<sup>21</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However bad some of the housing legislation before Congress may be, there remains the growing possibility that federal courts increasingly will render efforts now underway by Congress and HUD as irrelevant and in violation of the law. As court-directed settlements in Baltimore and several other communities demonstrate, tenants and their legal counsel are becoming increasingly less tolerant of the pervasive <I>de facto</I> segregation that characterizes most of HUD's urban public housing projects, and many of the suburban ones as well. Increased use of vouchers is the only acceptable alternative to the plaintiffs, and to the courts which render the final decision. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the Baltimore case also demonstrates, decisions by the courts also can be remarkably coercive, and could ultimately be as disruptive and as counterproductive as were the school busing decisions of a past generation. But this need not happen if Congress enacts a new initiative that breaks with past housing policy and the federally financed <I>de facto</I> racial segregation that is an integral part of it. Legislative proposals such as those of Representatives Myrick and Brownback, or HUD's plan of last year, each of which is founded on tenant choice, would be consistent with American principles of civil liberties. In contrast, the legislation produced by the housing committees of both the House and Senate simply entrenches today's disastrous programs and further frustrates reform.

Given the exceptional wear and tear that the typical public housing unit is subject to, a shorter period of, say, 15 or 20 years would be more reasonable and also would lead to a higher monthly cost estimate.  As for the interest rate, this also allows the analysis to err on the conservative side inasmuch as the average 30-year government bond rate was 9.2 percent for as long as there has been a 30-year bond (since 1977).  Obviously, this too would yield a higher monthly cost.  Alternatively, using the 10-year government bond rate, whose series goes back to 1953, a time span that more closely parallels the construction of today's public housing stock, the average 10-year interest rate is 6.8 percent, and this would yield a monthly debt service cost of  $423.79, making public housing still the most expensive form of housing assistance.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Deciding when, where, and how to intervene with military force presents a truly perplexing set of questions. In a post-Cold War world, with no overriding threat to serve as the focus for American national strategy, it is even more difficult to decide when, where, and how to use the U.S.'s limited military resources. In this increasingly uncertain world, it is therefore imperative that American policymakers follow clear guidelines in deciding where and when American military intervention is most needed and how it can be most effective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, however, the United States currently has no such guidelines in place. Because of this, the Clinton Administration has been tempted to intervene militarily in peripheral areas of the world. In Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, the result has been either failure or settlements that even one former Clinton advisor has characterized as "provisional, fragile, and reversible."<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, congressional and public support has been very weak because it has been unclear to most Americans how these interventions serve the national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations unless the Clinton Administration and Congress adopt a concrete set of policy guidelines for when and how to use American military forces abroad. These guidelines must be flexible enough to address a wide range of military options, but they also must be constant enough to balance the projected benefit of any intervention against the costs to the American people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before approving any future military intervention, the Administration and Congress therefore should make certain that it meets the following criteria:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #1 - Military intervention should defend national security interests.</b> Both the President and Congress must recognize that not all national interests are equally important. They must also acknowledge that not all national interests are national security interests that require military intervention. Instead of focusing on core security interests, the Clinton Administration has committed American military power only on the periphery, and with inconclusive and negligible results. The Administration has what one critic has called an "instinct for the capillary" -- a tendency to send U.S. troops on missions that serve lesser national interests, or in some cases (such as Haiti and Somalia), no security interest at all.<sup>2</sup>  For America to use its power effectively, it must prioritize where and how it chooses to defend its vital, important, and marginal interests, thereby avoiding both excessive activism that diffuses important resources and isolationism that eschews important opportunities to shape events.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #2 - Military intervention should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments.</b> America's current national military strategy is strategically bankrupt. Not only is the Bottom-Up Review force too small to execute the two major regional conflicts strategy, but it is woefully underfunded as well. Huge interventions in areas of marginal security interest have exacerbated the strain on the U.S. military and made it doubtful that the military can mobilize the resources necessary to defend vital national interests and honor current security commitments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #3 - Military intervention should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable.</b> Military interventions should be conducted to accomplish clearly definable military goals that are militarily achievable, consistent with overriding political objectives, and supported by enough force to achieve these goals. In Bosnia, the Clinton Administration has failed to define these military objectives clearly, and those objectives that have been articulated are insufficient to achieve the larger political goal of reaching a sustainable peace. Thus, there is no reliable way to measure success or failure, which is why Clinton has imposed a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The President, in effect, has made withdrawing U.S. forces on schedule the only clear-cut, identifiable U.S. military goal in Bosnia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #4 - Military intervention should enjoy congressional and public support. </b> President Clinton has made a habit of circumventing Congress in deciding to undertake military interventions. In non-emergency contingencies like Haiti and Bosnia, Congress should have the opportunity to vote on the merits of an intervention, not merely whether to support American troops already on the ground. Such decisions should not be made by polls; Americans traditionally are reluctant to intervene. However, when intervention is required, the President should mobilize public support (as President Bush did during the Persian Gulf War) so that American troops abroad will know that the nation and the Congress support not only the troops, but the actual goals of the operation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #5 - The armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success.</b> The U.S. armed forces must be allowed the operational freedom to create the conditions within which they can succeed. The U.S. military should never be placed in a situation where it has no control over the outcome, as was the case in both Haiti and Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, Congress can help redress the policy shortcomings of the Clinton Administration. First, it should ask the President to issue a presidential directive that establishes these five criteria for military interventions. This would add to the Administration's presidential decision directive concerning multilateral peace operations (PDD-25), which was limited to guidelines for U.S. participation in peacekeeping. Congress also should require that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain:
<p><ul>
<li><b>A prioritization</b> of national interests and national security interests;
<p>
<li><b>A listing of criteria,</b> such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions;
<P>
<li><b>A set of criteria</b> for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures such as the United Nations;<p>

<li><b>An unequivocal guarantee</b> that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and
<P>
<li><b>A declaration</b> that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine.
</ul><P>
<b>THE NEED FOR CRITERIA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Few issues of foreign and military policy are as vexing for the policymaker as military intervention. The problem of finding reliable criteria for deciding when, where, why, and how to intervene abroad with military force is made particularly difficult by several factors. First, there is the character of the "new world disorder," a volatile and unpredictable international arena that does not lend itself to conceptual or strategic clarity. On the one hand, there is no one clear and present danger on which to base a coherent strategy; on the other hand, the many lesser threats to American interests, like those posed by such rogue states as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Libya, cannot be ignored. These threats are more than enough reason for maintaining forces capable of many different levels of military intervention.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second factor that complicates operating in this world disorder is a dilemma in the way Americans think about military intervention. Henry Kissinger has aptly described this dilemma and the solution that is needed:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	America's dominant task is to strike a balance between the twin temptations inherent in its exceptionalism: the notion that America must remedy every wrong and stabilize every dislocation, and the latent instinct to withdraw into itself. Indiscriminate involvement in all the ethnic turmoil and civil wars of the post-Cold War world would drain a crusading America. Yet an America that confines itself to the refinement of its domestic virtues would, in the end, abdicate America's security and prosperity to decisions made by other societies in faraway places and over which America would progressively lose control. Not every evil can be combated by America, even less by America alone. But some monsters need to be, if not slain, at least resisted. What is most needed are criteria for selectivity.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has failed to put forth such selective criteria for military intervention: when and why it should take place, and how it should be carried out.<sup>4</sup>  Instead of offering a sensible strategy that sets strategic priorities and matches America's means to her most important foreign policy objectives, the Administration has concentrated on marginal "feel-good" operations on the periphery of U.S. national interests. While neglecting the core priorities of American foreign policy, the Administration has squandered American resources on interventions in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia -- military operations in which the claimed successes are both transient and easily overturned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Professor Michael Mandelbaum, a former Clinton advisor, writes that President Clinton has intervened on the periphery in "social work" at the expense of successfully managing relations with other great powers -- the core concern of U.S. foreign policy.<sup>5</sup>  Nothing demonstrates the validity of this argument better than the continued insistence of Administration officials that Bosnia is a conflict "raging at the heart of Europe."  Bosnia is indeed a European security problem, but hardly one that threatens to overwhelm the continent. It needs attention, but not the same sort of military attention given by America to Europe as a result of the hegemonic designs of Germany and the Soviet Union in the past. Americans deserve a foreign policy that is shorter on such rhetoric and longer on rational discourse about core and peripheral interests. Such discourse is needed to promote consensus and understanding about where, when, and how America should intervene.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the United States is the world's leading power, U.S. leaders must shape events and not be shaped by them. In Bosnia, however, President Clinton portrayed American leadership as a fateful burden that has painted America into a corner as the leader of the NATO implementation force (IFOR). Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke has stated that "we did not choose this as the test case.... [N]obody wanted it to happen, but that is the hand history has dealt us. The U.S. role in Europe and NATO's future and our bilateral relationships with all the major countries in Europe are all going to be determined by Bosnia."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the U.S. has no control over its own destiny in Bosnia or Europe, and leadership simply means accepting the many bad options presented by European and Administration indecisiveness. In addition, such a statement means surrendering America's right to help shape the future of Europe and instead allowing the American role in Europe to be determined by local factions in Bosnia. This is hardly leadership. America leads because of the conditions leadership engenders, conditions that are favorable to the U.S. and its allies. Leadership is a means to an end, not an end in itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By failing to lead and shape events in Bosnia, the U.S. has relegated itself to the role of medium-sized player in a peripheral European security affair. The Administration has put aside the larger questions, such as NATO's expansion, in favor of a one-year peace implementation mission in Bosnia. More important, it has tied the measure of American power and successful foreign policy in the world to insignificant operations that the President claims are "test cases" of American leadership. The danger, as one analyst has noted, is that "it is surely perilous to think of the Balkans as an 'acid test,' 'test case,' or a 'defining moment' for anything. We have already seen what devastating effect such manufactured challenges can have on Western unity."<sup>7</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States needs a military intervention policy that is consistent with America's role as the greatest power in the world today. Such a policy would be based on the need to protect and defend America's national security interests through a range of military options, including deterrence, preventive attacks, warfighting, diplomacy, and even peace operations. An intervention policy should discriminate between America's interests and how best to defend them so that America's limited military resources will be used where they are most needed and most effective and not wasted on inconsequential operations of little lasting significance. 
<p>
<b>THE INTERVENTION DEBATE</b><sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has acted without an effective doctrine for military intervention. Clinton's national strategy of "Engagement and Enlargement," for example, offers more in the way of academic abstractions than discriminating policy guidance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This reluctance to provide useful criteria for military intervention comes on the heels of long-standing debate. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was attacked in 1984, from both the left and the right, for proposing criteria that were perceived as too restrictive. Weinberger proposed six conditions for military intervention: 
<ul><p>
<li>Vital national interests are threatened,
<p>
<li>The U.S. clearly intends to win, 
<p>
<li>The intervention has precisely defined political and military objectives,
<p>
<li>There is reasonable assurance that intervention will be supported by the American people and Congress,
<p>
<li>The commitment of American forces and their objectives can be reassessed constantly and adjusted if necessary, and
<P>
<li>The commitment of U.S. forces to combat is undertaken as a last resort.<sup>9</sup> 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Critics maintained that Weinberger's criteria were a prescription for inaction, arguing that America's military options in many cases would not be clear-cut enough to support their application. In addition to the expected attacks from the left, critics ranging from Secretary of State George Shultz to conservative commentators and <I>National Review</I> magazine claimed that the Weinberger criteria were simply unobtainable in many instances in which the U.S. would want to entertain limited military action. Newspaper columnist William Safire echoed the sentiments of many when he wrote that Weinberger would restrict the U.S. to "only the fun wars."<sup>10</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
From the military's point of view, however, the Weinberger doctrine was meant to guarantee that the U.S. would not repeat the strategic mistakes of the Vietnam War and the failed Lebanese intervention of 1982-1983. In both of those cases, there was no clear intention of winning despite the sacrifices being made; there was tenuous public and congressional support; and the military and political objectives were never clearly defined, attainable, or decisive. The Vietnam syndrome was, in essence, the understandable desire on the part of America's military that their sacrifices not be in vain. As the post-Vietnam military sought to rebuild the strategic ethos, one officer wrote that "when it comes to being engaged in any undertaking where political objectives are hazy, public support only tepid, the prospects for a rapid decision remote, and the risk of substantial casualties high, service opinion is unanimous: count us out."<sup>11</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It therefore came as no surprise when General Colin Powell, who had been a young infantry officer in Vietnam, bolstered the Weinberger doctrine while serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Powell weighed in with even more explicit guidance as to how military force should be used in interventions.<sup>12</sup>  In particular, he wished to reinvigorate the strategic link: closely matching military goals to political objectives. And, as is well known, he favored using overwhelming force to guarantee that objectives would be reached at minimum cost in American lives. This was very much the philosophy in the Gulf War, where Powell stated that his strategy left nothing to chance; the U.S. military was "not operating in the margin" and would "win decisively."<sup>13</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the resounding victory in the Persian Gulf, critics still openly questioned the utility of the Weinberger-Powell doctrines as guidelines for the use of force, especially in other-than-war military interventions such as peacekeeping. The late Congressman and Defense Secretary Les Aspin and others said that Weinberger-Powell left the policymaker with only two options: all or nothing. Aspin postulated that with the end of the zero-sum game of Cold War superpower rivalry, the U.S. should adopt a more flexible approach to military intervention. Knowing that military power was a blunt instrument, he also hoped that new military technologies (such as precision guided munitions) would help to provide the U.S. with more precise and flexible tools that could be used in limited military interventions without mobilizing public and congressional support or using overwhelming military force.<sup>14</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's early position on intervention was couched in light of its doctrine of "assertive multilateralism" and addressed only peace operations. The Administration hoped that U.S. military intervention could be conducted mainly through such multilateral institutions as the United Nations. However, the failure of the U.N. mission to Somalia and the shocking deaths of U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu street battles prompted President Clinton's security team to rethink their criteria for participation in U.N. operations. The result was Presidential Decision Directive 25 (PDD-25), a document that set intervention criteria solidly in the tradition of prudence and caution started by Caspar Weinberger. PDD-25, published in May 1994, set out eight criteria for the U.S. to consider when deciding to support a peace operation, six further restrictions for U.S. participation should American troops be involved, and an additional three if there was a strong possibility of combat.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite this note of caution, however, the restrictive criteria of PDD-25 did not prevent the Clinton Administration from undertaking a peace enforcement mission in Haiti; U.N. peacekeeping in Haiti, Rwanda, and Macedonia; and the NATO peace implementation mission in Bosnia. In these interventions, the cautionary criteria of PDD-25 were ignored. Given the controversies over Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, it was obvious that there was little desire in the Administration to set criteria, let alone to comply with guidelines when they were set. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In March 1996, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake further contributed to the atmosphere of uncertainty in a speech at George Washington University in which he proposed seven broad circumstances that "may call for the use of force or our military forces."<sup>16</sup>  These circumstances included:
<p>
<ol>
<li>To defend against direct attacks on the U.S., its citizens, and its allies;
<p>
<li>To counter aggression;
<p>
<li>To defend key economic interests;
<p>
<li>To preserve, promote, and defend democracy;
<p>
<li>To prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, international crime, and drug trafficking;
<p>
<li>To maintain U.S. reliability; and
<p>
<li>For humanitarian purposes.<sup>17</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This was an attempt to answer "why" and "when" the U.S. might conduct a military intervention. However, Lake's list is not specific enough to serve as a useful guideline for military intervention. For instance, stating that the U.S. will use force "to counter aggression" is strategically meaningless. It assumes that aggression everywhere, large or small, may require the use of American military force. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lake's list can hardly be used to provide constructive guidance on "where" and "whether" to intervene. In addition, the question of "how" must be addressed, as it significantly affects all the other questions. Americans need a clearer set of criteria for military interventions -- which, while not necessarily identical to the Weinberger or Powell criteria, nevertheless are well within the tradition which they established. These criteria are:
<P>
<b>Criterion #1<br>
Military intervention should defend national security interests.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The essence of American statecraft today consists of being able to discriminate among competing national interests and then balance these interests against the willingness of the U.S. to defend them. Otherwise, America risks squandering its power by failing to differentiate between vital interests and others that are merely important or marginal. Without strategic priorities, the U.S. will be left rudderless in the post-Cold War era, lurching from one media-generated crisis to another and vacillating between the extremes of mindless interventionism and rigid isolationism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States today has a limited pool of resources to use for military interventions. These resources are manifested in tangible forms (for example, number of troops, carrier battle groups, or fighter wings) or intangible forms (public support, willingness to sacrifice). America must use these resources wisely, only where American action is most needed and most effective. Devising criteria for military intervention requires a methodology to establish priorities among America's interests in the world.<sup>18</sup>  It is not enough to develop a laundry list of national interests and assert that they are all equally important.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's national interests vary not only in degree of importance, but also in the types of military interventions necessary to defend them. <b>Vital national interests</b> (a term often used but not universally understood) are interests essential to the continued existence and well-being of America as a free and prosperous nation. They also are national security interests: Threats to vital interests threaten the security of the United States. Therefore, the United States should be willing to go to war to defend these interests, and should consider all manner of military intervention in order to uphold them. In contrast to Weinberger's criteria, military force in defense of vital national interests should not necessarily be used only as a last resort; many times it will be more effective when used as a first resort. Vital national interests include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Protecting</b> America's territory, borders, and airspace;
<p>
<li><b>Preventing</b> a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf;
<p>
<li><b>Preventing</b> hostile interference by an outside power in the Western Hemisphere;
<p>
<li><b>Ensuring</b> access to foreign trade and resources; and
<p>
<li><b>Protecting</b> Americans, at home and abroad, against threats to their lives and well-being.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Important national interests</b> are those which are less than vital but important enough to warrant major diplomatic, economic, or possibly limited military intervention. This recognizes the need for more flexibility than given by the Weinberger doctrine. In the post-Cold War world, with its lesser but more nebulous threats, the U.S. must be prepared to use limited force in defense of national security interests that are not vital national interests. Important interests are are not always national security interests, however, because not all threats to the security of the U.S. can be addressed through military means. Important national interests include general stability in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, as well as promoting more open trade arrangements with Japan and China, promoting democracy and stability in areas such as the former Soviet Union, and combating terrorism and the flow of illegal drugs into America. As a rule, military intervention should be considered as a last resort in defending most of these interests. In most cases, diplomatic and economic efforts will be more effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Marginal interests</b> are national interests, but rarely national security interests, and should not be high on the list of priorities that require the commitment of America's military resources. Marginal interests include political stability and economic development in many parts of the developing world, humanitarian concerns, and environmental issues. These interests also should be considered marginal from a military perspective because they tend to involve the sorts of problems that do not lend themselves to military solutions, especially when imposed by an outside force. For instance, the attempts by U.S. and U.N. military forces at coercive disarmament, political reconciliation, and nation-building in Somalia backfired. Problems of economic and political development, humanitarian crises, and environmental concerns only rarely are susceptible to a military solution. Lasting solutions to these problems most often come from within and are best supported by diplomatic or economic programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While policymakers must always weigh other considerations, such as moral and legal factors, calculations of national interest must always be their principal focus in setting priorities for military intervention. Moral considerations, media pressure, and legal prerogatives do not always give policymakers a clear sense of the value of a national interest to America and what Americans will be ready to sacrifice for that interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For instance, moral outrage and disturbing media images fueled President Bush's decision to conduct a limited humanitarian relief effort in Somalia. Moral considerations and vague internationalist ideals also drove President Clinton to continue the Somalia operation and expand its goals to include political reconciliation and nation-building. However, these moral motivations never gave either President a sense of what the Somalia effort was worth to the American people. In the end, 18 American soldiers killed on October 3, 1993, turned out to be too much for America. The result was a humiliating withdrawal because of a miscalculation over value and the threshold of national sacrifice. The Somalia episode showed the transient and ephemeral nature of national interests generated by the media or academic abstractions about the new world order. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moral umbrage, media-generated urgency, and offense taken from legal transgressions all combine to add pressure for military intervention. Naturally, the policymaker needs to consider all these factors. However, only calculations of national interest, based on the prosperity and well-being of America and her allies, can measure accurately what the American people will sacrifice to see the intervention through to a conclusion. As former National Security Council official Richard Haass writes, "the ability to sustain an intervention over time, and, more importantly, despite human and financial costs, is linked directly to the perceived importance of the interests at stake."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<b>Criterion #2<br>
 Military intervention should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments.  </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. is operating with an enormous gap between its national objectives and its military means to achieve them. The gap between security commitments and actual forces is exacerbated by the fact that even the inadequate force of the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review is underfunded by some $150 billion over the next five years.<sup>20</sup>  In the meantime, while drastically cutting America's armed forces by some 35 percent, the Administration has used what is left for tangential peace operations in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia: missions where the reward for the U.S.'s military efforts are tenuous, indecisive, and easily reversible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The current national security strategy ostensibly is predicated on fighting and winning two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts (MRCs). While President Clinton maintains that "the forces the Administration fields today are sufficient to defeat aggression in two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts,"<sup>21</sup> most experts disagree.<sup>22</sup>  More damaging is the assessment of the uniformed military, those who actually will have to carry out the Clinton strategy with inadequate resources. General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, has testified before the House National Security Committee that the service chiefs "had made no secret of the fact that we have never had the force structure that was called for... to execute the two-MRC strategy."<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This strategic bankruptcy, exacerbated by military interventions in areas of marginal strategic importance, violates what the great American foreign policy thinker Walter Lippman called "the controlling principle" of strategy: that a nation should keep its goals within its means and should never make commitments without providing the resources necessary to achieve them. For the United States, this means ensuring that the shrinking military forces of the U.S. are trained, ready, and postured to defend the national security interests of the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary mission of the U.S. armed forces should be to fight and win the nation's wars, although this obviously does not mean that war is their only task. In fact, of the over 250 military interventions carried out by the U.S. since 1789, only five have been declared wars.<sup>24</sup> In the post-Cold War world, the U.S. military must be prepared for all manner of military interventions, including limited conventional warfare (Panama 1989 and Desert Storm), punitive airstrikes (Libya 1986 and Iraq 1993), deterrence (Kuwait 1994), shows of force (Persian Gulf 1988 and Philippines 1989), and support for peace operations (when their goals are clearly defined and they serve the national interest). However, two critical points must instruct the wide range of possible interventions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first is common sense: Forces intervening somewhere are not available elsewhere. Nor are they training. Congressman Ike Skelton (D-MO) has noted that "peace-keeping commitments may so degrade the armed forces' warfighting capability that it will be impossible to carry out the national military strategy."<sup>25</sup>  His findings are supported by the General Accounting Office, which has found that even small combat units returning from peace operations need up to six months of recovery time to train back up to warfighting standards; larger units (such as divisions) need more.<sup>26</sup>  This means that because the Bosnian peace implementation force requires so many resources from the 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions, the U.S. Army in Europe is unable to meet the Army's standards of warfighting readiness for one to two years. It also means that the shrinking forces of the U.S. are finding it difficult to keep up with their many security commitments.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second point must always underpin American military strategy: Focus on warfighting and keep America's powder dry to protect vital security interests. Lieutenant General Wesley Clark, the Joint Chiefs' strategic planner, knows that the U.S. armed forces may be called upon to conduct many types of limited interventions in defense of less important interests. He notes that "American military power need not, and indeed, must not, be reserved for use only in cases of vital interests."<sup>28</sup>  However, it is equally true that military interventions in support of peripheral interests should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests: a perilous situation that many believe the U.S. is rapidly approaching today. As Colin Powell stated shortly before he retired,
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	we can modify our doctrine, we can modify our strategy, we can modify our structure, our equipment, our training, our leadership techniques, everything else to do these other missions, but we never want to do it in such a way that we lose sight of the focus of why you have armed forces -- to fight and win the nation's wars.<sup>29</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. must act like a great power and use its military forces where the American role is unique and decisive. The U.S. must concentrate its diplomatic, economic, and military efforts on its core interests: relations with other great powers and preventing major conflicts between them. For instance, America's military role in NATO is to prevent the domination of Europe by a hostile power or bloc of powers. This is a role that no other nation in the world can play. Consequently, an America with security commitments all over the world cannot be expected to play the principal military role in every local security crisis that does not threaten the basic security of the European continent.<sup>30</sup>  As Richard Haass has written, "there is little reason for U.S. involvement in peacekeeping, a mission that can be readily undertaken by the forces of many countries."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<b>Criterion #3<br>
Military intervention should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interventions must always be driven by political and military objectives that will define success or failure in an operation. More important, military objectives must support the political objective. In Vietnam, the numerous battlefield victories achieved by American and South Vietnamese forces made little difference to the political outcome of the conflict. In order to correct that incoherence in America's Vietnam strategy, the U.S. military now specifies in campaign plans exactly how military achievements will produce the political success of an operation. This is what the Weinberger doctrine meant by "winning."  For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from in and around Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task on the battlefield, the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For military objectives to contribute to the political goal of an intervention, they must be clearly defined, decisive, and attainable. In some American interventions, the military was not given a clearly defined objective whose attainment could be measured. For instance, in Lebanon in 1982-1983, the U.S. Marines in Beirut were asked to "establish a presence."  This objective was ambiguous, indecisive, and unsustainable, and made little contribution to the political goal of stabilizing Beirut and Lebanon. In Somalia, the initial mission to provide humanitarian relief was clearly defined, and the U.S. military was able to measure its success. However, the mission of nation-building could not be supported by unambiguous and conclusive military missions. As a result, the U.N. force never defined the criteria for its success in Somalia, and the military forces were left to hope that an incoherent campaign of partial disarmament and the fact of their presence would make political reconciliation possible. There was no direct connection between military goals and political objectives, only an oblique influence on political events by various military activities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Working toward clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point, but it has been violated consistently by the Clinton Administration. Lacking clear military and political objectives for his military options, Clinton has fallen back on setting deadlines for troop withdrawal as the only objective that is both clearly defined and attainable. In short, Clinton has substituted time-driven objectives for event-driven objectives. This violates the profound military dictum of Clausewitz that "No one starts a war -- or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so -- without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve and how he intends to conduct it."<sup>32</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In contrast, for the Clinton Administration it is enough that an intervention endure for a certain period of time. Bosnia is case in point. The Administration has not given the military an objective the achievement of which would signal the end of the mission and the accomplishment of something important -- an exit strategy. Instead, President Clinton has offered an exit date and stated that the U.S. military effort in Bosnia will last "about a year."  Therefore, U.S. troops will pull out of Bosnia regardless of whether they achieve any other objectives. In other words, the "exit strategy is the mission. That is, the mission is to show up and leave, not to stay until the [unstated] goals are fully achieved."<sup>33</sup>  Some critics have maintained that this lack of strategy is intentional because if a goal is never set, Clinton cannot be accused of not reaching it. Exit dates, in fact, are foolproof; time always marches on. Supporting the realization of the Dayton Peace Accords -- the vaguely stated goal of the mission in Bosnia -- may not be achieved, but the goal of withdrawing U.S. troops can be.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Time-driven interventions are the <I>de facto</I> strategy of this Administration because it cannot find achievable and sustainable military goals in its ill-defined and ambiguous interventions. In his March 1996 address on intervention, Anthony Lake stressed the Administration's emphasis on schedules and deadlines rather than objectives: In Haiti and Bosnia, "for these operations to succeed, tightly tailored military missions and sharp withdrawal deadlines must be the norm."  Lake has been forced to rely on deadlines and timelines because the Administration is intervening in peripheral conflicts that cannot long sustain the support of the American people and their Congress. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the American people thought the Bosnian intervention was really as profoundly critical to the security of Europe as the Administration pretends, the effort would be worth doing for more than "about a year."  The American public has supported U.S. involvement in NATO for 47 years but is skeptical about Bosnia. This inconsistency between rhetoric and commitment illustrates the Administration's failure to measure the real value of marginal national interests. The President's pollsters know that weak public support for inconsequential interventions can be somewhat ameliorated by deadlines, regardless of mission accomplishment. They also know that if the going gets rough, they can pull out the troops and argue that nothing much was lost anyway --precisely because Americans know that no vital interests were at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is a gross misuse of American military power. When the U.S. military is committed to an intervention, it must be given goals whose success can be measured clearly. If policymakers do not set clearly defined military and political objectives, they will tend to choose, as in Vietnam, plans that are politically controllable over plans that will be militarily and politically successful.<sup>34</sup>  This is the case in Bosnia. The military plan is controllable, but whether it will be successful is out of the military's hands. As a result, there is no guarantee that the year spent in Bosnia will achieve anything of note.<sup>35</sup>  Ultimately, the goal of the U.S. military is to be persuasive in peace and decisive in war. To satisfy both conditions, it needs clearly defined and decisive objectives in all interventions.
<p>
<b>Criterion #4<br>
 Military intervention should enjoy congressional and public support.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The role of Congress in foreign policy and defense today is certainly not what the framers of the U.S. Constitution intended. During the past three years, Congress has been marginalized and unable to vote on the merits of a military intervention. This condition was fostered during the Cold War and exacerbated by the necessity that the President be able to act with secrecy, expediency, and continuity of purpose. However, neither Somalia, nor Haiti, nor Bosnia represented a critical emergency or imminent threat to national security. There was time for debate about ends and means, costs and benefits, and the role of American military force in the world. Congress must reinvigorate its constitutional role by reasserting its decision-making powers concerning military intervention without infringing on the President's ability to act decisively in a crisis. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In both Haiti and Bosnia, President Clinton committed large numbers of U.S. combat forces without the approval of Congress. In fact, in both instances, the President obtained the authorization of the U.N. Security Council before asking the U.S. Congress for its support. In the debate over the Bosnian intervention, by the time Congress was prepared to vote, the vote was no longer about the value and efficacy of the intervention itself. Rather, it was about upholding a President that already had committed American troops and American prestige. Having painted Congress into a corner, the President won the vote to uphold American credibility and support American troops. Even so, the House of Representatives voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while expressing support for the troops. The Senate voted 69-30 to stand by the troops but "not endorse the President's decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, in the first months of his Administration, the President expanded the U.S. role in Somalia and pushed the United Nations to take on a more ambitious mandate. Congress never approved this plan, and when 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in Mogadishu on October 3, 1993, Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) led the successful effort to cut off funds for the mission and force a unilateral U.S. withdrawal from Somalia by March 1994. Not having consulted Congress before changing the nature of the Somalia intervention, President Clinton could not gauge the inherent value of the mission to Congress and the American people. Committing U.S. troops and national prestige to interventions when Congress is unsupportive and the national will is not engaged weakens American credibility abroad.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has always been tension between the Congress and the President over foreign policy, and military intervention in particular. The framers of the Constitution clearly intended both the legislative and executive branches to have a role beyond one branch's rubber-stamping the unilateral actions of the other. The system delineated by the framers was to have Congress declare war (Article I, Section 8) and the President wage war (Article II, Section 2). But since modern convention is for nations to resort to the force of arms without declaring war, this system of checks and balances has broken down. And yet, as Professor Chistopher Layne recently noted, "as the embodiment of the American people's political will, Congress has a legitimate role in deciding whether U.S. troops participate in global military interventions."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American people must be involved in supporting significant military interventions, and this requires the support of Congress as well. If an intervention is not supported by the public, it can collapse after minimum resistance and a few American casualties. This is not to say that Americans are intolerant of casualties incurred in military interventions, but they will not tolerate losses in interventions that do not have clear goals and readily apparent benefits that are worth the cost in blood and treasure. As strategist Harry Summers has written, "casualties per se are not the limiting factor. It is whether those casualties are disproportionate to the value of the mission."<sup>37</sup>  This proposition is supported by a recent sociological study of public opinion during the Lebanon and Somalia interventions. The study showed that public approval of some interventions "is not conditioned by a knee-jerk reaction to casualties. Judging from the responses we have seen to Lebanon and Somalia, it is conditioned rather by the demand that casualties be incurred for some clear and worthy purpose."<sup>38</sup>  If the mission appears to be worthless, the tolerance for casualties will be low. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The decision to undertake a military intervention cannot be made by polling or by having 535 Members of Congress act as national security advisors. Traditionally, the American public and Congress are reluctant to intervene. Presidential leadership can make a significant difference in building a case for intervention, however. President George Bush worked assiduously for months to rally Congress and the public behind Operation Desert Storm. Even then, not a single member of the Democratic leadership in either the House or the Senate voted in favor of the Desert Storm resolution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress and the American public should be involved in voting on the merits of any American military intervention, and it is the task of the President to seek that consensus. Only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the U.S. hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad.
<p>
<b>Criterion #5<br>
 The armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should use its military forces for objectives that can be achieved decisively, and that are politically decisive as well. This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just "the big ones," as some critics charge. Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli in Libya, can have a decisive effect. However, in limited interventions, there is often the temptation to restrict military requirements because the purpose is to send a political signal. This happened in 1979 when Iran was threatening Saudi Arabia. Embarrassingly, it was revealed that the F-15s which President Carter sent to help defend Saudi Arabia were unarmed. It was an empty political signal that could have been a military disaster. If U.S. combat forces are to be used in any intervention, their operations must be completely consistent with the proven operational doctrine of the United States military. This allows the U.S. armed forces to create and control the conditions for their success, no matter how big or small the tasks and the stakes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Strategy is the art of using military means to achieve political ends. A coherent strategy ensures that the armed forces have objectives that, once attained, contribute directly to the desired political solution. These military objectives must be clearly defined, attainable, decisive, and consistent with military doctrine. In other words, the military should be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well-trained, and that will make a difference once attained. From a military perspective, the most sought-after strategy would be similar to that used in the Gulf War, in which President Bush formulated "clear-cut and attainable political objectives; and the armed forces achieved those objectives through rapid and decisive military action."<sup>39</sup>  While this formula is not always so easily achieved in limited military interventions, the policymaker should strive to replicate it as much as possible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. military prefers rapid and decisive action because it delivers results. Not only is overwhelming force and decisive action consistent with the greatest success, but it tends to be the least costly way to fight. In any intervention, the military wants to keep the initiative. The actions of U.S. forces, not others, should dictate the pace of events and the outcome. Even in limited interventions, the use of overwhelming force helps American forces keep the initiative and create the conditions for success. It also helps minimize the casualties and costs of protracted or attritional warfare. Although this is often referred to as the "Powell Doctrine," it is in fact a classic tenet of military action. The official history of World War II notes that "the efficient commander does not seek to use just enough means but an excess of means. A military force that is just strong enough to take a position will suffer heavy casualties in doing so; a force vastly superior to the enemy's will do the job without serious loss of men."<sup>40</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many types of intervention are inherently resistant to this formula. Peacekeeping, for example, relies on the consent and cooperation of the local factions in order to succeed. The peacekeepers themselves cannot guarantee the outcome no matter how efficient their operations. It is for this reason that peacekeeping missions can carry on for 20 years on the Golan Heights, 30 years on Cyprus, or 40 years in India and Pakistan with no conclusion. This also could become the case in Bosnia, where U.S. forces have been deployed to a volatile environment without being able to create the conditions for success. Such interventions should be avoided, since they offer no control over what return can be expected from America's military sacrifices. The U.S. should not be interested in make-work military options in which a "draw" is a good result.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, because the U.S. is the world's military superpower, American forces will be involved in multilateral peacekeeping or other inconclusive interventions. It is imperative that the U.S. play only a supporting role in these indecisive multilateral ventures. The U.S. should promote a sensible division of labor in multilateral operations; America is not just another power. Using U.S. leadership in this way will extend American resources and allow the U.S. to focus on those crises in which the American role can be both unique and decisive. Faced with all manner of security crises, both great and small, the U.S. should function much as the Mayo Clinic does in an unhealthy world: American combat troops should not make a house call for every case of nighttime heartburn, but instead should support local doctors as the need arises. More important, the forces of the U.S. should be committed to those illnesses that are truly consequential and for which the unique and decisive capabilities of the American military are most needed and most effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also must decide when to work under the rubric of an international organization, as part of a coalition of the willing, or on its own. As a rule, if a military intervention is worth doing, it is worth doing alone. However, operating with the support and assistance of allies can offer tremendous political and military advantages. Another factor that must be recognized is the constraints presented by international organizations. An alliance such as NATO has the political legitimacy, military authority, and practiced procedures for mounting and deploying significant military operations; an organization such as the U.N., however, is not capable of forming, directing, and employing large military forces in pursuit of ambitious objectives. It is inhibited by the constraints inherent in a 185-member voluntary organization. The U.N. has neither the legitimacy nor the authority that would allow it the resources and procedures for forming and controlling complex military operations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The more complex a military operation becomes, the more it will require a stringent, rehearsed, and reliable command and control structure that can be provided only by a practiced alliance structure or a coalition dominated by a major power. A coalition of the willing, such as that in the Persian Gulf War, can be a tremendous success as long as there is a clear unity of effort and purpose among coalition partners and a legitimate and authoritative framework for command and control. Any time U.S. combat forces are involved in coalition operations, the United States should work either as the lead nation or in a parallel command and control structure where American troops remain under U.S. command and control. U.S. troops should never be put under non-U.S. command and control structures in order to "balance" coalition forces on paper; they must always have the operational autonomy to succeed through operations based on American training and doctrine.
<p>
<b>CODIFYING A MILITARY INTERVENTION POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration and Congress should institutionalize these steps in order to provide strategically sound criteria for military intervention in the post-Cold War world. The goal should be for Congress to have some oversight over America's military interventions without usurping the President's duty to form and implement a national military strategy. The President should codify his military intervention policy in a Presidential Decision Directive similar to PDD-25, but addressing more than multilateral peace operations. Unfortunately, there is no legal recourse against a President who insists on making poor strategic decisions. However, Congress can take steps to redress this problem through the National Security Strategy. This is a presidential document required by Section 603 of the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department Reorganization Act of 1986. In this document, the President is required to lay out his national security strategy: when, where, why, and how he intends to use America's armed forces in promoting the goals of the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because President Clinton's National Security Strategy has failed to provide constructive criteria about America's role in the world and how the U.S. armed forces will support that role, Congress should consider an amendment to the 1997 defense authorization bill requiring the President to:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Prioritize national interests</b> and specify national security interests that the President will support through military intervention. 
<p>
<b><li>Stipulate the criteria</b>, such as the five listed here, that will be used to discriminate when, whether, where, and how the U.S. will undertake a military intervention. 
<p>
<b><li>Specify the criteria</b> used to decide when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other multilateral structures.
<p>
<b><li>State unequivocally</b> that he will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies.
<p>
<b><li>Declare</b> that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives that can be achieved decisively through proven military doctrine.
</ol><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention. However, by establishing workable criteria, the United States can minimize those risks or, at the very least, ensure that risks are consistent with costs. The Clinton Administration has not done well in measuring the value of its interventions and has persisted in costly and inconclusive operations on the periphery instead of focusing on America's core interests. By refusing to prioritize the value of national interests, the Administration has failed to understand the price, in magnitude and duration, that the American people are willing to pay to protect these interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Strategic priorities lend clarity and coherency to a national security strategy that addresses criteria for military intervention. They also help to allocate America's finite means among the many different challenges facing the U.S. today. Failing to match means to ends results in a credibility gap and severely strained forces, a condition the United States is approaching today.<sup>41</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, if a military intervention is worth undertaking, and is better than other options, it also must be accomplishable. Thus, the U.S. must set clearly defined and achievable military objectives that the armed forces can achieve through their proven operational doctrine. Empty political "signaling" that overrides military requirements for successful operations is ultimately self-defeating. Most important, the objectives U.S. military forces achieve must be able to stand alone as politically decisive; the U.S. should not be in the business of making strategic gestures that are transient and easily reversible. Intervention must achieve a goal that serves the long-term security interests of the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. owes it to its armed forces to give them every conceivable advantage in any intervention. This includes giving them enough autonomy to create the conditions they will need to succeed. It also means that when working in a multilateral framework, U.S. forces should have a unique and decisive role that makes sense for a global leader with singular capabilities. Finally, by keeping Congress and the American people involved, the President can assure that the value of his objective is understood by all and that the benefits from military intervention are worth the costs in blood and treasure.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy currently exhibits relatively low levels of inflation, interest rates, and unemployment. Yet millions of workers remain anxious about their economic security. The relatively good economic news, combined with the widespread dissatisfaction among Americans with the nation's economic performance, seems to be a paradox. But an analysis of underlying policies and economic trends suggests an answer to this puzzle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)<sup>1</sup> -- a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies -- economists at The Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.<sup>2</sup>  The results of this analysis shed light on why Americans are so anxious about the economy's performance. According to the Heritage analysis, the 1993 tax hike, championed by the Clinton White House, did indeed produce what some critics have referred to as a "Clinton Crunch" -- a larger tax bite for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy performing well below its potential.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that, compared with how the economy would have performed without the 1993 tax legislation, Clinton's 1993 tax and budget plan will have:
<img src="bg1078t1.gif" width=408 height=459 border=0 alt="Table 1" align=right><ul><P>
<li><b>Cost the economy $208 billion in output</b> from 1993 through 1996,<sup>4</sup> in today's dollars.<sup>5</sup>  This lost output is equal to nearly $2,100 for every household in America. Last year, without the 1993 economic package, gross domestic product (GDP) would have grown $66 billion more than it actually did absent the change.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the number of private jobs created by 1.2 million</b> between 1993 and the end of 1996. Including the forecast for 1997, the total employment cost of the 1993 tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million lost job opportunities.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Delivered only 49 percent of the new revenues predicted</b> by the Congressional Budget Office from the increase in personal and corporate tax rates between FY 1994 and FY 1996. When compared with the 1.2 million lost jobs, the tax hike has depressed potential employment growth by 17,600 jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
<p>
<li><b>Cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of potential employee wages and salaries</b> between 1993 and 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the growth in real personal disposable income</b> of Americans by $264 billion in today's dollars between 1993 and 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the potential sale of automobiles by 773,700 and light trucks by 504,000</b> between 1993 and 1996. Some 1.1 million of the nearly 1.3 million <a href="bg1078c5.gif">lost vehicle sales</a> would have been produced domestically. In 1996, Heritage calculates that this loss in auto and truck sales will cost a projected 60,100 jobs across all industries.

Some proponents may argue that even if the economy is not performing up to its potential today, this slow growth period is necessary to reduce federal deficit spending which, in turn, will promote greater future growth. Yet many respected economists maintain that this will not be the case with the 1993 tax increase and budget deal: Increased taxes (and particularly increased marginal tax rates) will permanently decrease economic activity below its potential.<sup>7</sup>  Similarly, the Heritage analysis, using the WUMM economic model and forecasts of future economic activity, supports this theory. According to the Heritage analysis, nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically:
<ul><P>
<li><b>Gross domestic product is projected to be lower in each year.</b> In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li><b>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year.</b> In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><P>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. President Clinton's 1993 economic plan turns out to have deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential, leading to a slower rise in employee compensation, household income, industrial output, and most other measures of a prosperous economy. 
<p>
<b>HOW IS THE ECONOMY REALLY PERFORMING?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of quite good economic news in recent months, many Americans feel anxious about their economic security, complaining of stagnating family incomes, less money in their paychecks after taxes, and a belief that the economy is performing below its full potential. They simply do not accept that the economy is, as the President claims, the "healthiest it has been in 30 years." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the latest <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, the White House maintains that the general health of the economy is good and credits the creation of 8 million new jobs to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93), which, the report says, "set the stage for this economic expansion and resurgence, by enacting historic deficit reduction while continuing to invest in technology and education."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX) cites OBRA-93, which enacted the largest tax increase in history, as the culprit for the anxiety Americans are now feeling. Calling this condition the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/lect556.html">"Clinton Crunch,"</a><sup>9</sup> Armey claims workers are experiencing the dual effect of an actual decline in real wages and higher taxes. With fewer of their own dollars in their pockets to meet the needs of their families, he says, workers understandably have a heightened sensitivity to changing economic conditions, corporate layoffs, and downsizing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Who is right?  Is the economy performing up to its potential, as claimed by the White House?  Or are Americans suffering from the "Clinton Crunch," as claimed by Armey?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans have good reason to be confused about the direction in which the nation's economy is headed. On the one hand, there is good news in statistics showing continued economic growth, relatively low unemployment, and record highs in the stock market. And as the Clinton Administration points out, the economy has created nearly 8 million jobs over the past three years, 93 percent of them in the private sector. Clinton also claims credit for reducing the federal budget deficit for three consecutive years: According to the <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, passage of the 1993 economic plan "put the country solidly on the road to fiscal responsibility."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for Americans in recent years. For example, existing studies and government data indicate: 
<p><ul>
<li> Since 1992, real median family income has stagnated even though more adult women are working than ever before.<sup>11</sup>  Since September 1993, both real average hourly earnings and real average weekly earnings have stagnated.<sup>12</sup>
<P>
<li>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.<sup>13</sup>  Over the same period, real hourly compensation (which includes benefits as well as wages) has not increased significantly.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<li>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs in the twelve months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet. In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.<sup>17</sup>   The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<li>
From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.<sup>19</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>THE ECONOMY IS LAGGING BEHIND PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, while the economy is no longer in a recession, and indeed is experiencing modest growth, many Americans are still having trouble making ends meet and corporate layoffs have many workers thinking twice about the security of their jobs. But is this just part of a typical business cycle?  Experience suggests "no."  Although total employment has increased in recent years, the current economic expansion -- which began in March 1991 and is now some 59 months long -- is not progressing as well as it should when compared with the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months. These expansions occurred from February 1961 to December 1969, from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to July 1990.<sup>20</sup>  The failure of this economy to perform as well as similar expansions gives a clue as to why many Americans are concerned about their economic future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is interesting to compare this expansion with the average of these previous expansions. To be sure, the patterns of each expansion do differ, so data for each expansion are provided in <a href="bg1078t2.gif">Table 2</a>, as well as the average. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the current expansion:
<ul><p>
<li>The gross domestic product has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries. Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><a href="bg1078t2.gif">Total employment</a> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>The number of unemployed Americans has declined by less than half the number during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>Real median family income has <I>declined</I> by a total of 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
<li>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an <I>increase</I> of 3.1 percent during the 1982 to 1986 expansion.<sup>22</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, despite the Administration's cheerful outlook, the economy is not performing well when compared with similar points during the three previous expansions of similar lengths. The question is "why?"  Would the economy have been performing less well today without OBRA-93, as the Clinton Administration claims, or did the tax increase slow down an economy in recovery and put many workers into a wage and job squeeze, as critics claim?
<p>
<b>THE 1993 BUDGET DEAL</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all economists agree that Washington can alter the course of the economy to some degree through its tax and spending decisions. This influence is particularly evident when Congress and the President enact tax and spending policies that affect income from work or investment. For example, Washington can reduce employment and workers' take-home pay by increasing tax rates on wages and salaries. Higher rates take money directly out of workers' pockets and make work less attractive. Conversely, lower tax rates increase the incentives for men and women to work, start new businesses, or invest in training and equipment for workers. In short, tax rate changes either lower or raise the cost of labor, depending on the direction of the rate movement. Commonly, lowering labor costs leads to a higher demand for labor. When combined with lower capital costs stemming from lower taxes on capital, greater levels of economic activity are attained.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When Congress and the President adopt policies that alter economic life in some significant fashion, there will be a difference between how the economy then performs and how it would have performed had policy not been changed. These differences between actual and potential performance can be estimated statistically using models of the U.S. economy that capture the economic impact of policy changes. Generally speaking, these models allow analysts to "simulate" the impact of tax and spending decisions that could have been made -- or not made -- by Congress and the President, and then compare the simulation with what actually occurred. This is what the Congressional Budget Office routinely does when Congress is considering tax and spending legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been two major tax and spending plans enacted in recent years. These were in 1990 and 1993. American taxpayers were told that large tax increases in each of these plans would lead to a significant reduction in federal deficits and spur long-term economic growth. In this study, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to investigate the effects of the 1993 budget deal. There were two reasons for the decision to focus on the 1993 agreement: First, by 1993, the economy was largely in recovery from the 1990-1991 recession, so the impact on the expansion of the 1993 plan could be isolated more easily. And, second, focusing on the 1993 economic plan allowed analysts to test the Clinton thesis that the plan has produced "the healthiest economy in three decades."<sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1993 budget plan (OBRA-93) raised taxes $241 billion over five years and called for $77 billion in entitlement program savings and $69 billion in discretionary program savings by 1998.<sup>24</sup>  The tax law changes included two new personal tax brackets (36 and 39.6 percent) and an extension of the Medicare payroll tax to cover all wages. The motor fuel tax was increased 4.3 cents per gallon, and the tax on Social Security recipients' income from personal savings was increased. Congress and the President agreed to raise the corporation income tax to 35 percent and to restrict business meal and entertainment deductions. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The small entitlement savings came mostly from reductions in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals and increased charges to Medicare beneficiaries. OBRA-93 delayed cost of living adjustments for military and civil service retirees and limited Medicaid payments to the states. Small reductions also were made in veterans benefits, farm programs, and student loans.
<p>
<b>THE FINDINGS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comparison of the real and simulated economies suggests that OBRA-93 was not as beneficial to the economy as the White House claims. Indeed, it damaged the economy and living standards in several ways. Specifically, the Heritage analysis finds that:
<ol><p>
<b><li>Economic growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy would have grown significantly faster without the Clinton tax increases and spending reductions of 1993. These policy changes will have cost the economy <a href="bg1078c2.gif">$208 billion</a> in today's dollars in output from 1993 through 1996, equivalent to nearly $2,100 in lost GDP for every household in America. In 1995, GDP would have grown by nearly 0.90 percent more, or $66 billion in today's dollars, than it actually did. The model forecasts that GDP in 1997 will be 1.0 percent lower than it could be without the 1993 tax hike, or about $95.5 billion in today's dollars.
<p>
<b><li> The pace of business formation has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Heritage analysis shows more new businesses would have been incorporated without Clinton's 1993 package. This is due to the relationship between gross domestic product and new business incorporation. In general, for every $1 billion in GDP, about 195 new businesses are incorporated. Thus, the $208 billion fall in GDP due to the 1993 legislation will have prevented the formation of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and the end of 1996.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The loss of new businesses means not only a loss of valuable entrepreneurs, but also the loss of many new jobs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) estimates that five new jobs are created with each new business establishment. Using the SBA estimate, the loss of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and 1996 will have meant the loss of 203,000 new jobs.
<p>
<b><li>Job growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy produced 1.2 million fewer private sector jobs between 1993 and 1996 than it would have without the tax increase and budget changes of 1993. President Clinton claims credit for more than eight million new jobs during his Administration, so far, with roughly seven million of these in the private sector. But the Heritage analysis indicates that 1.2 million <I>additional</I> Americans could have been working without his policy changes. If the forecast for 1997 is added to these figures, the total private employment cost of the tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million.<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It must be noted that the loss of potential civilian employment is one of the more remarkable findings of the analysis, based on the model's design. It is also one of the more controversial. While it is the Heritage Foundation's policy to accept the model's macroeconomic results and assumptions (other than the action of the Fed -- see box, page 8) and not make adjustments in these results through statistical work performed outside the model, this particular effect of OBRA-93 deserves a brief explanation. The model's measurement of how much employment will change when taxes change (the so-called tax elasticity of employment) sits roughly in the middle of the professionally accepted range for such measurements: The model contains a factor of .29 percent change for every one percent change in labor income, and the standard range among economists goes from .12 to .37 percent. These elasticities mean that a 10 percent increase in take-home pay leads to an increase in the labor supply of between 1.2 and 3.7 percent. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The designers of the WUMM model caution users regarding the output of the model's employment equations. However, Heritage economists decided to accept the model's results because further investigations and calculations using other data bases gave general support to the conclusions in this Heritage study. If the rate changes associated with OBRA-93's increases in payroll and income taxes are applied only to the incomes of those with more than $70,000 in income, we calculate that potential employment was at least 350,000. Of course, the increase in tax rates also negatively affected investment decisions, which resulted in slower growth of job-creating new businesses and business expansion. For example, Heritage calculates that the loss in potential capital stock may account for an additional decrease of 470,000 jobs. When these and other capital effects are combined with the direct and minimal employment effects, the calculation derived from the model of 1.2 million in 1996 between actual and potential employment appears reasonable.<sup>27</sup>  Even using lower elasticities favored by some economists would mean an employment effect of at least 400,000 lost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Heritage calculates approximately 203,000 of the potential lost jobs between 1993 and the end of 1996 were a result of new businesses that were not formed. The remainder of lost potential jobs, some 1 million, most probably results from existing businesses that hired fewer employees than they otherwise would have or expanded less.
<p>
<b><li>The growth in household income and savings has been cut. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the job losses are combined with higher taxes on working families, a disturbing picture of lost household income growth emerges. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in wages and salaries has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of employee wages and salaries between 1993 and 1996, when compared with the pattern that otherwise would have occurred. Extending the analysis to 1997 would mean $162 billion in total lost wages and salaries, again in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> In 1996 alone, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton program depressed the growth in wages and salaries by $46.5 billion in today's dollars, roughly $465 for every household in America. The loss of potential income means that families spent less than they could have spent on food, clothing, transportation, medical care, and other necessities for their families. Indeed, in a typical month, the average household spends $251 on groceries, $160 on medical costs, and $40 on education.<sup>28</sup>  The addition of $465 in purchasing power for the typical household means an average of 1.8 months of groceries, or 2.9 months of medical bills, or 12 months of educational expenses in a typical year.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The growth in personal disposable income has been cut.</b> The 1993 budget deal raised taxes on millions of American households and will have cut overall real personal disposable income by $264 billion in today's dollars from 1993 through 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America. In 1996, households will have nearly 2 percent, or $101 billion, less money to spend on education, food, medical care, and other items than they would have had without the 1993 legislation.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Total personal disposable income measures both wage income and non-wage income from such things as investments. Besides lost future wages, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton tax increase and budget plan will have cost households $152 billion in non-wage income, in today's dollars, between 1993 and the end of 1996. This is equal to $1,500 for every American household. In 1996 alone, the average household will realize $550 less in non-wage disposable income, nearly double the amount the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the average household spends on appliances each year.<sup>29</sup>  Many households use income from non-wage sources to make large purchases such as the down payment on a new car, a washing machine, and other appliances. Alternatively, families may use this income to finance extraordinary events such as weddings, college education, or vacations.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in personal savings has been cut.</b> Between 1993 and the end of 1996, the 1993 budget plan will have reduced personal savings by roughly $138 billion in today's dollars. This cut in family savings means that future consumption of the things for which families save, principally housing and education, will be lower than it would have been. If 1997 is included, savings will have been cut by a total of $192 billion, in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The three things households save for most are education, housing, and retirement. To illustrate the impact of these lost savings, Heritage analysts distributed the $138 billion in lost savings to families with children, young families saving to purchase a home, and those saving for retirement, based upon age and population. We then assumed that this amount would grow at an everyday interest rate of 5 percent, to see what important purchases these three groups could make in the future with their respective accumulated savings. Each of the following amounts is what could be purchased with the future value of each group's portion of the $138 billion in lost savings:<sup>30</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>$432 billion for higher education expenses; and
<p>
<li>$335 billion for buying homes; and
<p>
<li>$3.6 trillion for retirement.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the portion of this $138 billion we allocated to families with children been allowed to earn interest for the average number of years available for savings in the under-18 age group, then the cumulative amount could have purchased a four-year college education for 7 million students at $14,000. Had the foregone savings we allocated to young families saving to purchase a home (the age group 18 to 35), been allowed to grow for 18 years, the total sum could have resulted in 17 million future home sales where a $20,000 down payment is required. And had the portion of this $138 billion allocated to people above the age of 35 -- those saving for retirement -- been allowed to grow for the average number of years before this cohort retires, the future value could have resulted in 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities paying $37,500 per year.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth of household wealth has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have reduced the growth of household net wealth by $111 billion from between 1993 and 1996. The WUMM model defines net household wealth as a sum of personal savings, the purchase of automobiles and other durables, the existing household stock of durable goods and personal capital gains.
</ul><p>
<b><li>The reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President maintains that taxes had to be raised in 1993 to reduce mounting federal debt.<sup>31</sup>  He now points to a fall in the deficit as justification for the 1993 legislation. But the Heritage analysis indicates that the weak economy produced by the tax hike will have generated far less new revenue, and thus less deficit reduction, than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had predicted for FY 1994 through the end of FY 1996. On the other hand, the analysis indicates that the modest amount of savings predicted from the spending cuts will materialize. These findings suggest that if OBRA-93 had enacted few or no tax increases to slow the economy, but more spending cuts, the deficit would be far less today than it is.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1993, CBO predicted that OBRA-93 would lower the cumulative deficits between FY 1994 and FY 1996 by $171 billion. Some $50 billion of these savings -- 29 percent of the total -- was to come from spending cuts, including $17 billion in net interest savings and asset sale proceeds. The remaining $121 billion in deficit reduction -- 70 percent of the total -- was to come from the new revenues generated by the increase in tax rates.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that OBRA-93 will have produced just 74 percent of the deficit reduction CBO had estimated, or a total of $127 billion.<sup>32</sup>  This, however, does not tell the whole story. While the spending cuts will have produced slightly more savings than CBO predicted, $52 billion (excluding asset sale proceeds), accounting for 41 percent of the overall deficit reduction achieved,<sup>33</sup> the tax increase accounts for roughly 54 percent of the total, having delivered far less new revenue than was promised. 
<p><ul>
<li>The Heritage analysis shows that the tax increase will have produced just $68 billion in actual deficit reduction between FY 1994 and the end of FY 1996, just 56 cents of actual deficit reduction for every new dollar CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>However, excluding the roughly $16 billion in new revenues generated by the increase in the motor fuels tax, the analysis shows that the increase in personal and corporate tax rates produced only 49 percent of the new revenues CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>Thus, comparing the actual amount of deficit reduction produced by the 1993 tax hike between 1994 and 1996, with the 1.2 million potential new jobs lost, it can be said that the 1993 tax increase will have meant the loss of over 17,600 new jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis of the near-term consequences of the 1993 tax increase largely confirms the results of a recent study by noted Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their analysis of the impact of the 1993 tax increase on individual behavior shows that the higher tax rates placed on upper-income taxpayers encouraged these individuals to change their economic behavior and, thus, report lower taxable income. As a result, in the first year it took effect, the 1993 tax rate increase raised just 45 percent of the "revenue that would have been collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior."<sup>34</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, Feldstein and Feenberg discovered that the 1993 tax hike caused considerable inefficiencies in the economy, what economists call "deadweight losses."  "This means that for every dollar of additional revenue collected by the government as a result of the higher tax rates, taxpayers experience a decline in their well-being equivalent to three dollars as a result of the induced changes in work, in the form of compensation, and in tax deductible expenditures."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, conclude Feldstein and Feenberg, "the structure of the 1993 tax increase thus made it a very inefficient way of increasing revenue."<sup>36</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This analysis so far has examined what might be called the short-term effects of the 1993 package. The current debate is about these short term effects, with the White House claiming benefits to today's economy. But for there to be a complete verdict on the 1993 tax and budget plan, one needs to project into the future, to explore whether the short-term effects analyzed above are merely a prelude to future growth.
</ol><p>
<b>THE LONG-TERM PICTURE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To estimate the longer-run future effects of the 1993 plan, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to extend the simulation of potential economic performance without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal through 2004. The results of this simulation were then compared with the baseline economic projections -- under current law and including the 1993 tax increase and budget deal -- produced by the owners of the WUMM model in December 1995. The comparison shows that nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically, the Heritage analysis concludes: 
<p><ul>
<li><a href="bg1078c4.gif">Gross domestic product</a> is projected to be lower in each year. In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year. In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Employment is projected to be less in every year. By 2004, 1.5 million fewer jobs will be created because of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there is good news in the economy, such as low interest rates, low inflation, 8 million new jobs, and lower federal deficits, many workers and their families feel that the recovery is anemic as far as they are concerned. The Clinton Administration is taking credit for good economic news and asserts that the news is a justification of its economic policies; specifically, the 1993 budget deal, which included the largest tax increase in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The evidence does not support the Administration's claim that the 1993 budget plan triggered stronger economic growth. On the contrary, the critics of the 1993 legislation appear to be correct that because of it Americans are caught in what some refer to as the "Clinton Crunch," the dual effect of declining real wages combined with higher taxes. The analysis by Heritage Foundation economists, using the WUMM model, indicates that OBRA-93 has had a damaging impact on the nation's economy. Removing the effects of OBRA-93 in an econometric simulation shows that the economy would have been performing better today had Congress not enacted the legislation. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, President Clinton is right to point to the 1993 budget deal as creating today's economic climate. But rather than create a better climate, the legislation has cast a dark shadow over the economy.

<P>
<a href="bg1078a.gif">Appendix:</a> Economic Impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconiliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93)
<p>
<b>Notes on the Simulation</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The simulation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) was developed using the Washington University Macroeconomic Model of the United States economy. The baseline is that produced by the model in December 1995. Only those variables in the model that reflect federal tax and spending policies were modified to create the simulation. Both the baseline case and the simulation incorporated the model's Federal Reserve reaction function. Specifically, Heritage economists made the following decisions regarding tax and spending data inputted into the model for the simulation:<sup>37</sup>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Tax Changes</b> -- Most changes in tax policy were initiated in the first quarter of 1993 to account for the retroactive nature of the tax increases included in OBRA-93. 
<p>
1. The maximum federal corporate tax rate was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level to account for the one percentage point rate increase included in OBRA-93.
<p>
2. The statutory depreciation period for nonresidential structures was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level of 31.5 years. The corporate capital consumption allowance, as a percentage of total capital consumption allowance, was increased to accommodate the shorter depreciation periods within the simulation.
<p>
3. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal tax rates on wages, dividends, and interest were restored to their "pre-OBRA-93" levels.
<p>
4. The average federal personal tax rate was adjusted to account for lower marginal tax rates within the simulation compared to actual levels.
<p>
5. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal Social Security tax rate on wages and salaries was re-set to its "pre-OBRA-93" level.
<p>
6. Federal collections from social insurance taxes were adjusted to account for the repeal of the cap on earnings subject to the Medicare tax.
<p>
7. Federal collections from indirect business taxes were adjusted for the extension and increase of the motor fuels tax account.
<p>
8. Federal collections from business taxes were adjusted to account for non-rate changes in the business income tax code.
<p>

<li><b>Mandatory Spending Changes </b>
<p>
1. The actual spending level for <b>Medicare</b> was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $55.8 billion between 1994 and 1998. 
<p>
2. The actual spending level for <b>Medicaid</b> transfers was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $7.1 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
3. The actual spending level for personal transfers was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal employee retirement and health benefits, veteran benefits</b>, and the <b>Earned Income Tax Credit</b> would create -- a net total of $6.7 billion of increased spending between 1994 and 1998. The increased spending for the Earned Income Tax Credit more than offset the savings from reforming federal employee retirement and health benefits, and veterans benefits. Therefore, the simulation actually calls for less spending on personal transfers than actually occurred during the past three years.
<p>
4. The actual spending level for other grants-in-aid was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal farm programs</b>, the <b>food stamp program</b>, and <b>"other" mandatory programs</b> would save -- a net total of $7.2 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
5.  The proceeds from FCC electromagnetic spectrum auctions and the savings from changes in federal family education loans were added to the unified deficit but not included in the NIPA-based spending accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Discretionary Spending Changes</b> -- The actual spending levels for <b>non-defense purchases, defense purchases, and federal grants</b> to state and local governments were adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in discretionary spending would save -- a total of $68.5 billion between 1994 and 1998. This was evenly distributed among the three separate accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Spending Projections FY 1999 - FY 2004</b> -- CBO September 1993 estimates extended through FY 1998. For fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the underlying growth rates were assumed.
</ul><P>

<b>Other Technical Notes</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Savings</b> -- The Heritage analysis concludes, among other things, that the tax policy changes of 1993 undercut personal savings by $138 billion. The estimates of long-term consumption effects were calculated as follows. The foregone personal savings were distributed across an array of seven age groupings by the percentage of people that fall in each grouping. This array consists of population estimates made by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for 1995.<sup>38</sup> 
<p>
<li>For those people 18 years old or less, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow until their 18th year at a compounded rate of 5 percent. The sum of this compounding ($432 billion) was divided by $14,000 to arrive at the estimate of 7 million people who could pay for four years of state university education. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 18 and 35, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 35th birthday. The sum of this compounding ($335 billion) was divided by $20,000 to arrive at the estimate of 17 million home sales that might be effected by potential home purchasers having $20,000 for a down payment and other home-buying costs. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 35 and 65, the distributed savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 65th birthday. The sum of this compounding was $3.6 trillion. To this sum was added the amount of distributed personal savings for people above age 65. It was assumed that this amount is consumed as it is received. Therefore, the total amount available for retirement was $3.6 trillion. This $3.6 trillion estimate was divided by $37,500 (an estimate of annual living costs at retirement for the cohort aged 35 and above) to arrive at the estimate of 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities.

The BLS definition of displaced workers refers to persons with 3 or more years of job tenure that lost their jobs because their plant or company closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their positions or shifts were abolished.<p>
<li>Most of the change in earnings can be accounted for by the loss in firm-size wage premiums as workers have moved from larger to smaller firms.  All else being equal, larger firms pay 12 to 23 percent more than smaller firms.  See Wesley Mellow, "Employer Size and Wages," <I>Review of Economics and Statistics</I>, August 1982, and Charles Brown and James L.  Medoff, "The employer size-wage effect," Harvard Institute of Economics Research <I>Discussion Paper</I> No.  1202, 1986.<p>

<li>The data comparisons made in this section refer to similar points in time during these four expansions.  For example, average employment growth from March 1991 to the present (59 months) is compared with the average employment growth from February 1961 to December 1965 (59 months), from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to October 1987.<p>
<li>U.S.  Bureau of the Census, "Income and Poverty 1995," <a href="http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/hhes/www/incpov94.html"> http:/www.census.gov/ftp/pub/hhes/www/incpov94.html</a>.  These are the most recent data available.<p>
<li>Data on median weekly earnings are not available on a consistent basis prior to 1979.<p>
<li>There are limits to the historical changes economists can make in structural macroeconomic models.  Clearly the major limitation is the time period.  While economies rarely experience major changes in the span of a few years, structural stability is far less likely over longer time periods.  The six years of changes in variables in the WUMM model needed to measure the 1990 tax increase would have stretched prudent econometric practice to its limits.  A number of prominent macroeconomists have written on the deleterious effects of the 1990 budget deal.  For a summary of these viewpoints, see Daniel J.  Mitchell, "The Impact of Higher Taxes:  More Spending, Economic Stagnation, Fewer Jobs, and Higher Deficits," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  925, February 10, 1993, and Daniel J.  Mitchell, "Why Higher Tax Rates on Income Will Slow Growth, Cost Jobs," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  942, May 25, 1993.<P>
<li>Congressional Budget Office, <I>The Economic and Budget Outlook:  An Update</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1993), Table 2-2, p.  29.<p>
<li>This estimate is derived from a statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of new business incorporations and real GDP over the period 1959-1994.  Overall a decrease in GDP of $1 billion was found to be associated with a decrease in the number of new business incorporations by an average of 194.957 over this period.  (The estimate had an R-squared of .92748, a standard error of 9.35, and a t-statistic of 20.852.) Multiplying this figure by the $208 billion lost from GDP over 1993-96 (as a result of the Clinton tax increase) gave an estimate of 40,600 fewer new businesses.  Figures for GDP and business formation came from the 1995 and the 1996 <I>Economic Report of the President</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1996), Tables B-2 and B-92, respectively, pp.  282, 385.   <P>
<li>The estimate of lost potential employment results from increases in taxes on the wages and salaries of upper income Americans, on the income of corporations, and on capital, an effect that stems from lengthening the period of depreciation on capital goods as well as taxing interest, dividends, and capital gains at higher rates.  Such tax increases reduce capital formation and promote consumption.  By increasing both the cost of capital and the cost of additional labor, the rate of business expansion and formation falls below potential which, in turn, reduces the potential growth of employment.<p>
<li>Most labor economists view tax increases as being equivalent to wage decreases, but they hold sharply divergent views about the degree of change in employment that results from a change in the tax rate on labor income.  See Mark Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I> (New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1983), Chapter 6, esp.  pp.  356-360.  This variation in the amount of labor that is supplied as the wage level changes is called the "wage or income supply elasticity of labor."  More specifically, the supply elasticity of labor is a measurement of the percentage change in the amount of labor that is supplied from a one percent change in the compensation of labor.  The professional literature contains estimates of the labor supply elasticity that range from.  12 to.  37 percent for every one percent change in total labor income (which become negatively signed when analyzing the effect of taxes on labor supply).  See Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I>, pp.  119-125, Table 3.2 to 3.5.  Also see comparable variation in the demand elasticities for labor in Daniel S.  Hamermesh, <I>Labor Demand</I> (Princeton, N.  J.:  Princeton University Press, 1993), Table 7.5.  The elasticity of labor supply used in the Washington University Macro Model is 0.29 percent and lies within the midrange of the estimates contained in this literature.<P>
<li>U.S.  Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, <I>Consumer Expenditures in 1993</I>, Report 885, December 1994, Table 4.  The figures are an average of all consumer units and have been adjusted to 1995 dollars.<p>
<li>Bureau of Labor Statistics, <I>Consumer Expenditure Survey, 1992-93</I>, September 1995, p 27.  Figures have been adjusted for inflation.<P>
<li>See Technical Notes for a full description of how these figures were calculated.  It should be noted here, however, that the foregone savings is distributed to three different age groupings that each save for only one of the three purchases.  Allowing only one purchase for each group significantly simplified an otherwise complicated problem.  The group that is saving for education (those people under age 18) is not saving for a home purchase.  The group that is saving for a home purchase (aged 18 through 35) is not saving for retirement.  And the group saving for retirement (age 35 and above) is saving only for retirement.<p>
<li>"... because the deficit has increased so much beyond my earlier estimates and beyond even the worst official government estimates from last year.  We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our country needs, more Americans must contribute today.... " President Clinton, "Address to the Nation," February 15, 1993.<p>
<li>The FY 1996 forecast does include some spending cuts enacted by the 104th Congress and signed by the President.  Heritage analysts, however, are unable to estimate these effects at this time.<p>
<li>A disproportionate share of the savings from spending cuts, $33 billion or 63 percent, are achieved in FY 1996.<p>

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1093.html">Backgrounder #1093</a>, <i>How A Flat Tax Would Affect Charitable Contributions</i></b> by John S. Barry. (December 16, 1996)
<p>

Contrary to popular opinion, the data suggest that giving to charities probably would increase with passage of a flat tax with no charitable deduction. The reason: The flat tax increases economic growth, personal income, savings, and net wealth, all of which lead to higher levels of giving.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/taxcut"><i>Why America Needs a Tax Cut</i></a></b>, Foreword by Steve Forbes, edited by Angela M. Antonelli and Christianna L. Shortridge. (October, 1996) 
<p>
Lower taxes followed by sweeping tax reform is a recipe for renewal. This book should arm American taxpayers with the information they need to spread the word about the benefits of a pro-growth tax policy.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">Backgrounder #1091,</a> <i>The Case for Repealing the Estate Tax,</i></b> by William W. Beach (August 21, 1996)<p> 

   "Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception." In this careful analysis of the short and long-term effects of estate taxes in the United States, Beach demonstrates the negative impact of such taxes from both an economic and a philisophically liberal position.  Warning that the apparently minor significance of the tax makes it easy and dangerous to overlook, Beach sees its repeal as a source of a better economy, more jobs, and higher wages.

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090.html">Backgrounder #1090,</a> <i>How to Measure the Revenue Impact of Changes in Tax Rates,</i></b> by Daniel J. Mitchell (August 9, 1996) <p>
One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in the 1996 election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  Using decades of empirical evidence, Mitchell explains why government officials should take such economic variables into account when determining the budgetary effects of tax reductions. 
<p>

<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi91up.html">F.Y.I. No. 91 Update,</a> <i>Selected Heritage Foundation Studies on Taxes and Economic Growth</i></b> (July 23, 1996) <p>
 
<b><a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1086.html">Backgrounder #1086,</a> <i>The Historical Lessons of Lower Tax Rates,</i></b> by Daniel J. Mitchell (July 19, 1996) <p>
Economic evidence proves that when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Examining three decades--the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s--Mitchell shows how tax policy can affect the economy and the Treasury, and provides suggestions for changes to tax policies in the 1990s.

Comparing the two dominant schools of thought on the causes of economic growth, Mitchell examines whether a balanced budget or a lower tax rate will achieve greater economic response. The lecture analyzes the impact of a flat tax on economic growth and investment.

This report examines the effects of the 1993 federal budget plan, and uses an economic model to measure the "Clinton Crunch," a combination of higher tax rates and lower real wages. The study shows how the Clinton economic plan resulted in slower growth as compared with previous economic expansions.

Government taxation and spending have reached intrusive levels in our economy and personal lives. The best way to solve the problem, the panelists argue, is to enact a flat tax that reduces the tax burden on workers and businesses, while restricting Congress's ability to take money out of the economy. Additionally, by limiting government spending and enacting laws requiring a two-thirds supermajority vote to raise taxes, Congress would go a long way toward alleviating the fiscal burden the federal government places on citizens.

<p>
A widely quoted analysis of the economic effects of the flat tax on housing prices shows a 15% drop in housing values. That study's methodology, however, is seriously flawed. This Heritage econometric analysis shows a 7% to 14 % increase in home values.

<P>
<h2>ASIAN STUDIES CENTER</h2>
<P>
Not surprisingly, four of the ten countries with the best ratings
on Heritage's <a href="/townhall/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><I>Index of Economic Freedom</a></I> - and eight of
the top 20 - were from the Asia-Pacific region. When the United
States, Canada, and Chile are included - all of which belong to
the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) --
the more broadly defined region boasts 11 of the top 20 freest
economies in the world. The APEC nations also now account for
40 percent of all global trade.
<P>
In recognition of the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific community,
The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center was established
in 1983. Today, the Center is recognized on both sides of the
Pacific as one of the most important research and policy centers
on diplomatic, economic, and security issues affecting the United
States and Asia. 
<P>
While trade and security issues dominated the calendar, Director
<a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a> and the Asian Studies Center staff made a strong
case in 1994 for significantly upgrading U.S. relations with the
Republic of China on Taiwan, a booming country of more than 20
million people that continues to be treated as a second-class
world citizen by the United States. Visiting Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/plunk.htm">Daryl Plunk</a>
and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard V. Allen</a>, National Security Advisor to President
Reagan and Chairman of the Asian Studies Center's Advisory Council,
provided Washington with much-needed guidance on defusing the
growing crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons program. And
Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a> offered the White House an agenda
for the mid-November APEC summit, proposing that leaders of the
18 member countries set a &quot;time certain&quot; for establishing
a trans-Pacific free-trade area, the topic of an Oct. 27 Asian
Studies Center conference featuring Nancy Adams, U.S. Trade Representative
for APEC Affairs, and Paula Stern, former Chairwoman of the U.S.
International Trade Commission. 
<P>
The Heritage-sponsored Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific
Press (WRAPP) hosted several &quot;newsmaker&quot; breakfasts
during the year. Rep. Floyd Spence (R-SC), then ranking Republican
on the House Armed Services Committee, discussed the North Korean
nuclear threat. Political analysts Victor Kamber, a liberal Democrat,
and Bradley O'Leary a conservative Republican, discussed the congressional
elections. And Heritage' <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a> discussed <a href="/townhall/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"><I>The Index
of Economic Freedom</a></I> and proposed changes in U.S. foreign
aid policy. 
<P>
Important financial support for many of the Asian Studies Center's
programs continues to be provided by the Korea Foundation Endowment
for Korean Studies.

For the first time in 5,000 years of China's history, a Chinese people have directly elected their leader. This impressive exercise in democracy took place on March 23 in the Republic of China on Taiwan with the election of President Lee Teng-hui. Equally impressive, however, has been the pace of political evolution in the ROC that has transformed a one-party authoritarian system into a multi-party democracy. The direct popular re-election of President Lee was the capstone in a ten-year process of liberalizing national politics and developing democracy on Taiwan, and took place even as China was conducting a campaign of military intimidation against Taiwan. Democracy on Taiwan is of great political and strategic importance. Policymakers in Washington cannot ignore the reality of Taiwan's democracy when dealing with mainland China.

<p>

<b>The Road to Democracy on Taiwan</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the ending of martial law in 1987 and the legalization of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main opposition party, the democratic transformation of Taiwan has spread across the political landscape at the local, county, provincial, and national levels. In 1992, Taiwan held the first full election of its law-making body (the Legislative Yuan);<sup>1</sup> in December 1994, ROC citizens directly elected Taiwan's provincial governor for the first time. The growth of democracy also involved amending the constitution of the Republic of China in 1994 to allow for the direct election of the president.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Taiwan's democratic transformation culminated in a four-month span from December 2, 1995, when ROC citizens for the second time elected members to the Legislative Yuan, to March 23, 1996, when they went to the polls to elect their president directly for the first time.
<p>
<b>The March Election</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 23, 1996, over 10.7 million of Taiwan's 14.3 million eligible voters cast their ballots in the first direct, democratic election of the president of the Republic of China. Incumbent President Lee Teng-hui won re-election overwhelmingly, with 54 percent of the vote. Former political prisoner and Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Peng Ming-min came in a distant second with 21 percent of the vote, and New Party candidate Lin Yang-gang and independent Chen Li-an received under 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Winning 54 percent of the vote in a four-way race with 76 percent voter participation earned President Lee Teng-hui an overwhelming mandate to push forward his platform of greater "dignity, vitality, and grand development" for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although overshadowed by the presidential election, elections for the Third National Assembly also were held on March 23. In the National Assembly, the ROC institution charged with managing constitutional reform, the Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist Party) maintained its slim majority with 54 percent of the 334 seats. The formerly independent seats were nearly equally divided between the DPP and the New Party, with slightly more going to the DPP. The DPP improved its representation in the assembly from 12.6 percent to 29.6 percent, while the New Party went from zero to 13.7 percent representation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After the elections of December 1995 and March 1996, the KMT maintains a slim majority in both the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan and thus will have to form coalitions in order to conduct the business of government. In the National Assembly, Taiwan's constitutional democracy will have to deal with the political agenda of Taiwan's evolving loyal opposition. The DPP has campaigned for constitutional amendments to eliminate the National Assembly and the office of Taiwan's provincial governor. The KMT opposes these changes, but supports less drastic measures such as extending Legislative Yuan terms from three to four years.
<p>

<b>China's Missile Diplomacy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing could not have made the contrast between the two Chinese systems more clear. On one side was the PRC -- a communist, one-party, authoritarian state. On the other, a thriving democracy. The PRC threatened the ROC with three military exercises in the three weeks leading up to and during Taiwan's democratic election. The exercises interfered with international commerce and threatened investors' confidence in Taiwan. Almost daily, Beijing shrilly charged President Lee Teng-hui with using "false" democracy to establish a dictatorship on Taiwan. The Chinese also accused Lee of wanting to split Taiwan away from the motherland. Similarly, China warned the United States that it would pay a high price, more dear than in Korea and Vietnam, if it intervened in the Beijing-Taipei dispute -- China's internal affair. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Beijing's military intimidation proved ineffective and counterproductive. The elections took place as scheduled and Lee's margin of victory exceeded expectations. In fact, China's military exercises may have contributed greatly to Lee Teng-hui's overwhelming victory. Many analysts predicted that Lee would have difficulty winning a majority in a four-way race, especially given the good showing of the DPP and New Party in the Legislative Yuan election last December. Partly because of China's missile diplomacy, this turned out not to be the case.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing's use of force also failed to accomplish its international objective: to reconfirm to the world that Taiwan is China's internal affair in which the U.S. should not interfere. While the "one China" policy remains official U.S. policy, the PRC's show of force provoked joint resolutions from Congress that urged a stronger commitment to Taiwan's defense than even the former U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense Treaty allowed.<sup>2</sup>  That pressure from Congress almost certainly played a role in the Administration's decision to send two aircraft carriers to the vicinity of Taiwan to monitor Beijing's "war games."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing's military threats forced Washington to be less ambiguous in its commitments to Taiwan. Previously, the Clinton Administration had maintained that the use of military force to protect Taiwan would depend on circumstances and developments. The dispatch of two carrier battlegroups sent a less ambiguous message. It implied that the U.S. was prepared to use force to deter China from attacking Taiwan under current circumstances. In addition, Beijing's heavy-handed tactics soured China's image in the eyes of the American public and policymakers, making it more difficult for the U.S. to pursue its policy of "constructive engagement" with China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the March crisis, Beijing asserted its resolve to use force to keep Taiwan from declaring independence. The U.S. demonstrated its resolve to use force to deter China from attacking Taiwan. And Taiwan demonstrated its resolve to move forward with political liberalization, even in the face of Beijing's military threat. In this standoff Taipei was the clear winner, Beijing the clear loser, and Washington fell somewhere in between. Taiwan stood up to Beijing's threats, garnered favorable world-wide headlines, and elicited further demonstrations of support from the United States. By contrast, Beijing soured global public opinion with its irresponsible display of military force and provoked a stronger than expected military response from the United States. In Washington, the Congress and media pushed a reluctant Clinton Administration into a stronger position vis--vis China and Taiwan. 
<p>

<b> A New Strategic Environment</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now that the Taiwan elections are over, it is time for the U.S. to take stock of its positions and policies toward China and Taiwan. Ever since 1950, when President Truman sent the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait at the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. has been part of a strategic triangle with the PRC and the ROC. For 46 years America's aim has been to prevent either the PRC or the ROC from using non-peaceful means to resolve the question of Taiwan's status. This triangular relationship survived near nuclear crises in the 1950s and changes in diplomatic recognition in the 1970s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The rise of democracy on Taiwan changes this triangular relationship and forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance. Economic and political freedom on Taiwan amplify the lack of similar freedoms in China. Taiwan has proven that free enterprise and democracy are compatible with and desirable in a Chinese society. Taiwan's rapid progress leaves many Americans impatient for similarly rapid change on the mainland. For the U.S., democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking improved relations with China.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For China, democracy on Taiwan takes away Beijing's self-proclaimed ability to speak for the people of Taiwan. Beijing no longer is able to extend a hand of friendship to the people of Taiwan while slapping its leader in the face. It is increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people, while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese people who elected him.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing fears democracy on Taiwan for several reasons. Democracy makes the government of Taiwan less predictable and harder to control, since it now must respond to the electorate's competing interests or be voted out of office. Democracy on Taiwan also increases the sympathy of the world's other advanced democracies for Taiwan. Moreover, Beijing fears democracy on Taiwan because it contrasts so strikingly with the leadership selection process on the mainland. In fact, it strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. What if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative?  The answer no longer can be that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Taiwan, democracy is also of great strategic importance. Fifteen years from now, Taiwan's hostile neighbor will be economically and militarily capable of dominating it, and possibly conquering it. Democracy is more important to Taiwan's strategic defense than any weapon system it could acquire. It makes Taiwan much more likely to draw support from the U.S. and other developed democracies in the event of any real threat from the mainland.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, though, democracy on Taiwan challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan. Reunification can take place only within a political system in which the government is responsive to the interests of the governed, not where the governed are beholden to the dictates of the government. By proving that democracy is possible and desirable in a Chinese society, Taiwan opens the door for Beijing to adopt such a system to protect the interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
<p>

<b>What Is At Stake</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At stake in the PRC-U.S.-ROC triangular relationship is peace and stability in Asia. American interests in this relationship range from freedom of navigation on the high seas, to control of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, to the development of democracy and free enterprise in Chinese society, to access to the markets of America's sixth and seventh largest trading partners -- the PRC and the ROC, respectively. In order to best serve these interests, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<b><li>Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue.</b> For the Chinese themselves to resolve Taiwan issues, as posited in the 1972 Shanghai Communiqu, they must meet face to face to negotiate.<sup>3</sup>  Beijing suspended Taiwan's primary channel of communication with the mainland last July in response to Lee Teng-hui's visit to the U.S. Therefore, the U.S. should use its ability to communicate with Beijing to encourage Beijing and Taipei to restore this forum for the discussion of fundamental issues in cross-Strait relations.
<p.
<b><li>Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations.</b> Washington should lend its support to Taiwan's membership in international commercial and cultural organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria for membership in the WTO, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its entry, even in the face of China's determined opposition.
<P>
<b><li>Urge Beijing to allow Taiwan to play an appropriate role in the international system.</b> Beijing must work with Taiwan to evolve an appropriate role for Taiwan in the international system. Taiwan is a separate, autonomous, and prosperous region which can and should play a role in international affairs. Taiwan is simply too large and important as a trading nation for either Beijing or Washington to ignore. Beijing must accept this reality. All international economic and cultural organizations, whether they technically require sovereignty or not, should be mutually agreeable. The successful examples of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) should be followed to allow both Beijing and Taipei to participate in international organizations.
<p>
<b><li>Sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, especially strategic missile defense.</b> Washington should continue to sell arms of a defensive nature to Taiwan in accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Given recent threats from Beijing, the U.S. should assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile defense system.
<P>
<b><li>Avoid linking MFN and Taiwan issues.</b> Washington should carefully consider the unintended consequences of any actions taken against China, such as revoking most-favored-nation trade status or applying unilateral sanctions, as they may indirectly harm Taiwan and Hong Kong, not to mention U.S. workers and consumers. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle rests are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the U.S. and other markets. Revoking MFN could cut Hong Kong's gross domestic product in half, deal a serious blow to Taiwan's economy, and jeopardize the 200,000 high-wage American jobs that depend on U.S. exports to China.
<p>
<b><li>Urge Taipei to avoid cross-Strait conflict and provocation.</b> Taipei must know that the U.S. wholeheartedly supports the efforts of the people of Taiwan to seek political and economic freedom and a greater role in world affairs. However, Taipei must understand that any unilateral action to determine the status of Taiwan, including a unilateral declaration of independence, is counter to the U.S. interest in peace and stability in Asia. Taipei must work with Washington and Beijing to ensure its security, and to protect its economic prosperity, by reasonably avoiding conflict and provocation.
<p>
<b><li>
Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement.</b> There is little chance of peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status if one party is negotiating with a gun pointed at its head. One possible way to defuse the tension could be for Taipei to pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time and for Beijing to respond by renouncing the use of force for that period of time. The U.S. could add credibility to a cross-Strait armistice agreement by endorsing it.
<p>
<b><li>
Engage in preventive diplomacy.</b> Beijing clearly misread the Taiwan electorate and miscalculated the international response toward China's missile diplomacy. To prevent such misunderstanding and miscalculation from occurring again, the U.S. must improve communication with Chinese leaders at the highest level. The U.S. should promptly and clearly inform Chinese leaders of the likely response Beijing's actions will provoke in a democracy where elected leaders must respond to constituent interests and public opinion. In Beijing a better understanding of America's democracy will help build stronger relations with the U.S. and the American people. Improved Sino-American relations are not only in the interest of China and the U.S., but of Taiwan as well.
</ul><p>


<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy. Despite a firestorm of military and rhetorical threats from Beijing, the electoral process in Taiwan functioned freely and fairly. Over 600 visiting journalists witnessed the triumph of democracy in Taiwan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election was truly an historic event. Leaders in Beijing, Taipei, and Washington now must assess the strategic implications of democracy on Taiwan. A new balance must be established in the PRC-U.S.-ROC triangular relationship. Central to a new equilibrium must be a new international role for the Republic of China. This role should comport with Taiwan's standing as an economic powerhouse and mature democracy. Also central to the new balance should be an increased dialogue allowing Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to work out their differences. As they do so, both should accept not only the need for maintaining peace and stability, but also the fact that democracy now exists in the Republic of China on Taiwan.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In preparing to shut down the federal government in November 1995, before President Clinton's veto of the second continuing resolution to keep federal agencies operating, the Clinton Administration made the customary distinction between "essential" employees, who would remain on the job, and "non-essential" employees, who would be furloughed. For the U.S. Department of Education, the Clinton Administration determined that 4,394 of the department's 4,937 employees -- or 89 percent -- were "non-essential" and would be furloughed for the duration of the budget impasse.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unwittingly, the Clinton Administration confirmed what Congress should recognize: America does not need a federal Department of Education. Congress should take the opportunity afforded by the budget process to return to states, local governments, and parents the authority and responsibility for education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 19, 1996, President Clinton submitted a budget to Congress that requested a 7.2 percent increase in FY 1997 discretionary funds for the <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a>.<sup>2</sup>  While the Administration makes certain attempts to realize savings through consolidation and reform of redundant and outdated programs, the proposal reflects an unquestioning commitment to an institution that has failed to prove its value in reaching the President's stated goal of giving "every single American citizen the education that all of us need to compete and win in the new century."  The education establishment has failed to demonstrate any positive correlation between federal education spending and education performance. It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education, not to spend more money in the hope that programs which have not worked in the past somehow will be made to succeed with increased funding.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Created by Congress in 1979 at the request of President Jimmy Carter, the Department of Education is doing precisely what its severest critics envisioned: usurping local and state control of education by slowly and steadily introducing federal programs, rules, and requirements. Although the department accounts for about six percent of total public funding of education, its influence is out of all proportion to its financial role. Indeed, the Department of Education is inserting itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts. Bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive, it is a metaphor for many of Washington's most wasteful and meddlesome domestic programs. As Chester E. Finn, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Education during the Reagan Administration, noted in recent congressional testimony:
<p><blockquote>
	The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in Washington over the past several decades. The national government has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, that Washington knows best and is taking charge.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Why should the U.S. Department of Education be eliminated?  Its time has come and gone. It is time to restore common sense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thanks to the Reserve Powers Clause in the Tenth Amendment, all powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states. Education is such a power; a federal role is both gratuitous and intrusive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is time to restore federalism to its founding principles, and there is no area more fruitful than education. Despite the desperate need for reform, there is no master template--certainly not one originating in Washington--to improve the schools. States and localities are "laboratories of democracy"; reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pedagogy - -the art of teaching and learning -- is quintessentially local in nature. Indeed, it goes on at the classroom and individual level. The closer decision-making is to the student and teacher, the better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal role is costly as well as intrusive, requiring an expensive and burdensome bureaucracy to manage national programs. Washington should do only those things states and localities cannot do for themselves, such as national data collection and targeted research.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most alarming aspect of growing federal control of education is not administrative interference, however, but its adverse impact on academic performance, equally the product of sins of omission and commission. The increasing power of special-interest groups, the burgeoning size of school districts, the refusal of the public schools to submit to any market discipline, weakening community bonds, a pervasive anti-intellectualism in schools of education, general permissiveness, family dissolution -- all have played a role. At no time in American history has academic performance been more important. Yet, as the federal role has increased, education performance has declined. While cause and effect are elusive, and the department's supporters assert a variety of causes to explain the decline in student performance, these changes nonetheless occurred during, and as a part of, the federal ascendancy in American education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<a href="bg1076c1.gif">Chart 1</a> illustrates how SAT scores have declined in the last 25 years as the federal role in education has increased. Since the creation of the department in 1979, scores have stagnated: In 1980, the national average was a combined 890; in 1994, the average was 910. What appears to be a small amount of progress could be attributed to changes in methodology on the SAT, which include a shortened test and permission to use calculators. In terms of graduation rates, the 8 percent of eighth graders who failed to complete high school in 1978 rose to 12 percent in 1992. In other measures of reading, science, and math ability, there has been some measurable improvement. When compared to the scores of other industrialized nations, however, it becomes clear that measuring success against where we were 20 years ago may not be sufficient if we still consistently lag behind other industrialized parts of the world, as <a href="bg1076c2.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates. The United States spends more money per elementary and secondary school pupil than any other country, with little to show for such an investment (see <a href="bg1076t1.gif">Table 1</a>). How education money is spent is as important as the amount spent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even if the federal role has not been directly responsible for education decline, this is clearly not the time to do more of the same. Taxpayers should realize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to "federalize" the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of education. At least since the advent of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, federal involvement in education has been designed to make each state more like the others.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not surprisingly, the descent to the lowest common denominator has been relentless. The inverse relationship between education performance and an increasingly intrusive federal education bureaucracy is so pronounced that it invites the most profound skepticism about any significant federal role in education. It is time for Congress to close down the Department of Education, reassign appropriate federal functions to their proper place in the national government, and return authority to those who really should be responsible for the nation's schools.

<P>
<b>THE ORIGINS OF THE DEPARTMENT</b>
<P>
<b>A Limited Federal Role</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1867, the federal government created a Department of Education to gather and disseminate statistics in order to improve the nation's public schools. The department was modeled after the Department of Agriculture, created in 1862 as a free-standing, sub-Cabinet-level federal agency, and was tasked with promoting the cause of education by publishing statistical reports and comparisons of school effectiveness. A bitter debate surrounded the establishment of the department as a free-standing agency, for although it was tasked only with data gathering and dissemination, many feared that it would grow to challenge state control of public schools. A coalition of Democrats and a wide spectrum of Republicans fought to abolish the department soon after its creation, and a compromise was reached, under which the office was moved to the Department of the Interior in 1868. The office continued to exist, but its influence was tempered by a Congress that allowed only modest increases in funding and personnel. Throughout the following century, amid several name changes and reorganizations, the agency played a carefully limited role in the development of federal education policy, with the Interior, Agriculture, and Labor departments also performing education-related functions.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the Office of Education grew, and so did its mission. In 1947, in the <i>Everson</i> case the U.S. Supreme court set the stage for increased federal involvement in education, establishing a precedent for federal involvement in state and local school policies by limiting public support for religious schooling. Two decades later, President Johnson's War on Poverty sought to improve the quality of and access to education with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. ESEA empowered the U.S. Office of Education to aid schools in low-income areas and strengthen state departments of education.<sup>5</sup>  The office performed analyses of state and local educational trends and gained authority to enforce racial discrimination guidelines. And while the Office of Education did not control curriculum, it supported a number of curriculum reform projects -- "new math" and MACOS (Man, A Course of Study), for example -- that were both intrusive and ineffectual. As the office distributed funds at the local level, it also required evaluations of regulatory compliance. No longer was the Office of Education merely a "statistical secretary" to the nation's schools.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1970s, education groups lobbied heavily for a Cabinet-level Department of Education. The National Education Association had long supported the creation of a Cabinet-level agency but had little support from Congress. President Jimmy Carter, in an effort to keep a campaign pledge, sought its creation soon after his inauguration. Overcoming opponents, supporters of a Cabinet-level department prevailed in 1979 with the Department of Education Organization Act, which passed easily in the Senate (72 to 21) but narrowly in the House (210 to 206).<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. Department of Education was created for the least defensible of reasons: politics. The education establishment desperately wanted its own Cabinet-level department, and creating it helped cement their political ties to liberals in Congress. In turn, a more pronounced federal role would raise the visibility of education and lead to more and more federal involvement in policymaking and funding. With such a dynamic in place, state and local education would become increasingly federalized. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Department increased the power of education interest groups, however, two decades of test scores show that public education has become progressively weaker and more ineffective. As Chester Finn observes:
<p><blockquote>
	It became clear that the authors want to substitute decisions made in Washington for decisions made by individual households and communities. They create new governance mechanisms and regulatory apparatus at both national and state levels. They use federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the very forms of behavior that other parts of the legislation term "voluntary."  They throw obstacles onto such promising reform pathways as school choice and private management of public schools. They transform what has been a national movement into a federal program.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education thus was not, and is not, a child of carefully reasoned policy or pressing national need. It was the product of politics and is an instrument of interest group political power. That is why it behaves as it does. The calculus is straightforward: President Carter made a political promise and kept it. After decades of existence, a cautious and careful professional association -- the National Education Association (NEA) -- became politicized in the 1970s and 1980s. Determined to create a national education presence, the NEA had one overriding agenda: "one-third, one-third, one-third."  By this, the NEA meant that each level of government -- local, state, and federal -- would provide one-third of the total dollars for education.<sup>9</sup>  It also wanted a Department of Education to increase central control of education through an agency that would be influenced by organized teachers and administrators rather than parents. In exchange for the support of the National Education Association for his candidacy, Jimmy Carter and his liberal allies in Congress delivered a Cabinet department.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ironically, the department's severest critics included those who regard themselves as among American education's best friends. The concern at the time is best captured in <i>Washington Post</i> editorials opposing the creation of the department nearly 20 years ago:
<P><blockquote>
	If the House does agree to enshrine an insulated, supergraded federal educational bureaucracy in the Cabinet, the results are likely to be so costly and unhealthy for American education that many representatives, in retrospect, will be embarrassed to admit that they voted "yea."<sup>10</sup>
<p>

	We are not one-time offenders in this business.... [W]e are, in fact, hardened criminals, hopeless recidivists and probably -- why mince words?  -- incorrigibles. We have been fighting the creation of a separate Department of Education since 1953 [and] we remain adamantly opposed to the creation of this new department. We think it is an awful idea and nothing that has been said or that has happened in the last 26 years has given us reason to think otherwise -- including and especially the Carter administration's campaign in favor of it.<sup>11</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason for such a reaction was that President Carter's proposal was startling even by Washington standards. There simply was no compelling organizational reason to create a Cabinet-level Department of Education, except to usurp state and local power -- a claim not even the most ardent supporter would make in public. It was a simple political payoff, obvious to everyone. Joining the <i>Post</i> in its opposition to the new department was the Committee Against a Separate Department of Education, created by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Made up of education, research, labor, and civil rights groups from across the country, and including prominent figures such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), the committee was afraid that the new department would have a baleful effect on America's long and successful tradition of local control of education. According to Moynihan, the department was a result of a "backroom deal, born out of squalid politics."<sup>12</sup>  Gregory Humphrey, director of legislation for the AFT, likewise declared: 
<P><blockquote>
	 We believe this is a hoax. It will not result in the improvement of education anywhere. [Test scores and literacy measurements] are the things people think of when they want an improvement in education -- not who talks to the President and when, or how many assistant secretaries can dance on the head of a pin.<sup>13</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite this criticism, when President Reagan proposed to abolish the department just two years later, he was barely able to find an author to carry his legislation. The abolition proposal vanished without a trace. Congressional support for a Department of Education was no stronger than when the Department had been created, but just as Congress had little energy or enthusiasm for creating the department, it could not marshal the resolve to dismantle it. The new <i>status quo</i> triumphed. 
<p>

<b>A DEPARTMENT IN SEARCH OF A JUSTIFICATION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The failings of the Department of Education (and the Office of Education before it) have been sins of omission as much as sins of commission. It is not just that Department officials foisted such things as "bilingual education" on an unwilling nation; the department also forfeited tremendous opportunities. Had it been a force for a constructive new federalism, it could have partially justified its existence as a "bully pulpit" for reform and academic excellence (as it was under Secretaries William Bennett and Lamar Alexander). But for most of its 18 years as a Cabinet department, it has been simply a handmaiden of special interests. Not surprisingly, the Department of Education is a department for producers (educators), not customers (parents and children). The problem is organic and institutional, and is not simply a function of lackluster political appointments.

<p>
<b>The National Interest in Education</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, there is a national interest in education: a compelling national interest in high quality education for all Americans, of all backgrounds and from all regions. But that interest is best served by a vigorous federal system, not by centralization. The states are and should be "laboratories of democracy"; to force them into the same mold does violence both to America's constitutional traditions and to the very nature of education. It misconceives both. If, for example, there were one best system by which to educate everyone, a uniform federal role might have some basis in logic if not in practice. The French (who invented modern bureaucracy) and the Japanese are among those who make such a claim; but among Americans, a uniform federal role, except in a carefully delineated fashion, has always been understood to be bad policy and worse practice. A robust federal system offers unparalleled opportunities to reform and improve education, state by state, community by community. As each state learns more about reform within its own borders, other states are free to learn from its reforms and avoid the pitfalls of the less successful. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The argument for state and local control of education begins with the Constitution and ends with common sense. The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves to the states all powers not specifically delegated to the national government, and education is quintessentially a state and local matter. From the time of the ancient Greeks to the present, education has been understood as a transaction between student and teacher. Everything else -- school districts, school boards, state rules and regulations, the federal role -- should be supportive, designed to assist teacher and student. Yet, as any candid observer must admit, a public school system, like any bureaucracy, tends to become insular and self-serving. The fault is not in teachers, but in the structure within which they must function. Unfortunately, the federal role reinforces this unhappy tendency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The further control is removed from the classroom, the greater the danger that teachers will be frustrated and students (and their families) shortchanged. Of all social activities (such as health care, criminal justice, housing, transportation, and economic policy), schooling is the least likely to profit from centralized control. Yet that has been precisely the goal of federal involvement. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, adding a federal dimension has not solved lower-level bureaucratic problems within the system -- it has made them worse. Not surprisingly, just as "command-control" economies have failed around the globe, command-control schools are failing. At issue is a deceptively simple administrative principle: decentralization. In the world of business, this means that those who are closest to the workplace should make as many decisions as possible. In the world of public administration, it means the same. Each unit of government should do what it does best -- and only that. Higher units of government should yield as much power as possible to lower units, and must be able to defend -- in terms of efficiency or justice -- whatever functions they retain.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps most important, the states have grown dramatically in their ability to deal with problems and seize opportunities. Not only have state legislatures become modernized, and state governors increasingly more sophisticated, but most states now have well-organized citizen watchdog groups and state and regional think tanks that provide oversight and policy guidance.<sup>14</sup>
<P>

<b>The Lack of Need for Federal Intervention</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the Department of Education been created for compelling policy reasons, had serious problems been successfully addressed, had something "broken" been fixed, or had student performance climbed upward over the past decade and a half, perhaps some federal involvement in education could be defended. But only a weak political defense was advanced at the time, and no intellectually serious defense is being advanced now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No government agency should be allowed to continue indefinitely without having to justify itself to the people's representatives. Each one should be required to demonstrate that it is doing something worthwhile -- in other words, to convince Members of Congress that it is worth preserving. Members of Congress should ask themselves three basic questions: Would the U.S. Department of Education survive serious scrutiny if forced to justify itself?  Has it improved American education significantly?  If Congress were starting from scratch, would it create the same bureaucracy that exists today?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal role in education emerged in waves, in response to crises perceived or real. In the modern era -- after the GI Bill, a program to support and reward veterans of World War II -- there were five major waves: first, under President Dwight Eisenhower with aid to higher education, a military/economic response to Sputnik; second, under President Lyndon Johnson with the Great Society; third, under President Richard Nixon with limited federal support for research and development; fourth, under President Gerald Ford with P.L. 94-142, a bill to aid handicapped children that created radical federal intrusions into the classroom by making education a federal civil right; and fifth, under President Jimmy Carter with the decision to upgrade the Office of Education within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) to a separate Cabinet-level department.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Other programs have been added, but with the notable exception of special education, the broad contours of federal education policy were established under the Great Society. The announced reason for this was equity -- racial and economic justice. A long history of state indifference -- and even outright hostility--to the rights of black Americans finally mobilized a powerful constituency for federal intervention in education. Even though education is clearly a state and local function, both in terms of practice and in terms of policy, and as important as local control is, racial justice formed a higher claim, one that must be honored. But just as tough cases make bad law, moral fervor is no guarantee of balanced and effective legislation. As Finn notes,
<p><blockquote>
	There were genuine quantity-and-access problems at the time, and it was legitimate to enlist the national government in their solution. But the world has changed in the three decades since these programs were born and these assumptions fixed in policy. The essential nature of the education problem facing the United States is altogether different today.<sup>15</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Preempting the States.</b> Put bluntly, the task for the Carter Administration and liberals in Congress was to circumvent the Tenth Amendment, which specifically reserves to the states all powers not specifically delegated to the national government. Education is such a power.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The effect of this limitation is quite dramatic. Any federal role in education, insofar as it exists at all, is conditioned on one of two things: either some larger federal role, such as civil rights, or money. In the case of civil rights, the states must bend to federal law. But in all other areas -- curriculum, organization of instruction, homework, discipline policies, testing and measurement, or the hiring and firing of teachers, for example -- the amendment implies that the federal government can do no more than offer states and localities money and specify the terms. In other words, no compliance, no money; states and localities are free to refuse the funds, and Washington is free to withhold them. That is the theory. The reality, however, is that few states or localities refuse federal funds; the temptation of the "money power" has proven to be nearly irresistible.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Embedded in this broader debate is the "Mississippi problem."  Historically, the federal government treated all states equally; a rule for one was a rule for all. At one level, this is a sensible policy response in a federal system -- the equal treatment of equals. But the federal role in education was not motivated by such considerations; it was motivated by the conviction that there were vast disparities among the states that must be remedied. In this context, treating all states equally caused important problems. By default if not design, Mississippi became the benchmark. At the time of the Great Society, Mississippi was the poorest, lowest spending, lowest achieving, most racially segregated state in the nation. As the largest of the federal government's initial forays into education, Mississippi set the bureaucratic pace for everyone else: the lowest common denominator policy. Management by exception was never entertained; there would be one bureaucracy for all. And so it has remained.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
No matter that some states were more sophisticated and enlightened than official Washington, or that Washington bureaucrats had no claim to superior knowledge or virtue; each state would march to the same drummer. The appeal of "free" money proved to be nearly irresistible. State after state accepted official Washington's largess, and few if any appealed to their congressional delegations to change the rules. It was one-way federalism.
<P>

<b>RESTORING THE PROPER FEDERAL ROLE IN EDUCATION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The one irresistible impulse of any bureaucracy is to assume power -- indeed, to usurp power -- to serve its own internal dynamic. Put slightly differently, bureaucracy is designed to institutionalize the suspension of judgment, and bureaucracies do precisely what they are designed to do. They are "one-size-fits-all" institutions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Given the predilections of bureaucracy and the fragility of the education process, what is the compelling reason for a federal Department of Education?  Is Washington more virtuous, more competent, more equitable, more knowledgeable, more capable, more caring, more decisive, or more clever than states and localities?  Make no mistake: That is the issue. Only something of this magnitude justifies federal involvement in education.<sup>18</sup>  By way of illustration, it is clear that there is an overriding federal responsibility to guarantee the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school and out. The same is true of national data collection; Washington is better equipped to collect and display the data than any state or locality -- indeed, than all states and localities. In this case, of course, official Washington is the proxy for all states and localities. At the other end of the scale, however, is the management of classroom instruction, curriculum, and textbook adoption. In the best of circumstances, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice. To control classroom management in Washington does violence to everything that we know about education; its only justification must be political, not pedagogical. And a political justification is, on its face, indefensible.
<P>

<b>Legislative Initiatives</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Members of the House desiring to eliminate the department generally fall into two camps: those who believe it should be eliminated entirely and those who think it should be merged with the Department of Labor and the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. The only bill currently under consideration is one that would terminate the department, although there may yet be a merger bill. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.1883:">Back to Basics Education Reform Act</a> (H.R. 1883) sponsored by Representatives Joe Scarborough (R-FL) and Steve Chabot (R-OH), seeks to abolish the Department of Education within one year of enactment. The bill rolls all elementary and postsecondary education programs that are not terminated into two separate block grants to the states that are authorized for four years. These grants would be administered by a new Office of Educational Opportunities (OEO) within the Department of Health and Human Services, which also would run student aid programs, IDEA, and other programs not terminated or transferred elsewhere under the bill. The programs transferred to the new OEO would have their administrative accounts reduced by 30 percent, based on their FY 1995 appropriations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Abolishing the department and returning control of education to parents and to state and local governments would improve education and help to ensure that the federal government does not overregulate and interfere in an area that is fundamentally local in nature.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
H.R. 1883 eliminates major portions of the federal bureaucracy, including Titles I-VII and IX-XIV. A few of the larger programs remain intact. Impact Aid, a program designed to aid local school districts educating children living on military installations, is transferred to the Department of Defense. Indian Education programs are transferred to the Department of the Interior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
H.R. 1883 is an excellent vehicle with which to accomplish this precisely because it recognizes explicitly that the "principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution of the United States entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the States and the people and a Federal Department of Education is inconsistent with such principles (Sec. 2.1)."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI) belongs to the merger camp but has yet to draft any legislation. Under his proposal, which currently exists only in outline form, the department would be merged with the Department of Labor and the EEOC, with the intent that a more relevant and efficient delivery system be established in order to ensure that America's children have the necessary knowledge and skills to prepare them for the workplace of the 21st century.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This proposal is driven primarily by the need to streamline and save, with the stated end goal being to "prepare our youth for the challenges of the 21st century."  As Representative Gunderson stated in a press release earlier this year, 
<p><blockquote>
	By simply consolidating programs and eliminating duplication, we can stem the immense bureaucratic growth of these agencies and realize some savings in the process.... [I]t is not the function of this proposal to debate the merits of each program. Rather, through broad consolidation and coordination of programs, we can make dramatic cost savings and achieve a better federal education and employment system at the same time.
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unlike the Scarborough bill, which uses an underlying philosophy of the proper role of the federal government in education to determine what programs will be retained and where they will be lodged, Gunderson's focuses on streamlining the delivery of existing services rather than on whether the federal government ought to be involved in them at all. Having the Department of Education emphasize "work force preparation and policy" begs the question. Parents educate their children not only for the work force, but also for life. Even if education is tantamount to "work force preparation," that does not compel a federal role in bringing about that objective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Official Washington's role should be limited to doing those things states and localities cannot do for themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose. The list is short and does not require a Cabinet-level department to implement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Getting it right.</b> Congress should dismantle federal agencies that do not serve the public interest, and the Department of Education is the most visible example. Conceptually, as Bennett, Alexander, and Finn all have noted:
<P><blockquote>
	The federal government should recognize that education in America is "the constitutional responsibility of the states, the social responsibility of communities, and the moral responsibility of families";<sup>20</sup>
<p>
	"Except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the federal government should <i>never</i> impede the capacity of families, communities and states to decide how best to provide education to their children";<sup>21</sup>
<p>
	The bully pulpit is appropriate, but goals and standards must always be truly voluntary; federal funds should not be used as "carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local control; and
<P>
	The federal government should "dedicate itself to (a) fostering family responsibility and local control, (b) assisting states to fulfill their responsibilities as they see fit, (c) providing sound statistics, prompt and accurate assessment results and other information, and (d) safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination."<sup>22</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Doing it right.</b> To send responsibility home where it belongs, to transfer legitimate federal functions to other federal agencies, and to eliminate what is unnecessary is the job for Congress. For example:
<p><ul>
<li> The protection of the civil rights of all Americans should be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice, as they are enforced in the larger society; a separate Office of Civil Rights in an Education Department is not necessary.
<p>
<li> Data collection, dissemination, analysis, and research should be transferred to a central Office of Data Collection in the Bureau of the Census.
<p>
<li> Aid to poor children in elementary and secondary schools (Title I/Chapter 1) should be made available to them as a transfer payment on their behalf, or as an education voucher. This should be negotiable in any school that satisfies a state's compulsory attendance statutes, without reference to whether the school is public or private, secular or denominational (as is the case in all other industrialized democracies). The administrative responsibility should be transferred to the states as part of an elementary and secondary education block grant administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
<li> College financial aid should be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services for the immediate future, and such aid should be merit as well as needs based (as it is in every other industrialized democracy). 
<p>
<li> All remaining funds should be made available as two block grants to the states, that would be gradually phased out. One block grant should be for elementary and secondary education programs and the other for higher education.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's taxpayers no longer believe in major federal solutions to problems that are quintessentially local in nature. Congress can undo the damage and restore education -- lower and higher -- to its rightful place. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Great Society and the cluster of programs that grew up around it describe the contours of the modern federal role in education. They are nothing if not large, ambitious, bureaucratic, and intrusive. While these programs were introduced for a variety of reasons, the most important was the simplest: the conviction that states and localities could neither get it right nor go it alone. Most Americans no longer believe this (if, indeed, they ever did). It is time to restore education to its rightful role and place; federal involvement has been tried and, by and large, found wanting. The principle that should guide us into the next century is simple: Devolve to states and localities the responsibility for education. That is the necessary first step. The results will be both profound and far-reaching: the restoration of federalism and the revitalization of the nation's schools.

<h3>APPENDIX </h3>
<p>
<b>DISMANTLING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the Department of Education was created, a number of important programs affecting schools were not transferred from other agencies to its control; as a result, interagency coordination remained a problem. For example, Head Start was left in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services), which also retained control over school lunch programs. The new Cabinet agency in fact consolidated some 25 percent of about 400 federal higher education activities and less than one-third of all educational expenditures then in the federal budget.<sup>24</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the department's limited scope, opponents who feared the growth of a federal presence in education turned out to be correct. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Department of Education had a budget over $14 billion, 7,000 employees, and as many assistant secretaries as its parent agency, HHS. Today, the department has more than doubled its budget (now over $31 billion) and has more than 240 categorical programs -- 100 more than in 1980. The range of its activities will be broadened even further if, as the Clinton Administration has proposed, it succeeds in establishing its own direct lending program. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Continued federal involvement in education is wasteful and inefficient, and involves responsibilities best left to the states and local communities. The following analysis describes each program, identifies its key problems, and presents a series of recommendations for reform.<sup>25</sup>  Reform consists of doing one of the following in each case: (1) sending the program back to the states and local communities through an elementary and secondary education or a higher education block grant; (2) transferring the program to another federal agency that can handle the issue more efficiently; or (3) terminating the program because it has outlived its usefulness or is better handled by some other agency.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
FY 1995 appropriation figures are given for most programs in order to give a sense of the size of each program and the amount of money that would be saved or transferred to block grants.
<P>
<b>OFFICE OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION: TERMINATE AND TRANSFER FUNDS
<P>
1995 Appropriation: $9.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) should be terminated and its funds turned into an elementary and secondary education block grant administered within HHS in a newly created Office of Education. 
<p>
<b>I. Education Reform
<p>
Goals 2000: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $408 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Enacted in 1994, the Goals 2000: Educate America Act provided funds to states, local districts, and schools to develop comprehensive education reform plans. Under the program, states applied to the federal government for funds to be used for academic standards, model curricula, staff training, and student assessments. Goals 2000 established three new federal boards: the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), the National Skills Board, and the National Education Goals Panel.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year-old Goals 2000 legislation, President Clinton's most important education program, has been a failure. Instead of "revolutionizing, revitalizing and reforming" America's schools, as President Clinton promised, Goals 2000 actually has slowed the process of change.<sup>26</sup>  It has created suffocating new government bureaucracies, increased federal regulations, and boosted federal spending. Worse still, it threatens to undermine progress to improve American education performance by encouraging schools to ignore academic "outputs" -- the results -- and focus instead on obtaining federal dollars by showing Washington that more money is being spent on "inputs."  The program also threatens the relationship of students and their families to the education process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two fundamentally important ways:
Building Bureaucracies. Under Goals 2000, three new government bureaucracies were created: the National Education Goals Panel, the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National Skills Board. These bureaucracies continue the old, outdated traditions of education "command-and-control" organization that continues to keep control of schools in the hands of education "producers" rather than "consumers."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Federalizing Education.</b> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to local control, the legislation comes dangerously close to mandating a watered-down national curriculum designed in Washington. The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying national history standards met bitter criticism that the standards were diluted and politically correct. Indeed the proposed standards so clearly distorted American history that the Senate rebuffed them by a 99-1 vote on January 18, 1995.<sup>27</sup>  This episode indicates one of the inherent dangers in the Goals 2000 approach. If NESIC's members were appointed, it would have become a <i>de facto</i> national school board whose 19 members would approve or disapprove all state-developed plans to meet goals set by the Education Goals Panel. Continuing attempts to "federalize" state and local education discourages real innovation and inhibits the most important school reform initiative of the decade: the movement toward privatization and school choice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000's state and national programs will only strengthen the federal government's power to control local reform efforts, hampering efforts at grass-roots reform. Goals 2000 funding should be terminated and the money sent back to the states in the elementary and secondary education block grant to foster real reform such as school choice, vouchers, and magnet and charter schools.<sup>28</sup>

<P>
<b>School-to-Work Program: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriations: $125 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The school-to-work program, funded by the Departments of Education and Labor, was designed to "continue development of comprehensive State and Local school-to-work opportunities systems."  Federal money is to be used as seed money to bring about a more comprehensive national program. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act mandates that this program sunset by the year 2001. In its FY 1997 budget request, the Clinton Administration is asking for $200 million (an increase of $75 million over FY 1995) to expand the number of states receiving full implementation grants to 43 and fund national research, technical assistance, and evolution activities. States use grants to establish partnerships representing education, industry, and labor, and to develop new assessments and accountability procedures for their school-to-work systems. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School-to-work programs have existed in various forms for some time and are an important part of preparing our nation's youth to lead productive lives. Nevertheless, both the state and national programs should be terminated. The federal government is not implementing a new idea; it is seeking to provide national leadership in developing a "coherent strategy" to help students move into the workforce out of high school. In an era of budget constraints, it is not appropriate for the federal government to take on such a task. Seed money is not necessarily the answer to the problem of developing effective partnerships between businesses and schools, and state-level partnerships with businesses to set up apprenticeship programs to bring non-college-bound students into a technologically advanced work force do not need federal oversight or funding. It is in the interest of private industry to ensure that workers are properly trained and equipped. States should make the implementation of such programs a priority and aggressively seek funding to provide their youth with a work history that enables them to succeed in today's work force.<sup>29</sup>

<b>II. Education for the Disadvantaged
<P>
Title I: Block Grant and Transfer<br>
1995 Appropriation: $7.2 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title I (formerly Chapter 1) funding for local education agencies and schools in areas with high rates of poverty provides additional educational assistance to five million low-achieving students. More than $90 billion has been spent on compensatory education since the program was created in 1965. Despite this huge investment, there is no evidence of any positive effect.<sup>30</sup>  Mary Jean LeTendre, Director of Compensatory Education during the Bush Administration, admitted that if Chapter 1's performance were displayed on a heart monitor, "We'd either pull the plug or get out the clappers."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pre- and post-tests administered to the same groups of students through a Department of Education study show that little progress has been made among Title I students. Comparisons of similar groups of children by grade and poverty show that program participation does not reduce the test score gap for disadvantaged students. Indeed, Chapter 1 student scores declined between the third and fourth grades in all poverty groups.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Chapter 1 instruction typically is offered for 30 minutes a day, five days a week. However, it contributes only about 10 additional minutes of academic instruction to each child's day. The benefit of additional time spent in Chapter 1 instruction too often is diminished by missed class time. During 1991-1992, 70 percent of elementary classroom teachers reported that students missed some academic subject during Chapter 1 reading/language arts instruction. Of this 70 percent, 56 percent indicated that students were missing regular reading/language arts activities during their Chapter 1 reading/language arts instruction.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Another significant problem with Chapter 1 is an incentive structure that discourages reaching the very end for which the program was created. Since funds are allocated based on the number of educationally disadvantaged children in a district, as test scores rise so does the risk of losing program money. Having a large population of educationally disadvantaged children ensures funding.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guiding principle for Title I reform should be reconnecting the program to its true beneficiaries: students, not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child; if that money were available as a Title I voucher, it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs, whether public, private non-sectarian, or private religious. Aid to poor children in elementary and secondary schools should be made available to poor youngsters as a transfer payment on their behalf, or as an education voucher. This should be negotiable in any school that satisfies a state's compulsory attendance statutes, without reference to whether the school is public or private, secular or denominational (as is the case in all other industrialized democracies). The administrative responsibility should be transferred to the states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with AFDC and other forms of public assistance, Title I programs are best administered at the state level. Each state has different problems and concerns in educating its population and should be given the latitude to determine policy governing the distribution of funds to help the economically disadvantaged. Communities should be able to implement programs that respond to the needs of their children without being burdened with oversight from Washington. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following programs from the Office of  Elementary and Secondary Education's Education for the Disadvantaged should be terminated and the funds returned to the states through an elementary and secondary education block grant administered by the Department of Health and Human Services:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Capital Expenses for Private School Children. 1995 Appropriation: $41.4 million.</b><br> 
Provides assistance for local education agencies that provide "equitable services" for children enrolled in religious schools.
<p>
<li><b>Even Start. 1995 Appropriation: $102 million. </b><br>
Supports family-centered educational programs that involve parents and children.
<p>
<li><b>State Agency programs for Migrant, Neglected, and Delinquent Students. 
1995 Appropriation: $350 million. </b>
Provides services to children who have moved in the last three years and to incarcerated students. 
<p>
<li><b>State School Improvement. 1995 Appropriation: $27.5 million.</b> 
Designed to help states initiate school-based change, holding them accountable for improving the education of the disadvantaged. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following Education for the Disadvantaged programs should be terminated with no transfer of funds to the elementary and secondary education block grant: 
<p>
<li><b>Migrant High School Equivalency Program and College Assistance Migrant Program. 
1995 Appropriation: $10 million.</b> 
The High School Equivalency Program exists to help low-income migrant workers gain high school diplomas or equivalency certificates. The College Assistance Migrant Program provides stipends and tutoring to migrant students in their first year of college. These programs duplicate programs administered by Federal TRIO Student Support Services programs in the Office of Postsecondary Education, and at a much higher per student cost, and therefore should be terminated.
</ul><P>
<b>III. Impact Aid: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $27.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Impact Aid provides basic support to school districts affected by federal activities. The program was established during World War II to relieve the sudden financial pressure on school districts in which enrollment increased sharply because of an influx of relocated military personnel. Impact Aid Part A compensated school districts for educating children whose families lived on federal property. Impact Aid Part B was almost exclusively for children whose parents worked on federal property but did not live there. More than 2,400 school districts received Impact Aid funds. The Impact Aid program was reauthorized and altered in 1994, and the original categories of "A" children, "B" children, Section 3(d)(2)(B), Disaster Assistance, and Construction were replaced with other forms of assistance. Payments were continued on behalf of children living on Indian lands and children living on federal property who have parents in the armed forces. The 1994 reauthorization ended payments for the other categories of previously eligible children, including "B" children.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program has outlived its initial purpose and should be terminated. Impact Aid is based on the erroneous premise that military bases and other federal facilities are a cost borne by local communities. This is curious, since communities as a rule lobby heavily for such facilities and complain about the losses that will result if they are closed. In truth, these facilities confer substantial benefits through job creation and the infusion of what may be millions of federal dollars into the local economy. Since local governments evidently are convinced their economies gain from the presence of federal facilities, there seems to be no reason to provide them with Impact Aid as compensation for them.
<p>
<b>IV. School Improvement Programs: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.3 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education funds 18 small elementary and secondary programs, many of them designed to address certain perceived needs or as favors to Members of Congress. While many of these School Improvement programs have worthy goals, none can be shown to serve a purpose that cannot be achieved at the state level. All 18 programs should be terminated and a portion of the funds appropriated to the elementary and secondary education block grant proposed at the beginning of this section.
<p>

<b>Eisenhower Professional Development State Grants: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $251 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Eisenhower Professional Development Program provides grants to the states for professional development. This program replaces the Eisenhower Mathematics and Science State Grants, which provided inservice training in mathematics and science. The underlying philosophy of the program is that "Real reform and improvement in elementary and secondary education require a teaching force that is up-to-date in the content areas and skilled in imparting knowledge to diverse populations of students. Only intensive, ongoing professional development will ensure that educators have the knowledge and skills necessary to teach children the challenging State standards."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In its FY 1997 budget request, the Clinton Administration agrees that this program has had "minimal impact on classroom effectiveness," yet still wants to expand it to offer "professional development" in additional subjects. The Administration's request terminates funding for <i>Innovative Education Program Strategies</i> (Title VI) because, as explained the department's FY 1996 budget request, as a block grant it did little to contribute to real education reform since the money was spent primarily on such routine things as equipment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration assumes that the past failures of both of these programs can be attributed to their block grant status and the inability of states to bring about reform on their own without large-scale federal control and regulation. However, this is contradicted by current studies that attribute the programs' ineffectiveness to faulty assumptions about student performance. For example, in his exhaustive review of 113 studies that examined the relationship between teacher education levels and student performance, University of Rochester economist Eric Hanushek concluded that only eight showed a statistically significant correlation between teachers' advanced degrees and student performance.<sup>34</sup>  These programs should be terminated not only because professional development is not a federal area, but also because of the overwhelming evidence of their inherent ineffectiveness.
<p>

<b>Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $476 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under this program, the federal government gives grants to the states (1) to improve cooperation between schools and the broader community so that all available resources are brought to bear on drug and violence problems; (2) to fund a broader range of local activities, including before- and after-school "safe haven" programs; (3) to target more resources to communities with the greatest drug and violence problems; and (4) to increase accountability through a greater emphasis on collection and use of outcome data. The national programs fund federal development of model programs, evaluation of state and local safe and drug-free schools programs, cooperative activities with other federal agencies, direct grants to communities with severe drug and violence problems, and campus drug prevention grants to institutions of higher education.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is no evidence that this program has been effective in achieving its goals, as no comprehensive audit has been completed since the program was created. Such an audit would be difficult in any event because little is known about what method works best to prevent and reduce substance abuse. A recent study by the Research Triangle Institute, for example, showed that support groups and community service groups increased in number as federal funding reached the schools, but the results are unclear because it cannot be demonstrated that such groups are the best way to combat drugs and violence.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Money under this program is sent not to areas of specific need, but to 96 percent of the nation's school districts, with many the smaller districts receiving only a few hundred dollars. Moreover, districts that do receive large sums of money are not necessarily spending it wisely. A recent audit of the Fairfax County public schools in Virginia found that the county spent $176,000 of its Safe and Drug Free Schools grant to send hundreds of parents, administrators, teachers, and local business owners to a Maryland resort for meetings described as providing "the background for people to try and intelligently solve problems."<sup>36</sup>  In Montgomery County, Maryland, administering a $548,000 grant eats up more than $200,000.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While safe and drug-free schools are a laudable goal, this federal program does little to achieve that goal and duplicates similar efforts such as the Substance Abuse Block Grant, Title XX, the Preventive Health Block Grant, and programs under the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. Like education, crime and drug programs are administered best at the local level by individuals who are close to the affected community. States and communities affected by violence and drugs in their schools already are addressing these problems. Federal funding means federal strings that make it more difficult for state and local officials to do their jobs. 
<p>

<b>Inexpensive Book Distribution: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A nonprofit organization, RIF (Reading is Fundamental), has been contracted by the Department of Education to distribute free and inexpensive books to areas of particular need. The $10.3 million Inexpensive Book Distribution Program, although a worthy concept, could be funded easily at the state level or by private foundations.
<p>

<b>Education Infrastructure: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $35 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was created under the 1995 Improving America's Schools Act to assist local education agencies in repairing and rebuilding school facilities. The department recommends terminating funding for the $35 million program due to the administrative complexity caused by the specific requirements LEAs must meet in order to receive assistance.
<p>

<b>Arts in Education: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program seeks to promote competency in the arts by encouraging the integration of art into elementary and secondary curricula. Congress should terminate the Arts in Education Program, which should be funded by private organizations or the states. Most of the money under this program goes to just two organizations: the Very Special Arts Organization and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Very little actually reaches the nation's classrooms.
<P>

<b>Instruction in Civics, Government and the Law: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This $4.5 million program makes competitive awards for programs that educate the public about the legal system and its underlying philosophical principles. Many of the grantees have been receiving funds since the early 1980s for the same projects and should be able to continue without federal assistance.
<p>
<b>Christa McAuliffe Fellowships: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Scholarships provided by this program fund teacher projects to improve education. Such support is best kept at the state or local level, where the need for recognition of teaching excellence and innovation is more immediate.

<p>
<b>Magnet Schools Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $111 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Magnet Schools Assistance program makes grants to local education agencies that are under some sort of desegregation plan, either court-ordered or federally approved. Preference is given to agencies proposing a new or significantly revised program and innovative educational programs. Congress should phase out Magnet Schools Assistance. Like charter schools, magnet schools already are well underway in many districts and are funded and controlled best by local and state authorities.
<p>

<b>Education for Homeless Children and Youth: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $28.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The objective of this program is to ensure that homeless children have equal access to education, and to run professional development programs to "heighten awareness of the special problems of homeless children and youth."  In essence, this program helps to advocate within state budgeting processes for the allocation of other funds for the homeless population. While this may be a worthy goal, it is hardly a federal responsibility. And because much of this money is used to lobby for additional funds, little is spent on the education of homeless children. Direct services for educating homeless children can be provided better through the elementary and secondary education block grant.
<p>

<b>Women's Educational Equity: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since 1974, this program has sought to promote educational equity through grants to local education agencies, nonprofit organizations, and individuals and through a national publishing center. This program is very small and funds only 32 grants of $100,000 each. The program has existed for 20 years but shows little evidence of success in achieving its objectives. If states find that gender equity is a problem that needs to be addressed, studies can be funded and administered at the state or local level; this is far better than a "one-size-fits-all" solution imposed from above. The federal government has no legitimate role in such subjective matters. 
<p>

<b>Training and Advisory Services: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $21.4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Training and Advisory Service Program, which supports federal Desegregation Assistance Centers (DACS), should be terminated. Most "desegregation-related" activities in the states, such as busing, have been expensive failures.<sup>38</sup>  Public school desegregation has reached the point where the federal government no longer needs to be involved in such activities.
<P>

<b>Drop-Out Prevention Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $28 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program has funded local demonstrations of approaches to curtailing high school dropout rates. By law, funding was to end in 1994, but ESEA reauthorization provided for two more years of non-competitive funding of projects that had been supported in previous years. According to the department, the activity thus "evolved into a program of direct, noncompetitive assistance to incumbent grantees" and was no longer a demonstration program. The program no longer merits funding. 
<P>

<b>Ellender Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation): Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
According to an audit requested by Congress, significant increases in federal funding had no impact on the number of fellowships offered by the foundation; fellowships actually decreased as the federal contribution increased. Other organizations in the private sector run government education programs and are able to provide economic assistance to those who are in need. 
<P>

<b>Education for Native Hawaiians: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Native Hawaiians already are eligible to receive services from the Department of Education as long as they meet the criteria applied to all citizens. These programs duplicate those offered under Title I, as well as Special Education and other competitive grants offered by the Department. Since funding for such programs would be available to Hawaii through the elementary and secondary education block grant, separate funding is unnecessary. 
<p>

<b>Foreign Language Assistance: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $10.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Foreign Language Assistance program provides formula grants to local education agencies to encourage and improve instruction of foreign languages in areas where there is a perceived critical national interest. Currently, support is limited to instruction in Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. This program was targeted for termination in the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review because it is "poorly structured to be an appropriate vehicle for the advancement of foreign language education in the schools."  The formula grants to the states are too small to have a significant impact on foreign language instruction.
<p>
<b>Charter Schools: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $20 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Charter Schools Program provides funds to "support planning and initial implementation of charter schools created by teachers, parents, and other members of local communities."  While charter schools certainly are desirable, the states do not need this funding to create them. Congress should terminate the Charter Schools Program and turn the funds over to the elementary and secondary education block grant.

<P>
<b>Technical Assistance for Improving ESEA Programs: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $29.6 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration is proposing that funds be provided to complete the phasing in of 15 regional assistance centers to help states, local education agencies, schools, and other recipients of federal funds implement elementary and secondary education programs under ESEA. This is a consolidation of services previously supplied through 48 regional assistance centers. Since the programs these centers are supposed to help administer will be turned over to the states through block grants (Title I programs), terminated (bilingual education), or transferred (Indian education), these centers no longer will be necessary.
<p>
<b>V. Indian Education (IEA): Transfer   <br> 
1995 Appropriation: $82.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indian Education programs supplement the efforts of state and local education agencies and Indian tribes by providing additional funding to the Indian population. Local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to develop "comprehensive plans" for the education of Indian children apart from the plans they develop for other children. This program should sent to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, an agency far better equipped to deal effectively with the unique challenges facing the Native American population. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indian Education programs are similar to the Title I programs which serve all disadvantaged children. Special Programs for Indian Children include (1) a broad demonstration program for testing new approaches in such areas as early childhood education, dropout prevention, and public-private partnerships; (2) an educator professional development program to increase the number of qualified Indians involved in the education of Indians and to improve the skills of Indians already teaching; and (3) fellowships for Indians studying medicine, psychology, law, education, business administration, and natural resources. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Special Programs for Indian Adults help Indian adults acquire basic literacy, complete secondary school, and secure the education needed to enter advanced vocational programs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both of these programs duplicate many Indian education programs run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs within the Interior Department. Therefore, the entire Indian Education program, including all program funding, should be transferred to that agency.

<b>OFFICE OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND MINORITY LANGUAGE AFFAIRS
<P>
Bilingual and Immigrant Education: Phase Out Over Three Years<br>
1995 Appropriation: $206.7 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government began funding local bilingual education programs in 1967. At that time, Congress made it clear that support should not be limited to any one instructional method; as the legislative report stated, the choice of method should be "left to the discretion and judgments of the local school districts to encourage both varied approaches to the problem and also special solutions for a particular problem of a given school."  This policy was reversed in 1974 when Congress effectively mandated that schools use "transitional bilingual education" (TBE) instructional methods, by which students are taught both in English and in their native language. In 1987, Congress loosened this restriction and allowed local governments to spend 25 percent of their bilingual education funds on "alternative" teaching methods, with 75 percent still required for TBE instruction. The federal programs assist local school districts in "building their capacity to operate high-quality instructional programs for recently-arrived immigrants and other Limited English Proficient (LEP) students."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Against the advice of local officials and many scholars, Washington continues to tie the hands of local school districts by requiring them to spend three-quarters of all their federal bilingual education funds on transitional bilingual education programs. Although federal funding is only about 3 percent of the total spent on bilingual education, the fact that the federal government favors transitional bilingual education over "alternative" teaching methods creates the impression that transitional education is the best way to teach recent immigrants and other Limited English Proficient students.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the federal preference for transitional bilingual education, numerous studies have shown that TBE programs are less effective than intensive English programs. A recent study by the Board of Education of the City of New York showed that 80 percent of students enrolled in special English programs were put in mainstream classes within 2-3 years, compared with only 51 percent of students in bilingual programs. Similar results were found in a READ Institute study of the schools in El Paso, Texas. Students in an English-based program in El Paso enter regular classrooms in 3 or 4 years, whereas bilingual students take 6 to 7 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education itself has concluded that TBE programs, which involve heavy reliance on the pupil's native language, can delay English proficiency for as many as six years after instruction begins.<sup>39</sup>  This is disturbing, given that the primary purpose of these programs is to assist Limited English Proficient students to join the American mainstream as quickly as possible. Yet the bilingual education establishment continues to push TBE, which has proved to be both a source of jobs and a pipeline to the federal Treasury.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although there remains intense debate over which bilingual teaching methods are most effective, a consensus is emerging that local school districts are best able to tailor their programs to meet the needs of their foreign students most effectively. Notes Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers: "The fact is that there is no proven method of bilingual education that guarantees English fluency. And I don't think that Uncle Sam, or anybody else ought to be shoving a particular message down anybody's throat."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As this $261 million program is phased out, local school districts should be permitted to use the money to develop the programs they deem most appropriate and effective in teaching English as a second language. This would restore the program to its original mandate of providing short-term federal funding to develop "special solutions" for Limited English Proficient students.<sup>40</sup>
<p>

<b>OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES (OSERS)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.8 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government has an interest both in ensuring that those who are disabled have access to quality education and in helping the states to achieve that goal. Therefore, the following programs would remain intact and be housed in HHS:
<ul><p>
<li> Special Education,
<li> Rehabilitative Services and Disability Research,
<li> American Printing House for the Blind,
<li> National Technical Institute for the Deaf, and

<li> Gallaudet University.
</ul><p>

<b>OFFICE OF VOCATIONAL AND ADULT EDUCATION<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Vocational Education program funds are used by states to support family literacy, vocational education, and job training, and to help adults complete a secondary education. Grants are allocated to the states according to a formula under which each state receives $250,000, with the remaining funds distributed in proportion to the number of persons age 16 years or older who have not completed a high school education. Basic grants integrate academic and vocational education and are allotted to states according to a formula based on state income, with an adjustment based on state per capita income. Currently, over $1.4 billion is spent on vocational and adult education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 17 vocational and adult education programs duplicate 154 employment training programs administered by 14 different federal agencies. In an effort to ameliorate this situation, the Clinton Administration rescinded 1995 funding for the Community-Based Organizations and Consumer and Homemaking Education Programs. Under the Clinton Administration's FY 1997 budget proposal, programs administered by the Office of Vocational and Adult Education would be combined and broken down into two sets of programs: state grants and national programs. There would be separate state grant and national programs for vocational and adult education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following programs would be consolidated under the Clinton-proposed state grants for vocational education:<p><ul>
<li> Tech-Prep Education ($108 million);
<li> Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Vocational Institutions ($2.9 million);
<li> State Councils ($8.8 million); and
<li> Permanent Appropriation (Smith-Hughes Act) ($7.1 million).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
State Literacy Resource Centers, Workplace Literacy Partnerships, Literacy Training for Homeless Adults, and Literacy Programs for Prisoners are Adult Education programs that fund relatively few programs in only a handful of states. All these activities are best handled by state and local governments, which are closest to those who are being served. These programs would be merged into adult education state grants in the Clinton Administration's FY 1997 budget request. The Administration correctly argues that a single state grant "would permit states to establish their own program objectives based on their own unique needs, and would give states the flexibility to use federal funds for a range of activities... aimed at achieving those objectives." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The research, technical assistance, and data collecting functions for adult and vocational education would comprise the national programs under the Clinton budget request.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Combining these programs into state and national programs makes sense, but not at the same level of funding. Funding for vocational education and adult education should be cut by 50 percent. Vocational education funds should be combined with the elementary and secondary education block grant and adult education funds with the higher education block grant, described below in the section on the Office of Post Secondary Education. Sufficient funds should be appropriated for research, data systems, and grant management at the federal level. The national program should be housed in the Department of Health and Human Services.

<p>
<b>OFFICE OF POST SECONDARY EDUCATION<br>
1995 Appropriation: $13.4 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Programs currently administered by the Office of Post Secondary Education should be transferred to the Office of Education at the Department of Health and Human Services. Programs under Student Financial Assistance should be transferred to HHS, along with certain reforms, cuts, and terminations. Higher education categorical programs should be consolidated into a higher education block grant to be administered by HHS.
<p>
<b>I. Student Financial Assistance  <br>  
1995 Appropriation: $7.6 billion</b>
<p>
<b>Pell Grants: Transfer to HHS<br>
1995 Appropriation: $6.2 billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Pell Grant program provides grant aid to low and middle-income undergraduate students. Unlike most other federal scholarship programs, it is the department's most "need-focused" student aid program. This proposal terminates most other merit-based scholarship programs in order to focus resources on need-based grant programs such as this one. Pell Grants should be sent to HHS along with other student financial assistance programs.
<p>
<b>Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants: Block Grant<br>
1995 Appropriation: $583 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The SEOG program, like the Pell Grant program, provides assistance to undergraduate students with financial need. Funds are allocated to institutions, however, based on statutory formula, and institutions match 25 percent. Students with exceptional need and Pell Grant recipients are given priority by the awarding institutions. This need-based program should be terminated and its funds included in the higher education block grant, enabling states to award money to institutions as they see fit.
<p>
<b>State Student Incentive Grants: Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $63.4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The SSIG program provides dollar-for-dollar matching funds as an incentive to the states to set up need-based postsecondary student grant assistance. Since 1972, all 50 states have set up their own undergraduate need-based programs. The original objective of this program therefore has been met, and federal funding is no longer necessary.  (Elimination of this program also was recommended by the Administration's own National Performance Review.)
<p>
<b>Federal Perkins Loans<br> 
1995 Appropriation: $176 million and
<p>
Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.1 Billion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Students receive federal student loans primarily through three programs: Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Family Education Loans (FFEL), and Federal Direct Loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Approximately 2,700 participating institutions currently administer Perkins Loans. Borrowers are charged 5 percent interest during principal repayment and no interest during in-school, grace, and deferment periods. The annual maximum amounts a student can borrow under the program are $3,000 for undergraduates and $5,000 for graduate and professional students. The cumulative maximum is $30,000 for combined undergraduate and graduate or professional study. The federal government currently pays $18 million annually to cancel loan obligations of borrowers who go into "public service employment," such as law enforcement, nursing, or teaching in Head Start programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the FFEL program, a student borrows money at a capped rate from private lending institutions. Banks making FFEL student loans have the loans insured by state and private nonprofit institutions, known as "guarantee agencies."  The federal government, however, reinsures these loans and is ultimately liable for up to 98 percent of defaulted loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The FFEL program offers four types of loans:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
1) Stafford Loans are subsidized, low-interest loans based on financial need. The federal government pays the interest while the student is in school and during certain grace and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
2) Unsubsidized Stafford Loans also are low-interest student loans. However, under this program, the federal government does not pay interest for the student during in-school, grace, and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
3) PLUS Loans are available to parents of dependent undergraduate students. The maximum interest rate for PLUS loans is higher than for Stafford or Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and the federal government does not pay interest for the student during in-school, grace, and deferment periods.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
4) Consolidation Loans allow borrowers with multiple student loans who meet certain criteria to combine their obligations and extend their repayment schedules. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All FFEL loans, except Consolidation Loans, have variable interest rates. The rate is capped at 8.25 percent for Stafford and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and 9.00 percent for PLUS Loans. Today, these variable rates are tied to the 91-day Treasury bill rate; beginning July 1, 1998, rates will be tied to the government borrowing rate (currently the 10-year Treasury bill rate).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These loan programs should be removed from the jurisdiction of the Department of Education and operated by the Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the following reforms should be instituted, both to reduce the cost of these programs and to cut defaults:  
<p>
<b>Reform #1: Eliminate the Perkins Loan Program.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Perkins Loan program is relatively small and exists largely to supplement the larger FFEL and Direct Loan programs. It easily could be eliminated or merged into these larger programs, reducing overhead and duplication. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Perkins Loan program also authorizes borrowers to have all or a portion of their loans canceled in exchange for service as a teacher, staff member in a Head Start program, volunteer in the Peace Corps or VISTA, law enforcement or corrections officer, nurse or medical technician, or family service agency employee. Yet there is no shortage of individuals interested in serving in these careers, some of which pay salaries and offer many rewards. There is no need to continue to forgive these loans for all individuals.
<p>
<b>Reform #2: Eliminate in-school interest subsidies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Students should be required to accrue interest on loans while attending school, with no payment of this accrued interest until after they leave school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Federal student loans are virtually an entitlement for college- or trade school-bound students, with most funds aiding students from middle-income families. The Department of Education estimates that about 30 percent of all college students are receiving subsidized federal loans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Attempts over the past decade to scale back the eligibility for student loans have failed because of strong middle-class support for the program. But the program actually subsidizes members of the middle class with one hand while taking taxes from them with the other. Recipients of the loans, moreover, gain considerably at the expense of Americans who did not go to college. College graduates can expect average lifetime earnings about $600,000 higher than those of non-graduates, and many students who do not need loans borrow up to the hilt to obtain money for non-education purchases at below-market rates. The result: Those who do not graduate end up subsidizing those who do by giving them a passport to higher earnings. Taxpayer subsidies to college students at the very least should expire when they join the work force. Borrowers who have completed or quit college should pay lenders market interest rates on their student loans without further assistance from the government.
<p>
<b>Reform #3: Link loan eligibility to continuous academic achievement.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Student loan eligibility should depend on continuously satisfactory academic progress toward degree completion, with all students required to have a high school diploma before becoming eligible for a loan. Enforcement efforts should be increased to verify that students receiving federal assistance are still in school and working toward a degree, and objective standards, such as the student's retaining at least a C average for the entire academic program, should be introduced.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Taxpayers should not be financing the college education of students who are failing their courses. A publicly funded loan is an honor and privilege, not an entitlement, and students receiving federal loans must be given incentives to study hard and graduate. Students today can obtain loans even without graduating from high school, which merely adds to the probability of default. Moreover, they need only maintain a C average by the end of their second year of study.
<p>
<b>Reform #4: Include home equity in the determination of eligibility and modify the simplified needs test.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Higher Education Act of 1992 eliminated house and farm assets from consideration in determining a family's ability to pay for post-secondary education, thereby making it easier for many students to obtain Stafford loans. The Act specifies formulas by which to calculate a family's need for Stafford loans. The amount the family is expected to contribute is determined by what is essentially a progressive tax formula. In effect, need analysis "taxes" family incomes and assets above amounts assumed to be required for a basic standard of living. The definition of assets excludes house and farm equity for all families, and all assets for applicants with incomes below $50,000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
House and farm equity should be included in the calculation of assets to determine a family's need for financial aid for post-secondary education. In addition, the threshold below which most families are not asked to report their assets should be lowered to its previous level of $15,000. Families whose houses appreciated during the 1980s are financially better off than they would have been if they had not owned a house then. Moreover, not counting this equity gives families who own a house an advantage over those who do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under current law, the needs test is used to determine which students enjoy subsidized interest. Revising the needs test would target subsidies more precisely to those who need them.
<p>
<b>Reform #5: Require lenders to share the risk of guaranteed student loan defaults.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This could be accomplished by reducing the standard federal re-insurance from 98 to 90 percent, except for loans designated lender-of-last-resort, which would continue to receive 100 percent insurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), conducted by the Education Department's Planning and Evaluation Service,<sup>41</sup> found that:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Defaulters were four times more likely than non-defaulters to begin their postsecondary education without a high school diploma. Of this group of defaulters, approximately 40 percent had not received a general educational development (GED) certificate.
<p>
<li>Defaulters were more than twice as likely as non-defaulters to have dropped out of their postsecondary program.
<p>
<li>Defaulters were more than twice as likely to be unemployed or underemployed (earning less than $10,000) than non-defaulters at the time repayment was scheduled to begin.
<p>
<li>Defaulters had fewer and smaller loans, which indicates that they attended postsecondary institutions for shorter periods or went to relatively inexpensive institutions. This statistic may be explained in part by the fact that a significantly larger percentage of defaulters attended trade or vocational schools with programs lasting two years or less. On average, 72 percent of private vocational/trade school students receive federal aid as compared to 40 percent of students attending public undergraduate institutions.<sup>42</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If lenders were required to bear part of the costs of loan defaults, they would be more cautious in making loans for institutions with high student default rates. The federal government should cover only 80 percent on defaulted loans. This reform would give lending institutions an incentive to take greater care in scrutinizing institutions and collecting loans.
<p>
<b>Reform #6: Increase the default risk shouldered by loan guaranty agencies.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This could be accomplished by changing the current guaranteed loan program's guaranty agency reinsurance on defaulted loans from 98/88/78 percent, depending on the annual level of defaults, to 95/85/75 percent, except for loans designated lender-of-last-resort, which would continue to receive 100 percent reinsurance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 45 guaranty agencies, which include USA Funds, California Student Assistance Commission, and America Student Assistance, have been too quick to turn defaulted loans over to the Department of Education and the taxpayers. If guaranty agencies were required to bear part of the costs of loan defaults, they would be more diligent in their collection efforts before turning responsibility for a defaulted loan over to the federal government.
<p>

<b>Work-Study: Terminate</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Work-Study program provides grants to participating institutions to pay up to 75 percent of the salaries of needy undergraduate or graduate students working part-time, typically in on-campus jobs. The remaining 25 percent of student earnings is provided by the school or other employer. Funds are allocated to institutions according to a statutory formula, and individual grant amounts are determined at the discretion of institutional financial aid administrators. To the extent feasible, participating institutions are required to place Work-Study students in employment situations that complement their academic studies. They also are required by statute to use at least five percent of their Work-Study allocations to support students working in community service activities. The federal government currently spends $617 million annually on Work-Study.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In most cases, CWS students are employed by colleges -- for example, in food service, administrative offices, and libraries, or as teacher's aides. Thus, the federal government is subsidizing the employment expenditures of these institutions. Expecting taxpayers to defray the labor costs of well-endowed institutions like Harvard University, which receives over $2.9 million in federal work-study grants, reveals just how poorly conceived a program CWS really is. 
<P>

<b>Federal Direct Student Loan Account: Terminate</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Direct Student Loan program, recently renamed the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, was authorized by Congress in 1992 as a "pilot" program. It was expanded by Congress in 1993, however, from a pilot program to a "transition" program. Now the Administration plans to replace the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, formerly known as the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program, with the Direct Student Loan program. Under the Direct Loan program, unlike the FFEL program, the federal Treasury borrows money and then lends it directly to schools, which in turn lend it to the students. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary impetus for implementing it is cost: Replacing the current system with direct lending is supposed to lead to billions of dollars in savings. All current indications, however, are that it will not produce such savings.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Direct Lending centralizes control of post-secondary education lending in the Department of Education and creates the potential for huge, unconstrained overhead costs. Despite talk of reducing bureaucracy by switching to Direct Lending, the Department of Education is hiring over 500 new employees to administer these programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when phase-in is completed. The federal government is funding the rapid expansion of this controversial program through an unencumbered $2.5 billion authorization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not only does the Direct Student Loan program add to a growing bureaucracy, but it also adds to the national debt. Instead of allowing capital for student loans to be provided by private sources, the federal government now must borrow money to fund those loans. Several noted economists have warned that the Direct Lending program will add billions to the federal debt without saving a dollar. For example, Dr. Rudolph G. Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, cautioned federal lawmakers that they "may be on the verge of making a serious public policy mistake" when Congress was debating the program. Penner predicts in an economic analysis that direct lending may add $70 million to the federal debt by 1998, with financing costs that could erase any theoretical budget savings.<sup>44</sup>  Penner's concerns are supported by two other recently issued reports, one conducted by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and another by economist Dr. Perry Quick of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.<sup>45</sup>  All three studies conclude that any alleged savings associated with one direct lending program are highly unlikely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Estimates of the costs of the Direct Lending program change constantly. In 1993 when it was enacted, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the program could save $4.3 billion over five years.<sup>46</sup>  The most recent CBO report, however, takes into account the Credit Reform Act as amended by the 1996 Budget Resolution. The amended Credit Reform Act includes long-term administrative costs, and the CBO now projects that the program will save a mere $115 million over the next seven years. Eliminating the program entirely would save $1.5 billion in outlays over the next seven years.<sup>47</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, government-run loan programs historically have had higher default rates than programs run by the private sector. A government-run monopoly like direct loans is unlikely to improve on the quality of service in the FFEL program. More important, the Direct Loan program is not subject to provisions terminating the eligibility of schools with high default rates -- which understandably are very enthusiastic about the prospect of direct loans.<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the Direct Lending Program fails to provide the savings it promises, it should be eliminated. Our student lending policies are not perfect, but nationalizing the program is not the answer.
<p>
<b>II. Higher Education Programs
<p>
Federal TRIO Programs<br>
1995 Appropriation: $463 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
TRIO programs provide a variety of outreach and support services to encourage low-income, potential first-generation college students to enter and complete college. These support programs target federal grant recipients and other disadvantaged students, working in tandem with federal grant programs focused on eliminating financial barriers to post-secondary education. Funds from this program should be included in the higher education block grant and sent back to the states in the same manner as Title I funds for elementary and secondary education.
<p>
<b>Aid for Institutional Development (Title III): Terminate<br>
1995 Appropriation: $230 million</b>
]<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, there are seven separate programs that support the operations and endowments of a few institutions of higher education. The Clinton Administration is requesting the same funding ($143 million) in FY 1997 for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, along with a $40 million decrease in Aid for Institutional Development Part A (Strengthening Institutions) as part of a two-year phaseout. The Administration also proposes to eliminate the Endowment Challenge Grant general "endowments" program while preserving the HBCU set-aside portion of the program. The Administration argues that the federal government can support the general improvement of institutions more efficiently by increasing the investment in student aid; tuition revenues from a student receiving financial aid may be used for "developmental" purposes, as well as for endowment-building activities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is unfair to the large majority of both public and private post-secondary institutions for the federal government to single out a few institutions for substantial amounts of federal aid. Many of the schools receiving this aid are financially secure and do not need special treatment. 
<p>
<b>III. Other Post-Secondary Education Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to Aid for Institutional Development, the Department of Education funds over 29 small post-secondary programs that address a range of issues and activities. Most have achieved their original purposes, either largely or completely, or could be supported more efficiently by other funding sources. In its budget request for FY 1997, the Clinton Administration recognizes the need to eliminate many of these programs because they duplicate other programs, have achieved their purposes, or are supported more appropriately with non-federal funds. However, all of the following small post-secondary programs should be eliminated:
<p>

<b>Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $17.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Funds from this program support projects with competitive grants that "enhance postsecondary education quality and cost effectiveness," according to the department. Current funding covers about 200 new and existing awards. The pursuit of education quality and cost-effectiveness should be the goal of all institutions of higher learning seeking to attract students; the federal government does not need to provide such an incentive. This program also supports exchange programs with European Community and NAFTA countries, activities that are available at the institutional level without federal funding. FIPSE should be terminated, with a portion of its funding transferred to the higher education block grant.
<P>
<b>Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development<br>
1995 Appropriation: $500,000</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides support for the preservation of Native Hawaiian and Alaskan Native Art. Such funding is provided more appropriately by state and tribal governments. Moreover, funds are available for this purpose from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<P>
<b>Eisenhower Leadership Program<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides grants to institutions of higher learning and nonprofit organizations to develop leadership skills in students. The department, following National Performance Review recommendations, is requesting no additional funds for this program in FY 1997. Activities promoted by these grants already are included in the curricula of post-secondary institutions' education programs. There is no need for federal involvement.
<p>
<b>Minority Teacher Recruitment <br>
1995 Appropriation: $2.5 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program administers two types of grants: partnership grants to institutions of higher learning to recruit and train minority teachers, and teacher placement grants to help state departments of education develop programs to help train minority students to become teachers. While minority teacher recruitment reflects a valid and current need, this program is too small to have an impact on a national scale. Only 13 small awards were given in 1995. Research should be done at the state level to determine what programs would best serve this interest, as there is little evidence thus far that giving money to these programs brings minority individuals into the profession who would not already have been there. 
<p>
<b>Minority Science Improvement <br>
1995 Appropriation: $5.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program grants money to institutions that primarily serve minority communities to encourage advanced study in science. Funds for advanced study are available through student financial assistance; money does not need to go directly to institutions for such purposes. This program should be terminated, with a portion of its funds transferred to the higher education block grant. States are better able to determine for themselves how best to encourage high-quality engineering and science studies at the institutional level.
<p>
<b>Innovative Projects for Community Service<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1.4 million </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides grants to nonprofit organizations and higher education institutions to encourage students to participate in community service. While this is a commendable goal, it is neither education-related nor a federal responsibility. In addition, it is too small to have an impact at the national level. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>International Education and Foreign Language Studies<br>
1995 Appropriation: $58.1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
IEFLS funds graduate and undergraduate foreign language and area studies programs. This program should be terminated with a portion of funds put into the higher education block grant. States would be encouraged to use a portion of this grant to fund language activities.
<P>
<b>Institute for International Public Policy<br>
1995 Appropriation: $1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Funds from this program support the Institute for International Public Policy of the United Negro College Fund, designed to increase minority representation in the Foreign Service. This program is a direct grant to an institution performing a function outside the federal role in education.
<p>
<b>Cooperative Education<br>
1995 Appropriation: $6.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program funds the demonstration of cooperative education, but over 700 post-secondary institutions currently operate programs combining work experience with academic study without federal support. Federal support is no longer needed. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Law School Clinical Experience<br>
1995 Appropriation: $14.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was designed to provide clinical experience to law students that is best provided by non-federal sources such as law schools themselves. In addition, schools already have the incentive to provide clinical experience to attract students since its inclusion in the curriculum is so highly regarded. As recommended by the National Performance Review and the department's FY 1997 proposed budget, this program should be eliminated.
<p>
<b>Urban Community Service<br>
1995 Appropriation: $13.0 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program funds higher education institutions that serve as a resource for urban areas attempting to solve urban social and economic problems. These issues are addressed more appropriately by other federal agencies, however. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center<br>
1995 Appropriation: $4 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over $10.2 million in non-competitive federal construction grants has been provided to Bethune-Cookman College to construct this fine arts center. Any additional financing that might be required is available through private sources. This program is therefore unnecessary. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>Academic Facilities<br>
1995 Appropriation: $24.2 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program gives aid to institutions of higher learning for construction, reconstruction, or renovation of academic facilities. These institutions, however, should be responsible for funding their own projects. Providing such funds is not a federal responsibility, and this program should be phased out as soon as previously awarded grant and loan obligations are met. A portion of these funds should be sent back to the states in the higher education block grant.
<p>
<b>Historically Black College and University Capital Financing Program<br>
1995 Appropriation: $300,000</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HBCU Capital Financing Program provides federal guarantees for private sector bond financing for the repair and construction of facilities at HBCUs. As with Aid for Institutional Development, providing such assistance to a select group of higher learning institutions is not a federal responsibility. Financing of this sort can and should be secured without federal assistance.
<p>
<b>National Early Intervention Scholarships and Partnerships<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.1 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was designed to "forge new Federal-State partnerships" aimed at encouraging disadvantaged youth to pursue higher education. The FY 1997 department budget proposes that this program be cut, since the current budget situation precludes adequate funding. While a worthy endeavor, reaching out to disadvantaged youth is best done at the local level. In addition, Pell Grants and other loan programs already encourage this.
<p>
<b>IV. Higher Education Scholarship Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department of Education maintains several merit-based scholarships that do not focus on providing access to higher education for those who are economically disadvantaged. Most are small, categorical programs that are difficult to maintain and have high overhead costs. In addition, over $30 billion is already available to those who need money for higher education. Therefore, each of the following scholarship programs should be terminated:
<p><ul>
<li>National Science Scholarships ($4.4 million);
<li>National Academy of Science, Space and Technology ($2.0 million);
<li>Douglas Teacher Scholarships ($14.6 million);
<li>Olympic Scholarships ($1.0 million);
<li>Teacher Corps ($1.9 million);
<li>Women and Minority Participation in Graduate Education ($5.8 million);
<li>Harris Fellowships ($20.2 million);
<li>Javits Fellowships ($7.8 million);
<li>Byrd Honors Scholarships ($29.1 million);
<li>Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need ($27.3 million); and
<li>Faculty Development Fellowships ($3.7 million).
</ul><p>

<b>School, College, and University Partnerships<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3.9 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program was created to forge partnerships to foster student readiness for the workforce. It is a relatively small program that duplicates functions of other federal and state-funded job training programs. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.

<p>
<b>Legal Training for the Disadvantaged (CLEO)<br>
1995 Appropriation: $3 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This program provides disadvantaged individuals with a basic understanding of our legal system. Non-federal sources now account for 40 percent of this program's total funding; the department believes this would continue even if federal funding was withdrawn, in addition to which aid would continue to be available through student financial assistance programs. The department's FY 1997 budget proposal also terminates this program.
<p>
<b>V. Howard University: Phase out funding<br>
1995 Appropriation: $204.7 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Howard University is a federally chartered black college in Washington, D.C. Despite its federal charter, Howard is a private institution with over 13,500 students. The university's programs are tailored to enhance the opportunities of minorities in professional fields. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1995 Congress appropriated $206 million for Howard University -- over $15,000 per enrolled student. This appropriation was approximately $13 million above both the 1994 funding level and the Clinton Administration's request. Direct appropriations for Howard were first authorized in 1867. In 1988, Congress and the Department of Education directed Howard University to develop a plan for financial self-sufficiency; ten years later, that plan still has not been developed fully, and Howard remains one of the most highly subsidized private universities in the nation. Academic subsidies cover roughly two-thirds of the cost of educating Howard's students, enabling the school to charge less than the average for state-supported public institutions. These students receive still more subsidies through federal student aid programs. Moreover, 20 percent of its student population is made up of foreign students who enjoy a federal subsidy equal to that of their American counterparts, yet come from families who generally have not paid taxes to finance the school.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to raising tuition for foreign students, another way for Howard to move toward fiscal independence would be to build up its endowment. The Howard University endowment has increased annually, due both to federal contributions and to private contributions from friends and alumni. The university should increase its efforts to solicit contributions from alumni and friends, as other institutions do. A five-year phaseout would give Howard the time and the incentive to build up its resources and endowment, as it promised Congress it would do ten years ago. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The following reforms and phaseouts should take place over the next five years:
<p>
Phase out subsidies for:
<p><ul>
<li>Academic Programs (1995 Appropriation: $158 million);
<li>Endowment Program (1995 Appropriation: $3.5 million); and
<li>Research (1995 Appropriation: $4.6 million).
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Require Howard University to raise tuition for foreign students by at least 50 percent to offset the current federal subsidy toward their education.
<p>

<b>OFFICE OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT<br>
1995 Appropriation: $324 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) is tasked with providing national leadership in the areas of educational research and statistics. Its stated mission is to promote excellence and equity in American education by:
<p><ul>
<li>  Conducting research and demonstration projects funded through grants to help improve education;

<li> Collecting statistics on the status and progress of schools and education throughout the nation; and

<li> Distributing information and providing technical assistance to those working to improve education. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, OERI has grown into a bloated bureaucracy with many programs that easily could be turned over to the private sector or eliminated altogether.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OERI was re-authorized under the Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994. The Clinton Administration's 1997 funding request would support the research and development programs of five new National Research Institutes, the National Education Dissemination System, the statistics and assessments activities of the National Center for Education Statistics, and the creation of a National Library of Education. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1994 Act authorized the Assistant Secretary for OERI to support activities to increase the participation of minority researchers and institutions. The law authorized funds for the operation of regional educational laboratories to provide technical assistance, promote education reform, and assist rural education. OERI also operates more than 15 categorical programs with budgets ranging from $800,000 to $83.2 million. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OERI's budget should be cut in half, and the agency's statistical, research, and assessment functions should be consolidated in the Census Bureau. Library and technology programs should be cut and sent back to the states as part of the elementary/secondary education and higher education block grants. 
<p>
<b>I. Statistics, Research, and Assessment<br>
1995 Appropriation: $32.8 million</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The statistical functions of OERI, which build knowledge about education, should continue to collect data on education reform and progress. But the Census Bureau performs similar functions in a far less politically charged environment. OERI's essential functions have become increasingly partisan and bureaucratic in recent years. In 1994, H.R. 6 (the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994) alone created several new bureaucracies which operate under OERI, including five new National Research Institutes, a new National Education Dissemination System, and a new National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board. While the federal government should collect and disseminate information, it should not be in the business of setting reform priorities for state and local education agencies. The research, statistics, and assessment functions therefore should be consolidated in the Bureau of the Census.
<p>
<b>II. Improvement Programs</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the small programs operating within OERI were recommended for elimination by the Clinton Administration in its National Performance Review. These functions either can be performed by the private sector, are new programs that are unnecessary or redundant, have outlived their original goals and purposes, or were created to benefit a special interest group. In addition, these small programs either do not need separate funding or receive substantial funding from non-federal sources. They should be eliminated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has recommended eliminating the following small programs in its FY 1997 request: 
<p><ul>
<li> 21st Century Community Learning Centers ($750,000), coordinated services projects that provide elementary and secondary school students and their families better access to social, health, and education services.

<li> National Writing Project ($3.2 million), a grant to the National Writing Project, a nonprofit educational organization that offers training programs in the effective teaching of writing. This program has received federal funds for many years and has been amply demonstrated as a strategy for improving the teaching of writing

<li> National Diffusion Network ($11.7 million), a general school improvement program that disseminates activities about programs that work well. 
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Several other programs not recommended for termination in the department's budget request, including the Star Schools Program ($25 million) and International Education Exchange ($3 million), can and should be handed over to the states or the private sector. For example, the Star Schools program was enacted in October 1988 to equip small primary and secondary schools in remote areas across the country with classroom instructions via live satellite transmissions. This service is being provided by state institutions and by commercial industry. Private industry also provides help, through donations of computers and laboratory equipment as well as cash assistance, to the very types of disadvantaged schools that the Star Schools program is designed to help. Exxon Corporation, IBM, and General Electric alone have spent millions of dollars on pre-college education to improve student training in computers, mathematics, and the sciences. These private initiatives are far more promising than a federal program.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Ready to Learn Television grant ($7 million) goes to Public Broadcasting specifically for the Children's Television Network, the makers of Sesame Street. This program existed without federal funding until 1995.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Fund for the Improvement of Education ($37 million) supports school recognition activities and various research projects. The information gained from research projects funded by this program is intended to benefit all states and aid the cause of reform. School recognition is best administered at the state or local level. With the elementary and secondary education block grant, a state can institute its own recognition activities. The research dissemination activities of this program will be handled by the research, statistics, and assessment offices sent to the Census Bureau.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These remaining programs can be cut because their purposes can be accomplished perfectly well within research and assessment programs: 
<P><ul>
<li>Eisenhower Regional Mathematics and Science Education Consortia ($15 million), which supports grants to operate regional organizations that put together math and science instructional materials and train teachers and administrators in teaching methods and assessment;

<li>Eisenhower Professional Development National Activities ($21.4 million), which funds national activities for teacher skill development in core subject areas; and

<li> Javits Gifted and Talented Education program ($9.5 million), which funds demonstration activities intended to improve the ability of elementary and secondary schools to meet the educational needs of the gifted.
</ul><p>
<b>III. Libraries</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The administration's FY 1997 budget request eliminates all categorical library programs and proposes instead that legislation be enacted to authorize a program of public library assistance state grants. Public libraries, however, should be free of federal involvement and funded at the local level or privately. These programs therefore should be eliminated:
<p><ul>
<li>Public Library Services ($83.2 million);
<li>Public Library Construction ($17.4 million);
<li>Interlibrary cooperation ($18 million);
<li>Library literacy programs ($8 million);
<li>Library Education and Training ($4.9 million), which can be financed through student financial aid; and
<li>Library Research and Demonstrations ($6.5 million). Other funds are available to fund demonstrations and disseminate findings through the Research division of OERI transferred to Census.
</ul><P>
<b>IV. Educational Technology</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Department has requested $357 million for educational technology for FY 1997. This is part of a new initiative designed to "leverage substantial new investments in computer equipment, the development of educational software, and the training of teachers in the use of educational technology."  States have demonstrated, however, that they do not need federal involvement to give their students "technology rich" learning environments. Companies such as Microsoft and Apple have forged state partnerships to accomplish this. The money should be given to the states through the elementary and secondary education block grant.

<p>
<b>DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT</b>
<p>
<b>Eliminate all funding for Departmental Management while abolishing the Department of Education.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over $865 million of the Department of Education's $31 billion FY 1995 budget was dedicated to Discretionary Salaries and Expenses ($520 million) and permanent costs ($345 million). Permanent costs include Direct Loan Servicing and Other Costs, Guaranty Agencies and Other Transition Costs, and Federal Payroll Costs: Direct Loans and Transition. The $520 million authorized for salaries and expenses pays the costs of the staff, overhead, contracts, and other activities needed to monitor and administer the over 240 programs operating within the department, including the Office of the Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights. The Clinton Administration has requested about the same level of funding for FY 1997, $506 million in discretionary authority and $355 in permanent budget authority. The increase in mandatory budget authority is due mainly to the costs of administering the Direct Student Loan program. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
With the abolition of the Department of Education, HHS will take over administration costs of programs housed in that agency.

<p>
<b>Office for Civil Rights</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary staff functions of this office are to investigate discrimination complaints, conduct compliance reviews, monitor corrective action plans, and provide technical assistance. It mainly handles disability and equity issues. The functions of this office should be moved to the Department of Justice, which already handles many education-related issues. Civil rights enforcement is more efficient and effective when consolidated in one central office, separate from the potentially conflicting agendas of separate agencies.

<h3>AGRICULTURE REFORM: CAN HOUSE SUCCEED WHERE SENATE FAILED?</h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The House of Representatives this week will consider 
H.R. 2854, the Agriculture Market Transition Act, to reform the nation's farm programs. This bill is 
companion legislation to the Senate-passed farm bill, S. 1541, the Agricultural Reform and 
Improvement Act of 1996, which falls far short of significant reform. S. 1541 also includes many 
costly nutrition, rural development, and environmental provisions that were added to get it passed 
in the Senate. Lawmakers in the House now have the opportunity to rectify the deficiencies of the 
Senate bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Both S. 1541 and H.R. 2854 replace traditional subsidies 
for the four major crops -- wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice -- with a system of fixed, declining 
payments through the year 2002. They also would eliminate acreage reduction programs. These 
reforms would give producers the needed flexibility to make planting decisions based on the 
demands of consumers rather than on supply controls from Washington, which have idled millions 
of acres of productive U.S. farmland and undermined U.S. agricultural competitiveness in world 
markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; However, both bills also retain the marketing loan 
provisions for the four major crops, in addition to soybeans. Marketing loans allow producers to 
repay to the government only what they receive for their crops, even if it is less than the amount of 
the loan, and pocket the difference. Retaining these marketing loans means that cotton and rice 
producers, in particular, would be able to circumvent the payment limitation. Leaving this 
mechanism in place runs the risk that future loan rates might exceed the market-clearing level, 
causing the United States either to lose export markets or to force the taxpayer to finance wasteful 
government-stimulated overproduction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Furthermore, neither the Senate-passed bill nor the bill 
pending in the House reforms the $1.5 billion-a-year Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); 
instead, both merely cap it at the current 36.4 million acres. Only about 7 million of the acres in the 
CRP are highly erodible, while the majority -- or close to 20 million acres -- constitute some of the 
most productive land in the United States. The remaining acres are quite capable of sustainable 
production if used in conjunction with appropriate conservation practices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Senate bill also retains permanent law. This means 
that, if no further legislative action is taken before 2002, farm programs would revert to the 1938 
and 1949 Acts, leading to the return of traditional subsidy and supply control policies. As reported 
out of the House Agriculture Committee, H.R. 2854 repeals permanent law. If the Senate provision 
prevails over the House version, supporters of a centrally planned agriculture in the future could 
point to any slight downturn in commodity prices or land values as justification for returning to 
government controls. The only way to prevent a return to these failed policies is to repeal 
permanent law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Unfortunately, both S. 1541 and H.R. 2854 reauthorize 
the sugar and peanut programs for seven years, with only inconsequential reforms. Although both 
bills do terminate marketing allotments for sugar and implement a one cent-per-pound penalty on 
forfeited sugar, they also freeze the support price at a level roughly twice the world market price 
rather than legislate any real reduction or phase-down. In the case of peanuts, for instance, both 
bills reduce the quota support rate from $678 a ton to $610 a ton, still well above the world price, 
and fail to reform the restrictive quota program. Moreover, while the Senate bill also fails to reform 
the dairy program, the dairy provisions included in H.R. 2854 actually would expand the extent of 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

<b>Costly Add-ons to the Senate Bill</b> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Several costly items are attached to the Senate bill. S. 
1541 authorizes an additional $1.4 billion for a new Environmental Quality Incentive Program, 
supposedly intended to make it easier for farmers and ranchers to apply for assistance with 
conservation projects. The Senate bill also reauthorizes the food stamp program for seven years 
without any reform. Although traditionally considered in conjunction with the commodity 
programs, the food stamp program was added to the bill on the Senate floor to gain additional votes 
and without any consideration of how this might affect overall reform of the welfare delivery 
system. Finally, S. 1541 creates a new Fund for Rural America, authorizing $300 million for the 
next three years to be used for housing and infrastructure grants and loans. None of these provisions 
is included in the House bill. As there is no need to move these provisions at this time to meet the 
deadline of the 1996 crop season, they should be dealt with in a separate piece of legislation. 

<p>
<b>The House's Opportunity</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The House is expected to consider H.R. 2854, the 
Agriculture Market Transition Act, as early as February 28. If the House Rules Committee 
approves a rule allowing for amendments, there would be an opportunity to provide greater reform 
in the House bill than was achieved in the Senate. If there is such a rule, the House can achieve real 
reform of agricultural policy by taking the following actions:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Conservation Reserve Program.</b> The House should include a provision that would 
give producers the flexibility to remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program. 
Farmers holding CRP contracts on such land should be given the option to withdraw from the 
program. The millions of sustainable acres in the program should be eligible for planting now, 
when demand for U.S. grain and oilseeds is at record levels. The government should not stand in 
the way of this opportunity to produce for strong prices and growing markets.
<p>
<li><b>Sugar and Peanut Programs.</b> Real reform of these programs can be accomplished by 
providing market-driven transitional phase-downs of support prices and elimination of restrictive 
quotas and allotments. Without such reform, the existing sugar cartel -- a handful of wealthy 
processors -- will continue to determine who has the right to produce sugar in this country, and the 
peanut quota system will continue to restrict production to a limited few, based on inheritance.
<p>
<li><b>Dairy Program.</b> The House should scrap the provisions in H.R. 2854 which expand 
government regulation and intervention in the U.S. dairy industry and replace that section of the bill 
with a program that phases out the subsidy system and eliminates the archaic Milk Marketing Order 
system. To phase out the subsidies without getting rid of the marketing orders means that the 
government continues to manipulate the dairy markets and to determine winners and losers, putting 
dairy farmers in certain regions of the country at an unfair disadvantage.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Marketing Loan Program.</b> The House should eliminate the marketing loans for 
wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, and oilseeds, thus eliminating the huge payments that circumvent 
the payment limitations and go primarily to the wealthiest farmers. 
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; With minor exceptions, the Senate has failed to reform 
agricultural policy in its version of the farm bill. However, the House has an opportunity to make 
significant changes in the bill reported out of the House Agriculture Committee. Lawmakers should 
seize that opportunity to craft a farm bill that lets farmers and consumers in the market, rather than 
bureaucrats in Washington, determine what should be grown and produced in America and where 
that production should take place.

<h3>WHY THE HOUSE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM BILL WOULD HELP ACHIEVE TRUE HEALTH CARE REFORM</h3>
By John C. Liu<br>
<P>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 271<br>
March 26, 1996<br>
<p>
(Updating <I>Issue Bulletin</I> No. 222, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/ib222.html">"A Guide to Kassebaum-Kennedy,"</a> March 22, 1996.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House of Representatives soon will consider major health insurance reform legislation approved by the Committees on Commerce, Ways and Means, and Economic and Educational Opportunities.<sup>1</sup>  The Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996, a legislative proposal being coordinated by Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL), contains many of the structural improvements needed in today's health insurance market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reforms would enable Americans to keep their health insurance should they change or lose their jobs. They also would generate more genuine competition among insurance carriers and other health plan providers, thereby controlling costs through free-market forces. In addition to making health insurance more available and portable, the House proposal would address the more immediate and pressing concern facing millions of Americans -- the affordability of health insurance. It would do this by changing the tax treatment of health insurance, creating medical savings accounts (MSAs), and expanding tax relief for health insurance. This would give Americans more personal choice of health care services and make it possible for more families to own their health plans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Increasing the Availability of Insurance.</b> The House proposal would restrict the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny group health insurance coverage to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. The limitation period on preexisting conditions would be reduced by the length of time that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under any prior plan. In addition, the proposal would prohibit an insurance company from imposing any further preexisting condition exclusions if the employee had been covered under another group health plan at the time coverage was offered, and would prohibit health plans from excluding or canceling coverage for any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status. Thus, workers who changed jobs would no longer be subjected to waiting periods. The absence of portability in group health insurance, now confronting millions of workers who want to change jobs, would be alleviated in the proposed group-to-group provision.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, the House bill would help create a consumer-based health insurance system by making individual ownership of health policies much easier. Individuals would be guaranteed health insurance coverage if they met certain specific requirements.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of health insurance in the individual market would be achieved under the bill by forbidding insurance carriers from imposing eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. These rules would guarantee the portability of health insurance for workers and their families in the individual market. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who provides health insurance to another employer who does not will lose coverage. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The concern has been raised that a guaranteed issue requirement would sharply raise the premiums on individual-based policies. Estimates vary, with some projecting increases of 2 to 5 percent, and others placing the increase between 10 and 15 percent.<sup>3</sup>  Because real consumer choice and genuine market competition are virtually non-existent in today's distorted health insurance market, it is inevitable that premiums would increase somewhat in the individual market under a guaranteed issue requirement. And since only employer-based health insurance is completely tax free, individuals who purchase it on their own must pay the entire cost of the higher premiums in after-tax dollars. Without any change in this tax treatment, healthier-than-average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance under a guaranteed issue requirement, while unhealthy persons would be more likely to purchase coverage, driving up average premiums. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, the House proposal makes two key adjustments in the federal tax code that would help offset the increase in premiums.
<p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) Medical savings accounts.</b> The bill creates medical savings accounts (MSAs). As drafted, MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a significant impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other forms of tax equity Congress should consider, such as the comprehensive system of tax credits proposed in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) and Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed, MSAs are a good start. They would provide an incentive for healthy individuals to purchase at least catastrophic health insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool to help offset the claims of future unhealthy enrollees.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2) An increased tax deduction for the self-employed.</b> Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House bill would increase the deduction to 50 percent by 2003.<sup>4</sup>  While this would help, the federal tax code would remain biased against employees in employer-based health plans who prefer the security of choosing and owning their own plan. The House thus should establish at least a 50 percent deduction for all individuals purchasing health insurance, not just the self-employed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Small Employer Pooling.</b> The House bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase insurance coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>5</sup>  Eighty-five percent of uninsured Americans are in households headed by a worker. The House proposal uses ERISA to preempt any state laws prohibiting groups of employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage through a multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House bill also would eliminate confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has helped insurance swindlers and bogus unions hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. The House proposal would clarify the law and give legitimate self-insured associations (including church plans, franchise networks, trade associations, and certain collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in a state permitting such practices. Alternatively, they could seek federal certification under the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Second, the House bill makes clear that entities created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business rather than ERISA. The states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage when attempting to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers. The wrong way to deal with this would be for Congress to create government-sponsored health insurance purchasing cooperatives and impose new federal regulations. By giving smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the economies of scale available under ERISA, the House proposal would make it much easier for small firms to obtain this expensive health insurance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House legislation would be a big step toward genuine health care reform because it addresses the principal reason why Americans have been demanding health insurance reform -- their fear of losing current health benefits or being unable to afford coverage. Further, the bill begins to tackle the root cause of the financing problems -- the tax bias against purchasing health insurance outside an employer. By doing this, the House proposal would give Americans the desirable components of health care reform that were the casualties of the battle over the Clinton health plan:  availability, affordability, portability, and -- above all -- the security that comes with personally owned health insurance.

<title>How to Bring China and Taiwan Into the World Trade Organization -- Heritage</title>

<h3>HOW TO BRING CHINA AND TAIWAN INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) have applied to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. Taiwan has made substantial progress in its accession negotiations. Although several important economic issues remain, the most significant obstacle to Taiwan's membership in the WTO is not economic, but political. China insists that Taiwan should not join the WTO before China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. prefers that China and Taiwan become members of the WTO simultaneously. Simultaneous accession is, of course, the best possible outcome, but China is not as far along as Taiwan in meeting the criteria for membership. The U.S. should not let China's political sensitivities over Taiwan's membership slow U.S. negotiations with Taiwan. Once Taiwan meets the requisite economic criteria for WTO accession, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwan's membership, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Indeed, a clear signal to Taipei that the U.S. is willing to exercise such leadership could encourage Taiwan to meet the economic criteria for membership. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also needs to clarify its position toward the PRC's prospective membership in the WTO. China wants to join for economic and political reasons. It wants not only the benefits of trade, but also the political recognition of its status as a world economic power and its primacy over Taiwan. In contrast, the European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States insist that WTO membership is a commercial contract, not an act of political recognition.<sup>1</sup>  Along with the Europeans and the Japanese, the Clinton Administration correctly insists that China can join the WTO only on "commercially viable terms."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Substantial disagreements remain over the terms of China's accession. In particular, China disagrees with the EU, Japan, and the U.S. on the size and scope of tariff reductions; when China's export-import licensing scheme, known as trading rights, should be abolished; how China's investment and industrial policies should be brought in line with international agreements; whether China should accede to the WTO as a developed or developing country; and what safeguards should be available to limit import surges while the WTO accession agreement is being implemented.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China's desire to join the WTO is an opportunity for the U.S. In addition to ensuring that China meets certain economic standards before acceding to the WTO, the U.S. could offer Beijing permanent, unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status in exchange not only for economic concessions, but also for dropping its political demands on Taiwan with regard to the WTO. It is in America's interest that membership in the WTO, both for China and for Taiwan, be treated as an economic question.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To further American economic interests, President Bill Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li> Support Taiwan's accession to the WTO after it meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues. Taiwan's accession should not be held hostage to demands by the PRC.
<p>
<li> Work closely with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms. In the face of a unified position on the part of the world's major trading nations, Beijing will be more likely to make economic concessions.
<p>
<li> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions. The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Allowing the President to trade unconditional, permanent MFN status, which Beijing would value highly, for concessions on Taiwan's membership in the WTO and on economic issues benefitting the U.S.would increase America's negotiating leverage with China.

</ul><p>
<b>FROM GATT TO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both China and Taiwan want to join the World Trade Organization because membership facilitates trade and enhances economic growth. Superseding the General Agreement Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the WTO establishes the legal framework for international trade. It also is the international organization which administers such multilateral agreements as GATT, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The WTO requires that member states and territories adhere to certain trade rules. Each member must apply the same tariffs and trade regulations to goods and services from all other members. This is known as the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, members may not discriminate against imported goods in favor of "like" domestically made products. This is known as the national treatment principle. All WTO-related trade agreements are based on these two fundamental principles.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The World Trade Organization is a direct descendent of the International Trade Organization (ITO), which allied leaders attempted to create at the end of World War II. The ITO was intended to prevent a recurrence of protectionism and to set the rules for international trade in the post-war era. In 1946-1947, President Harry Truman negotiated an "interim" agreement, the GATT, with other countries to reduce tariffs and establish a legal framework for international trade.<sup>3</sup>  The GATT was not intended to be a permanent organization, but a temporary instrument of the ITO. However, because the U.S. Senate failed to ratify the ITO charter, the ITO died stillborn in 1950, leaving the GATT forced to function as the world's multilateral trade organization until the WTO was established on January 1, 1995.<sup>4</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since 1947, there have been eight successful rounds of trade liberalization negotiations under the GATT. The eighth was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in September 1986 and concluded in Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15, 1994. U.S. legislation implementing the Uruguay Round was signed into law on December 8, 1994.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As in previous rounds, the Uruguay Round achieved substantial tariff reductions in developed countries. It cut tariffs by 38 percent, dropped the average tariff to 3.9 percent, and eliminated some tariffs altogether.<sup>5</sup>  The Uruguay Round also broke new ground in a number of areas:
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Agriculture.</b> For the first time, trade in agricultural products was placed under the GATT. The Uruguay Round mandates the conversion of non-tariff barriers on agricultural products into tariffs. This means that import quotas on foodstuffs must be lifted and replaced by tariffs whose rates are set to allow at least the same volume of imports as under the quota. The Uruguay Round also reduces government financial support for agriculture by 20 percent and cuts the value of export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years.<sup>6</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Apparel and Textiles.</b> Import quotas on apparel and textiles manufactured in developing economies such as China or India are being phased out over 10 years.<sup>7</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Services.</b> Trade in such services as advertising and tourism is governed by a new General Agreement on Trade in Services, which establishes an MFN principle for all services. However, this agreement applies the national treatment principle only to those services listed by a WTO member in its trade liberalization commitments.  This agreement also mandates additional negotiations on opening markets in such service sectors as financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Trade-Related Investment Measures.</b> Modest progress was made toward liberalizing foreign investment. Regulations which require that a minimum percentage of a product's "added value" (i.e., that portion of its value normally subject to a value-added tax) be produced within a country are banned. Such regulations are known as local content requirements. Also banned are regulations which require that a minimum percentage of finished goods be exported in exchange for allowing imports.<sup>8</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Intellectual Property Rights. </b>Finally, the Uruguay Round establishes global rules for the protection of copyrights, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets, semiconductor layouts, and geographical indications.<sup>9</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the Uruguay Round, GATT members recognized the need for a permanent multilateral organization similar to the stillborn ITO to supervise global trade. As a result, the World Trade Organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, was established to supersede the GATT. The WTO oversees the implementation of trade agreements negotiated under auspices of the GATT or WTO, periodically evaluates the trade practices of its members, organizes future multilateral trade negotiations, and adjudicates trade disputes arising from WTO-related trade agreements.
<p>
<b>HOW TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A knowledge of the WTO's structure and procedure helps explain the difficulties facing Taiwan. The WTO is governed by a Ministerial Conference, which is composed of the trade ministers of all WTO members and must meet at least once every two years. Between meetings, the Ministerial Conference delegates the power to run the WTO to a General Council composed of representatives of all WTO members and a Director-General appointed by the Ministerial Conference.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article IX of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization states, "The WTO shall continue the practice of decision-making by consensus followed under GATT.... [W]here a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter shall be decided by voting."  The preference for consensus is very strong. Fewer than a handful of votes have been taken in almost 50 years. When a vote does occur, each WTO member has one vote.<sup>10</sup>  Accession of new members requires a two-thirds vote of the membership. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article XII of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization provides that a member may be either "a [sovereign] state or a separate customs territory possessing full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations."  A state or territory applying for membership must submit a memorandum detailing all of its laws, regulations, and policies affecting trade and investment. Once this memorandum is submitted, negotiations for entry start on two tracks. In Geneva, the General Council appoints a Working Party composed of trade negotiators from WTO members, including the U.S., to bargain with the applicant on bringing its domestic laws into line with WTO rules. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Simultaneously, the applicant begins bilateral discussions with individual WTO members on tariff reductions and other market-opening issues. Only after the applicant concludes all bilateral negotiations may the Working Party submit a Protocol of Accession to the Ministerial Conference for approval. The Protocol of Accession is a statement which details all of an applicant's trade liberalization commitments. Consequently, the bilateral negotiations are a choke point in the membership process; any member can veto an applicant simply by failing to conclude the bilateral talks.
<p>
<b>TAIWAN'S BID TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because GATT and its successor, the WTO, allow either sovereign states or autonomous customs territories to apply, Taiwan applied on January 1, 1990, to become a contracting party to the GATT as "The Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu," or "Chinese Taipei."  This lengthy designation was chosen to soothe Beijing's sensitivities about Taiwan, over which it claims sovereignty.<sup>11</sup>  Taiwan was following the example of Hong Kong, which became a contracting party on April 23, 1986. On September 29, 1992, the GATT accepted Taiwan's application and appointed a Working Party to begin membership negotiations.<sup>12</sup>  Since then, Taiwan has participated in eight Working Party sessions and has conducted bilateral negotiations over tariff reductions and market access with 25 WTO members.<sup>13</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China does not object to "Chinese Taipei's" accession to the WTO, provided it does not join before China. In fact, China has offered to sponsor Taiwan's membership as its first act as a WTO member; at the same time, however, because China considers accession to be a political act, it has warned WTO members that it will firmly oppose admitting Taiwan first. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both bilateral and Working Party negotiations with Taiwan have progressed farther than they have with the PRC. Taiwan has agreed to enter the WTO as a developed economy, meaning it would comply with the same standards as the European Union, Japan, and the U.S.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Taiwan has promised to implement all WTO commitments immediately and fully with only a few exceptions, related principally to agricultural products. Taiwan has offered not only to lift all import bans, but also to cut average industrial tariffs from 5.2 percent to 3.8 percent and average agricultural tariffs from 13.3 percent to 11.4 percent. It also has agreed not to raise tariff rates in the future without compensating other WTO members; such compensation may include lowering other tariff rates, removing non-tariff barriers, or liberalizing trade in service sectors.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, five important economic issues remain unresolved in the bilateral negotiations with Taiwan.
<p><ul>
<li> Market Access for Alcohol and Tobacco. The Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau currently maintains a legal monopoly on the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages and tobacco in Taiwan. The European Union and the U.S. are seeking to end the monopoly's discriminatory practices and expand export opportunities.
<P>
<li> Market Access for Agricultural Products. Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, and the U.S. are not satisfied with Taiwan's offer to reduce tariffs and liberalize quotas for agricultural products, especially beef, milk, rice, and various fruits and vegetables.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Motor Vehicles. Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. have yet to reach agreement with Taiwan on cutting tariffs and removing strict quotas on automobile imports.
<p>
<li> Intellectual Property Rights Protection. The European Union and the U.S. find that Taiwan does not sufficiently protect intellectual property rights. Taiwan still requests a two-year phase-in period for implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights, while American and European negotiators insist on full implementation immediately upon accession. Taiwan also has failed to meet the American and European demand for full protection of copyrighted materials produced in the last 50 years.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Services. Taiwan's proposal on such services as telecommunications and legal services is also inadequate for the U.S. For example, American negotiators want to remove Taiwan's suffocating restrictions on foreign investment in the telecommunications industry.<sup>15</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the December 1995 meeting of the Taiwan Working Party, U.S. negotiators handed their Taiwanese counterparts a discussion paper on these unresolved issues. Taiwan is expected to reply before the Working Party's next meeting, tentatively scheduled for late spring 1996.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The optimum outcome would be the simultaneous accession of China and Taiwan to the WTO. However, the slower pace of the negotiations with China may be affecting the pace of talks with Taiwan. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord told a November 9, 1995, briefing at the Foreign Press Center that "we have not reached a point where we have to worry about sequence,"<sup>16</sup> but a more accurate (and perhaps more candid) statement of where things actually stand came from another American official. This official, who requested anonymity, commented after Taiwan's Working Party meeting on December 14, 1995, that "no one in the Working Party has the stomach" to propose delinking the accessions of the PRC and ROC.<sup>17</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When the question of who should go first does come up, the Clinton Administration merely follows the crowd. As Lord noted, "[the sequence of accession] will be a collective decision of the WTO, not just the United States."  Lord went on to say that "we believe each case should be decided on its own merits" without "any political consideration."<sup>18</sup>  As a European official observed anonymously after the conclusion of the Working Group meeting on December 14, however, "Bilateral concerns with Taiwan should be easy to conclude, [but] the EU is not keen to conclude them because there is a clear sentiment among WTO members that Taiwan's accession cannot take place before China's."<sup>19</sup>  Thus, without determined American leadership, it is doubtful that Taiwan will be permitted to enter the WTO before the PRC. The WTO's consensus-based approach to decision-making gives China a tacit veto over Taiwan's accession.
<p>
<b>THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will be more difficult for China to join the WTO than it is for Taiwan, if only because Beijing will have to make more fundamental changes in the structure of its economy.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China is now the world's third-largest economy behind the U.S. and Japan. Since 1978, the People's Republic of China has transformed its once-stagnant command economy into a growing mixed economy. Markets have been liberalized, and prices are set largely by the market. While currency inconvertibility and poor statistical data make a precise determination of China's gross domestic product impossible, estimates of its 1994 GDP range from $474 billion to $3.0 trillion.<sup>20</sup>  China's annual real GDP growth rate has averaged more than 9 percent in the last decade.<sup>21</sup>  Furthermore, China's high savings rate, high degree of literacy, and low population growth rate suggest the ability to sustain high productivity and per capita income growth rates in the future.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Economic reform also has stimulated international trade. China's global two-way trade was $20.7 billion in 1978, making the PRC the world's 27th-largest trading economy. In 1994, with two-way trade of $236.4 billion, China became the world's tenth-largest trading economy. Two-way trade between China and the U.S. also has grown, rising from $4.8 billion in 1980 to $48.1 billion in 1994, making the PRC America's sixth-largest trading partner.<sup>23</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Coming to Geneva.</b> China has been seeking to join the GATT and now the WTO for almost a decade. Although the Republic of China was an original contracting party to the GATT in 1948, Taiwan's government withdrew in 1950, following the Communist victory on the mainland and the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan; later, once economic reforms were underway on the mainland, the PRC sought to resume the seat itself. China won observer status in the GATT in November 1982 and formally requested accession to the GATT on July 11, 1986. On February 13, 1987, China submitted the required memorandum describing its trading system, and on March 4, 1987, the GATT Council established a Working Party to negotiate China's accession.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, China launched a major campaign to join the GATT before the end of 1994. Beijing wanted to become a founding member of the WTO because it saw this as political recognition of China's status as a world economic power. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insisted that China's accession must be accomplished on "commercially viable terms."  Because negotiators were unable to bridge the wide gap between these two positions, the talks failed to produce an agreement on China's accession.<sup>25</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Almost one year later, on November 10, 1995, Deputy United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky laid out a secret 13-page "road map" on Chinese accession to Beijing negotiators. This document outlined the full range of WTO commitments and identified the basic issues that China must resolve before it can enter the WTO on a commercially viable basis.<sup>26</sup>  These issues include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Reducing tariffs and opening markets.</b> A wide gap remains between China's current offers on reducing tariffs and the minimum demands of the major trading powers. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced that China would cut its average tariff rate from 36 percent to 24 percent as a "downpayment" on APEC trade liberalization.<sup>27</sup>  China also has indicated a willingness to cut its average tariff rate to 17 percent within three years for industrial products and six years for agricultural products.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
China has not released detailed information on what the new tariffs would be. Therefore, it is difficult to know the exact value of this offer. However, China's average tariff rate, even after this second reduction, would remain high compared to other developing countries such as Brazil (14.3 percent) or Malaysia (9 percent). Moreover, China indicated not only a desire to maintain an industrial policy to protect "infant" industries, but also an unwillingness to liberalize foreign investment rules and import restrictions in the automotive and telecommunications sectors of its economy.<sup>29</sup> 
<P>
<li><b> Trading Rights.</b> China controls imports and exports through a licensing system known as trading rights, which requires companies to receive Beijing's approval for each of their imports or exports. Under the WTO, firms may import or export any product they wish unless that product falls under certain narrowly defined government exceptions. Eliminating trading rights is important because they allow China to negate the value of any tariff concession by refusing to grant import licenses.<sup>30</sup>  In December 1995, China offered to phase out trading rights within five years instead of the eight years it had offered in July 1995.<sup>31</sup>  The U.S. has pushed for a shorter phase-out, possibly two or three years, provided China does not favor domestic firms over their foreign rivals in granting trading rights during the phase-out period.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Investment and Industrial Policies.</b> China's investment and industrial policies violate GATT's national treatment principle. For example, China forbids foreign investment in some industries (such as motor vehicle assembly), requires local partners in others, and discriminates against foreign firms in granting trading rights. China also violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Investment by requiring that foreign investors in China use domestic components in manufacturing of their products and also by requiring that foreign-owned firms export a large percentage of the products made at their Chinese factories. Finally, China violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights by requiring the transfer of patented technology as a precondition for approving foreign investment. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insist that China terminate these practices upon accession, but the Chinese want a much longer phase-out period.
<p>
<li><b> Developed versus Developing Country.</b> China seeks to enter the WTO as a so-called developing country. The WTO tries to help developing members adjust to global competition by allowing them to adhere to less demanding standards and to take a longer time to implement trade liberalization than is required of developed members. For example, in agriculture, while developed members must cut the value of their export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years, developing members are allowed to reduce the value of their export subsidies by only 24 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 14 percent over ten years. Similarly, developed members must implement the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights within one year, while developing members may take up to four years to implement the provisions.
<P>
China argues that it qualifies for admission as a developing country because of its low per capita income. The U.S. and other developed countries counter that China's economy is not small and weak like those of other developing countries; China is already a major exporter. Therefore, the PRC should enter the WTO under the more demanding standards of a developed country.
<P>
<li><b> Protection Against Import Surges from China.</b> The only significant disagreement among the European Union, Japan, and the U.S. concerning China's entry to the WTO is over safeguards against import surges from China during the phase-in period. WTO members may raise tariffs temporarily or impose quotas for up to four years (1) when an import surge threatens a domestic industry and (2) when relief from the import surge may "prevent or remedy serious injury and facilitate adjustment."  This practice is known as a "safeguard."  Generally, safeguards may not be targeted at a specific country; they must be applied equally to all exporting countries.
<P>
Europeans insist that during China's transition period, WTO members must be permitted to impose "safeguard" tariffs or quotas on Chinese exports without having to apply them at the same time to exports from all other WTO members. Furthermore, they want to be able to apply these safeguards against either specific Chinese products or all Chinese exports. The Japanese, on the other hand, have shown little interest in safeguards.
<P>
The American position is more ambivalent. The United States wants a strong accession agreement and would like to have China move rapidly to liberalize its market and adopt strict rules on investment and intellectual property rights. At the same time, the U.S. "road map" suggests a willingness to consider safeguards if necessary.
<P>
China objects to safeguards as a violation of the MFN principle but does not rule them out entirely. It would allow WTO members to invoke safeguards only when the volume of imports of a specific Chinese product grew substantially faster than the volume of imports of similar products from other countries.<sup>33</sup> 
<p>
<li><b> Import Quotas.</b> Referring to Poland's accession to the GATT in 1968 as a precedent, the U.S. "road map" suggests that China should consider adopting import quotas while implementing its WTO commitments.<sup>34</sup>  During Poland's accession negotiations, GATT members struggled over how to create trading opportunities between Poland's non-market economy and their market economies. To solve this problem, Poland agreed to increase its imports from GATT members by seven percent each year and to subject its exports to GATT members to special safeguards. These import quotas encouraged Polish central planners to permit more imports and to abandon some protectionist policies.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
China feels that import quotas are inappropriate during the implementation period. A Chinese negotiator recently stated that "China is in transit from a planned economy to a market economy. Today's China is totally different than Poland thirty years ago."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Jackson-Vanik.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act complicates the U.S. discussions with China over WTO accession. Passed in 1975, this law requires the President to certify annually that countries with non-market economies are allowing free emigration. Congress may overturn the President's certification by passing a joint resolution. Jackson-Vanik was intended to increase the flow of Jewish emigrants from the former Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to Israel and the U.S. However, following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, Congress began to apply it to China by attempting to revoke China's MFN status.
<P>
The WTO requires that the U.S. grant China unconditional, permanent MFN trade status once it joins the WTO. By preventing this, Jackson-Vanik will force the U.S. to conduct separate negotiations with China to try to duplicate the terms of its WTO accession in a separate bilateral trade agreement. This reduces America's negotiating leverage, allowing China to offer less generous economic concessions to the U.S. in a parallel bilateral trade agreement than other countries would receive under the usual WTO accession agreement.<sup>37</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Reactions to the U.S. Position.</b> Chinese negotiators greeted the U.S. "road map" as a "positive initiative," but they also warned that substantial differences remain unresolved. An informal meeting of the Working Party convened in Geneva on December 7-8, 1995, and China-U.S. bilateral talks were held the following day. Chinese negotiators agreed to reply to the "road map" by the next meeting of the Working Party on March 18, 1996.<sup>38</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During a February 12, 1996, meeting with Deputy USTR Charlene Barshefsky, Vice Minister Sun Zhenyun delivered China's reaction. Sun reaffirmed that the "road map" was a positive step, but criticized parts of it for making what he claimed were demands that exceed what is required of other WTO members. Sun rejected a U.S. proposal for safeguards against surges of Chinese imports. He also opposed a U.S. suggestion for import targets. China is expected to respond to the other issues raised in the "road map" at the next Working Group meeting.<sup>39</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So far, American, European, and Japanese negotiators have remained remarkably united in their talks with China. The three major trading powers have insisted that China may not join the WTO as a matter of political recognition; accession must occur on a "commercially viable basis."

<p>
<b>BRINGING CHINA AND TAIWAN INTO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will take China longer to join the WTO than it will Taiwan. The PRC has to make fundamental structural changes in its economy to meet WTO standards. The economic concessions Taiwan must make, while significant, are more limited, affecting only certain sectors of its economy. Nevertheless, even if the Taiwanese government decides to make concessions, Beijing's determined opposition to Taiwan's accession before China's and the apparent U.S. willingness to accede to Beijing's desires will hold Taiwan's application hostage to China's wishes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

WTO-related trade agreements are commercial contracts, and WTO accession is an economic, not a political, act. Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTO's economic criteria should be free to join. As the world's largest exporter, the U.S. has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO applicants. Therefore, to further American economic interests, President Clinton should:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Support the accession of Taiwan to the WTO after Taiwan meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues.</b> If China is making enough progress in the WTO negotiations, the Clinton Administration should help China and Taiwan join at the same time. This would be the best outcome for all parties. However, if the talks with China fail and accession appears unlikely in the near future, the Clinton Administration should support the accession of Taiwan on its own merits, even though this would face China's determined opposition. 
<p>
<li><b> Cooperate with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms.</b> Close cooperation among the European Union, Japan, and the United States will prevent China from playing one against the others in the accession negotiations. Therefore, cooperation will increase American leverage in negotiating with China. At a minimum, President Clinton must insist that China agree to: 
<p><ol>
<li><b> Implement</b> the principal WTO commitments, publish all trade regulations, and provide an open and fair legal process for adjudicating trade disputes immediately upon accession.
<p>
<li><b> Accept</b> strong safeguard provisions in exchange for a longer time to phase out trading rights and implement other WTO commitments.
<p>
<li><b> End</b> the PRC's practice of forcing foreign firms to transfer technology as a condition of doing business in China. China's market is so huge that Beijing has the leverage to force large industrial firms to surrender to this form of government-sponsored theft.
<p>
<li><b> Enforce</b> fully all existing bilateral trade agreements, especially the 1995 Intellectual Property Rights Memorandum of Understanding.
</ol><P>
<li><b> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions.</b> The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Beijing highly values gaining unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in the U.S. However, keeping China on conditional MFN status subject to annual renewal, as mandated by Jackson-Vanik, provides the U.S. with few benefits. By granting the President the discretionary authority to exempt China from Jackson-Vanik, Congress would strengthen substantially America's leverage in WTO accession talks with Beijing. The President then could offer Beijing unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in exchange not only for relaxing its political demands on Taiwan's membership in the WTO, but for economic concessions that benefit American exporters and investors.
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Jackson-Vanik Amendment harms American interests in a number of ways. First, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is based on a faulty premise. The PRC is no longer a stagnant non-market economy. Rather, it is a growing mixed economy. Proponents of applying Jackson-Vanik ignore the economic reforms that have occurred in China since 1978.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is inappropriate. Jackson-Vanik was designed to encourage the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift restrictions on Jewish emigration to Israel and the U.S. However, it is American immigration law, not Chinese emigration policy, that restricts the flow of Chinese emigrants. While millions of Chinese would willingly emigrate to the U.S., American immigration law limits the flow to approximately 25,000 annually. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Third, Jackson-Vanik's threat to withdraw MFN is at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive. MFN tariffs are not a special privilege granted to specific countries; they are the standard rates that the U.S. extends to all but a handful of small countries. Withdrawing MFN would compel the U.S. to apply Smoot-Hawley tariffs on Chinese exports. After the inevitable Chinese retaliation against American exports, there would be a virtual cessation of China-U.S. trade.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Finally, Jackson-Vanik weakens the U.S. bargaining position in the WTO accession talks with China. By preventing the U.S. from granting China unconditional, permanent MFN, it would force the U.S. to conclude a separate bilateral trade pact with Beijing, paralleling China's WTO accession agreement and allowing the PRC to offer the U.S. smaller tariff cuts and fewer market-opening measures than it would grant to other WTO members in its accession agreement.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China are seeking to join the WTO, the former as a sovereign state and the latter as an autonomous customs territory. Although Taiwan is closer to the goal, both have yet to meet the economic criteria for membership. Taiwan sees WTO membership as a commercial contract, while the PRC regards it as an act of political recognition. Beijing therefore opposes Taiwan's accession before its own. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because China's accession is more complicated, negotiations with China may take longer to complete than those with Taiwan. Taiwan's accession to the WTO could be held hostage to the process of internal change in China. Given the commercial nature of the WTO, this would be manifestly unfair. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its accession, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Taiwan should join the WTO when it is ready, not when Beijing says it can.

<li>Technically, only sovereign states and autonomous customs territories may join the WTO.

<li>There are several important exceptions to the most-favored-nation principle. Customs unions such as the European Union and free-trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are permissible exceptions to the MFN principle. Likewise, developed WTO members may abolish or reduce tariffs on certain industrial goods imported from least developed members. This is known as the generalized system of preferences (GSP). <p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The National Governors' Association (NGA) is proposing a new welfare reform plan, and Congress has initiated hearings on the governors' proposal. Unfortunately, this proposal, crafted by NGA bureaucrats and borrowing significant elements from President Clinton's welfare reform schemes, is another blueprint for flawed welfare reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Members of Congress should realize that the NGA plan repudiates most of the key elements of the Contract With America proposed by conservatives in the fall of 1994. The Contract contained a solid, comprehensive welfare reform based on three themes:
<p><ul>
<li><b> A national goal of reducing illegitimacy</b> and establishing a number of modest national policies to advance that goal;<p>

<li><b> National work requirements</b> for AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) recipients; and<p>

<li><b> Greater flexibility to state governments</b> in the operation of welfare programs.<sup>1</sup> 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House/Senate conference bill passed by Congress, and vetoed by President Clinton on January 9, retained these three basic elements of reform, albeit with the pro-marriage provisions weakened. But the NGA plan effectively eliminates the first two principles of reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Decision makers enticed by the NGA's "bipartisan" reform package would do well to remember history. America supposedly ended welfare just eight years ago, when Congress in 1988 passed a comprehensive "bipartisan" reform which promised to replace welfare with work. This so-called reform, also predominantly shaped by the NGA, turned out to be a sham:  Daycare spending soared; welfare caseloads skyrocketed; even today, almost no welfare recipients are required to work. With the NGA bureaucracy again in the lead, history is about to repeat itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA plan is heavily flawed in four key aspects.
<p>
<b>1) The plan abandons the welfare reform goal of reducing illegitimacy.</b> NGA officials have completely misdefined the real goal of reform. Their plan explicitly abandons the goal of saving marriage and reducing illegitimacy, which was the number one welfare reform plank in the Contract With America; the shift is so complete that the governors' policy declaration does not mention rising illegitimacy even as a minor social problem, let alone propose a reform structure to deal with it.
<p>
<b>2) The plan eliminates all work requirements for AFDC recipients.</b> The plan drawn up by the NGA bureaucracy completely guts the work requirements from the House-Senate conference bill and substitutes bogus requirements designed to deceive the public while preserving the status quo. The work requirements in the NGA plan are far weaker than those in the Democratic alternative bills supported by President Clinton, S.1117, introduced by Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) in the Senate, and the amendment to H.R. 4 introduced by Representative Nathan Deal (D-GA) in the House. In fact, under the NGA plan, no welfare recipients will be required to work.
<p>
<b>3) The plan has a pervasive anti-marriage bias.</b> Since the NGA bureaucracy rejected reducing out-of-wedlock birth rates as a reform goal, it is not surprising that the plan is indifferent, or effectively hostile, to marriage throughout. To the extent it modifies the conference welfare bill passed in the House and Senate, the NGA plan systematically discriminates against marriage. Further, it would penalize financially those states which pursue a pro-marriage welfare strategy and reward those which concentrate on the narrow goal of providing job-training and employment to single mothers.
<p>
<b>4) The plan embodies the Clinton Administration's "reform" structure.</b> The NGA plan incorporates many major elements of President Clinton's anti-dependency plans. As such, the governors' proposal encourages states to pursue the least efficient strategies for reducing welfare dependence and penalizes states that pursue efficient plans.
<p>

<b>ABANDONING MARRIAGE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most important element of any reform plan is the goal. If the goal is set properly, all other elements eventually will fall into place. If the nation sets the wrong goal, no amount of tinkering will help. The number one goal of welfare reform must be to save marriage and reduce illegitimacy. All else is secondary. Setting a clear, paramount goal of reducing illegitimacy also serves a public education function:  It frames the debate, alerts Americans to what is truly important, and establishes social expectations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' proposal is a failure because it sets the wrong goal. NGA officials declare that there are three "crucial elements" of real welfare reform:
<p><ul>
<li> Providing more government-funded daycare;
<p>
<li> Increasing child support payments from absent fathers; and 
<p>
<li> Imposing time limits and work requirements (with gaping loopholes) for welfare recipients.<sup>2</sup>
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The rise in illegitimacy and the collapse of marriage do not even merit a concerned comment, let alone aggressive policies, from the NGA.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, over the last year, the focus of the welfare debate has undergone a radical metamorphosis, from combating illegitimacy to providing public support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Eschewing the issue of illegitimacy, the NGA plan instead appears as a preparation for a future in which marriage plays a sharply diminishing role in America, and the government is heavily involved in meeting the needs of an ever-growing population of single-parent families. The triumph of liberals on this aspect of the debate has been complete:  Fighting illegitimacy is "out," and funding government daycare is "in." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' plan, borrowing heavily from the "reform" schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals, dovetails neatly with the interests of America's enormous welfare bureaucracy:  an industry that thrives on social decay. While the plan will trim the growth rate in welfare spending slightly in the near term, by failing to deal with ballooning rates of illegitimacy it sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social service spending in the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nor are the governors alone. Under its recently passed version of welfare reform, the Republican-controlled Congress has committed itself to spending nearly half a trillion dollars, over the next seven years to subsidize and support illegitimacy and single parenthood through multiple welfare benefits, daycare, job training, and other services. Under the congressional plan, government will spend $1,000 to subsidize single parenthood and illegitimacy for each dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA welfare reform plan will distort these priorities even further. When the dust settles on welfare reform, even token efforts to fight illegitimacy will have fallen by the wayside.

<P>
<b>The Crisis of Illegitimacy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But decisive action to deal with the collapse of the family is urgently needed. Last year, nearly one-third of American children were born out of wedlock. Even worse, the illegitimate birth rate continues to rise relentlessly -- by about one percentage point each and every year. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. This figure astounds even Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), who first issued his prophetic warnings about the erosion of marriage among blacks in the early 1960s. Moynihan's warning was vilified at the time, but the breakup of the black family and the accompanying social calamities have far outstripped his worst nightmares. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Ominously, the illegitimate birth rate among whites now is edging toward 25 percent -- almost exactly equaling the black rate when Moynihan first raised his alarm. The white family is teetering on the same precipice, heading rapidly toward the same lethal decomposition that devastated black communities in the late 1960s and 1970s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The collapse of marriage and the concomitant rise in illegitimacy together form the number one problem facing America; family collapse is the root cause of other social problems, such as poverty, crime, drug abuse, and school failure.<sup>4</sup>  Some reasons why:
<p><ul>
<li>Children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those born to couples who remain married. 
<p>
<li>Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out-of wedlock themselves than are girls from intact non-welfare families. 
<p>
<li>A boy from a single-parent home in the inner city is twice as likely to engage in crime as a similar boy who is poor but living with a father and a mother.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some would argue that federal action on illegitimacy is unneeded:  If left alone, the governors will tackle the problem on their own. But the governors' silence speaks volumes. Few, if any, governors have made reducing illegitimacy a central theme of reform; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. By refusing to acknowledge or mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out of wedlock and raised in government-supported daycare centers. This is not reform. It is a national disaster.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of welfare reform must be to save marriage. But the governors have formally stated that promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy is not a meaningful part of their reform plan. If the House and Senate adopt the governors' plan, they will have agreed with them and will have abandoned even token efforts to stem the rise of illegitimacy and decline of marriage in American society.
<p>

<b>THE NGA'S SHAM WORK REQUIREMENTS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Nearly 90 percent of Americans believe that welfare recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. In response to this public pressure, the U.S. welfare establishment has a simple solution:  sham work requirements that create the illusion that beneficiaries must work while, in fact, few actually do. For example, as part of the 1988 welfare reform (the Family Support Act) the public was told that "welfare will be replaced by work."  But the NGA opposed real work requirements. As a consequence, the reform, enacted by a nearly unanimous bipartisan vote in the Senate, was a sham. Daycare funding exploded, AFDC caseload grew by some 30 percent, and today only some 2 to 3 percent of AFDC recipients actually are required to work. History is about to repeat itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A major provision of the conference bill passed by Congress is a requirement that some AFDC recipients must work.5  Section 407 of the bill requires certain percentages of the AFDC caseload to work for benefits and provides a fairly tight definition of work. However, even these work participation requirements have loopholes. For example, up to 20 percent of those counted as working can be in vocational education instead.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The following table shows the nominal work participation rates in the conference bill and the real rates, once loopholes are taken into consideration. 
<center><P>
<table border>
<tr><th>YEAR</th><th>Nominal Participation Rates</th><th>Real Participation Rates</th>
</tr><tr>
<td>1996</td><td>15%</td><td>10.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1997</td><td>20%</td><td>14%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1998</td><td>25%</td><td>17.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>1999</td><td>30%</td><td>21%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2000</td><td>35%</td><td>24.5%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2001</td><td>40%</td><td>28%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>2002</td><td>50%</td><td>35%</td>
</tr></table></center><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, in the typical state, some 10 percent of AFDC recipients already are employed, voluntarily, in part-time jobs and can properly be counted toward the state work requirement rate. This means that, in the typical state, only 25 percent of AFDC recipients would be required to work by 2002.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even this rate is far too high for the NGA. While the NGA proposal nominally accepts the work participation rates from the conference report, the plan actually includes a cavernous loophole which effectively obliterates all work requirements. The NGA proposes to count routine caseload turnover toward the work participation rates, so any AFDC recipient who ever obtained work and left AFDC could be counted toward the participation requirement. It is important to note that there always has been a considerable turnover in the AFDC caseload. Hundreds of thousands of recipients obtain jobs and leave AFDC in any given year as an equal or greater number of persons enroll. This routine turnover occurs even when total AFDC caseloads are rising rapidly. The governors wish to be given credit for this automatic turnover and to portray the status quo as successful reform.<sup>7</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By claiming credit for individuals who have obtained a job and left AFDC during the last 24 months, a governor could automatically obtain a work "participation rate" of roughly 40 percent without in any way altering the existing welfare system.<sup>8</sup>  Nearly all states would be able to meet their work requirements for the next seven without the least change in the status quo. Thus, the NGA bill is almost a perfect repeat of the bogus 1988 reform. Once again, complicated sham work requirements will be substituted for the real thing.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Not surprisingly, the Clinton Administration is enthusiastic about counting normal caseload turnover as "work."  Very similar "credit for turnover" provisions played a key role in the Democratic alternative reform legislation rejected earlier this year in the House and Senate. Congressional Republicans at the time denounced these provisions as a crude effort to deceive the voters. It would be ironic if a Republican-controlled Congress now embraced the same deception.
<p>

<b>BUT ISN'T ENDING AFDC ENTITLEMENTS THE KEY TO REFORM?</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is true that the NGA plan does end the entitlement status of AFDC and eliminates many of the unnecessary restrictions in the existing AFDC code, thereby giving greater flexibility to the states.<sup>9</sup>  Replacing automatic entitlement funding with block grants also imposes greater fiscal discipline on each state. Under the current entitlement system, when a state expands its AFDC caseload, it gets an automatic increase in federal AFDC funds. If a state shrinks its caseload, its federal funding is cut. If the current automatic entitlement funding mechanism were replaced by a block grant system, each state would be given a fixed amount. Since the block grant amount would not expand automatically if a state's AFDC caseload grew, a block grant funding system would give states a greater incentive to curtail caseload growth.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The current entitlement nature of AFDC is objectionable and should be eliminated. However, eliminating entitlement status alone is not reform, or even a small part of reform. The impact of eliminating the entitlement nature of AFDC has been greatly overrated. Under the current funding system, states must match federal AFDC funding in the state (generally the state pays 40 to 50 percent of total AFDC costs within the state). Thus, states always have had a strong financial incentive to curtail AFDC caseload growth; this, however, has not prevented the program from swelling to the point where one out of five children receives benefits each year.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been recent efforts to exaggerate the importance of ending AFDC's entitlement status. For example, it has been claimed that ending the entitlement status and "block granting" were the only welfare goals of the Reagan Administration. This is misleading. A hallmark of welfare policy under President Reagan was the effort to establish national work requirements for welfare recipients. Bills to accomplish this aim were introduced year after year during the Reagan presidency.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In reality, eliminating AFDC entitlements would have only a modest effect on reform. Other far more significant factors in shaping reform at the state level are the overall framing of the welfare debate and the shaping of public expectations; the actual goal of reform in the minds of decision makers; the momentum of past policies; the vast influence of the state welfare bureaucracies; and the explicit goals, incentives, and requirements established by the federal government.<sup>10</sup>

<p>
<b>OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE NGA PLAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The governors' plan would create a huge performance incentive fund, costing roughly $6 billion over the next seven years. This fund -- a central feature of the Clinton reform strategy -- would provide cash bonuses to states which have higher rates of AFDC mothers obtaining jobs. This is a very limited and illogical measure of success. For example, increasing marriage and reducing out-of-wedlock births would have far more beneficial effects on children and society than merely increasing employment of single mothers. But the NGA plan is indifferent or hostile to the issues of illegitimacy and marriage.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even from the more limited perspective of reducing welfare dependence, the NGA plan is illogical. 
Welfare dependence can be reduced by six means:
<p><ul>
<li> Reducing illegitimacy;<P>
<li> Reducing divorce;<p>
<li> Increasing marriage among women who have had children out of wedlock but have not yet enrolled in welfare;<P>
<li> Encouraging single mothers to take jobs before they enter AFDC;<p>
<li> Increasing marriage among welfare mothers; and<p>
<li> Having welfare mothers obtain jobs.
</ul><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Employment of welfare mothers is, in fact, the least effective of these six mechanisms for purposes of shrinking dependence, reducing child poverty, and enhancing the well-being of children. However, employing welfare mothers is the mechanism which least disrupts the ideological status quo and it is attractive to the huge welfare bureaucracy, whose material interests require a growing population of welfare recipients needing more and more services, such as daycare and training. Hence, despite its irrationality, the employment of welfare mothers remains the almost exclusive focus of the NGA plan. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA plan thus is narrowly focused on the least effective means of reducing dependence and the one which is least beneficial to children. Under the proposal, states which concentrate on other aspects of reform would bear a heavy financial penalty. But by encouraging states to focus on the least effective and least desirable means of reducing dependence, the governor's plan actually will slow the reduction of welfare dependence.<sup>11</sup> 
<p>

<b>Rewards for Bogus "Success" </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA's focus on "exits from welfare," borrowed from the Clinton Administration, is illogical. The evidence indicates that serious work requirements have their strongest impact not by encouraging people to leave welfare, but by reducing the number of persons who bother to apply for welfare in the first place. Similarly, a state which restricts welfare entry to the truly needy (those who are the least able to support themselves) almost certainly will have proportionally fewer "exits" from the welfare caseload than would states with more liberal entrance standards.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The entire notion of measuring success in welfare by caseload exits makes no sense. It is like measuring success in the war on drugs not by a decline in drug use, but by an increase in the number of persons passing through rehabilitation, or judging the nation's health by counting the number of successful exits from hospitals -- a criterion which might be popular among hospital administrators but would make no sense for society at large. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, there is little relationship between "employment exits" and the level of welfare dependence or caseload size. In the NGA plan, there is no requirement that "successful" states actually lower caseloads. States would be rewarded for "success" even when their caseloads were consistently growing. If, for example, the NGA "performance incentive fund" had been created seven years ago, states automatically would have been rewarded with billions for "success," year after year, while their AFDC caseloads were growing between 25 and 30 percent. Unfortunately, the creation of bogus measurements of successful reform is no accident -- such measures are a key element in the welfare industry's strategy to forestall real change.
<p>
<b>Anti-Marriage Bias</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even from the limited perspective of promoting welfare exits, the NGA plan is inconsistent. The NGA bureaucrats would reward states when a single mother gets a job and leaves welfare, but give no reward if a mother marries and gets off welfare -- even though the marriage is far more effective in reducing long-term dependence and poverty. In keeping with the prevailing ideology of the nation's welfare establishment, the NGA plan is heavily biased against marriage and focused on obtaining employment for single mothers.
<p>
<b>No Real Money for Reducing Illegitimacy </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The vetoed House-Senate conference bill did contain a fund to reward states which reduced illegitimacy without increasing abortions, and the NGA plan retained this. However, it is useful to compare this illegitimacy reduction bonus fund with the NGA's "performance incentive fund," which rewards the employment of AFDC mothers. The performance incentive fund rewards states on a comparative or relative scale; states would be ranked, and states with higher employment records relative to other states would be given substantial bonuses. Such a comparative reward system creates automatic winners; cash incentives will be paid out automatically under the plan even if the overall level of real performance remains the same or deteriorates. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, the illegitimacy ratio bonus fund is linked to absolute -- not relative -- performance, so a state must achieve a real reduction in its illegitimacy ratio (the proportion of births which are out of wedlock) in order to receive a reward. The requirements are very difficult to achieve -- so much so that little or no bonus money actually will be paid from this fund. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NGA thus has adopted very tough absolute standards for rewarding illegitimacy reduction but lax comparative standards for rewarding employment. Yet the latter standards guarantee winners. Consequently, under the NGA plan, little or no money would be paid to reward states for efforts to reduce illegitimacy, while $6 billion in rewards would be given automatically for efforts to employ welfare mothers. Once again, the NGA's relentless bias against promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy is apparent. 

<p>
<b>Large Increases in Mandatory Day Care Funding</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The House-Senate conference bill increased federal daycare funding by $2 billion over seven years. The NGA plan would require another $4 billion. Overall, this means that federal daycare funding would be increased by a third. States would be required to spend all the increased funds on daycare even if they would prefer to spend it on other services to the poor.
<P>
<b>Family Cap </b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The conference bill prohibited states from using federal funds to give higher welfare benefits to women who have children out of wedlock while already enrolled in AFDC; states could choose to "opt out" of this restriction by enacting specific legislation. The governors' plan eliminates the family cap provision entirely. As under current law, states could have a family cap if they wish, but there is no legal impetus for them to do so.<sup>12</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The family cap is not only sound policy; it is widely supported by the public. Nearly nine out of ten Americans "oppose increasing a welfare mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out-of-wedlock."<sup>13</sup>  The popularity of the family cap is so great that the Clinton Administration does not publicly oppose the policy. Nor did the White House cite the inclusion of the family cap provision as a reason for its veto of the House/Senate conference bill.
<p>

<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Contract With America advanced three principles of welfare reform:  promoting marriage and reducing illegitimacy, requiring work, and increasing state flexibility. The NGA plan abandons the first two of these principles despite the fact that they are supported overwhelmingly by the public. Real welfare reform must carry out the principles of the Contract.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Restoring a sensible debate on marriage and illegitimacy is crucial. This issue has been trivialized or ignored by those pretending it is merely a question of whether the family cap provision in the House/Senate conference bill should be retained or eliminated. In reality, conservatives have proposed nearly a dozen national measures aimed at reducing illegitimacy. Many were included in the Contract With America. But in each case, they have been resisted by the Washington establishment and, one by one, they have been whittled away. What is now required is a complete reorientation of the debate back to the topic of illegitimacy, and the establishment of multiple measures to deal with the problem. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In order to produce real reform, the following ten steps are needed.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1)</b> The leadership of the House and Senate should assert publicly that reducing illegitimacy is the key goal in welfare reform and should commit to an ongoing effort to use the "bully pulpit" to raise concern about the collapse of marriage in society.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2)</b> The family cap provision of the conference bill (with the opt out clause) should be retained in any future legislation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>3)</b> The illegitimacy reduction bonus fund established in the conference bill is a good idea and should be retained. However, the criteria for successful performance are so strict that even those states which make serious attempts to reduce illegitimacy will be unlikely to achieve them. Of course, incentive bonuses which are nearly unobtainable are not likely to have much effect on state plans and activities. The success criteria for this fund should be softened to give states a more realistic opportunity to obtain the bonuses. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>4)</b> The NGA performance incentive fund rewards only employment by welfare mothers, even though this is the least effective and least desirable way of reducing dependence. The fund should be altered to reward a composite score of all of the following:  a reduced illegitimacy rate, reduced divorce rate, reduced AFDC application rate, increased AFDC employment exits, and increased AFDC marital exits. Moreover, states should be rewarded only if caseload and illegitimacy actually are declining.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>5)</b> States should be given the option of providing food commodities rather than food stamp coupons to AFDC mothers and retaining any resultant savings for other anti-poverty efforts. By reducing the attractiveness of the welfare life-style, this policy has the potential to greatly reduce future out-of-wedlock births.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>6)</b> The amount of funding in the conference bill's abstinence program should be increased from $75 million to $200 million per year in any future legislation.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>7)</b> Each state should be required to submit a plan showing how it intends to reduce illegitimacy. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>8)</b> Within the existing AFDC program, a new set-aside fund should be established providing $300 million per year for states to devise their own programs to reduce illegitimacy without increasing abortion (with firm evaluations required).
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>9)</b> The work requirements in the conference bill should not be weakened or undermined through the governors' proposal to count employment exits. Performance goals should not be linked to exits in any way, since the best reform schemes will reduce enrollments rather than increase exits. The hourly work requirements for AFDC recipients, especially AFDC-UP fathers, should not be reduced.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>10)</b> Under the bill, daycare funds could be spent only for daycare even if the governors wish to use them for other services for the poor. This "lock in" of the daycare money should be eliminated in future legislation.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On the crucial issues of work and illegitimacy, the NGA plan resembles the Democratic alternative bills introduced in the House and Senate much more closely than it does the original Contract With America. Indeed, the work requirements in the NGA plan actually are weaker than those in either Democratic bill.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The welfare "reform" proposed by the National Governors' Association is, in reality, an anti-reform. The NGA has abandoned the goal of saving marriage and reducing illegitimacy. Instead, NGA officials call for a massive investment in government daycare for an expanding population of single-parent families. The NGA seeks to abolish the work requirements in the conference bill passed by the House and Senate and to substitute sham requirements in their place. The bill is biased against marriage. The NGA has adopted a reward and incentive system which has as its exclusive goal the employment of single mothers despite the fact that this is the least effective means of reducing dependence and improving children's well-being.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Sham reforms such as that proposed by the NGA are very harmful. By creating the illusion of reform, bogus reform reduces public pressure for change and thereby helps to preserve the existing system. The bogus welfare reforms of 1988, created in large part by the NGA, delayed action on real reform for nearly a decade. This sad mistake should not be repeated.

<li>Statement on "Welfare Reform" as adopted by the governors on February 6, 1996.<p>
<li>In an February 29, 1996, article in the <I>Washington Times</I>, entitled "Can Welfare Reform Survive Friendly Fire?"  Robert Carleson maintains that the National Governors' Association did not ignore the catastrophic rise in illegitimacy. Carleson cites "findings" contained in the welfare legislation passed last year by Congress and vetoed by President Clinton. The findings say that illegitimacy is harmful. It is important to note, however, that these findings are merely rhetorical and are not linked to policy. It is true that the NGA, as a practical matter, used the conference bill passed by Congress as a textual base and amended it to produce its own proposed policy. But one can be quite certain that no governor actually looked at the huge conference tome, and it would be very surprising if any governor was aware of the few paragraphs of legally irrelevant "findings" buried deep within the 650-page conference document. Certainly no one at the NGA seems to have regarded these forlorn paragraphs as important. All one need do is listen to the NGA's own words. In its official statement of policy, reducing illegitimacy is not mentioned as a goal or "crucial element" of reform, and the NGA, of course, makes not the slightest reference to the "findings" on illegitimacy. <p>
<li>See Patrick F. Fagan, "Rising Illegitimacy:  America's Social Catastrophe," Heritage Foundation <I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 19, June 29, 1994. See also Patrick F. Fagan, "The Real Root Causes of Violent Crime:  The Breakdown of Marriage, Family, and Community," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1026, March 17, 1995.<p>
<li>Some of the "work" requirements in the conference bill are illusory; for example, individuals who have received AFDC for over two years are required to "work," but a state may count one hour of job search per year as "working."  These "requirements" are very similar to the cosmetic provisions of the sham reform of 1988. However, the work provisions of Section 407 of the bill are quite different, and for the first time in the history of AFDC, require a certain percentage of recipients actually to work <p>
<li>Another loophole permits states to subtract women with children under age one from the denominator for purposes of calculating their work participation rate. Such women comprise about 10 percent of the AFDC caseload; excluding them from the caseload count effectively cuts the required work participation rates by 10 percent.<P>
<li>It is important to understand the distinction between routine caseload turnover and net caseload reduction. With caseload turnover, a certain number of persons leave the welfare rolls but an equal or greater number enter; the total size of the caseload remains the same or increases. With net caseload reduction, the actual number of persons on welfare declines due to a drop in enrollments or an increase in exits which exceeds new enrollments. Caseload turnover is omnipresent and meaningless; it not a valid measure of success in reducing dependence. Caseload reduction is difficult to achieve and has rarely occurred in the history of AFDC. The goal of welfare reform is not to increase the number of persons cycled through the welfare system (although the welfare bureaucracy would like such a goal); it is to reduce the level of dependence. Caseload reduction is a proper measure of that goal. The House-Senate conference bill established performance standards which gave states proper credit for anti-dependency efforts which resulted in real caseload reduction, but not for mere turnover.<p>
<li>NGA bureaucrats in fact are demanding any individual who has ever obtained a job and left AFDC be counted toward the state's work participation rate. The figures become very complex since these individuals would be counted in both numerator and denominator for purposes of calculating the participation rate. However, the bottom line is simple:  Even if caseload turnover only for the prior six months is counted, the actual work standards in the bill would be gutted, at least through the end of this century.<p>
<li>In particular, the plan would eliminate the current JOBS program, which has made it difficult for states to operate serious workfare programs.<p>
<li>However, some proponents of the NGA plan regard ending the entitlement nature of AFDC not only as the most important, but as the only acceptable element of reform. Such individuals tend to adhere to the philosophy of "value neutral revenue sharing."  Under this doctrine, the federal government should collect the revenue for the welfare system and hand it over to state governments with no requirement other than that the funds be spent to aid the poor. According to this narrow doctrine, most of the welfare provisions of the Contract With America (and especially those dealing with work and illegitimacy) are not only unnecessary, but also highly objectionable. From this perspective, "success" in welfare reform necessarily means opposing and eliminating most of the Contract's welfare provisions as unwanted impediments on the states. Not surprisingly, the NGA plan draws very high praise from adherents of this view. However, this seems to be a perspective which is not widely shared.<p>
<li>It could be argued reasonably that the rewards and incentives provided in the NGA plan are irrational but that this fact is of lessened importance because it is greatly outweighed by the impact of removing the AFDC entitlement funding mechanism. In this view, giving each state a fixed-sum block grant creates an implicit fiscal discipline which will drive states to pursue rational means to reduce dependency, irrespective of the explicit, contrary system of goals and bonus incentives. However, in the experience of this writer, explicit goals, reform concepts, and rewards play a very large role in shaping the outlook of state-level bureaucrats and decision makers, a role which greatly outweighs any implicit fiscal impetus. <p>
<li>Under the current law, a state government must request a federal waiver to enact the family cap. Under the NGA plan, a waiver would no longer be needed.<p>
<li>Family Research Council poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, mid-October 1995. The poll surveyed 1,000 randomly selected American adults about their views on welfare and social issues and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.

<a href="fyi90c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Average Tax Rates Rise With Income under Armey-Shelby Flat Tax 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The presidential campaign has focused national attention on the flat tax. Some candidates in the Republican primary favor the flat tax, and even President Clinton, who currently does not support a single-rate tax system, advocates a fairer, simpler system.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This growing support for the flat tax and fundamental tax reform has enlivened critics who claim that a flat tax system will raise taxes on the middle class. To explore this argument, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the <a href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th?bill=(H ADJ R ADJ 2060)">flat tax proposal</a> put forward by Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), which includes a 17 percent tax, the same rate as proposed by Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes.<sup>2</sup> The analysis used the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the most detailed and complete publicly available database of individual income tax returns.<sup>3</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This analysis of the Armey-Shelby plan shows no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class Americans when compared with their current tax burden. In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups (see <a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a><sup>4</sup>). Among the key findings:<P>

<b>Question:</b> Does a 17 percent flat tax raise taxes on the middle class?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> No. The majority of taxpayers in every income bracket enjoys a tax cut under an Armey-Shelby flat tax with a 17 percent rate.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> If a married couple gross $60,000 in wages, how much will they save in taxes under a 17 percent flat tax?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> If they also have two children, they will save $2,488 in taxes. That is a 35 percent lower tax bill.<sup>6</sup>
<P>
<b>Question:</b> Does everyone pay the same flat tax rate, even the very rich?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Yes and no. Everyone faces the same 17 percent rate. However, the flat tax taxes only the difference of total income minus the generous family deduction ($33,300 for a family of four). Because the 17 percent tax is levied on the difference, families with incomes of $50,000 to $75,000 pay only 10 percent of their income, while families with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 pay 16 percent of their income in taxes.
<P>
<b>Question:</b> If everyone gets a tax cut with a 17 percent flat tax, won't that mean lower tax revenues and higher deficits?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> While nearly all individuals pay less tax, many medium- and large-size businesses will pay more. Also, many prominent economists believe that a flat tax will produce a bigger economy, which should result in more federal tax revenues.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Since the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal eliminates the Earned Income Tax Credit, what happens to low-income taxpayers?  
<P>
<b>Answer:</b> The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) allows low-income taxpayers to claim a credit that generally eliminates their income tax liability and restores some of the income taxed away by the Social Security tax (clearly the largest tax most low-income families pay). The Armey-Shelby bill replaces the EITC with a family deduction that more than doubles current family deductions. While details are unclear, the proposal intends to continue other aspects of the EITC under the government's welfare programs. About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<p>

<b>What Is a Flat Tax?</b><sup>8</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax would repeal the current income tax code and replace it with a system based on the following principles:
<p>
1. Tax all income with no deductions except a generous allowance based on family size. Today's complex system could be replaced by two simple, postcard-size forms, one for business and one for individuals.
<p>
2. Tax all income at one rate, applying the law equally to all taxpayers. Everyone faces the same 17 percent rate, and the government would not punish or subsidize taxpayers on the basis of how they earn or spend income.
<p>
3. Tax all income just once, ending the bias against savings and investment. Capital income would be taxed on the business form to ensure compliance, and labor income would be taxed on the individual form.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal follows each of these principles. For individuals, only the income from wages, salaries, and pensions is taxed. Individual taxpayers add up income from these sources and then deduct generous personal and dependent exemptions. What is left after these deductions is taxed at 17 percent (after a two-year phase-in period). For businesses, taxes are paid on income from the sale of goods or services. The business first adds up all of its income and then subtracts what it paid out in wages and salaries, what it purchased in order to make its products or provide its services, and the cost of all buildings, land, and other "capital structures" purchased during the tax year. The income that is left after these subtractions is taxed at 17 percent.

<P>
<b>Distribution of Tax Payments</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows the dollar and percentage reduction in average household tax payments under a 17 percent flat tax.<sup>8</sup> These estimates combine so-called labor income (wages and salaries) with all of the small business income currently reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedules C, E, and F.<sup>9</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The most striking feature of this flat tax distribution table is how much taxes are reduced for very low and very high incomes. At the low end, millions of households see their tax payments disappear as a result of the generous family deduction. Specifically:
About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly everyone else below $30,000 will see their taxes fall.<sup>10</sup>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxpayers at the high end of the income scale also see a substantial reduction in income taxes. These tax cuts result from two factors: the lower tax rate (a drop from an average effective rate of 33 percent to about 17 percent) and an end to the practice of double or triple taxation of so-called passive income (dividends, interest, and capital gains). Dividends and interest actually are payments made by companies to stockholders and depositors out of company income that already has been taxed. Furthermore, individuals buy company stock and make time deposits in savings accounts with after-tax income. Thus, all of the cash transactions associated with, say, a dividend are based on income that already has been taxed. To collect additional tax on dividends, interest, and capital gains constitutes double taxation, thus violating the principle of taxing all income only once and at its source. This double taxation would be ended under the Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxing income only once at its source results in a tax cut at the upper end of the income scale, just as it results in a tax cut for lower- and middle-income households with income from interest, capital gains, and dividends. While nearly 34 percent of all dividends claimed as income goes to households with total incomes below $50,000 (largely households with retired taxpayers), the average dividend income reported by upper-income households is much greater: $37,695 for incomes of $200,000 and above as opposed to $2,050 for incomes of $50,000 or below.<sup>11</sup> Thus, the exclusion of this income from taxes paid by individuals has a greater effect on taxes paid by wealthy people than on taxes paid by people of more limited means.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Because businesses under Armey-Shelby would pay taxes on the income from which they make dividend and interest payments, it is correct to say that the taxes on these payments are withheld at the business level in much the same way that income taxes on wages and salaries currently are withheld at the business level. <a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a> shows the effects of this withholding on the tax liabilities of households.<sup>12</sup> The dividend and interest payments received by households in <a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a> have been taxed at the business level, and these taxes are added to the 17 percent Armey-Shelby taxes of <a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a>. A quick comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows who shoulders the burden of dividend and interest taxes. As income rises, the implicit burden of taxes on these forms of income also increases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is worth noting in this regard that corporate income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax. This increase largely offsets decreases in individual tax payments during the tax's two-year implementation period; Heritage's tax models currently estimate that taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from corporations will rise by $52 billion.
<P>

<b>Progressive Nature of the Flat Tax</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While it is certainly true that the flat tax as proposed by Representative Armey and Senator Shelby taxes income at one rate, the taxpayer and dependent exemption causes the actual rates paid by taxpayers to increase as incomes rise. For example, a single taxpayer without children and making $25,000 would be exempt from income tax on the first $11,350 and would pay a 17 percent tax on the remaining $13,650. The tax would be $2,321, or 9.3 percent of $25,000. If part of the $25,000 was dividend income, of course, tax already would have been taken out at the corporate level. A single taxpayer making $250,000 would pay a 17 percent tax on $238,650 under the Armey-Shelby bill. The tax would be $40,571, or 16.2 percent of total income. It is the presence of the exemption that makes the flat tax "progressive."<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Technical Note</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The data shown in Tables <a href="fyi90t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi90t2.gif">2</a> and <a href="fyi90c1.gif">Chart 1</a> are based on income tax records contained in the IRS Public Use File for 1991, a statistically accurate sample of all individual income tax returns for that year. The file contains 115,000 taxpaying households and 178 tax variables per household. When a variable is multiplied by its weight, the value of the variable equals its national total. Thus, the value of wage and salary income for a family earning $35,000 equals the national total for families in that income class when it is multiplied by its national weight. These are the same data the IRS's own Statistics of Income Division uses when preparing its annual analysis of taxpayers. They are the most accurate and complete tax data available for public use.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tax payments shown in Tables 1 and 2 include all of the kinds of taxable income that individuals now report on their annual 1040 tax form. Individuals currently report labor income (for example, wages and salaries) as well as business income from self-employment, trusts, partnerships, farming operations, and other business activities. However, the more prominent flat tax proposals make an important change in the way small business income is reported. Proposals similar to the Armey-Shelby bill separate labor income from business income and allow businesses to deduct from their gross income the costs of operations, the value of land and capital structures purchased during the year, and the wages and salaries paid to their employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This separation of labor income from business income makes comparing the current tax system with a flat tax system difficult. In order to compare current taxes fairly with those collected under a flat tax, we added together the flat taxes individuals would pay on their labor income and on their small business income. This combination is reported in the flat tax columns of Tables 1 and 2. Thus, both sets of numbers include taxes paid on labor and business income.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, with respect to the effect higher business taxes might have on low- and middle-income families, many tax analysts believe that higher business taxes mean higher prices for consumers. Low- and middle-income households have more difficulty paying higher prices than do wealthier households. Thus, these analysts argue that increases in business taxes that produce higher consumer prices really amount to regressive "tax" increases on those families least able to pay for them.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While there maybe some truth to this view, the measurement of the relationship between tax changes and price changes is very difficult. First, the flat tax is expected to reduce many of the costs business faces, most particularly the cost of capital. Thus, firms may decide not to pass along tax increases to consumers. Second, more than half of all businesses will see a tax decrease under the Armey-Shelby bill, which could result in lower consumer prices. Third, history shows that firms in competitive markets are less likely to charge consumers for tax increases than firms in regulated, uncompetitive markets. The Heritage Foundation will address this issue in a future paper.

<li>    While the tax reform proposal offered by Mr. Forbes uses the same tax rate as the fully implemented Armey-Shelby plan, the proposals are not identical. The Forbes plan, for instance, has a larger personal allowance.<P>
<li>    For a detailed description of our analysis, see the Technical Note at the end of this paper.<p>
<li>   Tables <a href="fyi90t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi90t2.gif">2</a> do not show the effect of any special rules to ease the transition from the current tax system to the Armey-Shelby flat tax. Thus, these tables probably overstate the amount of additional taxes some businesses would pay under a flat tax. For example, current tax policy requires businesses to depreciate their equipment purchases over a fixed period of time, often 15 years. Thus, many businesses have a large amount of unused depreciation that they have been carrying on their books as an asset. However, the Armey-Shelby flat tax does away with tax depreciation for capital equipment and replaces this policy with one that permits businesses to expense their purchases of land, structures, and equipment in the year that these items are purchased. To move from the current system to the Armey-Shelby flat tax means either writing off billions of dollars in accumulated depreciation or enacting a "transition rule" that would allow businesses to use accumulated depreciation for a few years as a deduction from gross sales. The Heritage Foundation is engaged in developing and analyzing such rules and will provide commentary on transition issues at a future date.<p>
<li>    Economists and sociologists for decades have been trying to reach agreement about what constitutes the middle class. We certainly will not attempt to enter that debate in this paper. However, broadly defining the middle class as single- and multi-person households with incomes between $30,000 and $100,000 probably includes what most analysts view as middle-class.<p>

Mitchell, "The Flat Tax Cuts Individual Income Taxes in Every State," Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi86.html"><I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 86</a>, February 7, 1996.<p>
<li>    Economists are beginning to publish analyses of how a flat tax would effect economic activity. One of the most important essays to appear so far is by Alan J. Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research. See Auerbach, "Tax Reform, Capital Allocation, Efficiency and Growth," paper presented at Brookings Conference on Fundamental Tax Reform, February 15-16, 1996.<p>
<li>   The Heritage Foundation has published a number of other papers on tax reform and on the flat tax specifically. See Daniel J. Mitchell, "Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1035, May 25, 1995, and Daniel J. Mitchell, "Which Tax Reform Plan Is Best for America?," Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1055</a>, September 26, 1995.<p>
<li>    The Heritage Foundation used the largest publicly available tax database to construct these estimates. The Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991 is a statistically significant sample of all of the individual income tax returns filed in 1991. Estimates of current average tax payments were calculated by applying the 1996 tax rates and bracket amounts to net taxable income. The estimates of flat tax liabilities were calculated using the provisions of the tax reform proposal advanced by the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Representative Richard Armey (R-TX), and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL). See <a
href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th?bill=(H ADJ R ADJ 2060)">H.R. 2060</a> and S. 1050.<p>
<li>    See Technical Note.<p>
<li>   For example, the family deduction for a single taxpayer is $11,350; for a married family of four, it is $33,300; and for a head of household with two children, it is $25,450. Only incomes greater than these amounts are taxable under the Armey-Shelby flat tax.<p>
<li>    See Internal Revenue Service, <I>Individual Income Tax Returns 1991</I>, Publication 1304 (Rev. 3/94), p. 28, Table 1.4, cols. 9 and 10.<p>
<li>    It is possible also to view taxes on capital gains as "withheld" taxes: The net present value of corporations is connected intimately to their ability to remain profitable while paying all of their taxes. However, households rather than businesses control the timing of capital gains realizations, which makes the analyst's job of estimating the business tax liabilities for capital gains exceptionally difficult. Thus, taxes on capital gains are not shown in Table 2. If they could be shown, the total tax liabilities of high-income households under a fully phased 17 percent flat tax would be even greater.<p>
<li>    Some advocates of the flat tax say that a taxpayer with 10 times the income pays 10 times more tax. Actually, the flat tax requires wealthier taxpayers to pay somewhat more than that, since the taxpayer and dependent deductions remain the same regardless of income level. In the above example, the richer taxpayer, who has 10 times more income, pays 17.2 times more tax than the poorer taxpayer.

<title>Key Changes Needed In the Governors' Medicaid Proposal - Heritage</title>

<h3>KEY CHANGES NEEDED IN THE GOVERNORS' MEDICAID PROPOSAL</h3>

F.Y.I. No. 89<br>
March 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The congressional leadership is drafting comprehensive Medicaid reform legislation based on a recent outline proposal endorsed unanimously by the National Governors Association (NGA). But unless the legislation differs sharply from the governors' outline in some critical details, it will be a disaster rather than a reform, preserving some of the worst features of today's Medicaid program while opening the door to another state-led raid on the U.S. Treasury. To avoid this, the legislation must make two crucial changes in the governors' plan: It must limit the categories of Americans guaranteed benefits and, even more important, must not include an open-ended state entitlement to "umbrella" funds.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The outline preamble calls explicitly for an end to the entitlement status of Medicaid and for the establishment of a block grant system of financing. But a close reading of the fine print in the governors' plan shows that the reverse is true. The plan actually sets out a federally defined list of guaranteed benefits for a large "guaranteed population" that would have an entitlement to these benefits. Moreover, the plan does not simply transform Medicaid into a block grant program, with a specific determination of the maximum amount of federal funds each state will receive (at a higher percentage than is typical today); that capitated amount will be only part of the funds flowing to states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The plan also contains an "umbrella insurance" provision to provide guaranteed additional money to states in the event of unanticipated growth in the eligible population. It states explicitly that "[t]hese funds are an entitlement to states and are not subject to annual appropriations" by Congress. Thus, state officials, who have shown themselves adept in the past at squeezing huge amounts of federal money out of the fine print of federal Medicaid law, would have unencumbered power to raid the federal treasury. Even the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which strongly opposes devolution of control to the states, warns that the umbrella mechanism "may create incentives for states to 'game' the system and consequently may result in substantial, unintended federal cost."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Keeping the Status Quo.</b> As drafted, the governors' outline retains a comprehensive list of government benefits for Medicaid's "guaranteed" populations.<sup>2</sup>  The groups eligible for this entitlement include: 
<p><ul>
<li> Pregnant women, to 133 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Children to age 6, to 133 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Children ages 6 through 12, to 100 percent of poverty; 
<p>
<li> Elderly who meet Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and resource standards; and
<p>
<li> Persons with disabilities as defined by the state in their state plan. 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of the 33.4 million Medicaid recipients in 1993, pregnant women and children living on income up to 133 percent of the government's official poverty level accounted for 71 percent, or 23.7 million, of the eligible population. Generally, these recipients also get cash assistance under other major welfare programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supple- mental Security Income (SSI). By mandating states to continue coverage for these individuals, as well as those falling into the two other major categories (elderly and disabled), the governors simply retain the mandatory entitlement features of Medicaid for the vast majority of existing beneficiaries -- features that have contributed to the explosive financial pressures on the Medicaid system. Given the uncapped status of the insurance umbrella, the governors' plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and costly entitlement feature of Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In maintaining a federal definition of which individuals will be guaranteed benefits, the governors seem also to have tied their own hands in reforming their own welfare programs. Since most welfare recipients are categorically entitled to Medicaid benefits, there would remain little incentive for individuals to seek employment with generally more limited insurance through the private sector. Worse, the governors will have neither true flexibility in administering Medicaid nor the ultimate authority in determining how best to provide quality care for their resident poor. It is to help meet the anticipated costs of maintaining federal eligibility and benefits requirements that the governors included an insurance umbrella provision, which will help them shift costs back to the federal taxpayers. That also is the flaw from the federal taxpayer's point of view.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Deficit Dangers.</b> The governors know that the current level of spending growth in Medicaid is unsustainable. While few consider the governors' proposal a step toward fiscal responsibility, the insurance umbrella described in their outline almost certainly would add to the federal deficit. The purpose of the umbrella is understandable: to protect individual states from unanticpated costs due to changes in the growth of their eligible populations. But it is crafted as an uncapped, open-ended entitlement "reserve" fund upon which the states can draw in emergencies, and the outline contains no measures to control federal spending once the provision is triggered. This directly contradicts both the principle and goal of a federal block grant program, and it would allow creative accountants in state government free rein to manipulate eligibility requirements and service levels to shift as much of their costs as possible to categories of people who would qualify for umbrella funds. Past experience with Medicaid shows that they would do so.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Rules and Mandates.</b> The nation's governors rightly criticize the red tape of Medicaid mandates with which states must comply in order to get federal matching funds. Moreover, these congressionally imposed requirements hamper state governments' ability to design and implement cost-efficient programs that target medically needy persons. Ironically, the governors' proposal still includes federally defined mandates; even though states would be given much more flexibility, these federally mandated eligibility and benefit requirements would supersede their own authority to decide how best to care for their poor residents.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The costs associated with federal mandates have not gone unnoticed by this Congress, which has sought to tackle the growing financial burden of an unreformed Medicaid program (an effort vetoed by President Clinton). While the overall cost of the program is rising rapidly, the federal share alone is projected to reach approximately $100 billion in FY 1996. Similarly, states are dedicating a growing percentage of their budgets to providing their residents access to health services. According to an analysis prepared for The Heritage Foundation, if no reforms in the Medicaid program are enacted, the states will have to spend $688 billion of their own money between 1995 and 2002 just to maintain the system as it is today.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<b>HOW TO FIX THE GOVERNORS' PLAN</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While the governors' proposal calls for much-needed flexibility and a long-overdue block grant approach to financing Medicaid, the NGA's plan itself would not pare back the entitlement feature of Medicaid sufficiently, and the umbrella feature, as currently designed, almost certainly would lead to an uncontrolled hemorrhaging of federal funds. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the governors' plan is to be turned into legislation that actually reforms Medicaid and introduces sensible spending control at the federal level, two crucial changes are necessary. Without them, the plan should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of the costly open-ended entitlement status of today's program. These two essential changes are:
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The guaranteed populations and benefits -- the entitlement -- should be sharply limited, and focused on politically weak groups traditionally ignored by the states, such as the homeless and those with severe mental illness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The umbrella should be a budgeted fund appropriated each year, not an entitlement to states. States do need protection from unanticipated changes that would make them vulnerable under a strict block grant, but this should be in the form of a fund voted on each year and distributed according to a formula devised by Congress to meet specific problems. It should not be a blank check to states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then Medicaid, like other federal programs, will require more, not less, fiscal discipline. In reforming Medicaid, lawmakers must make sure that the precise legislative language does not create a legal loophole for state officials who have acquired expertise in "gaming" the Medicaid program at the expense of federal taxpayers.

<title>Defending America: Ending America's Vulnerability to Ballistic Missiles - Heritage</title>

<h3>DEFENDING AMERICA: ENDING AMERICA'S VULNERABILITY TO BALLISTIC MISSILES</h3>


An Update by the Missile Defense Study Team ("Team B")<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1074<br>
March 15, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="bg1074t1.gif">Table 1</a>: Recommended Funding for Missile Defense Systems
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1995, The Heritage Foundation convened a Missile Defense Study Team to examine the growing threat of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Missile Defense Study Team, known as "Team B," released its report <I>Defending America: A Near- and Long-Term Plan to Deploy Missile Defenses</I>, in June 1995, recommending timely, affordable, and technically sound responses to the missile threat, in keeping with the congressional leadership's high priority on ballistic missile defense.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Subsequent events have only reinforced the importance of Team B's recommendations that an effective ballistic missile defense system be deployed at the earliest possible date. In fact, the need for a vigorous missile defense program is more acute than ever. Ballistic missiles carrying mass destructive warheads remain the only weapons that can seriously threaten the territory of the United States. Shorter range or theater ballistic missiles (TBMs) also threaten U.S. forces and bases abroad, and allies in key regions of the world, as potentially hostile states continue to develop weapons of mass destruction and seek to acquire missiles to deliver them.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In February 1991, an Iraqi Scud missile killed 29 American soldiers in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, the largest single loss of American life in the Persian Gulf War. Yet five years later, the U.S. still has no better defense against theater ballistic missiles than the <I>Patriot</I>. To be sure, the <I>Patriot</I> did good service in the Gulf War, helping to neutralize the potential impact of Iraq's Scud arsenal. But it was designed originally as an air defense, not an anti-missile system, and its ability to defend a wide area or population center from ballistic missile attack was deliberately limited.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), contrary to what most Americans believe. If an ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of Americans. In 1983, President Reagan began the Strategic Defense Initiative to end this utter vulnerability to the world's most terrible weapons. Yet the nation is no better protected from missile attack in 1996 than it was in 1983. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B considered this needless vulnerability in the context of the missile threat to the American people and to their forces, bases, and allies overseas. Team B concluded, unlike the Clinton Administration, that the threat is clear, present, and growing; and that it demands an urgent response.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As the least expensive and most effective solution to this global problem, <I>Defending America</I> recommended accelerated deployment of global wide-area defenses -- at sea within the next three to four years and in space by early in the next decade. These initiatives would restore key ballistic missile defense programs that the Clinton Administration sharply curtailed or canceled in 1993. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A year after the release of the Team B study, the United States remains undefended despite the best efforts of some Members of the 104th Congress -- and will likely remain undefended if the Administration's current policies prevail. Because missile defense remains a vital but unfulfilled national security requirement, The Heritage Foundation asked Team B to reconvene and take a look at what the Clinton Administration and Congress have done -- or failed to do -- to defend America. Team B has revalidated its basic approach of 1995, but also has concluded that the lack of progress in protecting Americans from ballistic missiles warrants this updated report in conjunction with the reissue of <I>Defending America</I>. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consequently, The Heritage Foundation is reissuing the Team B report along with this update, which reviews events of the past year that affect the missile defense effort, analyzes the negative impact of recent Clinton Administration missile defense program decisions, and discusses in more detail the Clinton Administration's negotiations with Russia on re-interpreting the ABM Treaty and extending the Treaty's limits to key theater defense systems.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In this update, Team B offers a number of new recommendations to adjust to delays and negative developments in the missile defense program in the past year. The main conclusions are summarized as follows: 
<p><ul>
<li> Congress, and the U.S. Senate in particular, should seek ways to remove the obstacles to effective missile defenses posed by the ABM Treaty, including possible withdrawal from the treaty as the U.S. is entitled to do under Article XV.
<P>
<li> Congress should forego development of ground-based systems for national missile defense and accelerate deployment of sea-based, wide-area defenses. Without artificial performance constraints or limits imposed by the ABM Treaty, this system could counter threats against the U.S. homeland as well as regional threats from theater missiles, beginning by the year 2000. 
<p>

<li> Congress should accelerate the deployment of space-based sensors to enhance the effectiveness of both theater and national missile defense.
<p>
<li> Congress should direct the Air Force to develop follow-on space-based defenses, both kinetic energy interceptors and space-based lasers, to begin deployment early in the next decade. 
<p>
<li> Congress should ensure the Ballistic Missile Defense Office develops an integrated but open architecture for battle management, command, control, and communications to support missile defense systems.
</ul><p>
<b>WHAT TEAM B PROPOSED IN 1995</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1995, The Heritage Foundation Missile Defense Study Team proposed improvements or renewed emphasis in several missile defense program areas, in particular:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Sea-Based Wide-Area Defense.</b> Because the Navy already has invested almost $50 billion in its AEGIS cruisers and their infrastructure, modifications or modernization of the software, battle management system, and interceptors for the missile defense mission would cost only about $1 billion. The U.S. could then begin deploying defenses on AEGIS-equipped naval vessels by the end of this decade. For an investment of $2-3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 AEGIS cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile defense capability for the U.S. and for American forces and allies overseas. Team B pointed out that these highly mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas, provided the full technological capability of the Navy missile defense system was not arbitrarily constrained or artificially compromised.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Brilliant Eyes Sensor System.</b> Team B recommended accelerating the <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space-based sensor to begin deployment by as early as 1999. This system would enhance the capability of all wide-area defense interceptor systems, wherever based.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Space-Based Defenses.</b> Team B recommended reviving space-based defense programs canceled by the Clinton Administration to provide deployment options beginning early in the next decade. This approach would be the most effective long-term defense to protect the American homeland and to counter advanced theater ballistic missiles.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>ABM Treaty Limits.</b> Team B also recommended that defenses for America and American troops, bases, and allies overseas be built without arbitrarily restraining systems to comply with the outdated ABM Treaty. Codifying the Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) strategy of the Cold War, the ABM Treaty no longer makes sense in a multipolar world of proliferating nuclear powers.
<P>
<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON MISSILE DEFENSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Team B members are dismayed at the extent to which the Administration has undermined the ability of the United States to defend itself against the growing threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. It is a widely acknowledged characteristic of President Clinton and officials in his Administration that they say one thing and do another. Nowhere is this disingenuousness more evident than the Administration's position on weapons of mass destruction and their principal delivery systems -- ballistic missiles. 
<p>
<b>The Administration's Declaratory Policy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On November 14, 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12938, declaring in part that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering such weapons constitutes "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States," and that he therefore had decided to "declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."  A year later, on November 15, 1995, he issued a notice of the continuation of this "Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction."  This is a clear and indisputable evaluation of the immediate danger to the U.S. and its interests posed by "the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the means of delivering such systems."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite this clear and unequivocal statement of U.S. policy, President Clinton vetoed the FY 1996 Defense Authorization Act on December 28, 1995. This legislation contained missile defense provisions intended specifically to meet the threat from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems. President Clinton based his veto primarily on his objection to the missile defense language in the Act, which called for defending all 50 American states by early in the next decade. According to the President, this would be a "costly defense system" against a threat that the "intelligence community does not foresee in the coming decade."  His veto message asserted that the missile defense provisions would "also jeopardize our efforts to agree on an ABM/TMD demarcation with the Russian Federation." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defense Secretary William Perry said on September 20, 1994, when announcing the results of the Clinton Administration's nuclear posture review, that his "number one priority is to put MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction) behind us for good, to replace it with Mutual Assured Safety."  But on May 10, 1995, President Clinton joined Russian President Boris Yeltsin in declaring the ABM Treaty -- which is based on MAD -- a "cornerstone of strategic stability."  Indeed, the Clinton Administration's theological commitment to the ABM Treaty is so strong that it refuses to exploit U.S. technological advantages to build the most effective defenses -- which are also the least costly defenses -- to protect the American people and their overseas troops, friends, and allies.
<p>
<b>More Administration Inconsistency</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Secretary Perry is as inconsistent as his commander in chief. On January 31, 1996, he told the Hoover Institution Board of Overseers that "we are pursuing, in my judgment, robustly, vigorously, a so-called theater missile defense program [which] will give us the capability of defending U.S. forces and U.S. allies against medium-range ballistic missiles. We are moving toward deployment -- the production and deployment of this system on a high-priority schedule where the first of the new generation of such defenses will begin their deployment in a few years."  In a press conference on February 16, the Secretary announced the results of a six-month Pentagon review of plans to defend the American people and their troops, friends, and allies overseas, stating: "I have no higher obligation as Secretary of Defense than to protect our forces and our territory. This program responds to threats as they develop, combines current and evolving technology to face today's threat and will enable us to develop new technologies to face tomorrow's threat from longer range missiles."<sup>2 </sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nevertheless, the content if not the rhetoric of the February 16 announcement was contrary to the clear intent of Congress, which last year increased the Administration's budget request for missile defense and directed that key programs be accelerated.<sup>3</sup>  Instead, the Clinton Administration has decided to slow these programs while cutting 15 percent from its previously planned budget -- a budget that already had been cut by about 60 percent below the missile defense plan of the Bush Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defense experts who were not misled by the responsible-sounding statements in Mr. Perry's February 16 press briefing realize that even the Administration's vaunted commitment to theater missile defense is highly questionable. Secretary Perry announced cuts in funding for both the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Navy's AEGIS-based wide-area defense and proposed to delay deployment for both indefinitely -- in spite of congressional direction to deploy these two systems by 1999. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Furthermore, the Administration has decided to delay for at least three years a decision to deploy any defense of the American people, a delay that will most likely prove to be indefinite if the Clinton Administration continues in office beyond January 1997. The Administration has canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive defenses. It is even stretching out development of the programs it is supporting, thereby increasing total system costs. It has reoriented the theater defense programs to the least capable systems, providing only limited protection to overseas troops, friends, and allies and denying the American people the inherent capability that would be afforded by fully exploiting modern technology.<sup>4</sup>  Similarly, deployment of <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space sensors was delayed at least six months while the Administration reviewed how to proceed. In short, the net effect of the Clinton Administration's policies and statements is to undermine deployment of effective theater and national missile defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These developments, apparent from the headlines of press reports from the briefing given on the Friday afternoon before a long holiday weekend,<sup>5</sup> are at sharp variance with last year's Team B report, which concluded that the threat is clear, present and growing. The factual evidence presented in <I>Defending America</I> demonstrated in particular that worldwide defenses against longer range missiles are urgently needed to counter blackmail threats that could limit U.S. involvement in future regional crises involving U.S. national interests. This kind of blackmail was illustrated recently when a Chinese official threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the U.S. interfered with China's feud with Taiwan.<sup>6</sup>  And on March 8, 1996, China conducted missile firing tests offshore near Taiwan's two largest cities as part of an ongoing campaign to intimidate Taiwan. These missile "tests" amounted to a <I>de facto</I> blockade, and further dramatized the use of ballistic missiles as weapons of coercive diplomacy as well as weapons of war.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The incoherence of the Administration's position on missile defense is further revealed by its handling of theater defenses, which it continues to claim are "first priority."  Seeking funds in a shrinking defense budget to offset shortfalls in other procurement accounts, the Administration is slowing its own theater defense program on the grounds that there is no imminent threat.<sup>7</sup>  Yet America's top commander in South Korea, General Gary Luck, asked that the THAAD (Theater High Altitude Area Defense) system be expedited to replace the Patriot system in light of growing tensions with North Korea. But General John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, justified turning down General Luck and delaying THAAD because, in his view, there is no new threat from North Korean missiles.<sup>8</sup>  Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away -- which would include all of the capitals of Europe.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The need for wide-area defenses -- surpassing the capability of THAAD -- could not be clearer. Short-range interceptors like <I>Patriot</I> and the Navy Lower Tier emphasized by the Clinton Administration will be ineffective against 2,000-mile-range ballistic missiles. They will have difficulty defeating even the Gulf War Scud, which broke up on reentry and became very hard to hit as its warhead "cork-screwed" its way toward the Earth. Neither of these theater systems currently being pursued by the Clinton Administration will be at all effective against missiles that release their warheads shortly after their boost phase, while they are rising in rocket-powered flight from their launchers. Yet there are reports that such missiles might be developed and "on the world market within the next five years."<sup>10</sup>  Thus, the missile threat demonstrably continues to grow and the Clinton Administration continues to resist committing the needed resources to protect the American people, their forward-deployed forces, and their allies. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's relaxed view of the threat and its inconsistent actions on missile defense are neither prudent nor responsible. It has become regrettably clear that the Clinton Administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy. The President has created a political environment in which words mean nothing, in which the Administration's policy declarations merely conceal the failure to protect Americans against ballistic missiles. The Administration's actions over the past year demonstrate that the American people cannot depend upon the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow.
<p>
<b>ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE 1995 TEAM B REPORT</b>
<p>
<b>The President's Veto of the Defense Authorization Bill</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In crafting the missile defense provisions of the FY 1996 defense authorization bill, the congressional defense committees focused on limited, ABM Treaty-compliant, ground-based systems for the homeland defense mission. Team B recognizes that staunch supporters of missile defense in Congress chose to focus on ground-based defenses in order to garner the majority needed to pass the defense authorization bill. It was a tactical judgment call designed to "move the ball forward" toward actual deployment of National Missile Defense (NMD), even if only a few yards, and the bill as passed did direct the Clinton Administration to deploy, early in the next decade, a defense for the American homeland.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But on December 28, 1995, President Clinton vetoed the bill precisely because it mandated defending the American people by early in the next decade. The majority that had coalesced around a less than optimum NMD program was not sufficient to override the President's veto, and Congress was forced to strip out the offending section so that the defense authorization bill could be signed into law.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While this was a severe setback for the defense of the United States, at least it clarified the missile defense debate. It is now clear that the Clinton Administration and the majority of the Democrats in Congress, who would not vote to override the veto, are willing to risk leaving the American people vulnerable to attack by even a single ballistic missile.
<p>
<b>"Explaining Away" the Need for Missile Defense</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat develops. In line with these assumptions, the Administration has structured a National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program. Over the next three years, it would develop components of an ABM Treaty-compliant ground-based defense which, in turn, could be deployed in another three years if, in the President's view, developments warrant it. It therefore intends to provide no defense for the American people before 2003 at the earliest. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles. One wonders whether the Clinton Administration believes it is "politically incorrect" to call attention to such possibilities. Furthermore, authoritative Administration officials testified to Congress last year that rogue states could threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- or sooner if they chose to accelerate their development plans.<sup>12</sup>  Several Senators and Congressmen have expressed concern that the Clinton Administration politicized a recent National Intelligence Estimate so as to suggest a lesser threat to the United States than indicated in this previous testimony.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>The ABM Treaty -- or an ABM/TMD Treaty?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last year Team B recommended an honest appraisal of the impediments to effective missile defense, including theater defense, posed by the 1972 ABM Treaty. To its great credit, the congressional leadership has sought throughout the past year to prevent Clinton negotiators from negotiating arbitrary constraints on theater missile defense systems that were never supposed to be limited by the ABM Treaty.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the Clinton Administration appears committed to "strengthening" this treaty. In talks to determine the demarcation between permitted theater defenses and ABM Treaty-limited strategic defenses, the Administration reportedly has accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater defenses, including the Navy wide-area system. Only Russian recalcitrance and over-reaching in seeking greater restraints on theater missile defense have prevented consummation of the agreement and converting the ABM Treaty into an ABM-TMD treaty. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In demonstrating such a slavish adherence to a narrow interpretation of the ABM Treaty, the Administration in effect is binding the U.S. unilaterally to perceived rather than real treaty constraints. This theological devotion to the treaty has resulted in deliberate "dumbing down" of theater defense designs rather than making the systems as capable as available technology will permit. For example, the Navy wide-area defense is not being designed to exploit high velocity interceptors or external sensor data to maximize its reach, because that capability also would enable the system to defend the United States.<sup>15</sup>  The THAAD system is not being allowed to use any external sensor data to extend its reach and effectiveness.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the President's promise to "work closely with the Congress," he has largely ignored the concerns of Congress in favor of accommodating Russian demands to limit U.S. missile defenses through a renegotiated ABM Treaty. But Members of Congress are becoming increasingly disturbed at the Administration's position. Late last year, Representative Martin Hoke (R-OH) introduced a bill directing the Administration to exercise its rights to withdraw from the ABM Treaty,<sup>16</sup> though it has not yet been debated. More recently, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), introduced a similar bill in the Senate.<sup>17</sup> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 With these bills pending, the stage is set for hearings and a serious debate in both the Senate and the House on these issues vital to the nation's security. If the Administration expands the ABM Treaty to cover advanced theater systems and also agrees to "multi-lateralize" the treaty by including the states of the former Soviet Union, it will be making substantive changes in the treaty. These changes must come before the Senate for its consent. Otherwise, the Senate's constitutional prerogatives in treaty-making will be undermined, as will national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It has become manifestly clear that no effective defense of the American people can be built consistent with ABM Treaty limits. And if the Administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be built either. The Administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending Americans.
<p>
<b>TEAM B RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B believes the congressional leadership, having made clear its fundamental differences with the Administration, should press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-term defenses technically achievable. Moreover, Team B concludes that the ABM Treaty must be dealt with in a manner consistent with these primary objectives. Recommendations to meet the latest developments are to:
<p><ul>
<li> Review the Clinton Administration's ballistic missile threat assessment and direct a more prudent approach to accelerate the development of appropriate responses;
<p>
<li> Review the role of the ABM Treaty in artificially limiting the development of the most effective defenses now technologically feasible and direct that the most effective, affordable near-term defenses be developed unconstrained by the ABM Treaty and then deployed at an accelerated pace;
<p>
<li> Use all available congressional powers and prerogatives to move the U.S. toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months' notice, which it has the right to do under Article XV;
<p>
<li> Redirect last year's consensus objective of deploying ground-based U.S. homeland defenses by 2003 and focus it instead on beginning deployment of sea-based wide-area defenses by the year 2000, unconstrained by the ABM Treaty;
<p>
<li> Direct the Air Force to accelerate deployment of <I>Brilliant Eyes</I> space-based sensors beginning as early as 1999, to enhance the effectiveness of both theater and U.S. homeland defenses;
<p>
<li> Direct the Air Force to develop follow-on space-based defenses -- both kinetic-energy interceptors and space-based lasers -- for deployment early in the next decade;
<p>
<li> Direct the Army to focus its efforts on developing and deploying ground-based theater missile defenses to support overseas U.S. troops and allies; restore the $2 billion recently removed by the Administration from the multi-year THAAD budget; and re-establish 2000 as the initial deployment date;
<p>
<li> Direct the Ballistic Missile Defense Office to assure development of an integrated but open architecture for the battle management, command, control, and communications to support these defense systems.
</ul><p>
<b>Revised Spending Plan</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress's failure to override the President's veto of the FY 1996 defense bill demonstrates the futility of pursuing relatively expensive yet less effective ground-based national missile defenses in the hope of getting at least some anti-missile protection deployed. Team B believes Congress instead should direct the accelerated development and deployment of the most effective sea-based and space-based wide-area defenses. Developing a boost-phase intercept capability with these and other systems also should be a high priority. These systems also will defend American forces and allies abroad, reducing the requirements for ground-based theater missile defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This approach will require that missile defense funds, including those already appropriated and those currently being applied to the Clinton Administration's so-called 3+3 Deployment Readiness Program, be spent instead on sea- and space-based defense programs. The highest priority should be assigned to deploying the Navy wide-area defense beginning in the year 2000. This would provide the earliest U.S. homeland defense. Evolutionary improvements to increase its effectiveness should occur as the relevant technologies mature. This is needed to maximize the system's ability to protect the U.S. homeland. Second, the development of space-based sensors and space-based defenses, both kinetic-energy interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="bg1074t1.gif">Table 1</a> provides recommended funding levels, including additional funds in 1996 which can be accommodated by reprogramming funds already appropriated under the National Missile Defense program element from ground-based defenses to sea- and space-based defenses. (The recommended funding is consistent with last year's Team B report, given that six months of FY 1996 already have been lost.)
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As discussed in last year's Team B report, the out-year funding needed for space-based systems will depend on development activities during the next three years. However, Team B continues to believe that the two space-based defense systems are complementary. In fact, for a given effectiveness against advanced threats, it can be shown that the least expensive space-based defense involves both. With the necessary funding, deployment can begin shortly after the year 2000. For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This recommendation to forego continued commitment to a ground-based defense for protection of the U.S. homeland is intended to address the inherent shortcomings of ground-based systems discussed in the 1995 Team B report. In short, they can be overcome by likely countermeasures, they are expensive, and they are difficult to deploy in peacetime -- even more so in crisis or war. The Clinton Administration suggests that a very limited "ABM Treaty compliant" single site defense might cost less than $5 billion.<sup>18</sup>  Team regards this as a waste of scarce missile defense dollars. Such a significant expenditure of funds on relatively ineffective ground-based defenses will only delay building urgently needed, more effective, and less expensive sea-based and space-based defenses. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Team B recommends that FY 1996 funds for National Missile Defense (NMD) be redirected from the ground-based NMD program now planned toward accelerating more effective and less expensive sea-based and space-based wide area defense programs. Future NMD funds should be directed toward providing evolutionary technical improvements to the initial Navy wide-area defense system in order to give it the most capable performance against the full spectrum of future threats to the United States. The NMD budget line should also include about $150 million per year to continue programs to defeat countermeasures and support critical sensor programs that will enhance the midcourse intercept capability of all defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The recommended funding for the technology line would restore key efforts against likely countermeasures. The most important countermeasure anticipated in the relatively near future is a "clustered submunition" that disperses numerous warheads shortly after a missile's boost phase is completed. This countermeasure would overcome the limited theater missile defenses currently being developed by the Clinton Administration. To defeat it would require a boost-phase defense -- that is, destroying the entire missile/warhead package before the submunitions can be released. But all boost-phase defenses that could be deployed in the near term were canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993. Restoring them therefore should receive high priority. The funding recommended above should be sufficient for a technology demonstration within three years of a high-acceleration boost-phase interceptor like the <I>Raptor Talon</I> concept.
<p>
<b>The Final Hurdle: The ABM Treaty</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Team B again recommends that Congress do all within its power to restrain the Clinton Administration's penchant for negotiating additional treaty limits on U.S. defenses. Instead, the U.S. should indicate clearly to the Russians that the U.S. intends to provide effective wide area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops, friends, and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russia's agreement. However, the U.S. should be explicitly clear that unless Russia begins to cooperate immediately, it will exercise its right to withdraw from the ABM Treaty and proceed to build defenses unilaterally.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It should be obvious to any competent U.S. negotiator that the Russians will agree only if they believe that the U.S. is prepared to proceed unilaterally. The best way to move in this direction is to announce that the strategic situation has changed significantly since the ABM Treaty was negotiated in 1972 and that, because the new world disorder presents a number of potential threats to America's supreme interests, the U.S. intends to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. If the treaty no longer serves America's national security interests, the U.S. has every right to withdraw, and this right is made clear in Article XV. Once this step is taken the U.S. should proceed to build the effective defenses recommended above as quickly as possible.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration refuses to give serious consideration to building an effective missile defense program, whether to protect the U.S. homeland or U.S. troops abroad. Team B continues to recommend that global defenses be deployed urgently -- initially from the sea and then from space. These are the least expensive and most effective defenses possible, and the U.S. can begin their deployment by the end of the decade if it has the political will to do so. As Team B concluded in 1995, the ultimate issue in the missile defense debate is not technology, nor even cost, but political will.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The test of the nation's political will to defend itself -- and a test of the U.S. Senate's determination to defend its constitutional prerogatives -- will be in dealing with the 1972 ABM Treaty. Some in Congress and the defense community believe the ABM Treaty is not a near-term problem; they think dealing with the treaty can be deferred to some distant future. But they are wrong. The ABM Treaty is stifling the development of today's most capable and effective defense systems and perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases, and allies overseas. Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests. Team B believes that U.S. supreme interests are threatened by realities that are fundamentally different from those of the Cold War. The time has come for the U.S. to exercise its Article XV right and, as a matter of supreme national interest, withdraw from the ABM Treaty and build the needed defenses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution confers on the U.S. Congress the power and the duty to "provide for the common Defence."  This entails the raising, support, and regulation of the nation's armed forces. In other words, Congress shares the responsibility for national security with the President, the commander in chief. This shared but direct responsibility for the security of the nation is an important element of the constitutional system of checks and balances.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind a smokescreen of positive sounding but meaningless policy declarations. It is now clear that the Clinton Administration will remain derelict in the duties required of the office of the commander in chief by failing to provide for the common defense. Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executive's dereliction of duty by pressing for the most capable and effective missile defense technology permits. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Someday soon, it is a near certainty that U.S. forces abroad, and possibly even the U.S. homeland, will come under ballistic missile attack. Such an attack may occur with missiles carrying chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. If that day comes, the American people will hold responsible all those in positions of public trust who failed to carry out their constitutional and moral duty.

<li>    It is commonly though incorrectly assumed that the technology is most mature for ground-based defenses because such defenses have been under development longest, and that such defenses are the least expensive. In fact, effective wide-area defenses can be deployed sooner at sea and in space. Contrary to conventional wisdom, advances in technology have been flowing from research on space-based systems to ground-based systems, not the other way around. Finally, as discussed in the 1995 Team B report, sea-based and space-based defenses would be far less expensive and more effective in providing the needed wide-area defensive coverage.<p>

 <li>   Over the past year, at least seven letters from the congressional leadership have directed the Clinton Administration to cease its efforts to limit theater and U.S. homeland defenses and to "multilateralize" the ABM Treaty -- even to halt the negotiations that seem determined to proceed in this direction despite repeated statements of congressional concern. See, for example, Bill Gertz, "Deal With Russia Could Hamper Missile Defenses," <I>The Washington Times</I>, December 4, 1995. In one of the most recent letters, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and 12 chairmen of defense and foreign affairs committees and subcommittees wrote President Clinton on February 12, 1996, expressing their strong objections to continuing negotiations with Russia that "will impede our ability to defend America and its interests" and indicating their intent to hold related hearings in the near future.<p>
<li>    Then Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch explained to the Navy League on April 13, 1995, that the Clinton Administration's version of the Navy Upper Tier -- or wide area -- defense was treaty-compliant because it was constrained to use only data from the SPY-1 radar co-located with its interceptors. See Bill Gertz, "Navy Missile Defense Shouldn't Be Issue In Talks," <I>The Washington Times</I>, April 14, 1995, p. A3. What he did not reveal was that this constraint, especially in conjunction with the interceptor velocity limits being discussed with the Russians, limits the Navy system's effectiveness as a theater defense system and precludes it from having a capability to defend the U.S.<p>
 <li>  Kerry Gildee, "Bill Introduced in House Calls for U.S. to Abandon ABM Treaty," <I>Defense Daily</I>, October 18, 1995, p. 77.<p>
<li>   Bill Gertz, "Helms Wants U.S. Out of ABM Treaty," <I>The Washington Times</I>, February 7, 1996, p. A3.<p>
 <li>   The least expensive (perhaps $2-3 billion) and nearest term (perhaps within four years) ground-based defense would involve modifying Minuteman missiles and command and control software to exploit the current Minuteman infrastructure. However, this system would have limited capability against only a few missiles (in his April 27, 1995, testimony before the House Budget Committee, Defense Secretary Perry acknowledged that a defense would be needed against several times this number -- i.e. 10-20 warheads; on September 28, 1995, he told the Regional Commerce and Growth Association of St. Louis, Missouri, that a reasonable attack to design against would include "several dozen missiles"). There are likely to be substantial operational constraints (how would the U.S. persuade Russia that Minuteman defensive missiles launched at North Korean missiles were not Minuteman offensive missiles launched at Russia?), and these missiles would be less effective than sea-based wide-area defenses that could be deployed as soon for the same price -- and defend American overseas troops, friends, and allies as well.<p>
<li>    During the past year, bills that support this policy have been introduced in the Senate by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) and in the House by Representative Martin Hoke (R-OH). Hearings and floor debate could be very useful in firming up a clear U.S. policy regarding the need to move beyond the ABM Treaty and build effective defenses that increase the security of the U.S. and its friends and allies in the post-Cold War world.
