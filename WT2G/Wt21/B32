    Members shall encourage pre-shipment inspection entities and exporters
mutually to resolve their disputes. However, two working days after
submission of the grievance in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph&#160;21 of Article&#160;2, either party may refer the dispute to
independent review. Members shall take such reasonable measures as may be
available to them to ensure that the following procedures are established and
maintained to this end:<p>
(a)    these procedures shall be administered by an independent entity
constituted jointly by an organization representing pre-shipment inspection
entities and an organization representing exporters for the purposes of this
Agreement;<p> (b)    the independent entity referred to in
subparagraph&#160;(a) shall establish a list of experts as follows:<p> (i)
a section of members nominated by an organization representing pre-shipment
inspection entities;<p>
(ii)    a section of members nominated by an organization representing
exporters;<p>(iii)    a section of independent trade experts, nominated by
the independent entity referred to in subparagraph&#160;(a). <p> The
geographical distribution of the experts on this list shall be such as to
enable any disputes raised under these procedures to be dealt with
expeditiously. This list shall be drawn up within two months of the entry
into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000302100086"></a><a href="20.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000303200078"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement and shall be updated annually. The list shall
be publicly available. It shall be notified to the Secretariat and circulated
to all Members;<p> (c)    an exporter or pre-shipment inspection entity
wishing to raise a dispute shall contact the independent entity referred to
in subparagraph&#160;(a) and request the formation of a panel. The
independent entity shall be responsible for establishing a panel. This panel
shall consist of three members. The members of the panel shall be chosen so
as to avoid unnecessary costs and delays. The first member shall be chosen
from section&#160;(i) of the above list by the pre shipment inspection entity
concerned, provided that this member is not affiliated to that entity.  The
second member shall be chosen from section&#160;(ii) of the above list by the
exporter concerned, provided that this member is not affiliated to that
exporter. The third member shall be chosen from section&#160;(iii) of the
above list by the independent entity referred to in subparagraph&#160;(a). No
objections shall be made to any independent trade expert drawn from
section&#160;(iii) of the above list;<p>
(d)    the independent trade expert drawn from section&#160;(iii) of the
above list shall serve as the chairman of the panel. The independent trade
expert shall take the necessary decisions to ensure an expeditious settlement
of the dispute by the panel, for instance, whether the facts of the case
require the panelists to meet and, if so, where such a meeting shall take
place, taking into account the site of the inspection in question;<p> (e)
if the parties to the dispute so agree, one independent trade expert could be
selected from section&#160;(iii) of the above list by the independent entity
referred to in subparagraph&#160;(a) to review the dispute in question. This
expert shall take the necessary decisions to ensure an expeditious settlement
of the dispute, for instance taking into account the site of the inspection
in question;<p> (f)    the object of the review shall be to establish
whether, in the course of the inspection in dispute, the parties to the
dispute have complied with the provisions of this Agreement. The procedures
shall be expeditious and provide the opportunity for both parties to present
their views in person or in writing; <p> (g)    decisions by a three-member
panel shall be taken by majority vote. The decision on the dispute shall be
rendered within eight working days of the request for independent review and
be communicated to the parties to the dispute. This time-limit could be
extended upon agreement by the parties to the dispute. The panel or
independent trade expert shall apportion the costs, based on the merits of
the case;<p> (h)    the decision of the panel shall be binding upon the

<h1>
AGREEMENT ON SAFEGUARDS </h1>
<p><p>
<i>Members,</i><p>    <i>Having</i> in mind the overall objective of the
Members to improve and strengthen the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000387900031"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INTERNATIONALTRADINGSYSTEM"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>international trading system based on
GATT&#160;1994;<p>    <i>Recognizing</i> the need to clarify and reinforce the
disciplines of GATT&#160;1994, and specifically those of its Article&#160;XIX
(Emergency Action on Imports of Particular Products), to re-establish
multilateral control over safeguards and eliminate measures that escape such
control;<p>    <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of structural adjustment and
the need to enhance rather than limit competition in international markets;
and<p>    <i>Recognizing</i> further that, for these purposes, a
comprehensive agreement, applicable to all Members and based on the basic
principles of GATT&#160;1994, is called for;<p> Hereby <i>agree</i> as follows:<p>

<h2>
Article&#160;1 </h2><h2>
General Provision </h2>
     This Agreement establishes rules for the application of safeguard
measures which shall be understood to mean those measures provided for in
Article&#160;XIX of GATT 1994.<p><h2> Article 2 </h2><h2> Conditions </h2>
1.  A <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000389300006"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBEROFCUSTOMSUNION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Member of a customs union may apply a safeguard measure as a single
unit or on behalf of a member State. When a customs union applies a safeguard
measure as a single unit, all the requirements for the determination of
serious injury or threat thereof under this Agreement shall be based on the
conditions existing in the customs union as a whole. When a safeguard measure
is applied on behalf of a member State, all the requirements for the
determination of serious injury or threat thereof shall be based on the
conditions existing in that member State and the measure shall be limited to
that member State. Nothing in this Agreement prejudges the interpretation of
the relationship between Article&#160;XIX and paragraph&#160;8 of
Article&#160;XXIV of GATT 1994.

may apply a safeguard measure to a product only if that Member has
determined, pursuant to the provisions set out below, that such product is
being imported into its territory in such increased quantities, absolute or
relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or
threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like
or directly competitive products.<p> 2.    Safeguard measures shall be
applied to a product being imported irrespective of its source.<p>

<h2>
Article&#160;3 </h2><h2>
Investigation </h2>
1.    A Member may apply a safeguard measure only following an investigation
by the competent authorities of that Member pursuant to procedures previously
established and made public in consonance with Article&#160;X of GATT&#160;1994.
This investigation shall include reasonable <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000389900083"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PUBLICNOTICE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>public notice to all interested
parties and public hearings or other appropriate means in which importers,
exporters and other interested parties could present evidence and their
views, including the opportunity to respond to the presentations of other
parties and to submit their views, <i>inter&#160;alia</i>, as to whether or
not the application of a safeguard measure would be in the public interest.
The competent authorities shall publish a report setting forth their findings
and reasoned conclusions reached on all pertinent issues of fact and law.<p>
2.    Any information which is by nature confidential or which is provided on a confidential basis shall, upon
cause being shown, be treated as such by the competent authorities. Such
information shall not be disclosed without permission of the party submitting
it. Parties providing confidential information may be requested to furnish
non-confidential summaries thereof or, if such parties indicate that such
information cannot be summarized, the reasons why a summary cannot be
provided. However, if the competent authorities find that a request for
confidentiality is not warranted and if the party concerned is either
unwilling to make the information public or to authorize its disclosure in
generalized or summary form, the authorities may disregard such information
unless it can be demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources
that the information is correct.<p><h2> Article 4 </h2><h2> Determination of
Serious Injury or Threat Thereof </h2> 1.    For the purposes of this
Agreement:<p> (a)    "serious injury" shall be understood to mean a
significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry;<p> (b)
"threat of serious injury" shall be understood to mean serious injury that is
clearly imminent, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph&#160;2. A
determination of the existence of a threat of serious injury shall be based
on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility;
and<p>
(c)    in determining injury or threat thereof, a "domestic industry" shall
be understood to mean the producers as a whole of the like or directly
competitive products operating within the territory of a Member, or those
whose collective output of the like or directly competitive products
constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000390800115"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PRODUCTIONOFPRODUCTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production of those
products.<p> 2.    (a)    In the investigation to determine whether increased
imports have caused or are  threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic
industry under the terms of this Agreement, the competent authorities shall
evaluate all relevant factors of an objective  and quantifiable nature having a bearing on the situation of that
industry, in particular, the rate and amount of the increase in imports of
the product concerned in absolute and relative terms, the share of the
domestic market taken by increased imports, changes in the level of sales,
production, productivity, capacity utilization, profits and losses, and
employment.<p> (b)    The determination referred to in subparagraph&#160;(a)
    shall not be made unless this investigation demonstrates, on the basis of
objective evidence, the existence of the causal link between increased
imports of the product concerned and serious injury or threat thereof. When
factors other than increased imports are causing injury to the domestic
industry at the same time, such injury shall not be attributed to increased
imports.<p> (c)    The competent authorities shall publish promptly, in
accordance with the provisions of Article&#160;3, a detailed analysis of the
case under investigation as well as a demonstration of the relevance of the
factors examined.<p><h2> Article&#160;5 </h2><h2> Application of Safeguard
Measures </h2> 1.    A Member shall apply safeguard measures only to the
extent necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate
adjustment. If a quantitative restriction is used, such a measure shall not
reduce the quantity of imports below the level of a recent period which shall
be the average of imports in the last three representative years for which
statistics are available, unless clear justification is given that a
different level is necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury. Members
should choose measures most suitable for the achievement of these
objectives.<p> 2.    (a)    In cases in which a quota is allocated among
supplying countries, the Member applying the restrictions may seek agreement
with respect to the allocation of shares in the quota with all other Members
having a substantial interest in supplying the product concerned. In cases in
which this method is not reasonably practicable, the Member concerned shall
allot to Members having a substantial interest in supplying the product
shares based upon the proportions, supplied by such Members during a previous
representative period, of the total quantity or value of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000391700189"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000391800140"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imports of the
product, due account being taken of any special factors which may have
affected or may be affecting the trade in the product.<p> (b)    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000391800005"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000395800008"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>A Member may
depart from the provisions in subparagraph (a) provided that consultations
under paragraph&#160;3 of Article&#160;12 are conducted under the auspices of
the Committee on Safeguards provided for in paragraph&#160;1 of
Article&#160;13 and that clear demonstration is provided to the Committee
that (<i>i</i>) imports from certain Members have increased in
disproportional percentage in relation to the total increase of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000391800140"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000394700046"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imports of
the product concerned in the representative period, (<i>ii</i>) the reasons
for the departure from the provisions in subparagraph&#160;(a) are justified,
and (<i>iii</i>) the conditions of such departure are equitable to all
suppliers of the product concerned. The duration of any such measure shall
not be extended beyond the initial period under paragraph&#160;1 of
Article&#160;7. The departure referred to above shall not be permitted in the
case of threat of serious injury.<p><h2> Article&#160;6 </h2><h2> Provisional
Safeguard Measures  </h2> <i>    </i>In critical circumstances where delay
would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, a Member may take a
provisional safeguard measure pursuant to a preliminary determination that
there is clear evidence that increased imports have caused or are threatening
to cause serious injury. The duration of the provisional measure shall not
exceed 200&#160;days, during which period the pertinent requirements of
Articles&#160;2 through 7 and 12 shall be met. Such measures should take the
form of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000392300166"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TARIFFINCREASES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff increases to be promptly refunded if the subsequent
investigation referred to in paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;4 does not
determine that increased imports have caused or threatened to cause serious
injury to a domestic industry. The duration of any such provisional measure
shall be counted as a part of the initial period and any extension referred
to in paragraphs&#160;1, 2 and&#160;3 of Article&#160;7.<p><h2>
Article&#160;7 </h2><h2>
Duration and Review of Safeguard Measures </h2>
1.    A Member shall apply safeguard measures only for such period of time
as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate
adjustment. The period shall not exceed four years, unless it is extended
under paragraph&#160;2.<p>
2.    The period mentioned in paragraph&#160;1 may be extended provided that
the competent authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000392900036"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000394700061"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member have determined, in
conformity with the procedures set out in Articles&#160;2, 3, 4 and&#160;5,
that the safeguard measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy
serious injury and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting,
and provided that the pertinent provisions of Articles&#160;8 and&#160;12 are
observed.<p>3.    The total period of application of a safeguard measure
including the period of application of any provisional measure, the period of
initial application and any extension thereof, shall not exceed eight
years.<p>4.    In order to facilitate adjustment in a situation where the
expected duration of a safeguard measure as notified under the provisions of
paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;12 is over one year, the Member applying
the measure shall progressively liberalize it at regular intervals during the
period of application. If the duration of the measure exceeds three years,
the Member applying such a measure shall review the situation not later than
the mid-term of the measure and, if appropriate, withdraw it or increase the
pace of liberalization. A measure extended under paragraph&#160;2 shall not
be more restrictive than it was at the end of the initial period, and should
continue to be liberalized.<p>5.    No safeguard measure shall be applied
again to the import of a product which has been subject to such a measure,
taken after the date of entry into force of the WTO&#160;Agreement, for a
period of time equal to that during which such measure had been previously
applied, provided that the period of non-application is at least two
years.<p>6.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph&#160;5, a
safeguard measure with a duration of 180&#160;days or less may be applied
again to the import of a product if:<p> (a)    at least one year has elapsed
since the date of introduction of a safeguard measure on the import of that
product; and<p> (b)    such a safeguard measure has not been applied on the
same product more than twice in the five-year period immediately preceding
the date of introduction of the measure.<p><h2> Article&#160;8 </h2><h2>
Level of Concessions and Other Obligations </h2>
1.    A Member proposing to apply a safeguard measure or seeking an
extension of a safeguard measure shall endeavor to maintain a substantially
equivalent level of concessions and other obligations to that existing under

such a measure, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph&#160;3 of
Article&#160;12. To achieve this objective, the Members concerned may agree
on any adequate means of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000394000157"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COMPENSATIONTRADE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade compensation for the adverse effects of the
measure on their trade.<p> 2.    If no agreement is reached within
30&#160;days in the consultations under paragraph&#160;3 of Article&#160;12,
then the affected exporting Members shall be free, not later than
90&#160;days after the measure is applied, to suspend, upon the expiration of
30&#160;days from the day on which written notice of such suspension is
received by the Council for Trade in Goods, the application of substantially
equivalent concessions or other obligations under GATT 1994, to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000394100162"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERTRADEOF"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade of
the Member applying the safeguard measure, the suspension of which the
Council for Trade in Goods does not disapprove.<p> 3.    The right of
suspension referred to in paragraph&#160;2 shall not be exercised for the
first three years that a safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the
safeguard measure has been taken as a result of an absolute increase in
imports and that such a measure conforms to the provisions of this
Agreement.<p><h2> Article&#160;9 </h2><h2> Developing Country Members </h2>
1.    Safeguard measures shall not be applied against a product originating
in a developing country Member as long as its share of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000394700046"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTSOFPRODUCT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imports of the product

provided that developing country Members with less than 3&#160;per&#160;cent
import share collectively account for not more than 9&#160;per&#160;cent of
total imports of the product concerned. A Member shall immediately notify an
action taken under paragraph 1 of Article&#160;9 to the Committee on
Safeguards.

<p>
2.     A developing country Member shall have the right to extend the period
of application of a safeguard measure for a period of up to two years beyond
the maximum period provided for in paragraph&#160;3 of Article&#160;7.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph&#160;5 of Article&#160;7, a
developing country Member shall have the right to apply a safeguard measure
again to the import of a product which has been subject to such a measure,
taken after the date of entry into force of the WTO&#160;Agreement, after a
period of time equal to half that during which such a measure has been
previously applied, provided that the period of non-application is at least
two years.<p>

Article&#160;10 </h2><h2>
Pre-existing Article XIX Measures </h2>
     Members shall terminate all safeguard measures taken pursuant to

Article&#160;XVII provides for obligations on Members in respect of the
activities of the state trading enterprises referred to in paragraph 1 of
Article&#160;XVII, which are required to be consistent with the general principles
of non-discriminatory treatment prescribed in GATT&#160;1994 for <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000026100094"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GOVERNMENTALMEASURES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>governmental

prejudice to the substantive disciplines prescribed in Article&#160;XVII;<p>
Hereby <i>agree</i> as follows:<p>1.    In order to ensure the transparency
of the activities of state trading enterprises, Members shall notify such
enterprises to the Council for Trade in Goods, for review by the working
party to be set up under paragraph&#160;5, in accordance with the following
working definition:<p> "Governmental and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000026600006"></a><a href="n.htm#_ICONOVEX_NONGOVERNMENTALENTERPRISES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>non-governmental enterprises,

notifications on state trading enterprises to the Council for Trade in Goods,
taking account of the provisions of this Understanding. In carrying out such
a review, each Member should have regard to the need to ensure the maximum
transparency possible in its notifications so as to permit a clear

with regard to the adequacy of notifications and the need for further
information.  The working party shall also review, in the light of the

<h1>
Declaration on the Contribution of the World Trade Organization to Achieving
Greater Coherence in Global Economic Policymaking </h1>


<p>1.    <i>Ministers recognize</i> that the globalization of the world
economy has led to ever-growing interactions between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000661800037"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECONOMICPOLICIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>economic policies
pursued by individual countries, including interactions between the
structural, macroeconomic, trade, financial and development aspects of
economic policymaking. The task of achieving harmony between these policies
falls primarily on governments at the national level, but their coherence
internationally is an important and valuable element in increasing the
effectiveness of these policies at national level. The Agreements reached in
the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000661800167"></a><a href="u.htm#_ICONOVEX_URUGUAYROUNDSHOW"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Uruguay Round show that all the participating governments recognize the
contribution that liberal trading policies can make to the healthy growth
and development of their own economies and of the world economy as a
whole.<p>2.    Successful cooperation in each area of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000661900015"></a><a href="31.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000662200017"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>economic policy
contributes to progress in other areas. Greater exchange rate stability,
based on more orderly underlying economic and financial conditions, should
contribute towards the expansion of trade, sustainable growth and
development, and the correction of external imbalances. There is also a need
for an adequate and timely flow of concessional and non-concessional
financial and real investment resources to developing countries and for
further efforts to address debt problems, to help ensure economic growth and
development. <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000661900176"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADELIBERALIZATION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Trade liberalization forms an increasingly important component
in the success of the adjustment programs that many countries are
undertaking, often involving significant transitional social costs. In this
connection, Ministers note the role of the World Bank and the IMF in
supporting adjustment to trade liberalization, including support to net
food-importing developing countries facing short-term costs arising from
agricultural trade reforms.<p>3.    The positive outcome of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662000013"></a><a href="31.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000662000052"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Uruguay Round
is a major contribution towards more coherent and complementary <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662000036"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INTERNATIONALECONOMICPOLICIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>international
economic policies. The results of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662000052"></a><a href="34.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000669000027"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Uruguay Round ensure an expansion of
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662000065"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MARKETACCESS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>market access to the benefit of all countries, as well as a framework of
strengthened multilateral disciplines for trade. They also guarantee that
trade policy will be conducted in a more transparent manner and with greater
awareness of the benefits for domestic competitiveness of an open trading
environment. The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the
Uruguay Round has the capacity to provide an improved forum for
liberalization, to contribute to more effective surveillance, and to ensure
strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines. These
improvements mean that <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662000250"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADEPOLICY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade policy can in the future play a more substantial
role in ensuring the coherence of global <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662000285"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECONOMICPOLICYMAKING"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>economic policymaking.<p>4.
<i>Ministers recognize</i>, however, that difficulties the origins of which
lie outside the trade field cannot be redressed through measures taken in the
trade field alone. This underscores the importance of efforts to improve
other elements of global economic policymaking to complement the effective
implementation of the results achieved in the Uruguay Round.<p>5.    The
inter-linkages between the different aspects of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662200017"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECONOMICPOLICY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>economic policy require that
the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662200028"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INTERNATIONALINSTITUTIONS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>international institutions with responsibilities in each of these areas
follow consistent and mutually supportive policies. The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662200062"></a><a href="33.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000668100025"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>World Trade
Organization should therefore pursue and develop cooperation with the
international organizations responsible for monetary and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662200097"></a><a href="55.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000701100148"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>financial matters,
while respecting the mandate, the confidentiality requirements and the
necessary autonomy in decision-making procedures of each institution, and
avoiding the imposition on governments of cross-conditionality or additional
conditions. Ministers further invite the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000662200170"></a><a href="51.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000692000055"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Director-General of the WTO to

<h1>
Understanding on the Interpretation of Article II:1(b) of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 </h1> <p> <i>Members </i>hereby
<i>agree</i> as follows:<p>1.    In order to ensure transparency of the legal
rights and obligations deriving from paragraph&#160;1(b) of Article&#160;II,
the nature and level of any "other duties or charges" levied on bound tariff
items, as referred to in that provision, shall be recorded in the Schedules
of concessions annexed to GATT&#160;1994 against the tariff item to which
they apply. It is understood that such recording does not change the legal
character of "other duties or charges".<p>2.    The date as of which "other
duties or charges" are bound, for the purposes of Article&#160;II, shall be
15&#160;April 1994. "Other duties or charges" shall therefore be recorded in
the Schedules at the levels applying on this date. At each subsequent
renegotiation of a concession or negotiation of a new concession the
applicable date for the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000024800127"></a><a href="06.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000024800195"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff item in question shall become the date of the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000024800148"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INCORPORATIONOFNEWCONCESSION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>incorporation of the new concession in the appropriate Schedule. However, the
date of the instrument by which a concession on any particular <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000024800195"></a><a href="11.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000035000258"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff item
was first incorporated into <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000024800208"></a><a href="09.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000032300054"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>GATT 1947 or GATT&#160;1994 shall also continue
to be recorded in column 6 of the Loose-Leaf Schedules. <p>3.    "Other
duties or charges" shall be recorded in respect of all <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000024900027"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TARIFFBINDINGS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff bindings. <p>4.
Where a tariff item has previously been the subject of a concession, the
level of "other duties or charges" recorded in the appropriate Schedule shall
not be higher than the level obtaining at the time of the first <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000025000082"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INCORPORATIONOFCONCESSION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>incorporation
of the concession in that Schedule. It will be open to any Member to
challenge the existence of an "other duty or charge", on the ground that no
such "other duty or charge" existed at the time of the original binding of
the item in question, as well as the consistency of the recorded level of any
"other duty or charge" with the previously bound level, for a period of three
years after the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement or three years
after the date of deposit with the Director-General of the WTO of the
instrument incorporating the Schedule in question into GATT&#160;1994, if
that is a later date.<p>5.    The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000025100005"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RECORDINGOFOTHERDUTIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>recording of "other duties or charges" in
the Schedules is without prejudice to their consistency with rights and
obligations under GATT&#160;1994 other than those affected by
paragraph&#160;4. All Members retain the right to challenge, at any time, the
consistency of any "other duty or charge" with such obligations.<p>6.    For
the purposes of this Understanding, the provisions of Articles&#160;XXII and
XXIII of GATT&#160;1994 as elaborated and applied by the Dispute Settlement
Understanding shall apply.<p>7.    "Other duties or charges" omitted from a
Schedule at the time of deposit of the instrument incorporating the Schedule
in question into GATT&#160;1994 with, until the date of entry into force of
the WTO Agreement, the Director-General to the CONTRACTING PARTIES to GATT&#160;1947 or, thereafter, with the Director-General of the WTO, shall not
subsequently be added to it and any "other duty or charge" recorded at a
level lower than that prevailing on the applicable date shall not be restored
to that level unless such additions or changes are made within six months of
the date of deposit of the  instrument.<p>8.    The decision in paragraph 2
regarding the date applicable to each concession for the purposes of
paragraph 1(b) of Article II of GATT&#160;1994 supersedes the decision
regarding the applicable date taken on 26&#160;March&#160;1980 (BISD 27S/24).

<BODY>
<P>
<U>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</U>
<P>
<center><h3>NEW ENHANCEMENT OFFERS THE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE AUTOMATIC INDEXES</h3></center>
<P>
Bloomington, MN.  ICONOVEX Corporation announces the release of
ICONOVEX's <b>LexEdit,</B> a lexicon customizing utility for use
with all of ICONOVEX'S programs: Indexicon, Syntactica and AnchorPage.
ICONOVEX'S LexEdit allows users to create and edit user-defined lexicons
(word lists) to more precisely tailor the final output produced by any of
these products.  ICONOVEX will also be developing specialty lexicons
to enable people in different fields the ability to emphasize
industry-specific words.
<P>
 LexEdit is currently shipping for $49.99 and is available through
a network of resellers or direct at 1-800-943-0292.
<P>
 &quot;Many of our users wanted to have more control over the
way Indexicon made its indexing decisions,&quot; states Robert
Griggs, vice president of sales and marketing for ICONOVEX.  &quot;For
instance, an individual may very well want the word 'globe' to
appear in the index every time it appears in their document.
Or just the opposite, they may never want that word to appear
in their index.  LexEdit allows users to produce an index more
closely designed to their specifications.&quot;
<P>
 An easy-to-use interface provides three fields through which
the user assigns values to the words in their lexicon.   One of these fields is
<I>Indexing Value</I>, which gives the user five options for ranking
the overall indexing value of a word:  Always Index, Usually Index,
Sometimes Index, Rarely Index and Never Index.  <I>Part of Speech</I>
 allows the user to assign the part of speech a particular word
most often takes in their document.  &quot;There are 17 'syntax'
categories in LexEdit for the user to choose from,&quot; adds
Griggs.  Words that are already in the main lexicon can be added
to the user's lexicon in order to change their values.
<P>
 &quot;The primary use for specialty lexicons is that people in
different fields of knowledge and endeavor can weight terms in
a way that will better bring out index entries appropriate to
their field,&quot; states Griggs.
<P>
 The ICONOVEX Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of INNOVEX,
Inc., the world's leading manufacturer of lead-wire assemblies
for the thin film disk drive market.

<P>
In order to run AnchorPage for Windows, your system should meet
the following minimum requirements:<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone2"></A>
<P>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone3">386 CPU (486 recommended)</A>
<UL>

<P>
AnchorPage for Windows NT and for Windows 95 will run on any system
capable of supporting those operating systems; however, we strongly
recommend a minimum of 8 MB of RAM when running in 95 and 16 MB
of RAM when running in NT.
<H4>Disk Space Allotted to Output Files</H4>

<P>
In addition to the space requirements listed for the <!--Installation files-->installation
files, it should be noted that, depending on the options you set,
the size of the output files for any AnchorPage project will be
larger than the original input files and that during processing
many temporary files are created, again increasing the amount
of disk space required at run time.

whatever name you assign to the AnchorPage home directory if you
choose to change t<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone4">he default)

once you are familiar with AnchorPage.
<P>
The <!--Installation program-->installation program does not make
any changes to your <!--Autoexec. bat-->AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.<!--Config.sys-->SYS,
or to any of your .<!--Ini files-->INI files.  It will create
a program group called ICONOVEX <!--Program Manager--> and will

<title>Viewing the Sample Output</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffff">

<h2>Viewing the Sample Output</h2>
If you chose a complete AnchorPage installation, the <!--Anchor directory-->ANCHOR
directory (or whatever name you chose to assign to the AnchorPage
home directory) will include a VIEWDATA subdirectory.  This subdirectory
contains sample output files from an AnchorPage project so that
you can see what the output should look like and how the options
you set at run time affect the navigational options available
to your end-user. For this demonstration the input files consisted
of a series of Senate speeches about the Balanced Budget Amendment
taken from the Congressional Record.  These twenty-some-odd speeches
were run as a single project.
<P>
In order to view this sample output, start your browser and point
it at the file HOME.<!--Home.htm-->HTM in the <!--Viewdata directory-->VIEWDATA
directory.  This is the <!--Anchor page-->Anchor page, which acts
very much like a home page for the project.  From here you can
navigate to any of the other output pages, and you can always
return to the <!--Anchor page-->Anchor page from any of those
other output pages.
<P>
Begin by choosing the <!--Table of Contents View-->Table of Contents
View.  The table of contents is an outline composed of the headings
of the document or document suite, in this case a list of the
names of the speakers.  Choose an entry by clicking on it.  You
will be taken to the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View, beginning
with the first entry under the heading you selected.  Now choose
a link in the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View to follow.  Clicking
on a link here will take you to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View, where you can see the full text of the speech from which
the entry was taken.
<P>
To return to the <!--Anchor page-->Anchor page, scroll to the
top of the <!--Presentation View segment-->Presentation View segment
and click on the &quot;Return to Anchor Page&quot; icon.  Now
choose the &quot;Phrase View&quot; icon.  For this project we
have created a <!--Phrase A to Z page-->Phrase A to Z page so
that choosing <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View will take you to an
alphabetical page to begin your search.  Choose one of the hotlinked
letters (the plain black letters indicate that no entries are
available for that letter) to jump to the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase
View itself.  Now you can scroll up or down until you find an
entry that interests you.  If you click on a horizontal arrow
following an entry in this view you will be taken to the abstract
from which that entry was derived, and from there you can go on
to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View if you choose.
 If you click on the hotlink in the entry itself, you will be
taken directly to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View.
<P>
Using either one of these methods, go to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View.  Scroll to the bottom of the segment.  Here (unless you
happen to be on the very last segment of the set) you will find
a &quot;<!--Next Segment icon-->Next Segment&quot; icon.  Click
on it.  You will be jumped to the top of the next alphabetical
segment in the series.  You can continue to browse forward or
backward in this manner, or by following the circular links within
the text.  For now, choose the &quot;Return to <!--Anchor page icon-->Anchor
page&quot; icon at the top of the segment.
<P>
Finally, from the Anchor page, choose the &quot;<!--Concept View icon-->Concept
View&quot; icon.  As in the &quot;<!--Phrase View-->Phrase View,&quot;
we have created an A to Z page for concepts.  Choose a letter
to begin your search and you will be taken to the first alphabetical
listing for that character in the <!--Concept View-->Concept View.
 Choosing the <!--Hotlinked headword-->hotlinked headword for
any <!--Concept View entry-->Concept View entry will take you
to the place in the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View
from which the concept was derived.
<P>
This sample represents only one set of the possible <!--Run-time options -->run-time
options available in AnchorPage.  A complete discussion of these
options can be found in the chapter entitled &quot;Using AnchorPage.&quot;
<P>
Note:  If the links on any of these sample files do not seem to
take you to the correct location, if, for instance, the jump from
the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View to the Presentation View lands
you on the correct page but not at the correct location on that
page, please see the final chapter, &quot;Helpful Hints and Troubleshooting
Guide.&quot;<HR>

<title>Trial Run of AnchorPage</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="ffffff">

<h2>Trial Run of AnchorPage</h2>

Before going into detail about AnchorPage's settings and options,
it might be useful for you to have some hands-on experience with
the program, so in this section we'll take you step-by-step through
the process of running an <!--AnchorPage project-->AnchorPage
project to produce output files like those you just viewed.  This
section assumes that you did a full installation of the program
and all its tutorial files.
<P>
Begin by opening AnchorPage from the <!--Iconovex program group-->Iconovex
program group.  The start-up screen will appear, and after a few
seconds it will be replaced by the main options screen in its
standard interface.  If you would prefer a more graphical rendering
of the options available, you can change from the standard interface
to a graphical Options M<!--Options Map-->ap by choosing <!--View - Options Map--><B>View
- Options Map</B>.  In either case, the run-time options available
to you will remain the same; only the representation of them is
different.
<P>
The first step is to choose which <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views you will create and which <!--Hypertext links-->hypertext
links between those views.  In order to get results like the sample
output data you viewed earlier, leave all four <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views selected.  The numerical <!--Spinner controls-->spinner
controls next to Phrase, Concept, and Abstract Views are for the
<!--Selection Threshold setting-->Selection Threshold setting,
the setting which determines how selective or comprehensive AnchorPage's
output will be.  For this trial run, set the spinners at level
two.  Next, place check marks in the Phrase A to Z and Concept
A to Z checkboxes.  This will cause the two alphabetical search
pages to be created.  Now choose the optional <!--Hypertext links-->hypertext
links you would like to create; you can create circular links
for phrases or for concepts (but not both), and you can create
a horizontal link between the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View and
the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View.  To get output corresponding
to the sample output, check <!--Phrase circular links-->Phrase
Circular Links and <!--Phrase horizontal links-->Phrase Horizontal
Links.
<P>
The next step is to select the files you wish to process.  Choose
the <!--File List button--><B>File List</B> button at the bottom
of the screen.  On the <!--File List screen-->File List screen,
use the directory browser on the left to find and select the directory
containing those files.  If you are going to run the sample files
for this trial, they are in the SAMPLES subdirectory of the <!--AnchorPage home directory  subdirectory of -->AnchorPage
home directory.  Double-clicking on the directory name will select
the directory, and all the .HTM files in that directory will appear
in the <!--File List box-->File List box at the center of the
screen.  For this trial run, select all the files by clicking
on the triple right arrow button.  All the files, with their pathnames
attached, will now appear in the <!--Project List box-->Project
List box on the right.  Click <B>OK</B>, and you will be returned
to the main screen.
<P>
The final step is to choose the directories for the current project.
 Click on the <!--Directory button--><B>Directory</B> button at
the bottom of the screen.  Again you will be presented with a
<!--Directory browser-->directory browser on the left side of
the screen.  Use the browser to locate and select the destination
directory - the directory into which you wish to have the output
files placed.  For this trial, choose the PROJECT subdirectory
under the <!--AnchorPage home directory-->AnchorPage home directory.
 Once you have selected this directory (its name should now appear
under the DirectoryName label on the upper left side of the screen),
you indicate that it is the destination directory by clicking
on the <!--Select Destination Directory button--><B>Select Destination
Directory</B> button on the right side of the screen.  The text
box above that button should now show the name of your currently
selected directory.
<P>
Repeat this process to choose a template directory - the directory
<I>from which</I> you want AnchorPage to take templates and icons
for the current project.  For this trial run, we will use the
default template set, so use the <!--Directory browser-->directory
browser to select the DEFAULT subdirectory and then click on <!--Select Template Directory button--><B>Select
Template Directory</B>.  Click <B>OK</B> to return to the main
screen once again.
<P>
These are the essential steps in preparing to run an AnchorPage
project.  However, having spent the time to get the settings just
the way you want them, it's a good idea to save those settings
to a <!--Configuration file-->configuration file so that you can
easily recreate them.  That way, if you later wish to run another
project with identical settings, or wish to make some adjustments
before rerunning a project, you can easily determine exactly what
the original settings were.  To save your settings, choose <B>File
- Save Project As</B>.  Select the directory in which you wish
to save the <!--Configuration file-->configuration file and choose
a project name.  Click on <B>OK</B>.  You can now recall your
current project settings at any time by choosing <!--File - Open Project--><B>File
- Open Project</B> and selecting this <!--Configuration file-->configuration
file.
<P>
Having saved your settings, click on <B>Run</B> to begin AnchorPage
processing.  When AnchorPage is done, open your browser and point
it at the HOME.<!--Home.htm-->HTM file in the PROJECT directory
to view the results.

<h2>AnchorPage: an Overview</h2>
In order to understand how to use AnchorPage to the greatest benefit,
it is necessary to understand exactly what AnchorPage does.  The
process can be divided into three distinct phases: parsing the
document or suite of documents, placing <!--Hypertext anchors-->hypertext
anchors in the document, and building <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views that will link to these anchors.  In each phase, you have
control over options that affect the final output.  These phases,
their options, and how these options affect the navigational options
available to the end-user are discussed briefly below.  They are
discussed in more detail in the appropriate sections of this manual.

<h3>Parsing the Document</h3>
AnchorPage makes use of Iconovex's primary parsing engine, <!--Syntactica--><I>Syntactica</I>,
to &quot;read&quot; <!--HTML documents-->HTML documents and extract
their significant concepts.  It then extracts the significant
words and phrases.  You can control what AnchorPage considers
&quot;significant&quot; through the <!--Selection Threshold setting-->Selection
Threshold setting, which allows you to declare how generally selective
or inclusive you wish to be when creating Synopsis Views<B> </B>of
your documents, and more specifically through <!--LexEdit--><I>LexEdit</I>,
a lexicon maintenance tool which allows you to build a personal
lexicon of terms you consider important in your documents.  You
can also use <!--LexEdit--><I>LexEdit</I> to suppress words you
don't consider important.  Run-time options let you determine
whether or not personal names and/or <!--Geographical names-->geographical
names will become anchors.  For documents with specialized vocabularies,
you can instruct AnchorPage to produce a list of words it doesn't
recognize.  You can then enter these words in your personal lexicon,
much like adding words to a spellchecker, and reprocess the document.
 See the chapter on <!--LexEdit-->LexEdit<I> </I>for complete
details on using this utility to control the content of AnchorPage
output.<HR>



<P>
<a name="2">
<H3>Placing Anchors</H3>
After determining the significant phrases and concepts within
a document, AnchorPage places destination anchors in the document
to mark each of those significant points.  These destination anchors
will allow you to jump from the various <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views of the document to the appropriate place in the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View or from the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View to the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract
View via <I>horizontal links (see the explanation of horizontal
links later in this discussion).  They will also allow you to
jump from one instance of a phrase or concept in the </I><!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View to the next instance of the same phrase or concept via <I>circular
links (see the explanation of circular links later in this discussion).
 You control the relative number of anchors placed in the document
and the types of links established.</I>
<P>
The relative number of anchors is controlled through the <!--Selection Threshold setting-->Selection
Threshold setting, which has six levels; the higher the setting,
the more selective AnchorPage will be in determining what constitutes
a &quot;significant&quot; concept.  A low setting will therefore
apply less selective criteria when choosing concepts and will
produce a larger number of anchors.  A higher setting will apply
more selective criteria and produce a correspondingly smaller
number of anchors.  The Selection<!--Selection Threshold--> Threshold
for phrases, concepts, and abstracts can be set separately.
<P>
Horizontal links are the links that allow you to move from one
View of a document to another.  The <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View,
<!--Concept View-->Concept View, and <!--Abstract View-->Abstract
View are each linked directly to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View.  If you create a <!--Table of Contents View-->Table of Contents
View and an <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View, a horizontal link
will also be created from the Table of Contents to the Abstract.
 If you do not create an <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View, the
<!--Table of Contents View-->Table of Contents View is linked
directly to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View.  You
also have the option of creating a horizontal link from the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase
View to the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View.
<P>
Circular links are links within the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View which allow you to jump from one instance of a phrase or
concept to the next instance of that phrase or concept within
the document (or documents, if you have processed multiple documents
as a single project).  If, for instance, you follow a horizontal
link from the anchor &quot;Insurance companies&quot; in the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase
View to the instance where &quot;Insurance companies&quot; appears
in the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View, circular links
would then allow you to trace each use of &quot;Insurance companies&quot;
in that document.  The final link in the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View would lead you back to the original occurrence of &quot;Insurance
companies&quot; in the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View, completing
the circle. Circular links can be created for phrases or concepts,
but not both.  In <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View, circular links
are created for every instance of an <I>exact match</I> <I>of
the phrase</I>; in <!--Concept View-->Concept View, they are created
for every instance of an <I>exact match of the headword or </I><!--Headwords in Concept View--><I>headwords</I>
used to alphabetize the concept.
<P>
Creating circular links also changes the way entries are presented
in the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View or Concept V<!--Concept View-->iew
(depending on which kind of circular link you create).  If no
circular links are created, then each instance of a given phrase
is listed separately.  In a report about the Balanced Budget Amendment,
for example, the phrase &quot;government revenue&quot; might be
mentioned ten times.  If no circular links are created when this
report is processed, the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View generated
by the report will list ten different instances of &quot;government
revenue,&quot; each one linked to one of the places in the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View where the phrase appears.  If circular links are created,
the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View will contain only one entry
for &quot;government revenue.&quot;  This entry will be linked
to the first instance of the phrase in the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View, and circular links within the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View will provide jumps to all the other instances of the phrase.
 The last of these circular links will provide a jump back to
the originating entry, &quot;government revenue,&quot; in the
<!--Phrase View-->Phrase View.<HR>

<a name="3"><H3>Synopsis Views</H3>

<P>
These Synopsis Views present different ways to access the content
of a document or document suite.  The <!--Table of Contents View-->Table
of Contents View presents the document headings in outline form.
 The <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View presents the significant
concepts in the order in which they appear in the original document
grouped under the original headings. The <!--Concept View-->Concept
View presents these same concepts alphabetized according to the
keywords they contain.  The <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View is an
alphabetical listing of the keywords and key phrases of the document.
 These <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis Views can then be linked
to each other and to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View, a <!--Transcript of original document-->transcript of the
original document in its presentation form.  The original document
file is unmodified.
<P>
You may decide, however, that not all of these views are necessary
or appropriate for some of the documents you process (some documents,
for instance, may not provide enough headings to make a <!--Table of Contents View-->Table
of Contents View very informative), or you may decide that different
types of documents need different <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views.  For every project you run - a project can be one document
or many - you have the option of building any or all of the possible
<!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis Views.
<P>
You can also change the appearance of the <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views (and of any other AnchorPage output page) by changing the
templates<!--Templates that control them.  A template is an HTML
(HyperText Mark-up Language) document which instructs AnchorPage
how to build it various output pages.  These templates come in
sets, one template for each of the possible output pages, and
can be edited and viewed like any other HTML document.  You can
rearrange how the text is ordered on the page and where the various
icons are displayed.  You can change icons, using any of the alternative
icons we have provided or substituting icons of your own.  You
can even use different template sets for different projects, if
you wish, giving each project a distinctive look of its own.-->
<P>
Finally, you can control the total &quot;volume&quot; each output
page contains by adjusting the segment size.  AnchorPage divides
each output page into download segments.  These segments can contain
anything from one HTML paragraph each to an entire document.
<P>
Segmentation has the advantage of offering your users quick access.
 When properly adjusted, it assures faster downloads by only sending
the segment that is relevant to the user's immediate search.
If, for instance, you have set segments to ten (which translates
to 10 paragraphs of text per segment of the Presentation View
or 50 entries per segment on any of the Synopsis Views), and your
user requests the &quot;c&quot; section of the Concept View, he
or she will receive the segment which includes the first concepts
listed under &quot;c.&quot;  If the user wants to see more, he
or she can click the &quot;<!--Next Segment icon-->Next Segment&quot;
icon at the bottom of the page, and the next fifty concepts will
be transferred.  The <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View
is similarly segmented, so that even when your user wishes to
follow a link to the original text, he or she is not forced to
wait for the whole document to be retrieved before paging to the
passage of immediate interest.  You can, of course, also provide
a link for downloading the entire document.<HR>

<a name="4"><H3>Multiple Documents</H3>

<P>
AnchorPage can process single documents or multiple document sets.
Documents sets can be composed of files located anywhere on your
local system, in the same directory or spread out across many
directories.  The effect of processing single documents at a time
is very different, however, than the effect of processing multiple
document sets.  When you process documents singly, each document
creates its own unique set of <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis Views.
 This is especially useful for large, self-contained documents
like GATT or NAFTA.
<P>
When you process a multiple document set, the resulting <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views contain merged entries for the whole set: the <!--Concept View-->Concept
View and the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View will display all the
entries from the set merged alphabetically; the <!--Table of Contents View-->Table
of Contents View and the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View will
display the entries merged sequentially - that is, the complete
entries from each document in turn, in the order in which they
were selected for processing.  Using multiple document sets is
most useful when you have a number of  related documents, such
as a set of legislative documents pertaining to environmental
law or news articles about one subject.<HR>

<H3><a name="5">End-Users: Viewing the Results</a></H3>

<P>
For the end-user, AnchorPage provides a content-driven, <!--Point-and-shoot navigational tool-->point-and-shoot
navigational tool that allows them to verify the substance of
a document - without attempting to read it word for word - before
committing to downloading it.  Users can quickly scan the <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views for the ideas they are interested in and only download the
entire document once they are assured it will be suitable for
their research.  Or they may decide to do that research online
using AnchorPage as their primary research tool.
<P>
Nothing on your <!--Home page-->home page or subsequent pages
need be modified.  On the page or pages where you list document
titles available in your database, you may wish to inform users
that you will present them with a choice of <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views so that they understand that clicking on a document title
will not automatically entail waiting for the entire document
to download.  From this point on, the user  follows hyperlinked
ideas through the various <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis Views
and to the <!--Presentation View of document-->Presentation View
of the document itself.  <BR>

<P>
<P>
The following example, which assumes you have used a standard
AnchorPage template and have generated all of the <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views, illustrates how your end-user will navigate through AnchorPage
to find the information he or she is looking for.  The article
on which the example is based is used with the permission of <I>Car
and Driver Magazine.</I>
<P>
  After clicking on the document title in the list of titles you
provide, the user will be presented with the Anchor page for that
document.  This page explains the <!--Navigational icons-->navigational
icons used in AnchorPage and offers the user the choice of viewing
the table of contents, the phrases, the concepts, or the abstract.
 (Though we do not provide it in our templates, you can also offer
the user the option of jumping straight to the presentation page.)
   If the user chooses the table of contents, she will be presented
with the <!--Table of Contents View-->Table of Contents View,
which lists all headings (&lt;H1&gt; through &lt;H6&gt;) of the
document arranged in outline form.  Each of these headings is
a <!--Hotlink-->hotlink which provides a jump to the appropriate
section of the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View or, if you have
not created an Abstract View, directly to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View.<BR>

<P>
<P>
  The <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View operates much like the
<!--Table of Contents View-->Table of Contents View. If the user
chooses to see the abstract, she is presented with the first segment
of the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View (or the entire abstract
if you have chosen not to use segmentation).  At the end of the
first segment is a navigational icon for retrieving the next segment
of the abstract, and so on (every segment except for the first
one also provides an icon for retrieving the previous segment).
 Each entry in the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View is hotlinked
to the full-text sentence in the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View from which it was drawn.<BR>

<P>
  When choosing either Phrase View or Concept View, the user is
presented with an alphabet.  Selecting a letter from
the alphabet retrieves the entries beginning with that letter.
 When there are no entries for a particular letter, this is indicated
by a &quot;grayed-out&quot; letter or a letter with a red line
drawn through it, depending on the alphabetical set you choose
to use.<HR>

<P>
<P>
  However the user ultimately arrives at the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View, this view provides the same <!--Navigational icons-->navigational
icons as the other views (next segment, previous segment), and
may additionally contain circular links to allow jumping between
different instances of the same entry within the document.  The
user therefore has the option of moving through the document sequentially
or conceptually, following a single idea as it develops through
the course of the document.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<P>

<H3><a name="6">Procedures at a Glance</A></H3>

<P>
Because AnchorPage offers you a wide variety of options that directly
affect the appearance, content, and even functionality of the
final document presentation, we recommend that you make a number
of trial runs on the documents you will be anchoring and experiment
with different configuration options.
 Once you have decided which options you prefer, the actual processing
of your documents is a simple, three-step task.  You begin by
setting the <!--Run-time options-->run-time<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone20">
</A>
<P>

<P>
options to determine which <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis Views
will be created and which <!--Hypertext links-->hypertext links
will be established between them.  Next you select the documents
to be processed, and finally you indicate where on your system
you want the output files stored.<BR>

<P>
To make the task of setting options as easy as possible, AnchorPage
offers alternate interfaces for the Options window.  The standard
interface, with its checkboxes arranged by functional
category, will be familiar to most Windows users.  The <!--Options Map-->Options
Map is a more graphical representation AnchorPage's
options that allows you to see exactly how those options will
affect the final output.  The options offered on the two screens
are identical; only the visual representation is different.  Changing
the options on one screen is immediately reflected on the other.

<h2>Configuration Options</h2>
Configuration options on the main screen (whether you are using
the standard interface or the Options Map) control which of the
various <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis Views are created for a
document or document suite, what types of links are established
between and within those views, and the size of the segments the
output pages will be divided into for transfer to your end-user.
 You can also choose to have the <!--Anchor references-->anchor

Selection</A><!--Page selection--></H3>

<P>
The Page Selection options allow you to control which <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views are generated for your project and how selective AnchorPage
will be in choosing the entries for those views.  In the standard
interface, the column on the left side of the Page
Selection section has checkboxes for each of the possible Synopsis
Views - Phrase, Concept, Abstract, and Table of Contents.  You
can select any combination of these checkboxes.  When you select
Phrase View or Concept View you will also be given the option
of generating A to Z pages for these views.  If you select the
A to Z option, the phrase and/or concept entries for the project
will be divided into discreet alphabetical sections.  This option
is most useful if your project is a large one with many entries.
 If you do not select this option, the phrase and/or concept entries
will be ordered alphabetically in a single document.  This is
most useful if you are running single, modest size documents and
do not expect enough entries to justify separate pages for each
letter of the alphabet.
<P>
On the <!--Options Map-->Options Map, each of the <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis
Views is represented by a color-coded rectangle.  Marking the
checkbox next to any of these views will select it, as indicated
by the colored line that then links the source documents at the
top of the screen to the color-coded output page at the bottom.
 Selecting a particular Synopsis View also makes the related options
available.  If you have selected Concept View, for instance, options
for a Concept A to Z page and for concept circular links will
now be available.  Clicking on either of these options will change
the course of the map line to reflect the new options chosen.
<P>
Whether or not you choose to create A to Z pages will affect the
options available to your end-user.  If you have created A to
Z pages, selecting Phrase View or Concept View from the <!--Anchor page-->Anchor
page will present the user with an alphabet for choosing a search
letter.  After selecting a letter, he or she will be presented
with the Phrase View or Concept View, beginning with the first
entry for that letter.  If you do not choose to create A to Z
pages, the intermediate step will disappear; clicking on Phrase
View or Concept View on the Anchor page will immediately take
the user to that view of the document, beginning with the first
entry.
<P>
Immediately to the right of the Page Selection <!--Checkboxespage selection -->checkboxes
on the standard interface is the <!--Selection Threshold setting-->Selection
Threshold setting. When a checkbox on the left is filled in, a
<!--Spinner controls-->spinner control appears next to the corresponding
Selection Threshold box. This setting controls the degree of discrimination
<!--AnchorPagediscrimination in phrase selection-->AnchorPage
applies when selecting entries.  The higher the <!--Selection Threshold-->Selection
Threshold (the choices range from one to six), the more discriminating
the selection process becomes.  A typical level one phrase page
will contain some fairly mundane noun and noun phrase entries
such as &quot;Toll-free number.&quot;  A typical level six phrase
page will contain only nouns and noun phrases which indicate a
high degree of specialization or complexity such as &quot;Limited
liability insurance companies.&quot;  The other levels represent
relative increments between these two extremes.
<P>
In most documents, the volume of entries for the Synopsis Views
will be more or less directly related to the Selection Threshold
level used to produce them; the more selective levels will, naturally
enough, result in fewer entries.   The proportion of entries for
each level is entirely document-dependent, however, and may vary
considerably from one document type to another.  Non-technical
documents, such as an annual report, will generally have many
more entries at the lower levels and relatively few level six
entries.  Very technical and/or specialized documents, such as
scientific treatises, will usually produce entries which are much
more evenly distributed across all six levels.
<P>
Because the <!--Selection Threshold setting-->Selection Threshold
setting can make a vast difference in the actual content of the
Synopsis Views, we recommend that you experiment with it considerably.
 And because the Selection Threshold can be set separately for
phrases, concepts, and abstracts, we recommend that you run separate
experimental samples for each.  Depending on the documents being
processed and on your particular needs and preferences, the most

necessarily be produced by the same Selection Threshold setting.

</H3>

<P>
When AnchorPage processes a document or document set it automatically
creates links between the <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis Views
and the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View.  You have the
option of creating additional links, either horizontal links between
different views or circular links within the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View.
<H4><A NAME="D2HTopicM2">Horizontal Links</A><!--Horizontal links-->
</H4>

<P>
The Phrase View, Concept View, and Abstract View are each linked
directly to the Presentation View.  If you create a Table of Contents
View, a horizontal link will be created from the table of contents
to the abstract.  You also have the option of creating a horizontal
link from the Phrase View to the Abstract View.
<P>
When the optional horizontal link is not used, the headword or
phrase from each entry in the Phrase View is marked as a hotlink.
 This hotlink will jump the user directly to line on the Presentation
View from which the entry is drawn.  When the optional horizontal
link is used, the headwords of the entries are still marked as
hotlinks, with jumps provided to the Presentation View, but an
additional icon is added after the entry to indicate that there
is a horizontal link to the abstract as well.  The user can follow
the horizontal link from the Phrase View to the Abstract View
and then continue on from the Abstract View to the Presentation
View if he or she wishes.  On the <!--Options Map-->Options Map,
this horizontal link is indicated by a green line linking Phrase
View and Abstract View.
<P>
Please note that not all entries in the Phrase View will have
horizontal links when this option is selected, even if Phrase
View and Abstract View are given the same Selection Threshold
setting.  While most of the phrase entries generated by most documents
will be drawn from concepts that can be found in the Abstract
View, some words and phrases - and especially proper nouns - will
be picked up for the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View even if they
are not contained in significant concepts.  In this case there
will be no horizontal link.
<H4><A NAME="_Toc317143253"></A><A NAME="_Toc317143313"></A><A NAME="_Toc319978924"></A><A NAME="_Toc319997802"></A><A NAME="_Toc320000150"></A><A NAME="D2HTopicM3">Circular
Links</A><!--Circular links--></H4>

<P>
Circular links can be created within the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View to allow the user to jump from one instance of an entry to
the next instance of the same entry in the document or document
suite.  The last instance of that entry will be linked back to
the place in the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View where the link
originated.  This is done to give the user some visual feedback
that the entire circle for that entry has been traveled.  Circular
links can be created for phrases, in which case each <I>exact
instance of the phrase</I> will be linked, or for concepts, in
which case each <I>exact instance of the headword(s)</I> will
be linked, but not for both.
<P>
Creating circular links changes the way entries are presented
in the <!--Concept View-->Concept View or <!--Phrase View-->Phrase
View, as well as the appearance of the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View.  If no circular links are created, each instance of a given
phrase or concept is listed as a separate entry in the Phrase
View or Concept View, and each of those entries is linked to one
distinct instance of its appearance in the Presentation View.
 If circular links are used, only the first instance of a given
phrase or concept is listed as an entry in Phrase View or Concept
View, and all subsequent instances are linked by circular links.

<P>
An example will make this clearer.  A long report on medical malpractice
suits could conceivably mention &quot;fraudulent claims&quot;
a dozen times.  If no circular links are created for phrases when
this document is processed, the phrase &quot;fraudulent claims&quot;
would appear 12 times in the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View, with
each of those entries pointing to a separate occurrence of the
phrase in the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View.  If circular
links are created for phrases, then &quot;fraudulent claims&quot;
will appear only once in Phrase View, and that entry will be linked
to the first occurrence of &quot;fraudulent claims&quot; in the
Presentation View.  Immediately following that phrase will be
the icon for a circular link.  Clicking on this icon will jump
the user to the next occurrence of the phrase, which will be followed
by another icon for a circular link.  And so on, until the last
occurrence of the phrase in the document suite.  That too will
have an icon for a circular link, but clicking on this icon will
take the user back to the entry for &quot;fraudulent claims&quot;
in the Phrase View, tangibly completing the circle for the user.
<P>
On the <!--Options Map-->Options Map, circular links are indicated
by a red circular arrow superimposed over an output page that
is color-coded to indicate Phrase View or Concept View.

<P>
The Link Case <!--CheckboxesLink Case -->checkbox allows you to
indicate whether the filenames written as <!--Hrefscase of--><I>href</I>s

with the filename and case conventions used on your server system.

Size</A><!--Segment Size--></H3>

<P>
All of AnchorPage's output - the various Synopsis Views as well
as the Presentation View - can be divided into segments to make
faster download times possible for your users.  Segment size for
the Presentation View is measured in paragraphs per segment.
A segment size of 15 would mean that each segment of the Presentation
View would contain 15 paragraphs.  In the Phrase, Concept, Abstract
and Table of Contents Views, segment size is measured  in entries
and the number entered on the <!--Spinner controls-->spinner is
multiplied by five.  A segment size of 15 would mean that these
views would be divided into segments containing 75 entries each.
<P>
When calculating the appropriate segment size for your documents
bear in mind that each heading in the Presentation View counts
as a paragraph, as does each item in a bulleted or numbered list.
 Setting segment size to zero will disable segmenting.  Each Synopsis
View is then treated as a single, continuous segment.<HR>

<body bgcolor="ffffff">

<h2>Files and Directories</h2>

Choosing the <b>File List </B>button on
the main screen will open the file selection window.  The directory
browser on the left allows you to navigate your system's directory
structure to locate the directory containing the files you wish
to process.  The <!--File Names box-->File Names box at the center
of this window allows you to select from the files in that directory
those files to be processed for your current project.  Any number
of files can be selected from any number of directories.  These
files can have any name and any extension, but they must all be
HTML documents.
<P>
Files can be selected one at a time by first highlighting them
and then clicking on the single right arrow button or by double-clicking
on the filename.  Multiple files can be selected using standard
windows techniques (shift-click for contiguous files, control-click
for noncontiguous files) and then clicking on the single right
arrow button.  All the files in a chosen directory can be selected
and added by clicking on the triple right arrow button.  Files
can be deselected using the same methods with the left arrow buttons.
<P>
At run time, the files will be processed in the order in which
they appear in the <!--Project List box-->Project List box.  File
order makes no difference on the alphabetically arranged Views,
but if you choose to generate a <!--Table of Contents View-->Table
of Contents View or an <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View for a
multiple document set, you should keep in mind that these views
are sequentially arranged and that file order will determine the
order of the entries.  File order can be changed by highlighting
a filename and using <B>ctrl - up arrow</B> or <B>ctrl - down
arrow</B> to move it.
<P>
Choosing the <B>Directory</B> button on the main screen will open
a <!--Directory selection window-->directory selection window.
 To select a project directory - the directory  where the <!--HTML output files-->HTML
output files will be placed - use the directory browser on the
left to locate and open the correct directory, then click on the
<!--Select Destination Directory button--><B>Select Destination
Directory</B> button under the <!--Project Directory text box-->Project
Directory text box.  You can also enter the path and directory
name directly from the keyboard if you wish.  If the directory
you enter in the text box does not exist, AnchorPage will create
it.
<P>
Please note:  All the <!--Hypertext references-->hypertext references
created by <!--Relative references-->AnchorPage use relative references
and assume that the project files will all be located in the same
directory.  You can store different projects in different directories
or many projects in the same directory, and you can move a project
from one directory to another, but you must keep all the files
from any one project together in the same directory.
<P>
The same methods can be used to indicate the <!--Template directory-->Template
Directory, the directory in which AnchorPage will look for templates
for the current project.  You can create as many different template
sets as you like, and you can use different sets of templates
for different projects.  If you wish to store more than one set
of templates in the same directory, you can rename the individual
templates; however, you must remember to indicate the new template
names in the AP.<!--Ap.ini file-->INI file.  At run time, AnchorPage
will look in the directory specified as the template directory
for the templates named in the .<!--Ini file-->INI file.<HR>

<h2>Projects</h2>
In AnchorPage, a <I>project</I> is any set of run-time options
you choose to give a name and save in a <!--Configuration file-->configuration
file.  A project can (but does not need to) include a file list.
 Saving a configuration file is useful if you have found a particular
configuration that you like and wish to use repeatedly, without
going to the trouble of memorizing that configuration or resetting
it each time.  Saving a file list as part of the project is useful
if you include multiple files in a single project - thereby creating
a single set of Synopsis Views - and occasionally need to rerun
AnchorPage as you add new files to the set.  With the configuration
and the current file list already saved, you need only add the
names of the new files to the list and click on <B>Run</B>; the
new Synopsis Views will look and function precisely as the old
ones did except that they will now contain linked entries for
the new files as well.
<P>
The <B>File </B>menu contains all the project file functionalities
- <B>New</B>, <B>Open</B>, <B>Save</B>, and <B>Save As</B>.  These
functionalities perform the same as in any other Windows application
except that they apply, in this case, only to project configuration
files (*.CFG).  You cannot open regular text or binary files in
AnchorPage. <HR>

<title>Customizing AnchorPage's Output</title>

<body bgcolor="ffffff">

<h2>Customizing the Output</h2>
Choosing the <B>Custom</B> button on the main screen will bring
up a window in which you can set options for customizing the <U>specific</U>
<U>content</U> of the output AnchorPage produces.  You can also
configure AnchorPage to produce a list of all the words it encounters
in the current document set that it doesn't recognize.  You can
then &quot;define&quot; these words and assign indexing weights
to them using <!--LexEdit-->LexEdit and rerun the document set
for more accurate results.
<P>
The Custom window acts as a template for all documents so you
do not have to save your preferred settings for each individual
document.  Any changes you make in this window will affect the
output of all subsequent runs until you change the settings again.
 Settings enabled in this window will be saved when you exit AnchorPage.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc320178560"></A><A NAME="_Toc323189205"></A><A NAME="_Toc323269726"></A><A NAME="_Toc323348646"></A><A NAME="_Toc323699394"></A><A NAME="_Toc323702826"></A><A NAME="_Toc323708758"></A><A NAME="_Toc324596777"></A><A NAME="_Toc324739976"></A><A NAME="_Toc326465556"></A><A NAME="_Toc326631926"></A><A NAME="_Toc326805236"></A><A NAME="_Toc327171527"></A><A NAME="_Toc327251187"></A><A NAME="_Toc327859903"></A><A NAME="_Toc327926504"></A><A NAME="_Toc336160589"></A><A NAME="_Toc336160998"></A><A NAME="_Toc336222087"></A><A NAME="_Toc336230179">Personal
and </A><!--Geographical Names-->Geographical Names</H3>

<P>
By default, AnchorPage will recognize most personal names and
suppress most geographical names when they stand alone.  Geographical
names will not be suppressed when they are part of a proper noun
or of a larger noun phrase.  Thus, with default settings, you
might get the following entries on the phrase page:<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone21"></A>
<P>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone22">Bailey, F. Lee<BR>
Danny Glover<BR>
Parkinson's disease<BR>
Colorado Supreme Court<BR>
Greater Baltimore Chamber of Commerce<BR>
Chicago's great fire</A>
<P>
But you would not get entries such as:
<P>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone23">Utah<BR>
Singapore</A>
<P>
Placing a check in the Geographical Names <!--CheckboxesGeographical Names -->checkbox
allows recognized <!--Geographical names-->geographical names
to be extracted even when they stand in isolation.  Where geographical
names appear in larger noun phrases or in proper nouns, as in
the first set of examples above, they will still be extracted
<U>in that context</U>, just as they would be with the default
settings. Checking  Geographical Names affects only those situations
where a geographical name stands in isolation.  It should also
be noted that this option is entirely dependent on the system
recognizing the word as a geographical name.  Where the system
does not recognize a geographical name as such, that name will
be treated more generally as a proper noun, and may therefore
show up in your output even if you have not checked the Geographical
Names <!--CheckboxesGeographical Names -->checkbox.
<P>
The Personal Names <!--CheckboxesPersonal Names -->checkbox works
much the same way, except that it pertains exclusively to recognized
personal names.  Where a personal name is recognized as such,
it will be rotated around the last name, as in the example above
&quot;Bailey, F. Lee.&quot;  Problems can occur, however, when
any element of the name is also a common noun.  The system will
treat the common noun first, unless instructed (through a user
lexicon) to do otherwise.  Thus, you may get some entries like
the last one in the above examples, &quot;Danny Glover.&quot;
 &quot;Glover&quot; is here being treated as a common noun and
therefore not being rotated.  The solution to this is to enter
&quot;Glover&quot; in a user lexicon as a last name (if you feel
confident that it is not also used in the same documents as a
common noun).  Single names standing in isolation (Bob or Wilson)
will generally not be extracted with or without this checkbox
marked.  Please see the chapter on <!--LexEdit-->LexEdit for more
details.

<P>
You <!--LexEdit-->can shape the specific content of AnchorPage's
output by raising or lowering the indexing values of selected
words in a user lexicon.  User lexicons can be created with LexEdit,
a lexicon maintenance tool supplied with AnchorPage.
<P>
Once you have created a user lexicon, you can activate or deactivate
it for any AnchorPage project by adding it to or deleting it from
the Loaded Lexicons list.  Use the single arrow buttons to move
individual lexicons in a list and the triple arrow buttons to
move all lexicons.
<P>
Unloading a lexicon does not delete a lexicon. It simply removes
it from AnchorPage's initialization file so that it will not be
used as a basis for indexing decisions.  When you delete a lexicon
in LexEdit, its name <I>is</I> removed from the list of activated
lexicons.  However, if you delete a lexicon from outside LexEdit
you will need to make sure that you remove its name from the list
of activated lexicons or you will get an error message the next
time you run AnchorPage.
<P>
Note: Before creating an index using a user lexicon, you must
close that lexicon in LexEdit.

Words</A><!--Unknown words--></H3>

<P>
Placing a check in the Unknown Words <!--CheckboxesUnknown Words -->checkbox
will cause AnchorPage to produce a list of  words it does not
recognize when a document or document set is run.  This list will
take the form of a lexicon which can be opened and edited in <!--LexEdit-->LexEdit.
 The default name is simply UNKNOWN, and by default it will be
placed in the <!--AnchorPage home directory-->AnchorPage home
directory.  You can indicate another name and another location
(most often the project directory) in the Custom dialog box.
Please note that if you leave this option selected, unknown words
will be added to this lexicon every time you run a new document
set and these new words will be merged alphabetically with the
existing words.
<P>
Once you have created an unknown list for any given project, you
must edit it in LexEdit, supplying the part of speech, suffix,
and indexing value for each word.  You can then activate this
user lexicon and rerun your project.  See the chapter on <!--LexEdit-->LexEdit
for complete details.<HR>

<h2>Templates</h2>

Templates are HTML documents that define the layout features of
AnchorPage output
pages.  With templates you can indicate what types of links you
would like to provide on each page (to return from the Presentation
segments to the Anchor page, for instance, or to return from any
of the output pages to your server's home page), what icons or
text you would like to have serve as the anchors for those links,
and any other design features or text you want to appear on a
given type of output page.  In the default templates, we have
provided links from each of the Synopsis Views back to the Anchor
page, links to retrieve the previous segment and next segment
of the current view, and we have added minor design features like
horizontal rules to separate these icons from the data on the
page.  All of these design elements can be changed simply by editing
the templates.
<P>
The AnchorPage installation program will create template subdirectories
below the ANCHOR directory (or whatever name you chose to give
the AnchorPage home directory if you changed the default name
at installation time) for each of the template sets included with
AnchorPage.  The default templates, for instance, are located
in the DEFAULT directory.
<P>
Each of the template sets contain eight templates.  Template functions
and default names are listed in Table 1.<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone24">

<P>
When editing templates or creating new ones of your own, you can
retain the default filenames, in which case you must store each
template set in a separate directory, as we have done, or you
can choose new template names.  If you choose new template names,
you can use any legal DOS filenames, but you must remember to
indicate those new names in the AP.<!--Ap.ini file-->INI file
in order to make those templates active.  (see Appendix B for
more information on the AP.INI file). You can also use any legal
DOS extension for templates, but if you wish to use a browser
to view templates as you work on them you should use an .HTM extension
since many browsers will fail to read any other extension as an
HTML document.
<P>
We also provide five alternate template sets for you to choose
from:
<P>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone26"></A><!--Template setsblckwhte-->BLCKWHTE
- a black and white template set for those who wish to use icons
(as opposed to text-only anchors), but are concerned about transfer
speed.  This is the fastest of the icon sets.<!--Icon setsblckwhte-->
<MENU>
<LI>ROCKS - another simple, <!--Template setsrocks-->fast-transferring
icon set,<!--Icon setsrocks--> but with at least a splash of color
if you find the black and white set too drab.<!--Template setsroses-->
<LI>ROSES <!--Icon setsroses-->- more color and fancier arrows.
 This set is still somewhat faster transferring than the default
set.
<LI>CAVE<!--Template setscaveIcon setscave--> - authentic electronic
cave drawings from the earliest computer users.  These are pretty
primitive, but since our ancestors only had 2400 baud, they are
also pretty fast.
<LI>MONEY<!--Template setsmoneyIcon setsmoney--> - coins of the
realm and other nifty emblems of commerce.
</MENU>

<P>
See the next section for instructions on how to easily view all
of these template sets and their associated icons.<HR>

</H2>

<P>
The ANCHOR directory (or whatever name you chose for the AnchorPage
home directory during installation) contains a template master,
TEMPLATE.HTM, that you can use to view the various template sets
provided with AnchorPage and the icons associated with those template
sets.  To view template sets, point your browser at TEMPLATE.HTM.
 The template sets are listed as primary menu items.  Under each
template set you will find an anchor for &quot;Icons&quot; and
an anchor for &quot;Templates.&quot;  Choosing &quot;Icons&quot;
will jump you to a page in which all the icons associated with
the template set are laid out on a single page for comparison.
 In some cases these <!--Icon sets-->icon sets will include extra
icons that are not in use in the template set as it is currently
laid out.  These extra icons are provided so that you can substitute
them for any of the icons in the set without losing continuity
of appearance.
<P>
Choosing &quot;Templates&quot; will jump you to the template for
the Anchor page of that template set.  You can choose any of the
anchors on the Anchor page to travel to other templates in the
set, and you should be able to navigate the entire template set
in the same way that your end user will be able to navigate the
final output pages produced by the templates.
<P>
The layout of these templates will accurately represent the layout
of the output pages they will produce with three exceptions:
<MENU>
<LI>Data - Where data will be filled in at run time, the templates
will have a simple data token and a comment indicating that this
location is reserved for data<!--Run-time tokens -->
<LI>Run-time tokens - Certain tokens cannot be assigned a physical
location on the output page until after the data has been filled
in.  For example, the horizontal link icon will come at the end
of a line of data, which will only be placed on the page at run
time.  The &quot;location&quot; of these tokens on the template
is irrelevant since their eventual location on the output pages
is hard-coded in the software; they appear on the templates only
in order to define the icons that will be used.  On the templates
we supply, these tokens appear near the bottom of the template.
<LI>Return to <!--Template Master-->Template Master - At the bottom
of each template is a double horizontal rule and an anchor marked
&quot;Return to <!--Template Master-->Template Master.&quot;
These elements appear only on the templates and will not be transferred
to the output pages.

Sets<!--Template sets-->: Changing the <!--Active templates-->Active
Templates</H2>

<P>
When you run AnchorPage, the template parser will look in the
directory you specify as the <!--Template directory-->Template
Directory in the <!--Directory dialog box-->Directory dialog box
for templates with the filenames listed in the AP.<!--Ap.ini file-->INI
file (default names are listed in Table 1).  Changing the active
template set is a simple matter of specifying a new directory.
Because all of our template sets use default names for the individual
templates, each set must be stored in a different directory to
avoid overwriting files.  If you modify existing templates or
create your own, and you decide to use the default names, you
must also store each of your template sets in separate directories.
<P>
You can, if you wish, change the default names of the templates,
which will allow you to store more than one set of templates in
a directory.  However, if you change the names of the templates,
you must also change the template names listed in the AP.<!--Ap.ini file-->INI
file so that AnchorPage will search for the correct templates
at run time.  You will also need to change the <!--Templateshypertext references on-->hypertext
references on the templates themselves if you wish to be able
to use a browser to navigate from one template to another.<HR>

<P>
If you have created or edited HTML documents before, you will
find a good deal that is familiar when editing <!--Templatesediting-->AnchorPage
templates.  (The primary exception is our use of tokens, and this
will be discussed at length in the next section.)  If you have
not worked with <!--HTML-->HTML before, you will find it a relatively
simple and straightforward mark-up language, the basics of which
can easily be learned, with the help of a good guide book, in
an hour or two (see Appendix A for a list of resources for learning
HTML). Once you have a basic grasp of  HTML, you can customize
the templates we have provided or create your own.
<P>
The only significant difficulty in <!--HTML-->HTML, especially
for new users, is visualizing how the HTML document you are editing
will appear when seen through a browser on the Web. <A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone27">
</A>This difficulty is easily overcome by using a browser as an
integral part of the editing process.  Before beginning to edit
a template, point the browser at that template and open it.  (If
you are using the Netscape Navigator provided with AnchorPage,
this is done by going to <B>File - Open File</B>, and locating
the template file on your drive.)  Leave the browser open, switch
to your editor, and make the desired changes to the template.
 At any point during the editing process, you can save the document
you are working on, switch back to your browser, click on <B>Reload</B>,
and immediately see the results of your editing.
<P>
Each of the templates is a set of HTML instructions for the design
and layout elements of the page it describes.  The template ANCHOR.<!--Templatesanchor.htm-->HTM,
for instance, determines the layout of the <!--Anchor page-->anchor
page; PRESENT.<!--Templatespresent.htm-->HTM determines the layout
of the Presentation pages. A typical layout instruction on the
 PRESENT.HTM might look like this:
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone28">&lt;!RETAP&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;ANCHOR.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;SMANCR.GIF&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!/RETAP&gt;</A>
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone29"></A>If you have used HTML before,
most of this will seem familiar to you. What will be unfamiliar
here is our use of <!--HTMLcomment codes-->HTML comment codes
(&lt;!  &gt;) to create special tokens, in this case the &quot;Return
to <!--TokensReturn to Anchor Page-->Anchor Page&quot; token,
&lt;!RETAP&GT;.  These tokens are necessary because of the special
dilemma posed by templates.  When creating most Web pages, you
are working with static anchors and static text; you know exactly
what text will be on the page, which allows you to place your
anchors precisely where you wish to have them appear.  When working
with templates, you are creating an empty form which will be filled
in at run time with variable text - the AnchorPage output - and
you must set your anchors in a position that is relative to this
variable text.  This requires that you indicate for AnchorPage
which type of output goes on which page and which anchor should
be associated with it.
<P>
All this is accomplished by means of tokens.  The next section
will discuss these tokens in detail, and then we will return to
a fuller discussion of editing templates.<HR>

</H2>

<P>
Tokens are placeholders for data that cannot be filled in until
run time.  In some cases this data will be the actual AnchorPage
output; in some cases it will be the names of files that are created
at run time.  Tokens are placed within <!--HTMLcomment codes-->HTML
comment codes so that they will not be visible when you use a
browser to examine your templates.  This allows the templates
to accurately reflect how your final output pages will look.
AnchorPage uses four primary categories of tokens:
<H3><A NAME="_Toc326465566"></A><A NAME="_Toc326631936"></A><A NAME="_Toc326805246"></A><A NAME="_Toc327171537"></A><A NAME="_Toc327251197"></A><A NAME="_Toc327859913"></A><A NAME="_Toc327926514"></A><A NAME="_Toc336160599"></A><A NAME="_Toc336161008"></A><A NAME="_Toc336222097"></A><A NAME="_Toc336230189">Link
destination tokens</A><!--Tokenslink destinationLink Destination token-->
</H3>

<P>
These tokens determine the destination point of a <!--Hypertext links-->hypertext
link.  For instance, in any project large enough to be broken
into segments, the various segments of the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View will have a <!--Next Segment icon--><B>Next Segment</B> and
<!--Previous Segment icon--><B>Previous Segment</B> icon.  The
link destination token will determine precisely where on the next
segment or previous segment the hypertext link will lead the user.
 Typically, these tokens will be placed at the top of the template
so that the hypertext jump will lead the user to the top of the
output page.  The link destination tokens are:
<PRE WIDTH=132>
TokensTOPLINKTOP Marks the anchor destination for a
LINK             direct link to one of the Anchor
		 pages.  If the source anchor on the
		 Anchor page is &quot;Table of Contents,&quot;
		 clicking on it will cause a jump to
		 wherever the TOPLINK tokentoplink
		 token has been placed on the table
		 of contents template.

NEXTLINK         On segmented pages, this marks the
tokenTokensNEXTL destination of the jump caused by
INKNEXTLINK      clicking on &quot;Next Segment.&quot;

PREVLINK         On segmented pages, this marks the
tokenTokensPREVL destination of the jump caused by
INK PREVLINK     clicking on &quot;Previous Segment.&quot;

source tokens</A>
<P>
These tokens mark the source anchor of a hypertext link, where
it will be placed on the page and what form it will take, whether
it will be an icon or a text string.  You could place this information
on the template in non-token form, writing a regular HTML <I>href</I>
to create a link from the Phrase pages, for instance, to the Anchor
page.  But if, in the next suite of documents, you changed template
names, all the handwritten <I>hrefs</I> would be invalid and you
would have to edit them manually.  Using a token to create this
link (the token says &quot;create a link between the Phrase pages
and the Anchor page, <I>whatever they are called in this suite</I>&quot;),
saves you that extra work.  Link source tokens are:

These are tokens which can be defined on the template, but whose
precise position on the page cannot be set until run time because
they are data-dependent.  The horizontal link icon, for instance,
will come at the end of a phrase or concept entry, and this entry
is not created until run time.  As a matter of convenience, <!--Run-time tokens-->run-time

</PRE>

<P>
In addition to these primary token categories, we also provide
a special &quot;comment&quot; token which can be used to place
elements on the templates which are not intended to be transferred
to the final output pages.  Comment tokens are explained in the
next section.
<P>
All <!--AnchorPage tokens-->AnchorPage tokens and their functions
are listed in Appendix C.  With the exception of the data tokens,
these are all paired set tags; that is, a token beginning is marked
with an &quot;on&quot; tag such as &lt;!horz&gt; and the end is
marked with an &quot;off&quot; tag such as &lt;!/horz&gt;.  Everything
between these two tags is considered part of the token declaration.
 In addition to the token name, token location is also part of
this token declaration. The data token, when placed on the Abstract
View template, is read by the template parser as standing for
&quot;Abstract View data&quot;; on the Presentation View template
it is read as &quot;Presentation View data.&quot;  A token placed
on a template where it would have no meaning (e.g., a data token
placed on the Anchor page template) is ignored.

Format</A><!--Token Format--></H3>

<P>
All tokens other than data tokens and comment tokens use the same
format:
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone30">&lt;!TOKENNAME&gt; X &lt;A HREF=&quot;FILENAME.HTM&quot;&gt; Y &lt;/A&gt; Z &lt;!/TOKENNAME&gt;</A>
</PRE>

<P>
The token begins with the token name placed within an HTML comment
(&lt;!TOKENNAME&GT;) so that it will not be visible when you view
the template through a browser.  The template will, therefore,
be very close in appearance to the output page it is intended
to produce.  This gives you direct visual feedback when editing
the templates.  The token ends with a token off comment (&lt;!/TOKENNAME&GT;).

<P>
The &quot;X&QUOT; after the first comment marks the &quot;pre&quot;
area of the token.  Any legal HTML can be placed here, including
plain text; it will be inserted in the output page immediately
before the anchor defined for this token.  This is useful if,
for instance, you are defining an icon as an anchor and you wish
to have it preceded by a horizontal rule, or perhaps by a paragraph
mark so that it always begins a new line.
<P>
The next section of the token marks the beginning of the anchor
and the hypertext reference for the destination of that anchor.
 This is standard HTML, though it is used slightly differently
here.  The &QUOT;FILENAME.HTM&QUOT; is actually a placeholder
in terms of token function.  At run time, the template parser
will replace this &quot;dummy&quot; filename with a valid output
filename.  All the <I>href</I>s in the templates could, in fact
be set to HREF=&QUOT;LOCAL&QUOT; or HREF=&QUOT;FAKENAME&QUOT;
and it would have no effect on AnchorPage's functionality, but
on the templates we provide we are getting double duty out of
this placeholder.  If in the above example the token were, in
fact, &LT;!<!--RETAP tokenTokensRETAP (Return to Anchor page)-->RETAP&GT;,
which is the token for returning to the Anchor page, then we would
make the destination in the <I>href</I> the Anchor template (see
the examples in the section &quot;Editing Templates&quot;).  This
will allow you, when viewing the template you are currently editing
through a browser, to click on the &quot;Return to Anchor Page&quot;
icon and be taken to the <!--Anchor template-->Anchor template.
 In this way you can navigate through the template set just as
you will be able to navigate through the final output set.
<P>
The &quot;Y&quot; after the destination anchor is the &quot;mid&quot;
area of the token.  Whatever is placed here will become the source
anchor for the jump.  Most often this will be an icon or some
sort of navigational text, such as &quot;Return&quot; or &quot;Home.&quot;
 The &LT;/A&GT; that follows the mid area closes the anchor.
<P>
The &quot;Z&quot; marks the &quot;post&quot; area of the token.
 As in the &quot;pre&quot; area, any legal HTML can be placed
here, including plain body text.  This is helpful if there is
some design element you wish to have always associated with the
source anchor; if, for instance, you wish to have it followed
by a line break or a horizontal rule.  Most of these design elements
can also be added to the template itself, outside the token, but
there are occasions, especially with run-time tokens, when it
is most convenient to have the design element a part of the token.
 The <!--AAPICON tokenTokensAAPICON (Abstract icon)-->AAPICON
token, for instance, is the token which defines the icon to be
used as the anchor for entries on the Abstract View.  You may
decide that you like the appearance of the Abstract View best
when there are two spaces inserted between the icon and the first
word in the entry.  In this case you could simply add two nonbreaking
spaces in the post area of the token declaration.
<P>
Comment tokens are also paired set tokens, but they function much
more simply and thus have a much simpler form:
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone31">&lt;!</A><!--APCOMMENT tokenTokensAPCOMMENT-->APCOMMENT&gt; . . . &lt;!/APCOMMENT&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
This token is provided so that you can place comments in your
templates and not have them transferred (even as comments) to
the output page.  Everything between the comment &quot;on&quot;
and comment &quot;off&quot; codes is considered part of the comment.
 The entire expression will be ignored by the template parser
at run time.
<P>
Data tokens, because they act only as placeholders, have an even
simpler form:
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone32">&lt;!DATA&gt;                or              &lt;!CITE&gt;</A>
</PRE>

<P>
At run time, the data token will be replaced by the appropriate
AnchorPage output data for that page.  The citation token, if
you choose to use it, will be replaced by the filename of the
<!--AnchorPage output file  filename of -->AnchorPage output file.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc327251202"></A><A NAME="_Toc327859918"></A><A NAME="_Toc327926519"></A><A NAME="_Toc336160604"></A><A NAME="_Toc336161013"></A><A NAME="_Toc336222102"></A><A NAME="_Toc336230194">Alphabetical
Tokens</A></H3>

<P>
Tokens for the alphabetical characters on the Phrase A to Z page
and the Concept A to Z page take the same general form as other
source tokens, except that in the case of alphabetical characters
two distinct source anchors must be defined for each character.
 When processing small documents separately, or when processing
documents at a very high <!--Selection Threshold-->Selection Threshold,
there will likely be occasions when there are no entries for some
letters of the alphabet.  This absence of data is indicated with
the secondary source anchor for each letter.  <A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone33">The
token for the letter &quot;H&quot; on the Concept A to Z page
might take the form:</A>
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone34">&lt;!CAPLET=H&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;CONCEPT.HTM&quot;&gt;H&lt;/A&gt;(H)&lt;!/&gt;</A>
</PRE>

<P>
The opening comment &lt;!CAPLET=H&GT; indicates which letter you
are defining.  As with other source anchors, the href statement
is actually a placeholder that will be replaced at run time.
In the above example, this href points to the Concept template
as a matter of convenience for editing the templates. The &quot;mid&quot;
area indicates the anchor to be used when entries for this letter
exist.  In this case we are using a simple capital H.  You could,
however, designate any icon or text character combination as the
anchor.  The &quot;post&quot; area indicates the anchor to be
used when no entries for the letter exist.  Here we are using
a capital H in parenthesis.  Once again, any icon or character
combination can be designated here.
<P>
Tokens for letters on the Phrase A to Z are identical except that
they begin &lt;!PAPLET=H&GT;.<HR>

<P>
The easiest way to explain editing templates is through example.
 In this section we'll look at several basic templates and how
they can be edited to incorporate various design elements.

Template: The Anchor Page</A><!--Sample templatesAnchor page-->
</H3>

<P>
A basic <!--Anchor page template-->Anchor page template would
include, at a minimum, the following:
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone35">&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;title&gt;AnchorPage&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;!--TOPLINK--&gt;
&lt;!--PAPAZ--&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;PHRASEAZ.HTM&quot;&gt;Phrases&lt;/A&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;!--/PAPAZ--&gt;
&lt;!--PAP--&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;PHRASE.HTM&quot;&gt;Phrases&lt;/A&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;!--/PAP--&gt;
&lt;!--CAPAZ--&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;CONCPTAZ.HTM&quot;&gt; Concepts&lt;/A&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;!--/CAPAZ--&gt;
&lt;!--CAP--&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;CONCEPT.HTM&quot;&gt;Concepts&lt;/A&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;!--/CAP--&gt;
&lt;!--TOC--&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;TOC.HTM&quot;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/A&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;!--/TOC--&gt;
&lt;!--AAP--&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;ABSTRACT.HTM&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!--/AAP--&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iconovex.com/HOMEPAGE.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;ICONHOME.GIF&quot; ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT=RETURN&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; Iconovex Home Page&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML</A>&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The above illustration shows how this template would appear if viewed through
a browser.  This is also a good approximation of how the final
output page produced by this template would appear except that
the final output would include only one of the &quot;Phrases&quot;
anchors and one of the &quot;Concepts&quot; anchors.
<P>
Line 1 inserts standard HTML tags to indicate the beginning of
an HTML document, beginning and end of the head, beginning and
end of the title, and the beginning of the body text.  These tags
are necessary not only so that the template itself will be in
proper HTML form (some browsers are rather finicky and will not
read HTML properly if some of these tags are missing), but also
so that the final output Anchor page will be in proper <!--HTMLproper form-->HTML
form.
<P>
Line 2 is the &quot;<!--TOPLINK tokenTokensTOPLINK -->toplink&quot;
token.  Whenever a user clicks on a &quot;Return to Anchor Page&quot;
token on one of the other output pages, they will be jumped to
the location of this token.  Most often, as in this case, this
token will be placed at the very top of the template.
<P>

<P>
Line 3 is the &quot;Phrase A to Z page&quot; token and line 4
is the &quot;Phrase View&quot; token.  Only one of these tokens
(or neither) will be read by the parser at run time, depending
on the options selected: if a Phrase A to Z page is being generated,
the &quot;Phrase A to Z&quot; token will be read; if Phrase View
is being generated, but not a Phrase A to Z page, then the &quot;<!--Phrase View token-->Phrase
View&quot; token will be read.  If no Phrase View is being generated,
both of these tokens will be ignored.
<P>
The <I>hrefs</I> that follows the token declarations are, as discussed
earlier, simple placeholders that will be replaced at run time
with the appropriate filenames.  In the meantime, however, we
have used the name of the appropriate template file as the source
anchor.  This is what allows the templates to be hypertext linked
in the same fashion as the eventual output pages they will create.

<P>
Following the source anchor is the single word &quot;Phrases&quot;
that will become the hot word on the output page.  In the &quot;post&quot;
area, after closing the anchor, is a paragraph mark which ensures
that the next token will begin on a new line.  Note that the paragraph
mark might also have been added to the template outside of the
token.  You could rewrite the lines to read:
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone37">&lt;!--PAPAZ--&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;PHRASEAZ.HTM&quot;&gt;Phrases&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!--/PAPAZ--&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;!--PAP--&gt;&lt;AHREF=&quot;PHRASE.HTM&quot;&gt;Phrases&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!--/PAP--&gt;&lt;P&gt;</A>
</PRE>

<P>
or
<PRE>
&lt;!--PAPAZ--&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;PHRASEAZ.HTM&quot;&gt;Phrases&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!--/PAPAZ--&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;!--PAP--&gt;&lt;AHREF=&quot;PHRASE.HTM&quot;&gt;Phrases&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!--/PAP--&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
However, since one of these tokens is ignored at run time, this
will leave you with an extra paragraph mark which can, under some
circumstances and with some browsers, produce an extra, unintended
space.  If the paragraph marks are placed within the token tags,
so that they become part of the token definition, one of them
will always be ignored at run time.
<P>
Lines 5 and 6 are the &quot;<!--Concept A to Z token-->Concept
A to Z&quot; token and the &quot;<!--Concept View token-->Concept
View&quot; token respectively.  These lines parallel the structure
and function of lines 3 and 4.  Lines 7 and 8 are the &quot;<!--Table of Contents token-->Table
of Contents&quot; token and &quot;Abstract&quot; token respectively.
<P>
Lines 9 and 10 define an icon (ICONHOME.GIF) as an anchor for
a jump to the home page of our server.  Line 11 closes the body
text and HTML.  As with the opening lines, these lines are added
to maintain proper <!--HTMLproper form-->HTML form on both the
template itself and on the output pages it will produce.
<P>
Below is a rendering of a modified version of this template with icons
and layout elements added.  The HTML for this modified template
looks like this:
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone38">
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;title&gt;AnchorPage&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;!--TOPLINK--&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ANCR.GIF&quot; ALIGN=MIDDLE&gt; The Anchor Page&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please choose one of the following Synopsis Views of the document:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;!--APCOMMENT--&gt;Please note that only one of the following tokens for Phrases and one of the tokens for Concepts will be used at run-time, depending on whether or not you are creating an A to Z page.  We have chosen to use the same icon in either case, but you can use different icons to indicate whether an A to Z page exists if you choose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--/APCOMMENT--&gt;

&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</A><A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone39"></A>
</PRE>

<P>

In line 3 we've added a decorative icon and caption followed by
a horizontal rule (line 4).  In lines 5 and 6 we've added body
text.  In this case we've chosen to be brief, but you could add
explanatory notes here about the document or documents you are
presenting.
<P>
Lines 7 through 11 constitute a template comment.  At run time
the template parser will ignore everything between the &quot;comment
on&quot; token (&lt;!--APCOMMENT--&gt;) and the &quot;comment
off&quot; token (&lt;!--/APCOMMENT--&gt;).  This token should
be used whenever you wish to place something on the template that
you don't want transferred to the output pages. In this case we
have used the comment to add some explanatory text about the templates
themselves.
<P>
Lines 12 through 27 are essentially the same as in the previous
example except that here we've added icons for the source anchors
and we've lined those icons up horizontally across the page rather
than vertically down it by removing the paragraph tags.  The <!--Nonbreaking spaces-->nonbreaking
spaces in the &quot;post&quot; area of each token definition are
to space the icons more evenly across the page.  At line 25 we've
also added a horizontal rule to separate the primary content of
the page from the navigational icon at the bottom.
<P>
Lines 28 and 29 make a slightly different use of a comment token.
 Here we include two horizontal rules and a source anchor for
the template master (TEMPLATE.<!--Template Master-->HTM) within
the token.  The anchor to the template master is provided so that
you can easily navigate between template sets when viewing them
in a browser.  It is enclosed in comment tokens so that it will
not be transferred to the final output pages.

Template</A><!--Sample templatesPresentation page-->: The <!--Presentation View template-->Presentation
Page</H3>

<P>
A very basic Presentation page template might include the following:
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone41">&lt;!--APCOMMENT--&gt;&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;!--/APCOMMENT--&gt;
&lt;!NEXTLINK&gt;
&lt;!PREVLINK&gt;
&lt;!RETAP&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;ANCHOR.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;SMANCR.GIF&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!/RETAP&gt;
&lt;!PREV&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;PRESENT.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;PREV.GIF&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!/PREV&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;!DATA&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;!NEXT&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;PRESENT.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;NEXT.GIF&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;!/NEXT&gt;
&lt;!--APCOMMENT--&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;&lt;!--/APCOMMENT--&gt;</A>
</PRE>

<P>
The first line in this example is peculiar to the Presentation
page.  At run time, AnchorPage will look at the source documents
for the &quot;Open Head&quot; (&lt;HEAD&gt;) and &quot;Close Head&quot;
(&lt;/HEAD&gt;) tags, and will transfer all the information between
these tags directly to the appropriate Presentation pages.  In
the process it will also write all the appropriate HTML tags to
open and close the document and the body text.  None of this information,
therefore, needs to be included on the templates (and will, in
fact, confuse AnchorPage if it is included).  However, if these
tags were not included on the template in some form, many browsers
would not be able to properly view the template itself.  The solution
here is to provide the tags for the template within comment tokens.
 In this way, the browser can read the tags and thus read the
template correctly, but the template parser will not transfer
the tags to the output pages.
<P>
<P>
Line 2 is a destination anchor.  If a user is viewing the previous
segment of the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View and clicks
on the &quot;<!--Next Segment anchor-->Next Segment&quot; anchor,
he or she is jumped to this destination.  On the first page of
any given project (where there can be no &quot;Next Segment&quot;
anchor preceding it) or on a project which is not broken into
segments, this token is simply ignored.  Normally this token is
placed at the top of the template.  Note that the &quot;<!--TOPLINK tokenTokensTOPLINK-->toplink&quot;
token is not used on the Presentation page since AnchorPage provides
no source anchors for direct jumps to the top of this view of
the document.
<P>
Line 3 is also a destination token, in this case the destination
of a jump made when a user clicks on the &quot;<!--Previous Segment anchor-->Previous
Segment&quot; anchor located on a following page.  This token
is ignored on the last segment of any project and on projects
that are not broken into segments.
<P>
These first two tokens mark destinations on the output pages,
but do not produce any visible indicators on those pages.
<P>
The token on line 4 will produce the first visible element on
the output pages.  This is the &quot;Return to <!--Anchor page token-->Anchor
Page&quot; token, and the icon for that anchor, SMANCR.GIF, will
appear in the upper left corner of the output page.  No explanatory
text or caption is attached to the icon.
<P>
Line 5 is the &quot;<!--Previous Segment token-->Previous Segment&quot;
token.  In this case the icon PREV.GIF is placed immediately to
the right of SMANCR.GIF and serves as the anchor for the jump
to the previous segment.
<P>
The paragraph tag after the &quot;<!--Previous Segment token-->Previous
Segment&quot; token adds a blank line and ensures that the output
data, which will replace the data token in line 7, begins on a
new line.  The paragraph tag after the data token has the same
effect at the end of the output data.
<P>
Line 9 is the &quot;<!--Next Segment token-->Next Segment&quot;
source token, and the icon NEXT.GIF, which is designated here
as the anchor for that token, will be the last element on the
presentation page.  Line 10 is another comment token, in this
case used to formally close the body text and HTML.  These tags
are placed inside a comment token for the same reasons as Line
1.
<P>
These ten lines of HTML on the template will produce a Presentation
page like the one shown (keep in mind that
the exact appearance is browser-dependent).  This is a fully functional
<!--Presentation View template-->Presentation View template, with
everything the user will need to navigate through the document,
but it isn't particularly distinguished in its aesthetic appeal.
 Below is an example of how the template might be edited to incorporate
a few simple design elements into the final output page.
<PRE>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone42">
&lt;!--APCOMMENT--&gt;&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;!--/APCOMMENT--&gt;

&lt;!PREVLINK&gt;

&lt;!RETAP&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;ANCHOR.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;SMANCR.GIF&quot;     ALIGN=MIDDLE&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; Return to Anchor Page&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;!/RETAP&gt;

&lt;!PREV&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;PRESENT.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;PREV.GIF&quot; ALIGN=MIDDLE&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; Previous Page&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!/PREV&gt;

&lt;HR&gt;
This is a full-text facsimile of the original document.  This symbol, &lt;A HREF=&quot;LOCAL&quot;&gt;P&lt;/A&gt;, indicates a circular link.  Clicking on this link will take you to the next occurrence of the same phrase.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;!DATA&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&quot;HTTP://WWW.ICONOVEX.COM/HOMEPAGE.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;ICONHOME.GIF&quot; ALIGN=MIDDLE&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Iconovex Home Page&lt;/STRONG&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;
&lt;!NEXT&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;PRESENT.HTM&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;NEXT.GIF&quot; ALIGN=MIDDLE&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; Next Segment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;!/NEXT&gt;

&lt;!PHRASECIRC&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;LINK.GIF&quot;&gt;&lt;!/PHRASECIRC&gt;
&lt;!CONCEPTCIRC&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;LINK.GIF&quot;&gt;&lt;!/CONCEPTCIRC&gt;
&lt;!--apcomment--&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../template.htm&quot; align=middle&gt;Return to Template Master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!--/APCOMMENT--&gt;
&lt;!--APCOMMENT--&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;&lt;!--/APCOMMENT--&gt;
</A>
</PRE>

<P>
This example begins by placing the comment token and destination
anchors in the same location as in the earlier example.  The &quot;Return
to <!--Return to Anchor Page token-->Anchor Page&quot; token is
next, but here we've added a few elements to that token.  The
text &quot;Return to Anchor Page&quot; has been added as a bold
caption, aligned with the middle of the icon.  In the &quot;post&quot;
area we've added a nonbreaking space so that the next icon won't
push up against the caption from this one.
<P>
Lines 8 and 9 are the &quot;<!--Previous Segment token-->Previous
Segment&quot; token with the same changes as were made to the
&quot;Return to Anchor Page&quot; token except that we haven't
added a nonbreaking space here since this icon is the last element
on the line.
<P>
<P>
In line 11 we add a horizontal rule to separate the navigational
icons from the text on the page.  Immediately below that horizontal
rule we've placed some explanatory text that we want to appear
at the top of each segment.  (It's important to keep in mind that
with hypertext, unlike linear text, the user may enter the document
at any point by any number of routes and that any explanatory
text or other notes that would normally be necessary at the beginning
of a linear text should be placed at the beginning of each segment
of hypertext.)
<P>
At line 15 we add a paragraph tag to separate the boilerplate
text from the output data which will replace the data token at
line 16.  At lines 17 and 18 we place a paragraph tag and a horizontal
rule to separate the data from the navigational icons that will
appear at the bottom of the segment.
<P>
In lines 19 through 23 we place anchors for returning to our server's
home page and for retrieving the next segment of the document.
 The form for these tokens is identical to the source tokens used
at the top of the template.  Once again we add nonbreaking spaces
between the icons to separate them some.
<P>
At line 24 we add a break tag to start a new line without adding
blank space, and after that we place a citation token so that
the filename will appear in the lower left corner of the segment.
 This is the final visual element defined for the output pages.
<P>
Lines 27 and 28 are <!--Run-time tokens-->run-time tokens for
phrase circular links and concept circular links respectively.
 These tokens are purely definitional in function; they describe
what will be used for the anchor for their respective links, but
they do not affect the location of the anchor.  These tokens can
be placed anywhere on the template, and are grouped at the bottom
in this case simply for convenience.  Since only one type of circular
link can be used in any given project, it would not be necessary
to define both of them, but by doing so you can change options
at run time and not have to edit the templates again.
<P>
Lines 29 and 30 are identical to the &quot;template master&quot;
lines used on the Anchor page template; they are here only as
a navigational tool for the templates and are not transferred
to the output pages.  Line 31 formally closes the body text and
HTML on the template.

<title>RTF Conversion Process</title>
<body bgcolor="ffffff">

<h2>RTF Conversion Process</h2>
HTML is the <I>lingua franca</I> of the World Wide Web.  Unfortunately,
since HTML is only a half-dozen years old, there are still relatively
few documents in HTML form.  And almost certainly some, if not
most, of the documents you will want process with AnchorPage will
<U>not</U> be in HTML form.  <!--RTFACT-->RTFact should solve
this problem for most people.
<P>
Most major word processing programs provide options for saving
files in <!--Rich Text Format--><I>Rich Text Format</I> or RTF.
 RTF uses the standard <!--ASCII character set-->ASCII character
set to record the stylistic features of a document so that those
stylistic features can be preserved with the document when it
is transported by a system that recognizes only the simple <!--ASCII character set-->ASCII
character set (most e-mail) or when it is being ported from one
word processor to another and no direct converter between the
two processors is available.  <!--RTFACT-->RTFact can take this
same RTF document and convert it to HTML.<!--RTFACT-->
<P>
RTFact recognizes the following <!--RTF style indicators-->RTF
style indicators and translates them to the appropriate HTML tags:<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone43"></A>
<P>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone44">Headings 1 through 6</A>

<LI>Special characters (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, and non-breaking space)
<LI>Character emphasis styles (bold, italic, underscore)
<LI>Bullet lists
<LI>Number lists
</MENU>

<P>

<P>
One caveat is in order; the conversion process relies on the headings
being marked with style tags.  If the headings in the original
document are set off with manual styles rather than through the
use of style tags, the RTF form of the document will not carry
the information necessary to make the conversion to heading tags
in HTML.<HR>

<P>
RTFact is automatically installed at the same time as AnchorPage,
and a separate icon for it is created in the <!--Iconovex program group-->Iconovex
program group.  Clicking on this icon brings up a simple directory
and file selection window.  The box at the left of this window
allows you to traverse directories.  The file selection box at
the center allows you to select files by: 1) double-clicking on
them, 2) highlighting them and then clicking on the directional
arrow, or 3) clicking on the triple-arrow to select all the files
in the indicated directory.  As you select them, these files appear
in the box on the right.  You can select files from any directory
or directories to be processed in a single session.  The default
file extension is .RTF, but any legal DOS extension is fine as
long as the files themselves are in RTF format.
<P>
Once you have set conversion options (see next section), clicking
on <!--Run Converter--><B>Run Converter</B> will begin the conversion
process.  The HTML files created by this process will be placed
in the directory you designate as the destination directory (<B>Options

This window opens a standard directory browser.  Double-clicking
on a directory selects it.  While you can choose any number of
source files from any number of different directories to be run
at once, you can only indicate a single destination directory.

<P>
Since HTML does not allow tabs, all tabs marked in the RTF document
must be replaced by <!--Nonbreaking spaces-->non-breaking spaces.
 On the <!--RTFactGeneral Options screen-->General Options screen
you can set the number of spaces you would like RTFact to use
for each tab replacement.  If you set the number to 0, tabs will
simply be ignored in the conversion.
<P>
Please note that we replace all tabs with a <I>fixed </I>number
of spaces rather than counting the actual number of spaces the
tab is occupying in the text.  This means that tabbed tables and
tabbed columns will not translate correctly in most cases.

<P>
On the Headings screen you can indicate the style names you have
used for headings in your documents and which HTML heading levels
you want those styles mapped to.  The <!--RTF style name-->RTF
style name will be identical to the style name set in your word
processor.  For both Microsoft Word and WordPerfect, the default
style names would simply be &quot;Heading 1&quot; &quot;Heading
2,&quot; etc., and these are the defaults set in RTFact as well.

</H3>

<P>
The tables screen allows you to set options for converting tables.
 One proposal in <!--HTML 2+tables in-->HTML 2+ is to have HTML
support tables tags, and this is the first choice on this screen.
 However, since this is only a proposal rather than an accepted
HTML specification, and since many browsers will not be able to
read table tags, we also provide the option of converting tables
to nested bullet lists.  If you choose this option, RTFact will
number the rows and then place the cell content of each row in
a bulleted list under the appropriate row number.  Below is an
example of a simple table and how RTFact will convert it using
the bullet list option.

<h2>LexEdit</h2>
LexEdit&#153; is a lexicon maintenance tool which will allow you
to create and maintain lexicons for use with  AnchorPage or Indexicon&#174;,
Iconovex's automatic indexing program. <!--Lexicons-->Lexicons
allow you to customize AnchorPage's output and are essential for
accurate indexing, especially if you index technical or specialized
documents such as legal or medical texts. With <!--LexEdit-->LexEdit,
you can build a lexicon in which you indicate those words which
are especially important in your documents. You can also use a
lexicon to suppress words that you don't want indexed. For instance,
under most circumstances AnchorPage would index the word &quot;hemostats.&quot;
This may not be desirable if you are indexing a suite of documents
on surgical procedures in which &quot;hemostats&quot; may occur
on almost every page. Using a lexicon, you could assign a Sometimes
Index value to &quot;hemostats&quot; to assure that it would be
indexed only when it occurs in conjunction with another significant
term, or you could assign a &quot;Rarely index&quot; value so
that the word would be indexed only in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
With LexEdit, you can customize AnchorPage to handle the special
requirements of your documents, and because you can create multiple
lexicons, you can maintain a different list for each of the types
of documents you index. You can create those lexicons entirely
within <!--LexEdit-->LexEdit, or you can import a text list you
have created in another text editor or word processor. LexEdit
also allows you to export your lexicon to a file so that you can
view it in a text editor or print it.
<P>
To open LexEdit, doubleclick on the LexEdit icon in the Iconovex
program group.  LexEdit is a stand-alone utility; you do not need
to have AnchorPage open in order to create or edit a user lexicon.

</H2>

<P>
As used in this guide, the term lexicon refers to a list of words
to which value fields have been added.  AnchorPage has its own
primary lexicon and bases its indexing decisions in large part
on the values assigned in that lexicon.  A user lexicon is a supplemental
lexicon in which you assign the values in order to modify the
indexing decisions AnchorPage makes. It can be used both to assure
that terms you consider important get indexed and that terms you
consider unimportant get suppressed. A well-constructed user lexicon
can greatly improve the final output. User <!--User lexiconsLexiconsuser-->lexicons
are especially important for technical and specialty terms or
common usage terms that take on special meaning in your particular
field.
<P>
By default, most nouns which are not recognized by the main lexicon
will be considered significant and will therefore be indexed.
This may not be desirable in all cases. If, for instance, you
are processing documents describing major surgical operations,
the names of some of the specialized tools related to such operations
may not be recognized by the main lexicon. You will probably not
want these tools indexed. You can prevent terms from being indexed
in most cases by entering them in a user <!--LexiconsuserUser lexicons-->lexicon
and assigning them a low indexing value.
<P>
In other circumstances a word with a common meaning may have special
significance for you. For example, if you are processing a suite
of documents about desert water management techniques, you may
wish to index every instance of &quot;rain.&quot; In this case
you would enter &quot;rain&quot; in your lexicon with a high value.
This will be effective, even though &quot;rain&quot; is also in
the primary lexicon, because the program will read the user lexicon
before looking in the primary lexicon; entries in the user lexicon
override those in the primary lexicon. A word of caution, however;
keep in mind that &quot;rain&quot; can act either as a verb or
a noun, and you must indicate this when assigning a part of speech.
If you enter &quot;rain&quot; and indicate that it is only a noun,
the syntactic analysis will be thrown off in any sentence in which
&quot;rain&quot; is used as a present tense verb.
<P>
It should also be noted that the parsing engine does not perform
automatic stemming for user lexicons. Raising the indexing value
on &quot;rain&quot; will not automatically raise the value of
&quot;raining,&quot; &quot;rains,&quot; or &quot;rained.&quot;
You must manually add these terms to your lexicon to ensure that
they are given the index value you desire. This requires more
effort when building your lexicon, but it also gives you more
control over the resulting index. You may decide, for instance,
that &quot;rains,&quot; because it can function as a general noun
- as in &quot;spring rains&quot; - is of more value than &quot;raining&quot;
or &quot;rained,&quot; both of which indicate a single instance.
Of course, neither &quot;raining&quot; nor &quot;rained&quot;
would appear in your index as an independent entry, but by raising
the values of these words, you also raise the value of any phrase
containing them. This will have the effect of bringing up more
nouns and noun phrases associated with these verbs.

To begin the process of creating a new user lexicon:
<OL>
<LI>Choose <!--LexEditFile - New--><B>File - New</B> from LexEdit's
main screen. The list box will display names of any
existing user <!--LexiconsuserUser lexicons-->lexicons so that
you will not inadvertently duplicate a name and overwrite an existing

<LI>Type in a filename for the new lexicon; do not include an

cursor will automatically be placed in the text entry box. You
may now enter any words you wish to include in the new lexicon.
If you wish to see the values associated with a word in the primary
<!--Lexiconsprimary-->lexicon, choose <B>Get</B>. The <!--Lexiconsvalues-->lexicon
values for <!--Parts of Speech-->Parts of Speech, Suffix, and
<!--Indexing value-->Indexing Value will be filled in.  (Please
note that a few hundred of the language's most common terms are
actually stored in RAM to increase operating speed; since they
are not stored in the primary lexicon, the <B>Get</B> function
will not return values for these words.)  You can now edit the
value fields, moving from field to field by using the tab key
or by placing the cursor in the appropriate box with the mouse.
Clicking on the arrow button at the right of the Syntax or Suffix
box drops down a list of allowable codes for that field. You choose
a code by clicking on it in the drop-down list. If you prefer
to use the keyboard, you can scroll through the list of values
using the arrow keys. The <!--Indexing Value-->Indexing Value
is chosen through radio buttons; selecting one of these buttons
de-selects all others. <BR>
<BR>
While you can change any or all of these value fields, we recommend
that you modify only the <!--Indexing Value-->Indexing Value for
words that are already in the primary <!--Lexiconsprimary-->lexicon.

<LI>Choose <B>Add</B> to place the word in the user <!--LexiconsuserUser lexicons-->lexicon.
This process is then repeated for each of the words you wish to
add to that lexicon.

If you are importing a file to create a new lexicon, it is probably
easiest to import the whole file at once and then edit the resulting
lexicon in the main Edit Window. If, however, you are importing
a file into an existing lexicon, it is easier to add the words
one at a time, editing their index values as you import them.
Using the <B>Add All </B>command causes the new words to be automatically
sorted into the lexicon; consequently, if you use this feature
to import a list into an existing lexicon, you will need to go
through the entire lexicon to find and evaluate the words you
have just imported. The one exception to this might be if you
are importing a file in which all of the words have the same values,
as in a list of company acronyms, for instance. In that case the
whole list can easily be imported at once, so long as you have
set your template properly before beginning the process.

<P>
The template allows you to preset the index values that will be
assigned to a word list, short format list, or lexicon you are
importing. This is especially convenient if you are importing
a list, such as a list of names or acronyms, in which all of the
words will be assigned the same value. If you are importing a
list of words of differing values, set the template for the values
you expect to be most common; you can still change the values
assigned to individual words either as you import them or as you
edit the lexicon after they are imported.
<P>
Note: If you do not assign any index values in the template, default
values are assigned whenever you import a bare word list, whether
or not the Enable Template <!--Enable Template checkboxLexEditEnable Template checkbox-->checkbox
is marked. Those default values are: <I>singular noun, no suffix,
</I>and <I>usually index</I>.  If you are importing a short format
list or a lexicon, leaving the Enable Template checkbox unmarked
will disable the template and prevent default values from being
written.  This allows you to import a short format list or a lexicon
without changing any of the currently assigned values.
<P>
To set template values:
<OL>
<LI>Choose the <B>Template</B> command button on either import

you will be importing or select <B>Default</B> to accept the default

editing session or until you reset them.

After creating and/or modifying a lexicon to your specifications,
you will need to instruct AnchorPage to use your lexicon and its
index values when indexing.  Lexicons are loaded in the Custom
window of AnchorPage.  This process loads your lexicon in front
of the primary lexicon. AnchorPage will then search through your
lexicon before the main lexicon. If a word appears in a user lexicon,
AnchorPage will use the indexing values assigned there and not
the indexing values of the primary <!--Lexiconsprimary-->lexicon.

Note:  Before creating an index using a user lexicon, you must
close that lexicon in LexEdit.
<P>
When you delete a lexicon in LexEdit, its name is also removed
from the list of activated lexicons.  However, if you delete a
lexicon from outside LexEdit you will need to make sure that you
remove its name from the list of activated lexicons or you will
get an error message the next time you run AnchorPage.

Occasionally you may find a word which seems to fit more than
one of the above categories (<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone48">Xerox
is a company name, but it may also appear in some documents as
a verb) or in none at all (Desert can be an adjective as well
as a verb and a noun). </A> In such cases you should choose the
category which most closely fits the way the word is commonly
used in your documents.

</H3>

<P>
For LexEdit's purposes we are only concerned with the limited
set of suffixes that are attached to nouns to distinguish between
singular and plural, or to verbs to distinguish between tenses.
The allowable suffixes are enumerated in the drop-down list and
need little explanation except in a few special cases:
<P>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone49"><B>-e</B> -  In verbs where
the singular indicative form ends in &quot;e&quot; (vote), the
&quot;e&quot; is considered a suffix since it must be dropped
off when adding some endings, such as &quot;ing.&quot;</A>
<MENU>
<LI><B>-x, -xed, -xied, -xing</B> -  In some verbs, a single consonant
at the end of the singular indicative form is doubled when a suffix
is added (&quot;abut&quot; becomes &quot;abutted&quot; and &quot;abutting&quot;).
In such cases the singular indicative form is considered to have
a suffix &quot;x,&quot;  which indicates to the program that there
is a second, &quot;invisible&quot; consonant which will be added
under some circumstances. In keeping with this, &quot;abutting&quot;
is listed as having a suffix &quot;xing&quot; and &quot;abutted&quot;
as having a suffix &quot;xed.&quot;
<LI><B>-ying</B> -  When the present indicative form of a verb
ends in &quot;y&quot; and the &quot;y&quot; is not dropped before
adding &quot;ing&quot; (as in &quot;carrying&quot;), the suffix
is listed as &quot;ying.&quot;
</MENU>

<P>
Note: Because LexEdit does not perform any complex stemming functions
in user lexicons, you will need to add both singular and plural
forms of any nouns you wish to have indexed, and all the tense
forms of any verb you wish to contribute to indexing; though verbs
themselves will not become primary index words, their value contributes
to the overall value of a phrase and therefore helps to determine
which phrases are analyzed for indexing purposes. If you are interested
in indexing all phrases in the text which have to do with mergers,
you will want to place a high value not only on merger and mergers,
but also on merge, merges, merging, etc.

<P>
The indexing values are fairly straightforward and self-explanatory,
but a few notes on usage may help you get the results you want.
<MENU>
<LI><B>Never Index</B><!--Indexing valuesNever Index--> - This
will have the effect of suppressing a word so that it is never
indexed. This should be used carefully with nouns and verbs, however,
since a noun or verb ranked like this will also have the effect
of breaking up or suppressing the phrase it is embedded in. It
is preferable to use the Rarely Index button on most words you
consider unimportant and <!--Never Index-->Never Index only in
extreme cases.
<LI><B>Rarely </B><!--Rarely IndexIndexing valuesRarely Index--><B>Index</B>
- Words ranked at this level will almost never show up in an index.
The exception would be if they are embedded in the middle of a
high-value phrase, in which case they may be pulled up as part
of the phrase.
<LI><B>Sometimes </B><!--Sometimes IndexIndexing valuesSometimes Index--><B>Index</B>
- Words ranked at this level will be indexed whenever they occur
with another word of equal or greater value. <A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone50">Thus
&quot;heart,&quot; if ranked at this level, would not be indexed
if it appeared in the sentence &quot;John has a good heart.&quot;
It would be indexed if it appeared in the phrase &quot;John went
in for heart surgery,&quot; and in this case it would be indexed
as &quot;Heart surgery.&quot;</A>
<LI><B>Usually </B><!--Usually IndexIndexing valuesUsually Index--><B>Index</B>
- Words ranked at this level will be indexed most of the time
under most circumstances, especially at index levels 1 and 2.
They may not be indexed if they occur in insignificant or incomplete
phrases, and they will be less likely to be indexed when the index
level is set for 4 or greater, in which case the context in which
the word appears will be the prime determiner.
<LI><B>Always </B><!--Always IndexIndexing valuesAlways Index--><B>Index</B>
- Ranking a word Always Index forces AnchorPage to index it in
virtually all circumstances, regardless of the context in which
it appears.  As in the case of Never Index, this extreme valuation
should be used with care and only in instances where you are willing
to sacrifice evaluation of contextual significance.

<H4>Multiple words and phrases</H4>

<P>
LexEdit cannot currently handle multiple word phrases as single
entries. That is, you cannot enter <A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone51">&quot;Insurance
Companies&quot; as a single term with a single value. Instead,
add &quot;Insurance&quot; and &quot;Companies&quot; as different
entries. Giving both words the same indexing value will assure
that the terms will come up in the same order in the index as
they appear in the text.  If you wish to have a phrase such as
&quot;Liability Insurance&quot; rotated (&quot;Insurance, Liability&quot;),
give the last word in the phrase a higher indexing value.  </A>An
<!--Indexable noun phrases-->indexable noun phrase will always
be rotated around the highest value word it contains.
<H4><A NAME="D2HTopicM9">Indexing Personal </A><!--Indexing personal namesPersonal names-->and
<!--Geographical Names-->Geographical Names</H4>

<P>
With the default settings, AnchorPage will include most personal
names and suppress most geographical names from indexing under
most circumstances.  You may enable and disable these options
in AnchorPage's Custom window.  Even with Personal and Geographical
Names options enabled, please note that names will only be indexed
when AnchorPage recognizes them as such.  When AnchorPage does
not recognize a name as a personal name or geographical entity,
it will treat it more generally as a proper noun.
<P>
When <!--Personal Names option-->Personal Names option is active,
first names should be assigned a &quot;Sometimes Index&quot; indexing
value. Last names should be assigned &quot;Usually Index.&quot;
 This will assure that personal names will be rotated around the
last name for index entries.
<H4><A NAME="D2HTopicM10">Unknown Words </A><!--Unknown wordsLexEditUnknown words-->
</H4>

<P>
The <!--Enable Unknown Words feature-->Enable Unknown Words feature
will generate a report of the words AnchorPage does not recognize
when it indexes a document.  This report is generated in the form
of a lexicon so that it can be opened and edited in LexEdit.
Once you have identified and ranked these words, this lexicon
can be front-loaded as a user lexicon. AnchorPage should then
be run on the document a second time. This is an important step
for generating quality indexes.  By default, AnchorPage considers
any unknown word (unless it recognizes it as a verb form) a technical
word and therefore of value for indexing purposes.  Additionally,
any sentence containing words AnchorPage does not recognize becomes
that much harder for the system to parse and disambiguate correctly.
<P>
If you often index documents which contain the same terminology
or you index a wide variety of documents, you may wish to keep
a single user lexicon to which you continue to add unknown words.
 If you typically index several distinct types of documents, such
as legal and medical documents for instance, you may wish to keep
separate lexicons for each.
<P>
In order to activate this option open the Custom window and place
a check in the Enable Unknown Words checkbox.  As long as this
option is activated a report of unknown words will be generated
each time you index a document.  If a lexicon of unknown words
already exists, the new report will be merged into that existing
lexicon.  If you wish to keep a separate lexicon of unknown words
for a particular document, you should use <B>Save As </B>to rename
the lexicon before you index any other documents.

<h2>Getting the Best Results</h2>
<OL>
<LI>Under the category &quot;Things to Consider before hitting
<B>Run</B>,&quot; remember to <!--Spellchecking-->spellcheck your
documents before running AnchorPage on them, especially if you
are not the author of the documents and cannot vouch for their
condition.  The spellchecker will not only catch misspellings,
which, if uncorrected, will come up as &quot;unknown&quot; words
and produce odd entries in your output, but will also help you
catch oddities introduced by some word processors when saving
documents to RTF or HTML (spaces added in hyphenated words, etc.).
 In general, the better the condition of the original documents,
the better the AnchorPage output will be.
<LI>For the very best results on any document suite, we recommend
that you do a preliminary run, make necessary adjustments, and
then do your final run.  In the preliminary run you should create
a list of unknown words and you should  store all your <!--Configuration settings-->configuration
settings in a <!--Configuration file-->configuration file.  Between
runs you can then add the unknown words to a user <!--LexiconsuserUser lexicons-->lexicon
using <!--LexEdit-->LexEdit and make any adjustments you feel
are necessary for obtaining the best results.  You may discover,
for instance, that you need to raise the <!--Selection Threshold-->Selection
Threshold if your output is too large or if it includes entries
you do not consider important for your purposes.
<LI>In some cases you may wish to  provide your users with a direct
link to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View so that
they can go straight to the document and browse it from the beginning
(or use circular links to jump through related phrases or concepts).
 This is most easily done by adding a line on the Anchor page
template (ANCHOR.<!--Anchor page template -->HTM is the default
name of this template).  The precise composition of the line will
depend on the filenames and extensions you have declared in the
.INI file.<BR>
<BR>
If you have not changed the defaults set in the .INI file, the
base filename for <!--Presentation Viewsegments of-->Presentation
View segments is SPP.  The default extension for output files
is .HTM.  The first segment of Presentation View, representing
the &quot;top&quot; of  the document, is numbered 0, which is
added to the base filename to form the filename for the segment.
 The default filename for the first segment of the Presentation
View is therefore SPP0.HTM.  If you have changed the defaults
in the .INI file, the filename for the first segment of the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View can be determined by the following expression:<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="IndexiconExclusionZone52">[<I>BASE_FILENAME</I>]0.[<I>EXTENSION</I>]
<BR>
<BR>
where BASE_FILENAME is the variable PP_SEGMENT as declared in
the .INI file and EXTENSION is the variable </A><!--HTML file extension-->HTML_FILE_EXT.
<BR>
<BR>
(NOTE:  While we make provision in the .INI file for changing
the default extension of your output files, we recommend that
you leave it set to .HTM unless you have some compelling reason
to change it.  Some browsers simply refuse to recognize HTML documents
unless they have this extension.)

<h2>Known Problems</h2>

Jumps to the wrong place in the document:  We have discovered
that some browsers - most notably some versions of Mosaic - have
difficulty resolving links that include a reference to a name
attribute.  If your browser has this difficulty, you will notice
it whenever you click on links that jump to a specific point within
a segment rather than simply to the top of the segment.  The symptom
will be that you will jump to the correct segment, but not necessarily
to the specific reference point (whether that reference point
be an entry in one of the Synopsis Views or a specific location
in the text in Presentation View).  A browser that resolves the
links correctly (Netscape's Navigator and Netcom's NetCruiser
both seem to do fine) will jump directly to named destination
so that the reference point will be in the first line of text
(give or take a line if the reference point wraps across a line).

<body bgcolor="ffffff">
<h2>The AP.INI File</h2>

The following elements can be set through the AP.INI file:
<P>
NETSCAPE = [0 | 1]<BR>
The NetScape browser has difficulty reading the escape sequence
for a non<!--Nonbreaking spaces-->breaking space (&amp;nbsp;).
 For full compatibility with the NetScape browser set this line
to 1 which will convert all nonbreaking spaces in the templates
and in the source data to the <!--ASCII numerical escape sequence-->ASCII
numerical escape sequence (&amp;#160;). The NetScape browser seems
to handle this just fine.  Default setting is 0.
<P>
SKIP_DOCUMENT = [0 | 1]<BR>
If set to 1 AnchorPage will simply skip any document in which
it finds the HTML to be too faulty to read.  If set to 0 AnchorPage
will display an error message and terminate processing under this
condition.  Default setting is 1.<!--HTML warnings file-->
<P>
HTML_WARNINGS_FILE = <BR>
The name of the file to which warnings are sent.  The default
name is HTML.WAR.
<P>
HTML_FILE_EXT =<BR>
Sets the extension for all output files.  The default is .HTM.
<P>
PP_SEGMENT = &quot;<I>XYZ</I>&quot;<BR>
The base filename for Presentation segments.  Each segment of
the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View will have a filename
which begins with this base name, is followed by integers, and
ends with the extension declared in the HTML_FILE_EXT variable,
as in SPP23.HTM.  The base name must be surrounded by quotes and
should be kept, on long documents especially, fairly short.  The
base name is also case sensitive.  This will not matter on DOS,
but if you are planning on moving the output files to a server
with a case-sensitive operating system you should make the case
of your base names the same as the case the filenames will have
on that operating system.  The <!--Link Case option-->Link Case
option on the interface will override this setting.  Default base
name is &quot;SPP&QUOT;.
<P>
PAP_SEGMENT = &QUOT;<I>XYZ</I>&QUOT;<BR>
The base filename for Phrase segments.  See note under PP_SEGMENT.
 Default base name is &quot;SPAP.&QUOT;
<P>
CAP_SEGMENT = &QUOT;<I>XYZ</I>&QUOT;<BR>
The base filename for Concept segments.  See note under PP_SEGMENT.
 Default base name is &QUOT;SCAP.&QUOT;

AAP_SEGMENT = &quot;<I>XYZ</I>&quot;<BR>
The base filename for Abstract segments.  See note under PP_SEGMENT.
 Default base name is &quot;SAAP.&QUOT;
<P>
TOC_SEGMENT = &quot;<I>XYZ</I>&quot;<BR>
The base filename for <!--Table of Contents segments-->Table of
Contents segments.  See note under PP_SEGMENT.  Default base name
is &quot;STOC.&QUOT;
<P>
PHRASE_AZ_PAGE = &quot;<I>XYZ</I>&quot;<BR>
The filename for the Phrase A to Z page.  This page is not segmented,
so as many as 8 characters can be used.  The extension indicated
in the <!--HTML FILE extension-->HTML_FILE_EXT variable will be
used here as well.  The quotation marks are necessary.  The default
filename is &quot;PAPAZ.&QUOT;
<P>
CONCEPT_AZ_PAGE = &quot;<I>XYZ</I>&quot;<BR>
The filename for the Concept A to Z page.  See note under PHRASE_AZ_PAGE.
 The default filename is &quot;CAPAZ.&QUOT;
<P>
HOME_PAGE = &quot;<I>XYZ</I>&quot;<BR>
The filename for the <!--Anchor pagedefault filename-->Anchor
page.  See note under PHRASE_AZ_PAGE.  The default filename is
&quot;HOME.&QUOT;<BR>
<BR>
HOME_TEMPLATE=&quot;anchor.tpl&quot;<BR>
Anchor page template name.  Do not add a path name to indicate
where the template is stored.  At run time, the template parser
will look for the template named with this variable in the directory

<P>
ABSTRACT_ICON=&quot;&quot;<BR>
The icon or marker to be used at the head of each abstract entry.
 You can indicate an icon with an image source reference or a
simple text marker such as &quot;X.&quot;  An icon or marker specified
on the Abstract template will override the default choice indicated
here.
<P>

<h2>Glossary of Terms</h2>
<H5>ABSTRACT VIEW</H5>

<P>
The Abstract View presents the significant concepts of the document
in the sequence in which they appear in the original.
<H5>CIRCULAR LINK</H5>

<P>
Hypertext links within the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View which enable jumps from one instance of an entry to the next
instance of the same entry.  Circular links can be created to
link phrases or concepts, but not both.
<H5>CONCEPT VIEW<!--CONCEPT VIEW--></H5>

<P>
The Concept View presents the significant concepts of the document
in alphabetical order.  Each significant noun or noun phrase within
the concept is extracted and used as a headword, with the entire
concept listed after the headword.  These headwords are the basis
for the alphabetical listing.
<H5>HORIZONTAL LINK</H5>

<P>
Hypertext links that provide jumps from one type of Synopsis View
to another, as from the <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View to the <!--Abstract View-->Abstract
View, or from one of the <!--Synopsis Views-->Synopsis Views to
the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation View.  By default, all
Synopsis views are linked to the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View.
<H5>PHRASE VIEW<!--PHRASE VIEW--></H5>

<P>
The Phrase View presents the significant nouns and noun phrases
of the document in alphabetical order.
<H5>PRESENTATION VIEW</H5>

<P>
This view presents a copy of the original document in its presentation
form.  It contains destination anchors for whatever Synopsis Views
you have chosen to create for your project.  It may also contain
anchors for circular links if you have chosen that option.
<H5>SELECTION THRESHOLD</H5>

<P>
This setting allows you to indicate how selective or how inclusive
you would like AnchorPage to be in selecting phrases and concepts
for the Synopsis Views.
<H5>SYNOPSIS VIEWS</H5>

<P>
A term used to refer to the <!--Table of Contents View-->Table
of Contents View, <!--Abstract View-->Abstract View, <!--Concept View-->Concept
View, and <!--Phrase View-->Phrase View collectively.  It covers
all of AnchorPage's output except for the <!--Presentation View-->Presentation
View and the Anchor page itself.
<H5>TABLE OF CONTENTS VIEW<!--TABLE OF CONTENTS VIEW--></H5>

<P>
The <!--Table of Contents View-->Table of Contents View presents
a traditional Table of Contents comprised of the document's headings.
 Up to six levels of headings can be incorporated into the Table
of Contents.
<H5>TOKEN</H5>

<P>
A token is a placeholder for variable information (text and filenames)
that will not be determined until run time.  Tokens are used on
the templates in order to allow you to indicate where you want
AnchorPage to place this information when it is determined.
<H5>URL<!--URLSUniform Resource Locator--></H5>

<P>
Uniform Resource Locator.  This is the &quot;address&quot; of
a resource (text file, image file, HTML document, video clip,
etc.) on the Internet.  It consists of a protocol descriptor (<I>http</I>
for most Web documents), the name of the server on which the file
can be found, and the path and filename on that server.

NASA's Magellan spacecraft made a dramatic conclusion to its highly successful mission at Venus when it is commanded to plunge into the planet's dense atmosphere Tuesday, October 11, 1994.
During its four years in orbit around Earth's sister planet, the spacecraft has radar-mapped 98 percent of the surface and collected high-resolution gravity data of Venus.
The purpose of the crash landing is to gain data on the planet's atmosphere and on the performance of the spacecraft as it descends.

Chapter 9
</H1>
<!--ICVX_1-->
Once the spacecraft and the radar system were ready for the mission objectives, we were prepared to get under way with the mission timeline, or itinerary (see Figure 9-1).
<A HREF="2.html#0000000245S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<H2>
Launch
</H2>
<!--ICVX_1-->
The alignment of Earth and Venus dictated that Magellan be launched between April 28 and May 29, 1989, with the best launch occurring on May 5.
The advantage of a May 5 launch date would become apparent during the VOI maneuver, when the fixed performance of the SRM would be the exact value required to put Magellan into the desired orbit.
The Mission Design Team had skillfully maximized the number of possible launch days so that delays caused by weather or shuttle problems would not prevent a launch.
<A HREF="2.html#0000000484S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
The Space Shuttle Atlantis was moved to Launch Pad 39B at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on March 22, 1989, and the Magellan/IUS combination was installed in the cargo bay on March 25.
<A HREF="2.html#0000001076S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
In preparation for launch activities, Magellan team members from JPL who were part of the launch team assumed their command posts at the Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers.
During the preceding months, they and representatives from these other two NASA centers underwent extensive training for the launch event.
Other team members remained at JPL to monitor the spacecraft's state of readiness as it rested inside the shuttle's cargo bay.
<A HREF="2.html#0000001261S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
On the 28th, however, with the countdown at Launch -31 seconds, the automatic ground software system detected a shuttle problem and the countdown came to a halt.
A hydrogen recirculation pump that cooled the shuttle engines prior to firing developed a short and stopped.
<A HREF="2.html#0000002146S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->

The sky was overcast, and strong crosswinds (greater than 12 knots) blew across the runway at the Kennedy Space Center's emergency landing site.

<!--ICVX_1-->
The Space Shuttle Atlantis compensated for the delay in launch by yaw steering into the correct orbit plane.
Sixty minutes later, with the solar panels extended as shown in Figure 9-4, the IUS ignited its two SRMs in rapid succession and propelled the spacecraft on very nearly the precise trajectory to Venus.
After firing its attitude-control thrusters for a small course correction, the IUS separated from Magellan and used its remaining fuel to move away from the spacecraft.

<H2>
Magellan's Path to Venus
</H2>
<!--ICVX_1-->
The original May 1988 launch period would have allowed Magellan to reach Venus 4 months later via a Type-I trajectory, meaning that from launch to destination, the spacecraft would have traveled less than 180 degrees around the Sun.
<A HREF="2.html#0000004965S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
However, the positions of Earth and Venus during the late-April to late-May 1989 launch period required a Type-IV trajectory (see Figure 9-5).
This meant that the spacecraft would travel between 1-1/2 to 2 times around the Sun (slightly more than 540 degrees) and that it would arrive at Venus on August 10, 1990.
While it dictated a longer cruise duration (15 months), the Type IV actually had the advantages of reductions in launch energy and Venus approach speed.
<A HREF="2.html#0000005396S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Since launch, Magellan has traveled more than 1-1/2 times around the Sun at an average speed of 113,600 kilometers per hour (71,000 miles per hour) relative to the Sun and has logged over 1.261 billion kilometers (788 million miles).
Three trajectory-correction maneuvers (TCMs) have kept the spacecraft on track for the correct aim point and arrival time at Venus.
<A HREF="2.html#0000005901S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<H2>
Back to the Drawing Board
</H2>
<!--ICVX_1-->
Magellan's Type-IV trajectory and the resultant Venus arrival date brought about some changes in the basic mapping plan developed for the 1988 mission.
<A HREF="2.html#0000006408S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
The result is that up to 18 days of mapping data will be lost around November 2, 1990, because radio interference from the Sun will make it impossible to communicate with the spacecraft.
<A HREF="2.html#0000006722S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<H2>
Cruise Activities
</H2>
<!--ICVX_1-->
It is true that people who work on interplanetary missions usually take some time after launch to reflect on what it has taken to get that far and on what lies ahead to ensure a successful mission.
<A HREF="2.html#0000007351S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Magellan team members have been occupied with two primary tasks during the cruise to Venus.
The first was to fly the spacecraft and evaluate the performance of its various subsystems and components in the actual space environment.
The second task was to plan and prepare for the activities that will occur in Venus orbit.
<A HREF="2.html#0000007640S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<H2>
Getting to Know the In-Flight Spacecraft
</H2>
<!--ICVX_1-->
The cruise period has not been a time of leisure for the spacecraft either.
<A HREF="2.html#0000008172S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Magellan has traveled farther from the Sun than Earth's orbit (149,669,000 kilometers or 93,000,000 miles) and has approached to within 104,640,000 kilometers (65,400,000 miles) of the Sun, 2,880,000 kilometers (1,800,000 miles) closer to the Sun than the orbit of Venus.
This changing environment allowed us to characterize the thermal responses of various parts of the spacecraft over a range of temperatures as these parts faced toward or away from the Sun.
Knowing these responses is referred to by spacecraft engineers as having a model.
<A HREF="2.html#0000008253S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Four gyroscopes provide the information required to determine the attitude.
Because extremely high pointing accuracy is required to successfully capture radar reflections from the planet's surface, several calibrations were conducted on the gyroscopes to provide a thorough understanding of their orientation and behavior.
<A HREF="2.html#0000009614S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Two types of gyroscope calibrations were conducted to correct two possible error sources.
The Scale Factor Calibration (SFCAL) allows correction of the difference between the amount the spacecraft thinks it has turned and the amount it has actually turned in a large-angle excursion.
The Attitude Reference Unit Calibration (ARUCAL) allows correction of the offset of the axes of the gyroscope assembly relative to the star scanner reference frame.
<A HREF="2.html#0000009947S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Pointing of the HGA was calibrated to assure its accuracy while performing the dual functions of radar mapping and telecommunications.
<A HREF="2.html#0000010490S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Useful SAR images can be obtained only if the exact range from the spacecraft to the planet's surface is known throughout each mapping pass.
Because Magellan's orbit will be highly elliptical, the range to the surface will change every moment and require frequent adjustments to the radar commands.
<A HREF="2.html#0000010747S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
The orbit-determination task relies on a navigation technique called differenced Doppler, which involves measurements of the spacecraft's signal using tracking antennas at the Spain and California (and sometimes the Australia and California) Deep Space Network (DSN) complexes.
Obtaining these measurements during cruise refined the techniques, verified the procedures to be used in orbit, and assured us that the differenced Doppler approach will provide sufficient orbit-prediction accuracy to guarantee good radar-data collection.
<A HREF="2.html#0000011161S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Other major ground test activities that involved interaction with the spacecraft were the Mapping Readiness Tests carried out at the DSN sites; these tests verified that the DSN is primed to support mapping operations.
Magellan will send 1.8 gigabits of data back to Earth during every orbit.
Additionally, the timeline allows the station only one minute to lock on the spacecraft's signal before the data flow begins.
The DSN's lockup and recording operations must occur without a hitch to avoid gaps in the Magellan Venus map.
Results of the Mapping Readiness Tests verified that lockup can occur within one minute and validated the operational procedures for capturing all of the data from the spacecraft.
<A HREF="2.html#0000011709S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
In December 1989, the radar electronics were turned on for the first time since before launch.
Both the radar system and the hardware passed muster.
This test paved the way for a more complicated test performed in May 1990, when the radar and the spacecraft were put through their paces for more than three days.
The spacecraft turned through the intricate series of maneuvers it will perform orbit after orbit as it maps the planet.
At the same time, the radar system issued its complex series of mapping commands.
This period of simulated mapping operations allowed us to verify many spacecraft and ground procedures and much of the mapping software that will drive Magellan once it is in orbit around Venus.
<A HREF="2.html#0000012650S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Star scans were performed daily to allow correction for the normal drift in spacecraft pointing, and the reaction wheels were desaturated twice daily to eliminate the momentum accumulated from small torques to the spacecraft caused by the Sun's radiation.
<A HREF="2.html#0000013449S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<H2>
Planning for Orbital Operations
</H2>
<!--ICVX_1-->
Familiarity with the spacecraft's in-flight characteristics gained during the first few months following launch allowed us to take a critical look at our plans for both the in-orbit checkout (IOC) and mapping phases and revise them where needed.
<A HREF="2.html#0000013863S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
In-orbit checkout, a thorough examination of the spacecraft and the radar, will be the first event after achieving Venus orbit.
Assembling the requirements for in-orbit tests, resolving conflicts between requirements, negotiating a fundamental plan, and working out the operational and procedural details was an intense effort conducted in parallel with the activities involved in flying the spacecraft.
<A HREF="2.html#0000014117S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Final planning for the primary mapping mission was also achieved during this period.
The prime mission involves three distinct types of geometry: nonocculted mapping, the superior conjunction phase, and the apoapsis occultation phase.
<A HREF="2.html#0000014585S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
The results of the planning efforts for IOC and mapping are described in Chapters 10 and 11, respectively.
<A HREF="2.html#0000014936S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<H2>
Practice Makes Perfect
</H2>
<!--ICVX_1-->
But the Magellan team will perform this scenario throughout the VOI maneuver and the IOC phase.
<A HREF="2.html#0000015418S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
The eight-member Mission Engineering Team has devoted a portion of the cruise period to developing and conducting operational readiness tests and various training exercises, including simulated anomalies, that have tested and evaluated our performance in carrying out the major mission functions mentioned above.

Magellan Mission to Venus
</H1>
<!--ICVX_1-->
The Magellan spacecraft was launched on May 4, 1989, arrived at Venus on August 10, 1990 and was inserted into a near-polar elliptical orbit with a periapsis altitude of 294 km at 9.5 deg. N. Radio contact with Magellan was lost on October 12, 1994.
The primary objectives of the Magellan mission were to map the surface of Venus with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and to determine the topographic relief of the planet.
At the completion of radar mapping 98% of the surface was imaged at resolutions better than 100 m, and many areas were imaged multiple times.
The image at the top of the page shows the 30-km diametar crater Adivar, with a jet-like streak extending off to the left.
The mission proceeded as follows: 04 May 1989 - Launch 10 Aug 1990 - Venus orbit insertion and spacecraft checkout 15 Sep 1990 - Cycle 1: Radar mapping (left-looking) 15 May 1991 - Cycle 2: Radar mapping (right-looking) 15 Jan 1992 - Cycle 3: Radar mapping (left-looking) 14 Sep 1992 - Cycle 4: Gravity data acquisition 24 May 1993 - Aerobraking to circular orbit 03 Aug 1993 - Cycle 5: Gravity data acquisition 30 Aug 1994 - Windmill experiment 12 Oct 1994 - Loss of radio signal 13 Oct 1994 - Expected loss of spacecraft .
<A HREF="8.html#0000000345S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
A total of 4225 usable SAR imaging orbits was obtained by Magellan.
This raw SAR data was processed into image strips called full-resolution basic image data records (F-BIDRs).
Adjacent F-BIDRs were then assembled into full-resolution mosaicked image data records (F-MIDRs).
Altimetry and radiometry composite data records (ARCDR) are available on the ARCDR CD-ROMs.
Magellan also collected radar emissivity, radar reflectivity, slope, and topographic data, available on the GxDR CD-ROMs, and gravity and radio occultation data.
The USGS has also produced a set of full-resolution mosaics called FMAPs.

The Magellan mission scientific objectives were to study land forms and tectonics, impact processes, erosion, deposition, chemical processes, and model the interior of Venus.
The gravity field of Venus is highly correlated with the surface topography, which indicates the mechanism of topographic support is unlike the Earth, and may be controlled by processes deep in the interior.

Mission Summary
</H3>
<!--ICVX_1-->
The Magellan spacecraft, named after the sixteenth-century Portuguese-born explorer whose expedition first circumnavigated the Earth, was launched May 4, 1989, and arrived at Venus on August 10, 1990.
Magellan's solid rocket motor placed it into a near-polar elliptical orbit around the planet.
During the first 8-month mapping cycle around Venus, Magellan collected radar images of 84 percent of the planet's surface, with resolution 10 times better than that of the earlier Soviet Venera 15 and 16 missions.
<A HREF="1.html#0000000669S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Precision radio tracking of the spacecraft measured Venus' gravitational field to show the planet's internal mass distribution and the forces which have created the surface features.
Magellan's data will permit the first global geological understanding of Venus, the planet most like Earth in our solar system.

Key Scientific Results
</H3>
<!--ICVX_1-->
Study of the Magellan high-resolution global images is providing evidence to understand the role of impacts, volcanism, and tectonism in the formation of Venusian surface structures.
<A HREF="1.html#0000006239S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
The surface of Venus is mostly covered by volcanic materials.
Volcanic surface features, such as vast lava plains, fields of small lava domes, and large shield volcanoes are common.
<A HREF="1.html#0000006429S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
The presence of lava channels over 6,000 kilometers long suggests river-like flows of extremely low-viscosity lava that probably erupted at a high rate.
<A HREF="1.html#0000007069S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Large pancake-shaped volcanic domes suggest the presence of a type of lava produced by extensive evolution of crustal rocks.
<A HREF="1.html#0000007228S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
The planet's tectonics is dominated by a system of global rift zones and numerous broad, low domical structures called coronae, produced by the upwelling and subsidence of magma from the mantle.
<A HREF="1.html#0000007488S"><img  src = "ball.gif"></A><p>
<br><!--/ICVX_1-->
<!--ICVX_1-->
Although Venus has a dense atmosphere, the surface reveals no evidence of substantial wind erosion, and only evidence of limited wind transport of dust and sand.

<A NAME = ANC_PP_PP_PHRASE_CIRC714></A>
<A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#ANC_PP_PP_PHRASE_CIRC7396"><strong>P</strong></A> offers six levels of detail for you to choose from.
Level 6 is the least comprehensive; it includes only the most
significant indexable terms and therefore produces the shortest
index.
Level 1 is the most comprehensive; it includes all indexable terms
and
therefore produces the largest index.  Levels 2 through 4 represent
relative increments in between.  The default level of detail is 1;
the first time you open Indexicon
<A NAME = ANC_CAP_PP_STD71146></A> in any document the level
of detail will be automatically set to 1.  However, when you open
Indexicon in a document on which it has previously been run
<A NAME = ANC_AAP_PP_STD71203></A>, the
level of detail will be reset to the level that was last used
on that document
<A NAME = ANC_AAP_PP_STD71238></A>. To change the level of detail, click on Create

<h2>
Comparing Levels
<A NAME = ANC_PAP_PP_STD725></A> of Detail
</h2>

We recommend
<A NAME = ANC_AAP_PP_STD735></A> that you experiment with different levels of detail
to find the one that is most appropriate to your documents and
the degree of comprehensiveness you want your indexes to include.
The easiest way to do this in Microsoft
<A NAME = ANC_CAP_PP_STD7383></A>
<A NAME = ANC_PP_PP_PHRASE_CIRC7384></A>
<A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#ANC_PP_PAP_CIRC114"><strong>P</strong></A> Word is to run Indexicon

<A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#ANC_PP_PP_PHRASE_CIRC73159"><strong>P</strong></A>
on a document at one level, cut the resulting index to the
clipboard
<A NAME = ANC_AAP_PP_STD73123></A>,
open a new document window,
and paste the index in it.  Now you can run Indexicon
<A NAME = ANC_CAP_PP_STD73158></A>
<A NAME = ANC_PP_PP_PHRASE_CIRC73159></A>

original
document again, this time at a different level
<A NAME = ANC_AAP_PP_STD73182></A>, repeat the cut
and paste process, and compare the two indexes directly by
splitting
the document window and bringing each of the sample indexes into
one of the windows.  Or, if you prefer, you can attach multiple
indexes to the same document and view them successively.  In order
to do this you should run Indexicon
<A NAME = ANC_CAP_PP_STD73293></A>
<A NAME = ANC_PP_PP_PHRASE_CIRC73294></A>
<A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#ANC_PP_PP_PHRASE_CIRC73324"><strong>P</strong></A> with the Generate

21. Though according<A NAME = "AO2407"></A> to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in
number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.  I say
then that victory can be achieved.<BR>
<BR>
22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from
fighting.  Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their
success.
<P>

<P>

23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.  Force
him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.<BR>
<BR>
24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know
where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.
<P>

25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch
you can attain is to conceal them; conceal<A NAME = "AO24333"></A><A NAME = "AS24334"></A><A NAME = "AS24335"></A> your dispositions, and you will
be safe from the prying of the subtlest<A NAME = "AB24362"></A> spies, from the machinations<A NAME = "AB24371"></A> of the
wisest brains.
<P>

<P>

26. How victory<A NAME = "AO2457"></A> may be produced for them out of the enemy's
<P>

own tactics--that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
<P>

<P>

27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is
the strategy out of which victory is evolved.

<P>

<P>

28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let
your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.
<P>

<P>

29. Military<A NAME = "AO2525"></A><A NAME = "AS2526"></A><A NAME = "AB2527"></A> tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course
runs away from high places and hastens downwards.
<P>

<P>

30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak.
<P>

<P>

31. Water<A NAME = "AO2565"></A> shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which
it flows; the soldier<A NAME = "AO25638"></A> works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he
is facing.
<P>

<P>

32. Therefore, just as water<A NAME = "AO25811"></A> retains no constant shape, so in warfare there
are no constant conditions.
<P>

<P>

33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby
succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.
<P>

<P>

34. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth)are not always
equally predominant; the four<A NAME = "AO26234"></A> seasons make way for each other in turn.
There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and
waxing.
<P>

<H1>VII. MANEUVERING</H1>

<P>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO2665"></A><A NAME = "AS2666"></A><A NAME = "BB2667"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB3417"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  In war, the general<A NAME = "AO26620"></A> receives his commands from the
sovereign.
<P>



2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and
harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.
<P>

3. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more
difficult.  The difficulty<A NAME = "AO26831"></A> of tactical
maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune
into gain.

<H1>Procedural Background</H1>
<P>Before us are motions<A NAME = "AO247"></A><A NAME = "AS248"></A><A NAME = "AS249"></A> for a preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs who
challenge on constitutional<A NAME = "AB2432"></A> grounds provisions of the Communications<A NAME = "AB2443"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB28047"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Decency Act
of 1996 (CDA or &quot;the Act&quot;), which constitutes Title<A NAME = "AB2470"></A> V of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, signed into law by the President on February 8,
1996.(1)  Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, &#167; 502, 110
Stat. 56, 133-35.  Plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO24143"></A><A NAME = "AS24144"></A><A NAME = "AS24145"></A> include various organizations and individuals who,
inter alia, are associated with the computer and/or communications<A NAME = "AB24179"></A> industries,
or who publish or post materials on the Internet<A NAME = "AB24201"></A><A HREF = "SPP0.HTM#BB25108"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, or belong to various citizen
groups.  See ACLU Complaint (&#182;&#182; 7-26), ALA<A NAME = "AO24231"></A><A NAME = "AS24232"></A><A NAME = "AB24233"></A> First Amended Complaint (&#182;&#182;

two challenged provisions of the CDA that are directed to communications over

infringe upon rights protected by the First<A NAME = "AB25164"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB328225"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment and the Due<A NAME = "AB25173"></A> Process Clause

States District Court for the Eastern<A NAME = "BB2675"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF1551"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> District of Pennsylvania on the day the
Act was signed, and moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin
enforcement of these two provisions of the CDA.  On February 15, 1996, following
an evidentiary hearing, Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter, to whom the case had been
assigned, granted a limited temporary restraining order, finding in a Memorandum
that 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(B) (&quot;the indecency provision&quot; of the
CDA) was unconstitutionally vague.  On the same day, Chief<A NAME = "AB26240"></A> Judge Dolores K.
Sloviter, Chief<A NAME = "AB26252"></A> Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third<A NAME = "BB26275"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF1525"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Circuit, having been requested by the parties and the district court to convene
a three-judge court, pursuant to &#167; 561(a) of the CDA, appointed such a
court consisting of, in addition to Judge Buckwalter, Judge Stewart Dalzell of
the same district, and herself, as the circuit<A NAME = "AB26373"></A> judge required by 28 U.S.C. &#167;
2284.</P>
<P>After a conference with the court, the parties entered into a stipulation,
which the court approved on February 26, 1996, wherein the Attorney General
agreed that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>she will not<A NAME = "AO285"></A><A NAME = "AS286"></A><A NAME = "AS287"></A> initiate any investigations or prosecutions for violations of
47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d) for conduct occurring after enactment of this provision

14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position<A NAME = "AO15021"></A> which makes
defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.

<P>

<P>

15. Thus it is that in war<A NAME = "AO15215"></A> the victorious strategist only seeks battle after
the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights
and afterwards looks for victory.
<P>

<P>

16. The consummate<A NAME = "AO1547"></A> leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly adheres to
method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success.
<P>

17. In respect of military method, we have,firstly, Measurement; secondly,
Estimation<A NAME = "AS15526"></A><A NAME = "AB15527"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15733"><img src="link.GIF"></A> of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances
; fifthly, Victory.
<P>

<P>

18. Measurement<A NAME = "AO1575"></A> owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to
Measurement; Calculation<A NAME = "AS15728"></A> to Estimation<A NAME = "BB15733"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF15527"><img src="link.GIF"></A> of quantity; Balancing of chances to
Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
<P>

19. A victorious<A NAME = "AO1587"></A> army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's<A NAME = "AO15828"></A><A NAME = "AS15829"></A> weight placed
in the scale against a single grain<A NAME = "AB15848"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44223"><img src="link.GIF"></A>.
<P>

20. The onrush<A NAME = "AO1597"></A> of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters
into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.

control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.

<P>

<P>

2. Fighting<A NAME = "AO1655"></A><A NAME = "AS1656"></A> with a large army under your command is nowise<A NAME = "AB16525"></A> different from
fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and
signals.
<P>

<P>

3. To ensure<A NAME = "AO1677"></A><A NAME = "AS1678"></A> that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy's<A NAME = "AB16731"></A>
attack and remain unshaken--this is effected by maneuvers direct and
indirect.<BR>
<BR>
4. That the impact<A NAME = "AO16768"></A><A NAME = "AS16769"></A> of your army may be like a grindstone<A NAME = "AB16786"></A> dashed against an
egg--this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.
<P>

<P>

5. In all fighting, the direct<A NAME = "AO16913"></A> method may be used for joining battle, but
indirect<A NAME = "AO16932"></A> methods will be needed in order to secure victory.
<P>

<P>

6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as Heaven and
Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and moon,
they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to return
once more.
<P>

<P>

7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations<A NAME = "AO17325"></A> of these
five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.
<P>

<P>

8. There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white,
and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been
seen.
<P>

<P>

9. There are not more than five cardinal tastes(sour, acrid, salt, sweet,
bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavors than can ever be
tasted.

information on the Internet<A NAME = "BB9130"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB9241"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is to access and control remote computers in &quot;real
time&quot; using &quot;telnet<A NAME = "AB9158"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB91127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.&quot;  For example, using telnet, a researcher<A NAME = "AO9173"></A><A NAME = "AS9174"></A> at
a university would be able to use the computing<A NAME = "AB9195"></A> power of a supercomputer located
at a different university.  A student<A NAME = "AO91118"></A><A NAME = "AS91119"></A><A NAME = "AS91120"></A> can use telnet<A NAME = "BB91127"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF9158"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to connect to a remote
library to access the library's<A NAME = "AB91148"></A> online card catalog program.  </P>
<P>30.  Remote information retrieval.  The final<A NAME = "AO9211"></A><A NAME = "AS9212"></A> major category of
communication may be the most well known use of the Internet<A NAME = "BB9241"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB9297"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> -- the search<A NAME = "AO9248"></A><A NAME = "AS9249"></A> for
and retrieval<A NAME = "AB9256"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23622"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of information located on remote computers.  There are three<A NAME = "AO9275"></A><A NAME = "AS9276"></A>
primary methods to locate and retrieve information on the Internet<A NAME = "BB9297"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB9727"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  </P>
<P>31. A simple<A NAME = "AO935"></A><A NAME = "AS936"></A><A NAME = "AS937"></A> method uses &quot;ftp<A NAME = "AB9315"></A>&quot; (or file transfer protocol) to list
the names of computer<A NAME = "AB9339"></A> files available on a remote computer, and to transfer one
or more of those files to an individual's local computer.  </P>
<P>32. Another<A NAME = "AO943"></A><A NAME = "AS944"></A> approach uses a program and format named &quot;gopher<A NAME = "AB9422"></A>&quot; to
guide an individual's search through the resources available on a remote
computer.  </P>
<H1>The World Wide Web</H1>
<P>33. A third approach, and fast becoming the most well-known on the Internet<A NAME = "BB9727"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB97181"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
is the &quot;World Wide Web.&quot;  The Web<A NAME = "AO9746"></A><A NAME = "AS9747"></A><A NAME = "AS9748"></A><A NAME = "AS9749"></A> utilizes a &quot;hypertext<A NAME = "AB9757"></A>&quot;
formatting language called hypertext<A NAME = "AB9767"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20333"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> markup language (HTML), and programs that &quot;browse&quot;
the Web can display HTML<A NAME = "AB9796"></A> documents containing text, images, sound, animation and
moving video.  Any HTML<A NAME = "AO97119"></A><A NAME = "AS97120"></A><A NAME = "AB97121"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB97159"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> document can include links to other types of information
or resources, so that while viewing<A NAME = "AO97152"></A><A NAME = "AS97153"></A><A NAME = "AS97154"></A> an HTML<A NAME = "BB97159"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22574"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> document that, for example,
describes resources available on the Internet<A NAME = "BB97181"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB9870"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, one<A NAME = "AO97184"></A><A NAME = "AS97185"></A> can &quot;click&quot; using a
computer<A NAME = "AB97198"></A> mouse on the description of the resource and be immediately connected
to the resource itself.  Such &quot;hyperlinks<A NAME = "AO97234"></A>&quot; allow information to be
accessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allow people to locate and
efficiently view related information even if the information is stored on
numerous computers all around the world.</P>
<P>34. Purpose.  The World<A NAME = "AO987"></A><A NAME = "AS988"></A><A NAME = "AB989"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10011"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Wide Web (W3C) was created to serve as the platform
for a global, online store of knowledge, containing information from a diversity<A NAME = "AB9857"></A>
of sources and accessible to Internet<A NAME = "BB9870"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB98126"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users around the world.  Though
information<A NAME = "AO9883"></A> on the Web is contained in individual computers, the fact that each<A NAME = "AO98108"></A><A NAME = "AS98109"></A>
of these computers is connected to the Internet<A NAME = "BB98126"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB98188"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> through W3C protocols allows all
of the information to become part of a single body of knowledge.  It is
currently the most advanced<A NAME = "AO98174"></A><A NAME = "AS98175"></A> information system developed on the Internet<A NAME = "BB98188"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10042"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and
embraces within its data model most information in previous networked
information systems such as ftp, gopher, wais, and Usenet.  </P>
<P>35. History.  W3C<A NAME = "AO996"></A><A NAME = "AS997"></A> was originally developed at CERN<A NAME = "AB9918"></A>, the European Particle
Physics Laboratory, and was initially used to allow information sharing within
internationally dispersed teams of researchers and engineers.  Originally aimed
at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread<A NAME = "AO9983"></A> to other areas and attracted
much interest in user support, resource recovery, and many other areas which
depend on collaborative and information sharing.  The Web<A NAME = "AO99134"></A><A NAME = "AS99135"></A> has extended beyond
the scientific and academic community to include communications by individuals,
non<A NAME = "BB99165"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF71148"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-profit organizations, and businesses.</P>
<P>36. Basic Operation.  The World<A NAME = "AO1009"></A><A NAME = "AS10010"></A><A NAME = "BB10011"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB1049"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Wide Web is a series of documents stored in
different computers all over the Internet<A NAME = "BB10042"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10398"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Documents contain information stored
in a variety of formats, including text, still images, sounds, and video<A NAME = "AB10075"></A>.  An
essential element of the Web is that any document has an address (rather like a
telephone number).  Most Web<A NAME = "AO100118"></A><A NAME = "AS100119"></A><A NAME = "AB100120"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10973"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> documents contain &quot;links.&quot;  These are
short sections of text or image which refer to another document.  Typically the
linked text is blue or underlined when displayed, and when selected by the user,
the referenced document is automatically displayed, wherever in the world it
actually is stored.  Links<A NAME = "AO100219"></A> for example are used to lead from overview documents
to more detailed documents, from tables of contents to particular pages, but
also as cross-references, footnotes, and new forms of information structure.
</P>
<P>37. Many organizations now have &quot;home<A NAME = "AB10112"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB106248"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pages&quot; on the Web.  These
are documents which provide a set of links designed to represent the
organization, and through links from the home<A NAME = "AB10162"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10250"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> page, guide the user directly or
indirectly to information about or relevant to that organization.  </P>
<P>38. As an example of the use of links, if these Findings<A NAME = "AO10223"></A><A NAME = "AS10224"></A> were to be put on a
World<A NAME = "AB10239"></A> Wide Web site, its home<A NAME = "BB10250"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB260155"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> page might contain links such as those:  </P>
<UL>
<LI>THE NATURE<A NAME = "AB10274"></A> OF CYBERSPACE
</LI>
<LI>CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT<A NAME = "AB10296"></A> OF CYBERSPACE
</LI>
<LI>HOW PEOPLE<A NAME = "AB102108"></A> ACCESS THE INTERNET<A NAME = "AB102115"></A>
</LI>

<LI>METHODS TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE INTERNET<A NAME = "AB102132"></A>
</LI></UL>
<P>39. Each<A NAME = "AO1033"></A> of these links takes the user of the site from the beginning of the
Findings to the appropriate section within this Adjudication.  Links<A NAME = "AO10350"></A><A NAME = "AS10351"></A><A NAME = "AS10352"></A><A NAME = "AS10353"></A> may also
take the user from the original Web<A NAME = "AB10372"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10381"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site to another Web<A NAME = "BB10381"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB200130"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site on another computer
connected to the Internet<A NAME = "BB10398"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB104110"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  These links<A NAME = "AO103103"></A> from one computer to another, from one
document to another across the Internet, are what unify the Web into a single
body of knowledge, and what makes the Web unique.  The Web<A NAME = "AO103168"></A> was designed with a
maximum target time to follow a link of one tenth of a second.</P>
<P>40. Publishing.  The World<A NAME = "AO1047"></A><A NAME = "AS1048"></A><A NAME = "BB1049"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB11228"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Wide Web exists fundamentally as a platform
through which people and organizations can communicate through shared
information.  When information is made available, it is said to be &quot;published&quot;
on the Web.  Publishing<A NAME = "AO10476"></A><A NAME = "AS10477"></A> on the Web simply requires that the &quot;publisher&quot;
has a computer connected to the Internet<A NAME = "BB104110"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10739"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and that the computer is running W3C
server software.  The computer<A NAME = "AO104134"></A><A NAME = "AS104135"></A><A NAME = "AS104136"></A> can be as simple as a small personal<A NAME = "AB104153"></A> computer
costing less than $1500 dollars or as complex as a multi-million dollar<A NAME = "AB104183"></A>
mainframe computer.  Many Web publishers choose instead to lease<A NAME = "AO104202"></A><A NAME = "AS104203"></A><A NAME = "AS104204"></A> disk<A NAME = "AB104207"></A> storage
space from someone else who has the necessary computer<A NAME = "AB104228"></A> facilities, eliminating
the need for actually owning any equipment oneself.  </P>
<P>41. The Web<A NAME = "AO1055"></A><A NAME = "AS1056"></A>, as a universe of network accessible information, contains a
variety of documents prepared with quite varying degrees of care, from the
hastily typed idea, to the professionally executed corporate<A NAME = "AB10565"></A> profile.  The power
of the Web stems from the ability of a link to point to any document, regardless
of its status or physical location.  </P>
<P>42. Information<A NAME = "AO1063"></A><A NAME = "AS1064"></A> to be published on the Web must also be formatted according
to the rules of the Web<A NAME = "AB10639"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB109126"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> standards.  These standardized formats assure that all
Web users who want to read the material will be able to view it.  Web standards
are sophisticated and flexible enough that they have grown to meet the
publishing needs of many large corporations, banks, brokerage houses, newspapers
and magazines which now publish &quot;online&quot; editions of their material,
as well as government agencies, and even courts, which use the Web to
disseminate information to the public.  At the same time, Web publishing is
simple enough that thousands<A NAME = "AO106211"></A><A NAME = "AS106212"></A> of individual users and small community
organizations are using the Web to publish their own personal &quot;home<A NAME = "BB106248"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF10112"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pages,&quot;
the equivalent of individualized newsletters about that person or organization,
which are available to everyone on the Web.  </P>
<P>43. Web<A NAME = "AO1073"></A><A NAME = "AS1074"></A> publishers have a choice to make their Web sites open to the general
pool of all Internet<A NAME = "BB10739"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB11037"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users, or close them, thus making the information
accessible only to those with advance authorization.  Many publishers choose to
keep their sites open to all in order to give their information the widest
potential audience.  In the event that the publishers choose to maintain
restrictions on access, this may be accomplished by assigning specific user
names and passwords as a prerequisite to access to the site.  Or, in the case<A NAME = "AO107180"></A><A NAME = "AS107181"></A> of
Web<A NAME = "AB107186"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB108125"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> sites maintained for internal use of one organization, access<A NAME = "AO107205"></A> will only be
allowed from other computers within that organization's local network.(11)</P>
<P>44. Searching the Web.  A variety<A NAME = "AO10811"></A><A NAME = "AS10812"></A> of systems have developed that allow users
of the Web to search particular information among all of the public<A NAME = "AB10851"></A> sites that
are part of the Web.  Services such as Yahoo<A NAME = "AO10874"></A><A NAME = "AS10875"></A><A NAME = "AS10876"></A><A NAME = "AS10877"></A><A NAME = "AS10878"></A><A NAME = "AS10879"></A>, Magellan<A NAME = "AB10882"></A>, Altavista<A NAME = "AB10885"></A>, Webcrawler<A NAME = "AB10888"></A>,
and Lycos<A NAME = "AB10894"></A> are all services known as &quot;search engines&quot; which allow users
to search for Web<A NAME = "BB108125"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB110170"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> sites that contain certain categories of information, or to
search for key words.  For example, a Web<A NAME = "AO108160"></A><A NAME = "AS108161"></A><A NAME = "AS108162"></A><A NAME = "AS108163"></A><A NAME = "AS108164"></A> user looking for the text of Supreme<A NAME = "AB108179"></A>
Court opinions would type the words &quot;Supreme<A NAME = "AB108195"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB30590"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court&quot; into a search
engine, and then be presented with a list of World<A NAME = "AB108225"></A> Wide Web sites that contain
Supreme<A NAME = "AB108238"></A> Court information.  This list would actually be a series of links to
those sites.  Having searched out a number of sites that might contain the
desired information, the user would then follow individual links, browsing
through the information on each site, until the desired material is found.  For
many content providers on the Web, the ability to be found by these search
engines is very important.  </P>
<P>45. Common standards.  The Web<A NAME = "AO1099"></A><A NAME = "AS10910"></A><A NAME = "AS10911"></A> links together disparate information on an
ever-growing number of Internet<A NAME = "AB10934"></A>-linked computers by setting common information
storage formats (HTML) and a common language for the exchange of Web<A NAME = "BB10973"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF100120"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> documents
(HTTP).  Although the information itself may be in many different formats, and
stored on computers which are not otherwise compatible, the basic<A NAME = "AO109122"></A><A NAME = "AS109123"></A> Web<A NAME = "BB109126"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF10639"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> standards
provide a basic set of standards which allow communication and exchange of
information.  Despite the fact that many types<A NAME = "AO109167"></A> of computers are used on the Web,
and the fact that many of these machines are otherwise incompatible, those who &quot;publish&quot;
information on the Web are able to communicate with those who seek to access
information with little difficulty because of these basic technical standards.
</P>
<P>46. A distributed system with no centralized control.  Running on tens of
thousands of individual computers on the Internet<A NAME = "BB11037"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB110112"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, the Web<A NAME = "AO11042"></A> is what is known as a
distributed system.  The Web<A NAME = "AO11063"></A><A NAME = "AS11064"></A><A NAME = "AS11065"></A> was designed so that organizations with computers
containing information can become part of the Web simply by attaching their
computers to the Internet<A NAME = "BB110112"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB11195"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and running appropriate World<A NAME = "AB110121"></A> Wide Web software.  No
single organization controls any membership<A NAME = "AO110140"></A><A NAME = "AS110141"></A> in the Web, nor is there any single
centralized point from which individual Web<A NAME = "BB110170"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20146"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> sites or services can be blocked
from the Web.  From a user's perspective, it may appear to be a single,
integrated system, but in reality it has no centralized control point.  </P>
<P>47. Contrast to closed databases.  The Web's open, distributed,
decentralized nature stands in sharp contrast to most information systems that
have come before it.  Private information services such as Westlaw, Lexis/Nexis,
and Dialog, have contained large storehouses of knowledge, and can be accessed
from the Internet<A NAME = "BB11195"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB11715"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> with the appropriate passwords and access software.  However,
these databases are not linked together into a single whole, as is the World
Wide Web.  </P>
<P>48. Success of the Web in research, education, and political activities.
The World<A NAME = "AO11226"></A><A NAME = "AS11227"></A><A NAME = "BB11228"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB19289"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Wide Web has become so popular because of its open, distributed, and
easy-to-use nature.  Rather than requiring those who seek information to
purchase new software or hardware, and to learn a new kind of system for each
new database of information they seek to access, the Web<A NAME = "AO112127"></A><A NAME = "AS112128"></A><A NAME = "AB112129"></A> environment makes it
easy for users to jump from one set of information to another.  By the same
token, the open<A NAME = "AO112172"></A> nature of the Web makes it easy for publishers to reach their
intended audiences without having to know in advance what kind of computer each

potential reader has, and what kind of software they will be using.  </P>
<H1>Restricting<A NAME = "AS1132"></A> Access to Unwanted<A NAME = "AB1139"></A> On-Line Material(12)</H1>
<H1>PICS</H1>
<P>49. With the rapid growth of the Internet<A NAME = "BB11715"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB11850"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, the increasing popularity of the
Web, and the existence of material online that some parents<A NAME = "AO11746"></A> may consider
inappropriate for their children, various entities have begun to build systems
intended to enable parents to control the material which comes into their homes
and may be accessible to their children.  The World<A NAME = "AO117117"></A><A NAME = "AS117118"></A><A NAME = "AS117119"></A><A NAME = "AS117120"></A><A NAME = "AB117121"></A> Wide Web Consortium launched
the PICS<A NAME = "AB117134"></A> (&quot;Platform for Internet Content Selection&quot;) program in order
to develop technical<A NAME = "AB117161"></A> standards that would support parents' ability to filter and
screen material that their children see on the Web.  </P>
<P>50. The Consortium<A NAME = "AO1185"></A> intends that PICS will provide the ability for third
parties, as well as individual content providers, to rate content on the
Internet<A NAME = "BB11850"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15919"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> in a variety of ways.  When fully implemented, PICS<A NAME = "AB11869"></A>-compatible World
Wide Web browsers, Usenet<A NAME = "AB11882"></A> News Group readers, and other Internet<A NAME = "AB11895"></A> applications,
will provide parents the ability to choose from a variety of rating services, or
a combination of services.</P>

<H1>III.</H1>
<H1>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</H1>
<P>Plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO2731"></A><A NAME = "AS2732"></A> have established a reasonable probability<A NAME = "AB27313"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40865"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of eventual success in
the litigation by demonstrating that &#167;&#167; 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(a)(2) of
the CDA<A NAME = "AO27362"></A> are unconstitutional on their face to the extent that they reach
indecency.  Sections<A NAME = "AO27389"></A> 223(d)(1) and 223(d)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional on
their face.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, no<A NAME = "AO273138"></A><A NAME = "AS273139"></A><A NAME = "AS273140"></A> party has
any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional<A NAME = "AB273161"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB409187"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> law, and therefore the
public<A NAME = "AB273172"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB30773"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> interest will be served by granting the preliminary injunction.  Elrod v.
Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74 (1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.),
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989); Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.3d 645,
653 (3d Cir. 1994).  The motions for preliminary injunction will therefore be
granted.</P>
<P>The views<A NAME = "AO2743"></A> of the members of the Court in support of these conclusions
follow.</P>
<HR>
<P>SLOVITER, Chief Judge, Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit:</P>
<H1>A.</H1>
<H1>Statutory Provisions</H1>

<P>As noted in Part I, Introduction, the plaintiffs'<A NAME = "AO28015"></A><A NAME = "AS28016"></A> motion for a preliminary
injunction is confined to portions of two provisions of the Communications<A NAME = "BB28047"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF2443"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Decency Act of 1996, &#167; 223(a) and &#167; 223(d), which they contend violate
their First<A NAME = "AB28084"></A> Amendment free speech and Fifth<A NAME = "AB28095"></A> Amendment due process rights.  To
facilitate reference, I set forth those provisions in full.  Section 223(a), the
&quot;indecency&quot; provision, subjects to criminal penalties of imprisonment
of no more than two years or a fine or both anyone who:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>1) in interstate or foreign communications . . . </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(B) by means of a telecommunications device </P>
<P>knowingly --  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and</P>
<P>(ii) initiates the transmission of, </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication
which is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication is
under 18 years of age, regardless<A NAME = "AO28655"></A> of whether the maker of such communication
placed the call or initiated the communication; . . . </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under his control to
be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be
used for such activity.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(emphasis added).</P>
<P>The term<A NAME = "AO2893"></A><A NAME = "AS2894"></A><A NAME = "AS2895"></A> &quot;telecommunications<A NAME = "AB2899"></A><A HREF = "SPP18.HTM#BB56717"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> device&quot; is specifically defined not
to include &quot;the use of an interactive<A NAME = "BB28936"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB2929"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> computer service,&quot; as that is
covered by section 223(d)(1).</P>
<P>Section 223(d), the &quot;patently offensive&quot; provision, subjects to
criminal penalties anyone who:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly--</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(A) uses an interactive<A NAME = "BB2929"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB2939"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> computer service to send to a specific person or
persons under 18 years of age, or</P>
<P>(B) uses any interactive<A NAME = "BB2939"></A><A HREF = "SPP18.HTM#BB56838"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> computer service to display in a manner available
to a person under 18 years of age, any comment, request, suggestion<A NAME = "AO29350"></A><A NAME = "AS29351"></A>, proposal,
image or other communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or
excretory<A NAME = "BB293101"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB387181"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> activities or organs, regardless of whether the use of such service
placed the call or initiated the communication; or </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications<A NAME = "BB29411"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF3970"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> facility under such person's
control to be used for an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent
that it be used for such activity.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(emphasis added).</P>
<P>Two aspects of these provisions stand out.  First, we are dealing with
criminal provisions, subjecting violators to substantial penalties.  Second, the
provisions on indecent and patently offensive communications are not parallel.</P>
<P>The government<A NAME = "AO2973"></A><A NAME = "AS2974"></A><A NAME = "AS2975"></A><A NAME = "AS2976"></A> uses the term &quot;indecent&quot; interchangeably with &quot;patently
offensive&quot; and advises that it so construes the statute in light of the
legislative<A NAME = "AB29753"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB421217"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> history and the Supreme<A NAME = "AB29762"></A> Court's analysis of the word &quot;indecent&quot;
in FCC<A NAME = "BB29781"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB385489"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  However,  the CDA<A NAME = "AO297104"></A> does not
define &quot;indecent.&quot;  Notwithstanding Congress' familiarity with
Pacifica, it enacted &#167; 223(a), covering &quot;indecent&quot;
communications, without any language confining &quot;indecent&quot; to
descriptions or depictions of &quot;sexual or excretory activities or organs,&quot;
language it included in the reference to &quot;patently offensive&quot; in &#167;
223(d)(1)(B).  Nor does &#167; 223(a) contain the phrase &quot;in context,&quot;
which the government believes is relevant.  </P>
<P>The failure to define &quot;indecent&quot; in &#167; 223(a) is thus arguably
a negative pregnant and subject to &quot;the rule of construction that an
express statutory requirement here, contrasted with statutory silence there,
shows an intent to confine the requirement to the specified instance.&quot;
Field v. Mans, 116 S.Ct. 437, 442 (1995).  See also Gozlon-Peretz v. United
States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 (1991) (&quot;'[W]here Congress includes particular
language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same
Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in
the disparate inclusion or exclusion'&quot;) (quoting Russello v. United States,
464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)).  </P>

10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack--the direct and
the indirect; yet these two<A NAME = "AO17941"></A> in combination give rise to an endless series of
maneuvers.
<P>

<P>

11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is like
moving in a circle--you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the
possibilities of their combination?
<P>

<P>

12. The onset<A NAME = "AO1837"></A> of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even roll
stones along in its course.
<P>

<P>

13. The quality<A NAME = "AO1857"></A><A NAME = "AS1858"></A> of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon<A NAME = "AB18531"></A> which
enables it to strike and destroy its victim.
<P>

<P>

14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in
his decision.<BR>
<BR>
15. Energy<A NAME = "AO18741"></A> may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the
releasing of a trigger.
<P>

<P>

16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and
yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be
without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.
<P>

<P>

17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear
postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.
<P>

<P>

18. Hiding<A NAME = "AO1935"></A> order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of
subdivision; concealing<A NAME = "AO19332"></A> courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund
of latent energy; masking<A NAME = "AO19359"></A><A NAME = "AS19360"></A> strength with weakness is to be effected by
tactical<A NAME = "AB19379"></A> dispositions.
<P>

<P>

19. Thus one<A NAME = "AO1957"></A> who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains
deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.  He sacrifices
something, that the enemy may snatch at it.
<P>

<P>

20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body of
picked men he lies in wait for him.<BR>
<BR>
21. The clever<A NAME = "AO19759"></A><A NAME = "AS19760"></A> combatant<A NAME = "AB19763"></A> looks to the effect of combined energy, and does
not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability<A NAME = "AO197100"></A> to pick out the
right men and utilize combined energy.
<P>

<P>

22. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting men become as it were
like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or stone to
remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if
four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped, to go rolling
down.
<P>

<P>

23. Thus the energy<A NAME = "AO2019"></A><A NAME = "AS20110"></A> developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a
round stone rolled down a mountain<A NAME = "AB20145"></A> thousands of feet in height.  So much on
the subject&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;of energy.
<P>

<H1>VI. WEAK<A NAME = "AS2034"></A><A NAME = "AB2035"></A> POINTS AND STRONG</H1>

<P>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO2055"></A><A NAME = "AS2056"></A><A NAME = "BB2057"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB2667"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  Whoever<A NAME = "AO20514"></A> is first in the field and
awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is
second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.
<P>

<P>

2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does
not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
<P>

3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of
his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the
enemy to draw near.
<P>

<P>

4. If the enemy<A NAME = "AO2119"></A> is taking his ease, he can harass him; if well supplied with
food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move.

<P>

<P>

5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to
places where you are not expected.
<P>

<P>

6. An army<A NAME = "AO2157"></A> may march great distances without distress, if it marches through
country where the enemy is not.
<P>

<P>

7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places
which are undefended.You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only
hold positions that cannot be attacked.
<P>

<P>

8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know
what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know
what to attack.
<P>

<P>

9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy<A NAME = "AS22117"></A><A NAME = "AB22118"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB60133"><img src="link.GIF"></A>!  Through you
we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible;
and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.

<P>

10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the
enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your
movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.
<P>

<P>

11. If we wish to fight, the enemy<A NAME = "AO22417"></A> can be forced to an engagement even
though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch.  All we need
do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
<P>

<P>

12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us
even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground.
All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way.

<p>
13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible
ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must be
divided.
<P>

<P>

14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy<A NAME = "AO22923"></A> must split up into
fractions.  Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a
whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.
<P>

<P>

15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one,
our opponents will be in dire straits.
<P>

16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the
enemy<A NAME = "AO23235"></A> will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different
points; and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the
numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately
few.<BR>
<P>

17. For should the enemy<A NAME = "AO23311"></A> strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should
he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his
left,he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will
weaken his left.  If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere
be weak.
<P>

<P>

18. Numerical<A NAME = "AO2355"></A> weakness comes from having to prepare against possible attacks
; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these
preparations against us.<BR>
<P>

19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate
from the greatest distances in order to fight.
<P>

<P>

20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left<A NAME = "AO23825"></A> wing will be
impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left,
the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much
more<A NAME = "AO23893"></A> so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI
apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI!

4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out
of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal
before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.
<P>

<P>

5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.
<P>

<P>

6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an
advantage, the chances are that you will be too late.  On the other<A NAME = "AO27457"></A> hand, to
detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage
and stores.
<P>

<P>

7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced
marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at
a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders<A NAME = "AO27685"></A> of

8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and
on this plan<A NAME = "AO27837"></A> only one-tenth&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;of your army will
reach its destination.
<P>

9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose
the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the
goal.

<P>

10. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army
will arrive.<BR>
<P>

11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost;
without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.
<P>

<P>

12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs
of our neighbors.
<P>

<P>

13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with
the face of the country--its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and
precipices, its marshes and swamps.
<P>

<P>

14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make
use of local guides.
<P>

<P>

15. In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed.
<P>

<P>

16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by
circumstances.
<P>

<P>

17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind, your compactness that of the
forest.
<P>

18. In raiding and plundering be like fire, is immovability<A NAME = "AS29721"></A><A NAME = "AB29722"></A> like a mountain.

4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided.
The preparation<A NAME = "AS9036"></A><A NAME = "AS9037"></A> of mantlets<A NAME = "AB9042"></A>, movable shelters, and various implements<A NAME = "AB9053"></A> of
war, will take up three whole months; and the piling<A NAME = "AO9076"></A> up of mounds over
against the walls will take three months more.
<P>

<P>

5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch<A NAME = "AO9221"></A><A NAME = "AS9222"></A> his men to the
assault like swarming ants<A NAME = "AB9239"></A>, with the result that one-third of his men are
slain, while the town still remains untaken.  Such are the disastrous
effects of a siege.
<P>

<P>

6. Therefore the skillful<A NAME = "AO949"></A><A NAME = "AS9410"></A> leader subdues the enemy's<A NAME = "AB9419"></A> troops without any
fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he
overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
<P>

<P>

7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and
thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.  This is the
method of attacking by stratagem.
<P>

<P>

8. It is the rule in war, if our forces<A NAME = "AO9821"></A><A NAME = "AS9822"></A> are ten to the enemy's<A NAME = "AB9833"></A> one, to
surround him; if five to one, to attack him; if twice as numerous, to divide
our army into two.
<P>

<P>

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly inferior in numbers,
we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.

<P>

<P>

10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the
end it must be captured by the larger force.
<P>

<P>

11. Now the general<A NAME = "AO1049"></A> is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete
at all points; the State<A NAME = "AO10442"></A> will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the
State<A NAME = "AO10463"></A> will be weak.<BR>
<BR>
12. There are three<A NAME = "AO10482"></A> ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army
:--
<P>

<P>

13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of
the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.
<P>

<P>

14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a
kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army.  This
causes<A NAME = "AS10861"></A> restlessness<A NAME = "AB10864"></A> in the soldier's minds.
<P>

<P>

15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,
through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.

<P>

<P>

16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come
from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the
army, and flinging victory away.
<P>

<P>

17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory:
<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(1) He will win who knows when to fight and
when not to fight.
<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(2) He will win who knows how to handle both
superior and inferior forces.
<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(3) He<A NAME = "AO11712"></A> will win whose army is animated by the
same spirit throughout all its ranks.
<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits
to take&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the enemy unprepared.
<P>
<P>

<P>52. Membership<A NAME = "AO1583"></A> in the PICS-WG includes a broad cross-section of companies
from the computer, communications, and content industries, as well as trade
associations and public interest groups.  PICS<A NAME = "AB15860"></A> technical specifications have
been agreed to, allowing the Internet community to begin to deploy products and
services based on the PICS-standards.</P>
<P>53. Until a majority<A NAME = "AO1597"></A><A NAME = "AS1598"></A> of sites on the Internet<A NAME = "BB15919"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB16525"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have been rated by a PICS
rating service, PICS<A NAME = "AO15938"></A><A NAME = "AS15939"></A> will initially function as a &quot;positive&quot; ratings
system in which only those sites that have been rated will be displayed using
PICS<A NAME = "AB15986"></A> compatible software.  In other words, PICS<A NAME = "AO15999"></A> will initially function as a
site inclusion list rather than a site exclusion list.  The default<A NAME = "AO159132"></A><A NAME = "AS159133"></A>
configuration for a PICS<A NAME = "AB159142"></A> compatible Internet application will be to block access
to all sites which have not been rated by a PICS rating service, while allowing
access to sites which have a PICS rating for appropriate content.(14)</P>

<P>54. For over a year, various companies<A NAME = "AO16213"></A><A NAME = "AS16214"></A> have marketed stand alone software
that is intended to enable parents and other adults to limit the Internet<A NAME = "BB16251"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF7088"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> access
of children.  Examples of such software include:  Cyber Patrol, CYBERsitter, The
Internet<A NAME = "AB16278"></A> Filter, Net<A NAME = "AB16283"></A> Nanny, Parental Guidance, SurfWatch, Netscape Proxy Server,
and WebTrack.  The market<A NAME = "AO162107"></A> for this type of software is growing, and there is
increasing competition among software providers to provide products.</P>
<H1>Cyber Patrol</H1>
<P>55. As more people, particularly children, began<A NAME = "AO16513"></A><A NAME = "AS16514"></A><A NAME = "AS16515"></A><A NAME = "AS16516"></A> to use the Internet<A NAME = "BB16525"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB165128"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
Microsystems<A NAME = "AB16529"></A> Software, Inc. decided to develop and market<A NAME = "AB16544"></A> Internet software
intended to empower parents to exercise individual choice over what material
their children could access.  Microsystems'<A NAME = "AO16581"></A><A NAME = "AS16582"></A> stated intent is to develop a

product which would give parents comfort that their children can reap the
benefits of the Internet<A NAME = "BB165128"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB166237"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> while shielding them from objectionable or otherwise
inappropriate materials based on the parents' own particular tastes and values.
Microsystems' product, Cyber Patrol, was developed to address this need.</P>
<P>56. Cyber<A NAME = "AO1663"></A><A NAME = "AS1664"></A><A NAME = "AS1665"></A><A NAME = "AB1666"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB166105"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Patrol was first introduced in August 1995, and is currently
available in Windows and Macintosh<A NAME = "AB16637"></A> versions.  Cyber<A NAME = "AB16642"></A> Patrol works with both
direct Internet<A NAME = "AB16655"></A> Access providers (ISPs, e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet), and
Commercial<A NAME = "AB16677"></A> Online Service Providers (e.g., America Online, Compuserv, Prodigy,

the first parental<A NAME = "AB166185"></A> empowerment application to be compatible with the PICS<A NAME = "AB166202"></A>
standard.  In February of 1996, Microsystems<A NAME = "AO166215"></A><A NAME = "AS166216"></A><A NAME = "AS166217"></A> put the first PICS<A NAME = "AB166226"></A> ratings server

4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardor damped,
<P>

your strength<A NAME = "AO615"></A> exhausted and your treasure spent, other<A NAME = "AO6118"></A> chieftains will
spring up to take advantage of your extremity.  Then no<A NAME = "AO6143"></A> man, however wise,
will be able to avert the consequences that must ensue.<BR>
<BR>
5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness<A NAME = "AO6199"></A> has never
been seen associated with long delays.
<P>

<P>

6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged
warfare.
<P>

<P>

7. It is only<A NAME = "AO659"></A> one who is thoroughly acquainted
with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of
carrying it on.
<P>

8. The skillful<A NAME = "AO667"></A> soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his
supply-wagons loaded more than twice.
<P>

<P>

9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy.  Thus the
army<A NAME = "AO6833"></A> will have food enough for its needs.
<P>

<P>

10. Poverty<A NAME = "AO705"></A><A NAME = "AS706"></A><A NAME = "AB707"></A> of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by
contributions from a distance. Contributing<A NAME = "AO7040"></A> to maintain an army at a
distance causes the people to be impoverished.<BR>
<BR>
11. On the other hand, the proximity<A NAME = "AO7085"></A> of an army causes prices to go up; and
high<A NAME = "AO70106"></A> prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.
<P>

<P>

12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry<A NAME = "AO7219"></A> will be afflicted by
heavy exactions.
<P>

<P>

13,14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes<A NAME = "AO7425"></A><A NAME = "AS7426"></A><A NAME = "AS7427"></A><A NAME = "AB7428"></A> of
the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income<A NAME = "AB7455"></A> will be
dissipated; while government expenses for broken chariots, worn<A NAME = "AS7476"></A>-out horses<A NAME = "AB7481"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44218"><img src="link.GIF"></A>,
breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective
mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its
total revenue.
<P>

<P>

15. Hence a wise general<A NAME = "AO7611"></A> makes a point of foraging on the enemy.  One<A NAME = "AO7630"></A><A NAME = "AS7631"></A><A NAME = "AS7632"></A>
cartload of the enemy's<A NAME = "AB7641"></A> provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's own, and
likewise a single picul<A NAME = "AB7668"></A> of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one's
own store.<BR>
<BR>
16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that
there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their
rewards.<BR>
<P>

17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been
taken, those should be rewarded who took the first.
Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy<A NAME = "AO7766"></A>, and the chariots
mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be
kindly treated and kept.<BR>
<BR>
18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own strength.
<BR>
<P>

19. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.

<P>

<P>

20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the
people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in
peace or in peril.
<P>

<H1>III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM</H1>

<P>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO845"></A><A NAME = "AS846"></A><A NAME = "BB847"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB1257"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  In the practical art of war, the best<A NAME = "AO8428"></A> thing of all is to
take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not
so good.  So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy
it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy
them.
<P>

<P>

2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence;
supreme<A NAME = "AO8632"></A><A NAME = "AS8633"></A> excellence consists in breaking the enemy's<A NAME = "AB8646"></A> resistance without
fighting.

3. Thus the highest<A NAME = "AO889"></A><A NAME = "AS8810"></A> form of generalship is to balk the enemy's<A NAME = "AB8827"></A> plans; the
next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces; the next<A NAME = "AO8858"></A><A NAME = "AS8859"></A> in
order is to attack the enemy's<A NAME = "AB8874"></A> army in the field; and the worst policy<A NAME = "AO8891"></A> of
all is to besiege walled cities.

<P>103.  The Government<A NAME = "AO2405"></A><A NAME = "AS2406"></A> offered very limited evidence regarding the operation
of existing age verification<A NAME = "AB24029"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB244105"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> systems, and the evidence offered was not based on
personal knowledge.  AdultCheck and Verify, existing<A NAME = "AO24060"></A><A NAME = "AS24061"></A> systems which appear to be
used for accessing commercial<A NAME = "AB24080"></A> pornographic sites, charge users for their
services.  Dr. Olsen<A NAME = "AO24099"></A><A NAME = "AS240100"></A> admitted that his knowledge of these services was derived
primarily from reading the advertisements on their Web<A NAME = "AB240135"></A> pages.  He had not
interviewed any employees of these entities, had not personally used these
systems, had no idea how many people are registered with them, and could not
testify to the reliability of their attempt at age verification.  </P>
<P>104.  At least some, if not almost all, non<A NAME = "AO24117"></A><A NAME = "AS24118"></A><A NAME = "AB24119"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24217"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-commercial organizations, such
as the ACLU, Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path AIDS Project, regard charging
listeners to access their speech as contrary to their goals of making their
materials available to a wide audience free of charge.  </P>
<P>105.  It would not be feasible for many non<A NAME = "BB24217"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB337127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-commercial organizations to
design their own adult access code screening systems because the administrative<A NAME = "AB24246"></A>
burden of creating and maintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs
involved is beyond their reach.  There was testimony that the costs would be
prohibitive even for a commercial entity such as HotWired, the online<A NAME = "AO242119"></A><A NAME = "AS242120"></A><A NAME = "AB242121"></A> version of
Wired magazine.  </P>
<P>106.  There is evidence<A NAME = "AO2437"></A><A NAME = "AS2438"></A> suggesting that adult users, particularly casual Web
browsers, would be discouraged from retrieving information that required use of
a credit<A NAME = "BB24349"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24465"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card or password.  Andrew<A NAME = "AO24358"></A><A NAME = "AS24359"></A> Anker testified that HotWired has received
many complaints from its members about HotWired's<A NAME = "AB24386"></A> registration system, which

requires only that a member supply a name, e-mail address and self-created
password.  There is concern by commercial content providers that age<A NAME = "AO243142"></A><A NAME = "AS243143"></A><A NAME = "AS243144"></A>
verification<A NAME = "AB243147"></A> requirements would decrease advertising<A NAME = "AB243156"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB50332"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and revenue because
advertisers depend on a demonstration that the sites are widely available and
frequently visited.  </P>
<P>107.  Even if credit<A NAME = "BB2447"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24492"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card verification or adult password verification were
implemented, the Government<A NAME = "AO24428"></A> presented no testimony as to how such systems could
ensure that the user of the password or credit<A NAME = "BB24465"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB3504"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card is in fact over 18.  The
burdens<A NAME = "AO24482"></A><A NAME = "AS24483"></A><A NAME = "AS24484"></A><A NAME = "AS24485"></A> imposed by credit<A NAME = "BB24492"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB483102"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card verification and adult password verification<A NAME = "BB244105"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF24029"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
systems make them effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet<A NAME = "BB244128"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB34225"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
content providers.</P>
<H1> The Government's &quot;Tagging&quot; Proposal</H1>
<P>108. The feasibility and effectiveness of &quot;tagging&quot; to restrict
children from accessing &quot;indecent&quot; speech, as proposed by the
Government has not been established.  &quot;Tagging&quot; would require content
providers to label all of their &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot;
material by imbedding a string of characters, such as &quot;XXX,&quot; in either
the URL or HTML<A NAME = "BB247118"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF20368"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  If a user could install software on his or her computer to
recognize the &quot;XXX&quot; tag, the user could screen out any content with
that tag.  Dr. Olsen proposed a &quot;-L18&quot; tag, an idea he developed for
this hearing in response to Mr. Bradner's earlier testimony that certain tagging
would not be feasible.</P>
<P>109. The parties appear to agree that it is technologically feasible -- &quot;trivial&quot;,
in the words<A NAME = "AO24834"></A><A NAME = "AS24835"></A><A NAME = "AS24836"></A> of plaintiffs' expert -- to imbed tags in URLs and HTML, and the
technology of tagging underlies both plaintiffs' PICS<A NAME = "AB24877"></A> proposal and the
Government's<A NAME = "AB24886"></A> &quot;-L18&quot; proposal.</P>
<P>110. The Government's tagging proposal would require all content providers
that post arguably &quot;indecent&quot; material to review all of their online
content, a task that would be extremely burdensome for organizations that
provide large amounts of material online which cannot afford to pay a large
staff to review all of that material.  The Carnegie<A NAME = "AO249109"></A><A NAME = "AS249110"></A><A NAME = "AS249111"></A><A NAME = "BB249112"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43423"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Library would be required to
hire numerous additional employees to review its on<A NAME = "AB249139"></A>-line files at an extremely
high cost to its limited budget.  The cost and effort would be substantial for
the Library and frequently prohibitive for others.  Witness Kiroshi Kuromiya
testified that it would be impossible for his organization, Critical Path, to
review all of its material because it has only one full and one part-time
employee.  </P>
<P>111.  The task of screening and tagging cannot be done simply by using
software which screens for certain words, as Dr. Olsen acknowledged, and we find
that determinations as to what is indecent require human judgment.  </P>
<P>112.  In lieu of reviewing each file individually, a content provider could
tag its entire site but this would prevent minors from accessing much material
that is not &quot;indecent&quot; under the CDA.  </P>
<P>113.  To be effective, a scheme such as the -L18<A NAME = "AO25221"></A> proposal would require a
worldwide consensus among speakers to use the same tag to label &quot;indecent&quot;
material.  There is currently no<A NAME = "AO25266"></A><A NAME = "AS25267"></A> such consensus, and no Internet<A NAME = "BB25278"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25397"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> speaker
currently labels its speech with the -L18 code or with any other
widely-recognized label.</P>
<P>114. Tagging also assumes the existence of software that recognizes the tags
and takes appropriate action when it notes tagged speech.  Neither commercial
Web browsers nor user-based screening software is currently configured to block
a -L18 code.  Until such software exists, all speech<A NAME = "AO25389"></A><A NAME = "AS25390"></A> on the Internet<A NAME = "BB25397"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB253246"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> will
continue to travel to whomever requests it, without hindrance.  Labelling<A NAME = "AB253120"></A> speech
has no effect in itself on the transmission (or not) of that speech.  Neither<A NAME = "AO253153"></A><A NAME = "AS253154"></A>
plaintiffs nor the Government suggest that tagging alone would shield minors
from speech or insulate a speaker from criminal<A NAME = "AB253193"></A> liability under the CDA. It
follows that all speech on any topic that is available to adults will also be
available to children using the Internet<A NAME = "BB253246"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25829"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> (unless it is blocked by screening
software running on the computer the child is using).  </P>
<P>115. There is no way that a speaker can use current technology to know if a
listener is using screening software.  </P>
<P>116. Tags can not currently activate or deactivate themselves depending on
the age or location of the receiver.  Critical<A NAME = "AO25537"></A><A NAME = "AS25538"></A><A NAME = "BB25539"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB255100"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Path, which posts on-line safer
sex instructions, would be unable to imbed tags that block its speech only in
communities where it may be regarded as indecent.  Critical<A NAME = "AO25598"></A><A NAME = "AS25599"></A><A NAME = "BB255100"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB438203"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Path, for example,
must choose either to tag its site (blocking its speech in all communities) or
not to tag, blocking its speech in none. </P>
<H1>The Problems of Offshore Content and Caching</H1>
<P>117. A large percentage, perhaps 40% or more, of content<A NAME = "AO25820"></A><A NAME = "AS25821"></A><A NAME = "AS25822"></A> on the Internet<A NAME = "BB25829"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25863"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
originates outside the United<A NAME = "BB25838"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB259122"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States.  At the hearing, a witness<A NAME = "AO25851"></A><A NAME = "AS25852"></A><A NAME = "AS25853"></A><A NAME = "AS25854"></A> demonstrated
how an Internet<A NAME = "BB25863"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB258305"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> user could access a Web<A NAME = "AB25874"></A> site of London (which presumably is on a
server in England), and then link to other sites of interest in England<A NAME = "AB258119"></A>.  A user
can sometimes discern from a URL that content is coming from overseas, since
InterNIC<A NAME = "AO258152"></A><A NAME = "AS258153"></A> allows a content provider to imbed a country code in a domain<A NAME = "AB258178"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB58386"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> name.(20)
 Foreign<A NAME = "AB258188"></A> content is otherwise indistinguishable from domestic content (as long
as it is in English), since foreign<A NAME = "AO258223"></A> speech is created, named, and posted in the
same manner as domestic speech.  There is no requirement that foreign<A NAME = "AO258262"></A> speech
contain a country code in its URL.  It is undisputed that some foreign<A NAME = "AO258291"></A><A NAME = "AS258292"></A> speech
that travels over the Internet<A NAME = "BB258305"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26413"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is sexually explicit.</P>
<P>118. The use of &quot;caching&quot; makes it difficult to determine whether
the material originated from foreign or domestic sources.  Because of the high<A NAME = "AO25947"></A><A NAME = "AS25948"></A>
cost of using the trans- Atlantic and trans<A NAME = "AB25966"></A>-Pacific cables, and because the high
demand on those cables leads to bottleneck delays, content is often &quot;cached&quot;,
or temporarily stored, on servers in the United<A NAME = "BB259122"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB259171"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States.  Material<A NAME = "AO259127"></A><A NAME = "AS259128"></A><A NAME = "AS259129"></A><A NAME = "AS259130"></A> from a foreign
source in Europe<A NAME = "AB259143"></A> can travel over the trans<A NAME = "AB259154"></A>-Atlantic cable to the receiver in the
United<A NAME = "BB259171"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB323147"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States, and pass through a domestic caching server which then stores a
copy for subsequent retrieval.  This domestic caching server, rather than the
original foreign server, will send the material from the cache to the subsequent
receivers, without placing a demand on the trans<A NAME = "AB259260"></A>-oceanic cables.  This shortcut
effectively eliminates most of the distance for both the request and the
information and, hence, most of the delay.  The caching server discards the
stored information according to its configuration (e.g., after a certain time or
as the demand for the information diminishes).  Caching<A NAME = "AO259360"></A><A NAME = "AS259361"></A> therefore advances core
Internet<A NAME = "AB259370"></A> values:  the cheap and speedy retrieval of information.</P>
<P>119. Caching is not merely an international phenomenon.  Domestic<A NAME = "AO26017"></A><A NAME = "AS26018"></A> content
providers store popular domestic material on their caching servers to avoid the
delay of successive searches for the same material and to decrease the demand on
their Internet<A NAME = "AB26077"></A> connection.  America<A NAME = "AO26082"></A><A NAME = "AS26083"></A><A NAME = "AS26084"></A><A NAME = "BB26085"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB260164"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Online can cache the home<A NAME = "AB26096"></A> page of the New
York Times on its servers when a subscriber first requests it, so that
subsequent subscribers who make the same request will receive the same home<A NAME = "BB260155"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF10162"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
page, but from America<A NAME = "BB260164"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB489152"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Online's caching service rather than from the New York
Times's server.(21)  </P>
<P>120. Put simply, to follow the example in the prior paragraph, America
Online has no control over the content that the New<A NAME = "AO26143"></A><A NAME = "AS26144"></A><A NAME = "AS26145"></A><A NAME = "AS26146"></A><A NAME = "AS26147"></A><A NAME = "AB26148"></A> York Times posts to its Web<A NAME = "BB26161"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43872"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
site, and the New<A NAME = "BB26170"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF204292"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> York Times has no control over America<A NAME = "AB26185"></A> Online's distribution
of that content from a caching server.</P>
<H1>Anonymity</H1>
<P>121. Anonymity<A NAME = "AO2643"></A><A NAME = "AS2644"></A> is important to Internet<A NAME = "BB26413"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26725"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users who seek to access sensitive
information, such as users of the Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, the
users, particularly gay youth, of Queer Resources Directory, and users of Stop
Prisoner Rape (SPR).  Many members<A NAME = "AO26488"></A><A NAME = "AS26489"></A><A NAME = "AS26490"></A> of SPR's<A NAME = "AB26495"></A> mailing list have asked to remain
anonymous due to the stigma of prisoner<A NAME = "AB264122"></A> rape.  </P>
<H1>Plaintiffs' Choices Under the CDA</H1>
<P>122. Many speakers who display<A NAME = "AO2679"></A><A NAME = "AS26710"></A><A NAME = "AS26711"></A><A NAME = "AB26712"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB342115"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> arguably indecent content on the Internet<A NAME = "BB26725"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB314223"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
must choose between silence and the risk of prosecution.  The CDA's defenses --
credit card verification, adult access codes, and adult personal identification
numbers -- are effectively unavailable for non-commercial, not-for-profit
entities.</P>
<P>123.  The plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO2685"></A><A NAME = "AS2686"></A><A NAME = "AS2687"></A> in this action are businesses, libraries<A NAME = "BB26820"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB323245"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
non-commercial and not-for-profit organizations, and educational<A NAME = "AB26840"></A> societies and
consortia.  Although some of the material that plaintiffs post online -- such as
information regarding protection from AIDS, birth<A NAME = "AB26883"></A> control or prison<A NAME = "AB26890"></A> rape -- is
sexually explicit and may be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in some communities, none of the plaintiffs is a commercial
purveyor of what is commonly termed &quot;pornography.&quot;  </P>

Internet<A NAME = "BB20231"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20292"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> provides an easy and inexpensive way for a speaker to reach a large

communication on the Internet<A NAME = "BB20292"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB202329"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are significantly lower than those associated with
use of other forms of mass communication, such as television<A NAME = "AB202127"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21743"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, radio<A NAME = "AB202130"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21738"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, newspapers,
and magazines.  This enables operation of their own Web sites not only by large
companies, such as Microsoft and Time Warner, but also by small, not-for-profit
groups, such as Stop Prisoner Rape and Critical Path AIDS Project.  The
Government's expert, Dr. Dan R. Olsen,(17) agreed that creation of a Web<A NAME = "BB202242"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB203123"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site
would cost between $1,000 and $15,000, with monthly operating costs depending on
one's goals and the Web<A NAME = "AB202281"></A> site's traffic.  Commercial online services such as

use of hypertext<A NAME = "BB20333"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF9767"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> markup language (HTML), which allows for the creation of &quot;hyperlinks&quot;

<P>79.  Because of the different forms of Internet<A NAME = "BB20515"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21066"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication, a user<A NAME = "AO20522"></A><A NAME = "AS20523"></A> of the
Internet<A NAME = "BB20530"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20565"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> may speak or listen interchangeably, blurring the distinction between &quot;speakers&quot;
and &quot;listeners&quot; on the Internet<A NAME = "BB20565"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20635"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.

are interactive<A NAME = "AB20588"></A> forms of communication, providing the user with the opportunity
both to speak and to listen.  </P>
<P>80. It follows that unlike traditional media, the barriers<A NAME = "AO20617"></A><A NAME = "AS20618"></A> to entry as a
speaker on the Internet<A NAME = "BB20635"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB2077"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> do not differ significantly from the barriers to entry
as a listener.  Once one has entered cyberspace, one may engage in the dialogue
that occurs there.  In the argot of the medium, the receiver can and does become
the content provider, and vice-versa.</P>
<P>81. The Internet<A NAME = "AO2075"></A><A NAME = "AS2076"></A><A NAME = "BB2077"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20813"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is therefore a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide

<H1>The Creation<A NAME = "AB604"></A> of the Internet and the Development<A NAME = "AB6017"></A> of Cyberspace</H1>
<OL>
<LI> The Internet<A NAME = "AO618"></A><A NAME = "AS619"></A><A NAME = "BB6110"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61357"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is not a physical or tangible entity, but rather a giant<A NAME = "AO6133"></A><A NAME = "AS6134"></A>
network which interconnects innumerable smaller groups of linked computer<A NAME = "AB6153"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61700"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
networks.  It is thus a network of networks.  This is best understood if one
considers what a linked group of computers -- referred to here as a &quot;network&quot;
-- is, and what it does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often
called &quot;local area networks&quot;).  For example, in many United<A NAME = "AB61162"></A> States
Courthouses, computers<A NAME = "AO61169"></A> are linked to each other for the purpose of exchanging
files and messages (and to share equipment such as printers).  These are
networks.
</LI>
<LI>  Some networks are &quot;closed&quot; networks, not linked to other
computers or networks.  Many networks, however, are connected to other networks,
which are in turn connected to other networks in a manner which permits each
computer in any network to communicate with computers on any other network in
the system.  This global<A NAME = "AO61328"></A><A NAME = "AS61329"></A><A NAME = "AS61330"></A> Web<A NAME = "AB61333"></A> of linked networks and computers is referred to as

the Internet<A NAME = "BB61357"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61373"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.
</LI>
<LI>  The nature of the Internet<A NAME = "BB61373"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61427"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is such that it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to determine its size at a given moment.  It is indisputable,
however, that the Internet<A NAME = "AO61425"></A><A NAME = "AS61426"></A><A NAME = "BB61427"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61468"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has experienced extraordinary growth in recent years.
 In 1981, fewer<A NAME = "AO61450"></A><A NAME = "AS61451"></A> than 300 computers were linked to the Internet<A NAME = "BB61468"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61589"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and by 1989, the
number stood at fewer than 90,000 computers.  By 1993, over 1,000,000 computers
were linked.  Today, over 9,400,000 host computers worldwide, of which
approximately 60 percent located within the United States, are estimated to be
linked to the Internet.  This count<A NAME = "AO61561"></A><A NAME = "AS61562"></A><A NAME = "AS61563"></A> does not include the personal<A NAME = "AB61574"></A> computers
people use to access the Internet<A NAME = "BB61589"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61669"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> using modems.  In all, reasonable estimates
are that as many as 40<A NAME = "AO61614"></A><A NAME = "AS61615"></A> million people around the world can and do access the
enormously flexible communication<A NAME = "AB61642"></A> Internet medium.  That figure<A NAME = "AO61651"></A><A NAME = "AS61652"></A> is expected to
grow to 200 million Internet<A NAME = "BB61669"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61713"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users by the year 1999.
</LI>
<LI>  Some of the computers<A NAME = "AO61692"></A><A NAME = "AS61693"></A><A NAME = "AS61694"></A><A NAME = "AS61695"></A> and computer<A NAME = "BB61700"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB611010"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> networks that make up the Internet<A NAME = "BB61713"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61812"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are
owned by governmental and public<A NAME = "AB61726"></A> institutions, some are owned by non-profit
organizations, and some are privately owned.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, global medium of communications -- or &quot;cyberspace&quot; --
that links people, institutions, corporations, and governments around the world.
 The Internet<A NAME = "AO61809"></A><A NAME = "AS61810"></A><A NAME = "AS61811"></A><A NAME = "BB61812"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61862"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is an international<A NAME = "AB61819"></A> system.  This communications<A NAME = "AO61826"></A><A NAME = "AS61827"></A><A NAME = "AS61828"></A><A NAME = "AB61829"></A> medium allows any
of the literally tens of millions of people with access to the Internet<A NAME = "BB61862"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61948"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to
exchange information.  These communications<A NAME = "AO61873"></A> can occur almost instantaneously,
and can be directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of people
interested in a particular subject, or to the world as a whole.

</LI>
<LI>  The Internet<A NAME = "AO61945"></A><A NAME = "AS61946"></A><A NAME = "AS61947"></A><A NAME = "BB61948"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB611172"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had its origins in 1969 as an experimental project of the
Advanced<A NAME = "AB61973"></A> Research Project Agency (&quot;ARPA&quot;), and was called ARPANET.

This network<A NAME = "AO611000"></A><A NAME = "AS611001"></A> linked computers and computer<A NAME = "BB611010"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB611222"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> networks owned by the military,
defense contractors, and university laboratories conducting defense-related
research.  The network<A NAME = "AO611044"></A><A NAME = "AS611045"></A> later allowed researchers across the country to access
directly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers<A NAME = "AB611076"></A> located at a few key
universities and laboratories.  As it evolved far beyond its research origins in
the United<A NAME = "BB611115"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6639"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States to encompass universities, corporations, and people around the
world, the ARPANET<A NAME = "AO611140"></A><A NAME = "AS611141"></A><A NAME = "AS611142"></A> came to be called the &quot;DARPA<A NAME = "AB611156"></A> Internet,&quot; and finally
just the &quot;Internet<A NAME = "BB611172"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB611847"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.&quot;
</LI>
<LI>  From its inception, the network was designed to be a decentralized,
self-maintaining series of redundant links between computers and computer<A NAME = "BB611222"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB62142"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
networks, capable of rapidly transmitting communications without direct human
involvement or control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or otherwise
unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant<A NAME = "AO611297"></A> system of linked computers was
designed to allow vital research and communications to continue even if portions
of the network were damaged, say, in a war.
</LI>
<LI>  To achieve this resilient nationwide (and ultimately global)
communications medium, the ARPANET<A NAME = "AO611381"></A> encouraged the creation of multiple links to
and from each computer (or computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer<A NAME = "AO611424"></A>
located in Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated telephone
lines) to other computers in neighboring states or on the Eastern seaboard.
Each<A NAME = "AO611477"></A> of those computers could in turn be linked to other computers, which
themselves would be linked to other computers.
</LI>
<LI>  A communication<A NAME = "AO611525"></A> sent over this redundant series of linked computers could
travel any of a number of routes to its destination.  Thus, a message<A NAME = "AO611570"></A><A NAME = "AS611571"></A> sent from
a computer in Washington, D.C<A NAME = "AB611586"></A>., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might
first be sent to a computer in Philadelphia<A NAME = "AB611620"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB213293"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and then be forwarded to a computer
in Pittsburgh<A NAME = "AB611639"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB58081"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and then to Chicago<A NAME = "AB611648"></A>, Denver<A NAME = "AB611651"></A>, and Salt<A NAME = "AB611656"></A> Lake City, before finally
reaching Palo Alto.  If the message could not travel along that path (because of
military attack, simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message<A NAME = "AO611715"></A><A NAME = "AS611716"></A><A NAME = "AS611717"></A><A NAME = "AS611718"></A><A NAME = "AS611719"></A><A NAME = "AS611720"></A>communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is this series<A NAME = "AO6223"></A><A NAME = "AS6224"></A> of
linked networks (themselves linking computers and computer networks) that is
today commonly known as the Internet<A NAME = "BB6261"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6297"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.
</LI>
<LI>  No<A NAME = "AO6269"></A><A NAME = "AS6270"></A> single entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit --
administers the Internet<A NAME = "BB6297"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB62232"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  It exists and functions as a result of the fact that
hundreds<A NAME = "AO62122"></A><A NAME = "AS62123"></A> of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer<A NAME = "BB62142"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6750"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> networks
independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange
communications and information with other computers (which in turn exchange
communications and information with still other computers).  There is no<A NAME = "AO62207"></A><A NAME = "AS62208"></A><A NAME = "AS62209"></A>
centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet<A NAME = "BB62232"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB62275"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to
control all of the information conveyed on the Internet<A NAME = "BB62275"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6311"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.
</LI></OL>
<H1>How Individuals<A NAME = "AB634"></A> Access the Internet<A NAME = "BB6311"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6533"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A></H1>
<P>12. Individuals<A NAME = "AO653"></A><A NAME = "AS654"></A> have a wide variety of avenues to access cyberspace in
general, and the Internet<A NAME = "BB6533"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6574"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> in particular.  In terms of physical access, there are
two common methods to establish an actual link to the Internet<A NAME = "BB6574"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6650"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  First, one<A NAME = "AO6579"></A><A NAME = "AS6580"></A><A NAME = "AS6581"></A> can
use a computer or computer<A NAME = "AB6594"></A> terminal that is directly (and usually permanently)
connected to a computer<A NAME = "AB65119"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65194"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> network that is itself directly or indirectly connected
to the Internet.  Second, one<A NAME = "AO65146"></A><A NAME = "AS65147"></A><A NAME = "AS65148"></A> can use a &quot;personal<A NAME = "AB65158"></A> computer&quot; with a &quot;modem&quot;
to connect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computer<A NAME = "BB65194"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7163"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> network that
is itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  As detailed below,
both direct<A NAME = "AO65228"></A><A NAME = "AS65229"></A><A NAME = "AS65230"></A> and modem<A NAME = "AB65235"></A> connections are made available to people by a wide variety
of academic, governmental, or commercial<A NAME = "AB65266"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB71107"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> entities.</P>
<P>13. Students<A NAME = "AO663"></A><A NAME = "AS664"></A><A NAME = "AS665"></A><A NAME = "AS666"></A>, faculty, researchers, and others affiliated with the vast
majority of colleges and universities in the United<A NAME = "BB6639"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB72277"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States can access the
Internet<A NAME = "BB6650"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB66266"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> through their educational<A NAME = "AB6657"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB569144"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> institutions.  Such access is often via
direct<A NAME = "AO6672"></A><A NAME = "AS6673"></A><A NAME = "AS6674"></A> connection using computers located in campus libraries<A NAME = "AB6689"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6925"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, offices, or
computer<A NAME = "AB6696"></A> centers, or may be through telephone<A NAME = "AB66109"></A> access using a modem from a
student's or professor's campus or off-campus location.  Some colleges<A NAME = "AO66142"></A><A NAME = "AS66143"></A> and
universities install &quot;ports&quot; or outlets for direct network connections
in each dormitory<A NAME = "AB66172"></A> room or provide access via computers located in common areas
in dormitories.  Such access<A NAME = "AO66201"></A> enables students and professors to use information
and content provided by the college or university itself, and to use the vast
amount of research resources and other information available on the Internet<A NAME = "BB66266"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6759"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
worldwide.</P>
<P>14.  Similarly, Internet<A NAME = "AO675"></A><A NAME = "AS676"></A><A NAME = "AB677"></A> resources and access are sufficiently important to
many corporations and other employers that those employers<A NAME = "AO6738"></A><A NAME = "AS6739"></A><A NAME = "AS6740"></A><A NAME = "AS6741"></A> link their office
computer<A NAME = "BB6750"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7284"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> networks to the Internet<A NAME = "BB6759"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6815"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and provide employees with direct or modem<A NAME = "AB6774"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB69155"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
access to the office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access might be
used by, for example, a corporation<A NAME = "AO67117"></A><A NAME = "AS67118"></A> involved in scientific or medical<A NAME = "AB67129"></A> research
or manufacturing to enable corporate employees to exchange information and ideas
with academic researchers in their fields.</P>
<P>15.  Those who lack access to the Internet<A NAME = "BB6815"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6898"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> through their schools or
employers still have a variety of ways they can access the Internet.  Many
communities<A NAME = "AO6852"></A><A NAME = "AS6853"></A> across the country have established &quot;free-nets&quot; or
community networks to provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet<A NAME = "BB6898"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6916"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
(and to provide local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The first<A NAME = "AO68123"></A><A NAME = "AS68124"></A><A NAME = "AS68125"></A><A NAME = "AS68126"></A><A NAME = "AS68127"></A><A NAME = "AS68128"></A><A NAME = "AS68129"></A><A NAME = "AS68130"></A> such

community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community Computer System, was
established in 1986, and free-nets now exist in scores of communities as diverse
as Richmond<A NAME = "BB68186"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF611760"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, Virginia<A NAME = "AB68189"></A>, Tallahassee<A NAME = "AB68192"></A>, Florida<A NAME = "AB68195"></A>, Seattle<A NAME = "AB68198"></A>, Washington, and San<A NAME = "AB68205"></A> Diego,
California<A NAME = "AB68211"></A>.  Individuals<A NAME = "AO68214"></A><A NAME = "AS68215"></A> typically can access free-nets at little or no cost via
modem<A NAME = "AB68240"></A> connection or by using computers available in community buildings.
Free-nets are often operated by a local library, educational institution, or
non-profit community group.</P>
<P>16.  Individuals<A NAME = "AO693"></A><A NAME = "AS694"></A><A NAME = "AS695"></A> can also access the Internet<A NAME = "BB6916"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6957"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> through many local libraries<A NAME = "BB6925"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6932"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.
Libraries<A NAME = "AO6929"></A><A NAME = "AS6930"></A><A NAME = "AS6931"></A><A NAME = "BB6932"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6971"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> often offer patrons use of computers that are linked to the Internet<A NAME = "BB6957"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7016"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.
In addition, some libraries<A NAME = "AO6967"></A><A NAME = "AS6968"></A><A NAME = "AS6969"></A><A NAME = "AS6970"></A><A NAME = "BB6971"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB69142"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> offer telephone<A NAME = "AB6976"></A> modem access to the libraries'<A NAME = "AB6987"></A>
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet.  Increasingly,

patrons now use library<A NAME = "AB69116"></A> services and resources without ever physically entering
the library itself.  Libraries<A NAME = "AO69139"></A><A NAME = "AS69140"></A><A NAME = "AS69141"></A><A NAME = "BB69142"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26820"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> typically provide such direct or modem<A NAME = "BB69155"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB71199"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> access at
no cost to the individual user.  </P>
<P>17.  Individuals<A NAME = "AO703"></A><A NAME = "AS704"></A><A NAME = "AS705"></A> can also access the Internet<A NAME = "BB7016"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7081"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> by patronizing an increasing

they drink their coffee -- can use computers provided by the shop to access the

<P>18.  Individuals<A NAME = "AO713"></A><A NAME = "AS714"></A><A NAME = "AS715"></A> can also access the Internet<A NAME = "BB7116"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7174"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> through commercial and
non<A NAME = "AB7125"></A>-commercial &quot;Internet service providers&quot; that typically offer<A NAME = "AO7142"></A><A NAME = "AS7143"></A><A NAME = "AS7144"></A><A NAME = "AS7145"></A> modem<A NAME = "AB7148"></A>

such providers -- including the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet
Exchange Association -- are commercial<A NAME = "BB71107"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20139"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> entities offering Internet<A NAME = "BB71114"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB71241"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> access for a
monthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet<A NAME = "AO71133"></A><A NAME = "AS71134"></A><A NAME = "AS71135"></A><A NAME = "AS71136"></A><A NAME = "AB71137"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB19199"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> service providers, however, are non<A NAME = "AB71148"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB73124"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-profit
organizations that offer free or very low cost access to the Internet<A NAME = "BB71175"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB71208"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  For
example, the International<A NAME = "AO71184"></A><A NAME = "AS71185"></A><A NAME = "AS71186"></A><A NAME = "AS71187"></A><A NAME = "AB71188"></A> Internet Association offers free modem<A NAME = "BB71199"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF6774"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> access to the
Internet<A NAME = "BB71208"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7222"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> upon request.  Also, a number<A NAME = "AO71219"></A><A NAME = "AS71220"></A><A NAME = "AS71221"></A> of trade or other non<A NAME = "AB71232"></A>-profit associations
offer Internet<A NAME = "BB71241"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB16251"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> access as a service to members. </P>
<P>19.  Another<A NAME = "AO723"></A><A NAME = "AS724"></A><A NAME = "AS725"></A> common way for individuals to access the Internet<A NAME = "BB7222"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7335"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is through
one of the major national commercial<A NAME = "AB7239"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB72254"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> &quot;online services&quot; such as America<A NAME = "AB7252"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB9017"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These online<A NAME = "AO7271"></A><A NAME = "AS7272"></A><A NAME = "AS7273"></A><A NAME = "AS7274"></A><A NAME = "AB7275"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB11933"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> services
offer nationwide computer<A NAME = "BB7284"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8873"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local
telephone number), and the services provide extensive and well organized content
within their own proprietary<A NAME = "AB72137"></A> computer networks.  In addition to allowing access
to the extensive content available within each online service, the services<A NAME = "AO72174"></A><A NAME = "AS72175"></A> also
allow subscribers to link to the much larger resources<A NAME = "AB72196"></A> of the Internet.  Full
access to the online service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained
for modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major<A NAME = "AO72249"></A><A NAME = "AS72250"></A><A NAME = "AS72251"></A> commercial<A NAME = "BB72254"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22639"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> online services have
almost twelve million individual subscribers across the United<A NAME = "BB72277"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25838"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States.</P>
<P>20.  In addition to using the national commercial online services,
individuals<A NAME = "AO7322"></A><A NAME = "AS7323"></A><A NAME = "AS7324"></A> can also access the Internet<A NAME = "BB7335"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB73325"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> using some (but not all) of the
thousands of local dial-in computer<A NAME = "AB7364"></A> services, often called &quot;bulletin board
systems&quot; or &quot;BBSs.&quot;  With an investment of as little as $2,000.00
and the cost of a telephone line, individuals<A NAME = "AO73119"></A><A NAME = "AS73120"></A><A NAME = "AS73121"></A>, non<A NAME = "BB73124"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB99165"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-profit organizations,
advocacy groups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer<A NAME = "AB73152"></A> &quot;bulletin
board&quot; service where friends, members, subscribers, or customers can
exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from single computers with only one
telephone line into the computer (allowing only one user at a time), to single
computers with many telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple
simultaneous users), to multiple linked computers each servicing multiple
dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users).  Some (but not
all) of these BBS<A NAME = "AO73303"></A><A NAME = "AS73304"></A><A NAME = "AS73305"></A><A NAME = "AB73306"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB73332"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> systems offer direct or indirect links to the Internet<A NAME = "BB73325"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7417"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Some
BBS<A NAME = "AO73330"></A><A NAME = "AS73331"></A><A NAME = "BB73332"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF73306"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> systems charge users a nominal fee for access, while many others are free to
the individual users. </P>
<P>21. Although commercial<A NAME = "AO745"></A><A NAME = "AS746"></A><A NAME = "AS747"></A><A NAME = "AB748"></A> access to the Internet<A NAME = "BB7417"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7436"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is growing rapidly, many
users<A NAME = "AO7428"></A><A NAME = "AS7429"></A> of the Internet<A NAME = "BB7436"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB74115"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> -- such as college students and staff -- do not
individually pay for access (except to the extent, for example, that the cost of
computer services is a component of college tuition).  These and other<A NAME = "AO74109"></A><A NAME = "AS74110"></A><A NAME = "AS74111"></A><A NAME = "AS74112"></A> Internet<A NAME = "BB74115"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB74126"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
users can access the Internet<A NAME = "BB74126"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7512"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> without paying for such access with a credit<A NAME = "BB74143"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23737"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card
or other form of payment.</P>
<H1>Methods to Communicate Over the Internet<A NAME = "BB7512"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7717"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A></H1>
<P>22.  Once<A NAME = "AO773"></A><A NAME = "AS774"></A> one has access to the Internet<A NAME = "BB7717"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB77111"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, there are a wide variety of
different methods of communication and information exchange over the network.

These many methods<A NAME = "AO7758"></A><A NAME = "AS7759"></A> of communication and information<A NAME = "AB7768"></A> retrieval are constantly
evolving and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely.  The most common<A NAME = "AO7797"></A><A NAME = "AS7798"></A>
methods of communications on the Internet<A NAME = "BB77111"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8523"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> (as well as within the major online
services) can be roughly grouped into six categories: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1) one-to-one messaging (such as &quot;e-mail&quot;), </P>
<P>(2) one-to-many messaging (such as &quot;listserv&quot;),</P>
<P>(3) distributed message databases (such as &quot;USENET newsgroups&quot;),
</P>
<P>(4) real time communication (such as &quot;Internet Relay Chat&quot;), </P>
<P>(5) real time remote computer utilization (such as &quot;telnet&quot;), and
</P>
<P>(6) remote information retrieval (such as &quot;ftp,&quot; &quot;gopher,&quot;
and the &quot;World Wide Web&quot;).  </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Most of these methods<A NAME = "AO847"></A> of communication can be used to transmit text, data,
computer programs, sound, visual<A NAME = "AB8435"></A> images (i.e., pictures), and moving video<A NAME = "AB8451"></A>
images.</P>
<P>23.  One-to-one messaging.  One method of communication on the Internet<A NAME = "BB8523"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8599"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is
via electronic mail, or &quot;e-mail,&quot; comparable in principle to sending a
first class letter.  One can address and transmit a message to one or more other
people.  E-<A NAME = "AO8588"></A><A NAME = "AS8589"></A><A NAME = "AS8590"></A><A NAME = "AB8591"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB85151"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>mail on the Internet<A NAME = "BB8599"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8615"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is not routed through a central control point,
and can take many and varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail,
simple<A NAME = "AO85146"></A><A NAME = "AS85147"></A> e-<A NAME = "BB85151"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20577"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>mail generally is not &quot;sealed&quot; or secure, and can be accessed
or viewed on intermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unless the
message is encrypted).</P>
<P>24.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet<A NAME = "AO8613"></A><A NAME = "AS8614"></A><A NAME = "BB8615"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB86335"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> also contains automatic mailing
list services (such as &quot;listservs&quot;), [also referred to by witnesses as
&quot;mail<A NAME = "AB8654"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22052"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> exploders&quot;] that allow communications about particular subjects
of interest to a group of people.  For example, people<A NAME = "AO8691"></A><A NAME = "AS8692"></A> can subscribe to a &quot;listserv<A NAME = "AB86104"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB86148"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>&quot;
mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them.  The subscriber can
submit messages on the topic to the listserv<A NAME = "BB86148"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF86104"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> that are forwarded (via e-mail),
either automatically or through a human moderator overseeing the listserv, to
anyone who has subscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a message
can reply to the message and have the reply also distributed to everyone on the
mailing list.  This service provides the capability to keep abreast of
developments or events in a particular subject area.  Most listserv<A NAME = "AB86286"></A>-type mailing
lists automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list
subscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list services on the Internet<A NAME = "BB86335"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB8942"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
collectively with hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Users<A NAME = "AO86353"></A><A NAME = "AS86354"></A> of &quot;open&quot;
listservs<A NAME = "AB86363"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB220273"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> typically can add or remove their names from the mailing list
automatically, with no direct human involvement.  Listservs may also be &quot;closed,&quot;
i.e., only allowing for one's acceptance into the listserv by a human moderator.</P>
<P>25.  Distributed message databases.  Similar in function to listservs -- but
quite different in how communications are transmitted -- are distributed message
databases such as &quot;USENET newsgroups.&quot;  User<A NAME = "AO8758"></A><A NAME = "AS8759"></A><A NAME = "AS8760"></A>-sponsored newsgroups<A NAME = "AB8765"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB87113"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are
among the most popular and widespread applications of Internet<A NAME = "AB8786"></A> services, and
cover all imaginable topics of interest to users.  Like listservs, newsgroups<A NAME = "BB87113"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB200297"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
are open discussions and exchanges on particular topics.  Users, however, need
not subscribe to the discussion mailing list in advance, but can instead access
the database at any time.  Some USENET<A NAME = "AO87176"></A><A NAME = "AS87177"></A><A NAME = "AB87178"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB87258"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> newsgroups are &quot;moderated&quot; but
most are open access.  For the moderated newsgroups,(10) all messages<A NAME = "AO87213"></A><A NAME = "AS87214"></A> to the
newsgroup<A NAME = "AB87221"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB87345"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are forwarded to one person who can screen them for relevance to the
topics under discussion.  USENET<A NAME = "AO87256"></A><A NAME = "AS87257"></A><A NAME = "BB87258"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF87178"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc, peer
to peer connections between approximately 200,000 computers (called USENET &quot;servers&quot;)
around the world.  For unmoderated newsgroups, when an individual<A NAME = "AO87315"></A><A NAME = "AS87316"></A><A NAME = "AS87317"></A> user with
access to a USENET<A NAME = "AB87330"></A> server posts a message to a newsgroup<A NAME = "BB87345"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB87382"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, the message<A NAME = "AO87350"></A><A NAME = "AS87351"></A><A NAME = "AS87352"></A> is
automatically forwarded to all adjacent USENET<A NAME = "AB87367"></A> servers that furnish access to
the newsgroup<A NAME = "BB87382"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB87525"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and it is then propagated to the servers adjacent to those
servers, etc.  The messages are temporarily stored on each receiving server,
where they are available for review and response by individual users.  The
messages are automatically and periodically purged from each system after a time
to make room for new messages.  Responses<A NAME = "AO87490"></A><A NAME = "AS87491"></A><A NAME = "AS87492"></A> to messages, like the original
messages, are automatically distributed to all other computers receiving the
newsgroup<A NAME = "BB87525"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB87550"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or forwarded to a moderator in the case of a moderated newsgroup<A NAME = "BB87550"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB200320"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  The
dissemination of messages to USENET servers around the world is an automated
process that does not require direct human intervention or review. </P>
<P>26. There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand different subjects.
In 1994, approximately<A NAME = "AO8828"></A><A NAME = "AS8829"></A><A NAME = "AS8830"></A><A NAME = "AS8831"></A> 70,000 messages were posted to newsgroups<A NAME = "AB8844"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB88170"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> each day, and
those messages were distributed to the approximately 190,000 computers or
computer<A NAME = "BB8873"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB88115"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> networks that participate in the USENET<A NAME = "AB8886"></A> newsgroup system.  Once the
messages<A NAME = "AO8897"></A><A NAME = "AS8898"></A> reach the approximately 190,000 receiving computers or computer<A NAME = "BB88115"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF6153"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
networks, they are available to individual users of those computers or computer
networks.  Collectively, almost<A NAME = "AO88146"></A><A NAME = "AS88147"></A> 100,000 new messages (or &quot;articles&quot;)
are posted to newsgroups<A NAME = "BB88170"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF8844"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> each day.</P>

15. The general that hearkens<A NAME = "AS2911"></A><A NAME = "AB2912"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB2958"><img src="link.GIF"></A> to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer:
let such a one be retained in command! The general that hearkens<A NAME = "AS2957"></A><A NAME = "BB2958"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF2912"><img src="link.GIF"></A> not to my
counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:--let such a one be dismissed!

<P>

<P>

16. While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any
helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.
<P>

<P>

17. According as circumstances are favorable, one<A NAME = "AO3315"></A> should modify one's plans.

<P>

<P>

18. All warfare is based on deception.
<P>

<P>

19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable;
when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we
are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away;
when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
<P>

20. Hold<A NAME = "AO385"></A> out baits to entice the enemy.  Feign disorder, and crush him.

<P>

<P>

21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.  If he is in
superior strength, evade him.
<P>

<P>

22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.  Pretend
to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
<P>

<P>

23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.  If his forces are united,
separate them.
<P>

<P>

24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

<P>

<P>

25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged
beforehand.
<P>

<P>

26. Now the general who wins<A NAME = "AO5013"></A><A NAME = "AS5014"></A> a battle makes many calculations in
his temple<A NAME = "AB5031"></A> ere the battle is fought. The general<A NAME = "AO5046"></A> who loses a battle makes
but few calculations beforehand.  Thus do many calculations<A NAME = "AO5073"></A> lead to victory,
and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all!  It is
by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO545"></A><A NAME = "AS546"></A><A NAME = "BB547"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB847"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  In the operations of war,
where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots,
as many heavy chariots, and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with
provisions enough to carry them a thousand<A NAME = "AO5482"></A> li, the expenditure at home and
at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue
and paint, and sums spent on chariots and armor, will reach<A NAME = "AO54141"></A><A NAME = "AS54142"></A> the total of a
thousand ounces of silver<A NAME = "AB54159"></A> per day. Such is the cost of raising an army of
100,000 men.
<P>

<P>

2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory
is long in coming, then men's<A NAME = "AO5631"></A> weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be
damped.  If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.
<P>

<P>

3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources<A NAME = "AO5819"></A><A NAME = "AS5820"></A><A NAME = "AB5821"></A><A HREF = "SPP24.HTM#BB71964"><img src="link.GIF"></A> of the State will not be equal to the strain.

<P>
The Attorney<A NAME = "AO293"></A><A NAME = "AS294"></A><A NAME = "AB295"></A> General's commitment was qualified to the extent that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>her full authority to investigate or prosecute any violation of &#167;
223(a)(1)(B), as amended, and &#167; 223(d) as to conduct which occurs or
occurred during any period of time after enactment of these provisions
(including for the period of time to which this stipulation applies) should the
Court deny plaintiffs' motion or, if the motion is granted, should these
provisions ultimately be upheld.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stipulation, &#182; 4, in C.A. No. 96-963.</P>
<P>Shortly thereafter, the American<A NAME = "AO327"></A><A NAME = "AS328"></A><A NAME = "AS329"></A><A NAME = "AB3210"></A> Library Association, Inc. (the ALA) and
others(3) filed a similar action at C.A<A NAME = "AB3242"></A>. No. 96-1458.  On February 27, 1996,
Chief Judge Sloviter, again pursuant to &#167; 561(a) of the CDA and upon
request, convened the same three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2284.
The actions were consolidated pursuant to Fed<A NAME = "AB32128"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB57175"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. R. Civ. P. 42(a), &quot;for all
matters relating to the disposition of motions for preliminary injunction in
these cases, including the hearing on such motions.&quot;</P>
<P>The parties<A NAME = "AO333"></A><A NAME = "AS334"></A> were afforded expedited discovery in connection with the motions
for preliminary injunction, and they cooperated with Judge<A NAME = "AB3339"></A> Dalzell, who had been
assigned the case management aspects of the litigation.  While the discovery was
proceeding, and with the agreement of the parties, the court<A NAME = "AO3392"></A> began receiving
evidence at the consolidated hearings which were conducted on March 21 and 22,
and April 1, 12 and 15, 1996.  In order to expedite the proceedings, the parties
worked closely with Judge Dalzell and arranged to stipulate to many of the
underlying facts and to place much of their cases in chief before the court by
sworn declarations, so that the hearings were largely devoted to
cross-examination of certain of the witnesses whose declarations had been filed.
 The parties<A NAME = "AO33260"></A><A NAME = "AS33261"></A> submitted proposed findings of fact and post<A NAME = "AB33276"></A>-hearing memoranda on
April 29, and the court heard extensive oral argument on May 10, 1996.(4)</P>
<H1>Statutory Provisions at Issue</H1>
<P>Plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO361"></A> focus their challenge on two provisions of section 502 of the CDA
which amend 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 223(a) and 223(d).</P>
<P>Section 223(a)(1)(B) provides in part that any person in interstate or
foreign communications who, &quot;by means of a telecommunications device,&quot;(5)
&quot;knowingly . . . makes, creates, or solicits&quot; and &quot;initiates the
transmission&quot; of &quot;any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or
other communication which is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of
the communication is under 18 years of age,&quot; &quot;shall be criminally
fined or imprisoned.&quot; (emphasis added).  </P>
<P>Section 223(d)(1) (&quot;the patently offensive provision&quot;), makes it a
crime<A NAME = "AO3829"></A><A NAME = "AS3830"></A> to use an &quot;interactive<A NAME = "AB3840"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB28936"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> computer service&quot;(6) to &quot;send&quot;
or &quot;display in a manner available&quot; to a person under age 18, &quot;any
comment, request, suggestion<A NAME = "AO3890"></A><A NAME = "AS3891"></A>, proposal, image, or other communication that, in
context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory<A NAME = "AB38140"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB293101"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> activities or organs,
regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the
communication.&quot; </P>
<P>Plaintiffs also challenge on the same grounds the provisions in &#167;
223(a)(2) and &#167; 223(d)(2), which make it a crime<A NAME = "AO3951"></A><A NAME = "AS3952"></A> for anyone to &quot;knowingly
permit[] any telecommunications<A NAME = "AB3970"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29411"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> facility under [his or her] control to be used
for any activity prohibited&quot; in &#167;&#167; 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(d)(1).
The challenged provisions impose a punishment of a fine, up to two years
imprisonment, or both for each offense.  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs make clear that they do not quarrel with the statute to the
extent that it covers<A NAME = "AO4033"></A><A NAME = "AS4034"></A><A NAME = "AS4035"></A> obscenity or child<A NAME = "AB4042"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32855"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pornography, which were already
proscribed before the CDA's<A NAME = "AB4059"></A> adoption.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1464-65
(criminalizing obscene material); id. &#167;&#167; 2251-52 (criminalizing child
pornography); see also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).</P>
<P>Plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO411"></A><A NAME = "AS412"></A><A NAME = "AS413"></A><A NAME = "AS414"></A><A NAME = "AS415"></A> in the ACLU<A NAME = "AB4112"></A> action also challenge the provision of the CDA that
criminalizes speech over the Internet<A NAME = "BB4141"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB5769"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> that transmits information about abortions<A NAME = "AB4152"></A>
or abortifacient<A NAME = "AB4157"></A> drugs and devices, through its amendment of 18 U.S.C. &#167;
1462(c).  That section now prohibits the sending and receiving of information
over the Internet by any means regarding &quot;where, how, or of whom, or by
what means any [drug<A NAME = "AO41142"></A><A NAME = "AS41143"></A>, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended
for producing abortion<A NAME = "AB41166"></A>] may be obtained or made&quot;.  The Government has
stated that it does not contest plaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of
the provision of the CDA as it relates to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462(c).(7) </P>
<P>As part of its argument that the CDA<A NAME = "AO4215"></A><A NAME = "AS4216"></A> passes constitutional<A NAME = "AB4221"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB385813"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> muster, the
Government<A NAME = "AO4228"></A><A NAME = "AS4229"></A> cites the CDA's<A NAME = "AB4236"></A> &quot;safe harbor&quot; defenses in new &#167; 223(e)
of 47 U.S.C., which provides:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) <B>Defenses</B></P>
<P>In addition to any other defenses available by law:</P>
<P>(1) No<A NAME = "AO455"></A> person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d) of this
section solely for providing access or connection to or from a facility, system,
or network not under that person's control, including transmission, downloading<A NAME = "AO4583"></A>,
intermediate storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are
incidental to providing such access or connection that does not include the
creation of the content of the communication.</P>
<P>(2) The defenses<A NAME = "AO467"></A><A NAME = "AS468"></A> provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who is a conspirator with an entity actively involved in
the creation or knowing distribution<A NAME = "AB4669"></A> of communications that violate this
section, or who knowingly advertises the availability of such communications.</P>
<P>(3) The defenses<A NAME = "AO477"></A> provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who provides access or connection to a facility, system,
or network engaged in the violation of this section that is owned or controlled
by such person.</P>
<P>(4) No<A NAME = "AO485"></A> employer shall be held liable under this section for the actions of
an employee or agent unless the employee's or agent's conduct is within the
scope of his or her employment or agency and the employer (A) having knowledge
of such conduct, authorizes or ratifies such conduct, or (B) recklessly
disregards such conduct.</P>
<P>(5) It is a defense to a prosecution under subsection (a)(1)(B) or (d) of
this section, or under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the use
of a facility for an activity under subsection (a)(1)(B) that a person --</P>
<P>(A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective<A NAME = "AO5017"></A>, and appropriate actions
under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to a
communication specified in such subsections, which may involve any appropriate
measures to restrict minors from such communications, including any method which
is feasible under available technology; or</P>
<P>(B) has restricted<A NAME = "AO517"></A><A NAME = "AS518"></A><A NAME = "AS519"></A> access to such communication by requiring use of a
verified credit<A NAME = "AB5132"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB74143"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal
identification<A NAME = "AB5153"></A> number.</P>
<P>(6) The [Federal<A NAME = "AO528"></A><A NAME = "AS529"></A><A NAME = "AB5210"></A> Communications] Commission may describe measures which are
reasonable, effective, and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited
communications under subsection (d) of this section.  Nothing<A NAME = "AO5262"></A> in this section
authorizes the Commission to enforce, or is intended to provide the Commission
with the authority to approve, sanction, or permit, the use of such measures.
The Commission<A NAME = "AO52124"></A> shall have no enforcement authority over the failure to utilize

such measures. . . .</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1>II.</H1>
<H1>FINDINGS OF FACT</H1>
<P>All parties agree that in order to apprehend the legal questions at issue in
these cases, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the exponentially
growing, worldwide<A NAME = "AO5757"></A><A NAME = "AS5758"></A> medium that is the Internet<A NAME = "BB5769"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6110"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, which presents unique issues
relating to the application of First Amendment jurisprudence and due process
requirements to this new and evolving method of communication.  For this reason
all parties insisted on having extensive evidentiary<A NAME = "AB57138"></A> hearings before the
three-judge court. The court's<A NAME = "AO57155"></A><A NAME = "AS57156"></A><A NAME = "AS57157"></A> Findings<A NAME = "AB57160"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB57234"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of fact are made pursuant to Fed<A NAME = "BB57175"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF32128"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. R.
Civ. P. 52(a).  The history<A NAME = "AO57192"></A><A NAME = "AS57193"></A> and basic technology of this medium are not in
dispute, and the first forty-eight paragraphs of the following Findings<A NAME = "BB57234"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF57160"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of fact
are derived from the like-numbered paragraphs of a stipulation(8) the parties
filed with the court.(9)</P>

<P>

<P>82. The parties<A NAME = "AO2105"></A><A NAME = "AS2106"></A> agree that sexually explicit material exists on the
Internet<A NAME = "BB21025"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21175"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Such material<A NAME = "AO21030"></A><A NAME = "AS21031"></A><A NAME = "AS21032"></A> includes text, pictures, and chat, and includes
bulletin boards, newsgroups<A NAME = "BB21053"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB215183"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and the other forms of Internet<A NAME = "BB21066"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB314164"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication, and
extends from the modestly titillating to the hardest-core.  </P>
<P>83. There is no evidence that sexually-oriented material is the primary type
of content on this new medium.  Purveyors of such material take advantage of the
same ease of access available to all users of the Internet<A NAME = "BB21175"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21319"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, including
establishment of a Web<A NAME = "BB21186"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22562"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site. </P>
<P>84. Sexually explicit material is created, named, and posted in the same
manner as material that is not sexually explicit.  It is possible that a search<A NAME = "AO21251"></A><A NAME = "AS21252"></A>
engine can accidentally retrieve material of a sexual<A NAME = "AB21269"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB212116"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> nature through an
imprecise search, as demonstrated at the hearing.  Imprecise searches may also
retrieve irrelevant material that is not of a sexual<A NAME = "BB212116"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF21269"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> nature.  The accidental<A NAME = "AB212123"></A>
retrieval of sexually explicit material is one manifestation of the larger
phenomenon of irrelevant search results. </P>
<P>85. Once a provider<A NAME = "AO2137"></A><A NAME = "AS2138"></A> posts content on the Internet<A NAME = "BB21319"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21334"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, it is available to all
other Internet<A NAME = "BB21334"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB213226"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users worldwide.  Similarly, once a user<A NAME = "AO21347"></A><A NAME = "AS21348"></A> posts a message to a
newsgroup<A NAME = "BB21361"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21390"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or bulletin board, that message<A NAME = "AO21372"></A><A NAME = "AS21373"></A> becomes available to all subscribers
to that newsgroup<A NAME = "BB21390"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB213391"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or bulletin board.  For example, when the UCR<A NAME = "AB213107"></A>/California
Museum of Photography posts to its Web<A NAME = "AB213124"></A> site nudes by Edward<A NAME = "AB213133"></A> Weston and Robert<A NAME = "AB213140"></A>
Mapplethorpe to announce that its new exhibit will travel to Baltimore<A NAME = "AB213163"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB213194"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and New<A NAME = "AB213168"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB213199"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
York City, those images are available not only in Los<A NAME = "BB213189"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF611784"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Angeles, Baltimore<A NAME = "BB213194"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF213163"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and
New<A NAME = "BB213199"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32382"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> York City, but also in Cincinnati<A NAME = "AB213212"></A>, Mobile, or Beijing<A NAME = "AB213219"></A> -- wherever Internet<A NAME = "BB213226"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21421"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
users live.  Similarly, the safer sex instructions that Critical Path posts to
its Web site, written in street language so that the teenage receiver can
understand them, are available not just in Philadelphia<A NAME = "BB213293"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF611620"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, but also in Provo<A NAME = "AB213302"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB58039"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and
Prague<A NAME = "AB213307"></A>.  A chat<A NAME = "AO213312"></A><A NAME = "AS213313"></A><A NAME = "AS213314"></A><A NAME = "AS213315"></A> room organized by the ACLU<A NAME = "BB213326"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43466"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to discuss the United<A NAME = "AB213335"></A> States Supreme
Court's  decision in FCC<A NAME = "AB213348"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29781"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. Pacifica Foundation would transmit George Carlin's
seven dirty words to anyone who enters.  Messages<A NAME = "AO213379"></A><A NAME = "AS213380"></A><A NAME = "AS213381"></A><A NAME = "AS213382"></A> posted to a newsgroup<A NAME = "BB213391"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB213419"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
dedicated to the Oklahoma<A NAME = "AB213400"></A> City bombing travel to all subscribers to that
newsgroup<A NAME = "BB213419"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22125"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  </P>
<P>86.  Once a provider<A NAME = "AO2147"></A><A NAME = "AS2148"></A> posts its content on the Internet<A NAME = "BB21421"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21487"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, it cannot prevent
that content from entering any community.  Unlike the newspaper, broadcast
station, or cable system, Internet<A NAME = "AO21458"></A><A NAME = "AS21459"></A><A NAME = "AB21460"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB6217"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> technology necessarily gives a speaker a
potential worldwide audience.  Because the Internet<A NAME = "AO21485"></A><A NAME = "AS21486"></A><A NAME = "BB21487"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB214130"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is a network of networks (as
described above in Findings 1 through 4), any network<A NAME = "AO214120"></A><A NAME = "AS214121"></A> connected to the Internet<A NAME = "BB214130"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21576"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
has the capacity to send and receive information to any other network.  Hotwired<A NAME = "AO214157"></A><A NAME = "AS214158"></A><A NAME = "AS214159"></A><A NAME = "AB214160"></A>
Ventures, for example, cannot prevent its materials on mixology<A NAME = "AB214179"></A> from entering
communities that have no interest in that topic.  </P>
<P>87.  Demonstrations<A NAME = "AO2153"></A><A NAME = "AS2154"></A> at the preliminary injunction<A NAME = "AB21513"></A> hearings showed that it
takes several steps to enter cyberspace.  At the most fundamental level, a user<A NAME = "AO21548"></A><A NAME = "AS21549"></A>
must have access to a computer with the ability to reach the Internet<A NAME = "BB21576"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21612"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> (typically
by way of a modem).  A user must then direct the computer to connect with the
access provider, enter a password, and enter the appropriate commands to find
particular data.  On the World Wide Web, a user must normally use a search
engine or enter an appropriate address.  Similarly, accessing newsgroups<A NAME = "BB215183"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22057"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
bulletin boards, and chat rooms requires several steps.</P>
<P>88. Communications<A NAME = "AO2163"></A><A NAME = "AS2164"></A><A NAME = "AS2165"></A> over the Internet<A NAME = "BB21612"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21758"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> do not &quot;invade&quot; an
individual's home or appear on one's computer<A NAME = "AB21637"></A> screen unbidden.  Users seldom
encounter content &quot;by accident.&quot;   A document's title or a description
of the document will usually appear before the document itself takes the step
needed to view it, and in many cases the user will receive detailed information
about a site's content before he or she need take the step to access the
document.  Almost all sexually explicit images are preceded by warnings as to
the content.  Even the Government's witness, Agent Howard Schmidt, Director of
the Air Force Office of Special Investigation, testified that the &quot;odds are
slim&quot; that a user would come across a sexually explicit site by accident.
</P>
<P>89. Evidence<A NAME = "AO2173"></A><A NAME = "AS2174"></A><A NAME = "AS2175"></A><A NAME = "AS2176"></A> adduced at the hearing showed significant  differences between
Internet<A NAME = "AB21725"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52158"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communications and communications received by radio<A NAME = "BB21738"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB31533"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or television<A NAME = "BB21743"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB405226"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.
Although content<A NAME = "AO21749"></A><A NAME = "AS21750"></A><A NAME = "AS21751"></A> on the Internet<A NAME = "BB21758"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB217101"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is just a few clicks of a mouse<A NAME = "AB21775"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB630201"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> away from the

affirmative<A NAME = "AB217112"></A> steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial.  A
child requires some sophistication and some ability to read to retrieve material
and thereby to use the Internet<A NAME = "BB217171"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21815"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> unattended.  </P>
<H1>Obstacles to Age<A NAME = "AB2186"></A> Verification on the Internet<A NAME = "BB21815"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22517"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A></H1>
<P>90.  There is no<A NAME = "AO2207"></A><A NAME = "AS2208"></A><A NAME = "AS2209"></A><A NAME = "AS22010"></A> effective way to determine the identity or the age of a
user who is accessing material through e-<A NAME = "BB22048"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB220218"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>mail, mail<A NAME = "BB22052"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB220261"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> exploders, newsgroups<A NAME = "BB22057"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB336105"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or
chat rooms.  An e-<A NAME = "AO22069"></A><A NAME = "AS22070"></A><A NAME = "AS22071"></A><A NAME = "AS22072"></A><A NAME = "AB22073"></A>mail address provides no authoritative information about the
addressee, who may use an e-<A NAME = "AB220102"></A>mail &quot;alias&quot; or an anonymous remailer<A NAME = "AB220116"></A>.
There is also no<A NAME = "AO220126"></A><A NAME = "AS220127"></A><A NAME = "AS220128"></A> universal or reliable listing of e-<A NAME = "AB220142"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB220289"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>mail addresses and
corresponding names or telephone<A NAME = "AB220156"></A> numbers, and any such listing would be or
rapidly become incomplete.  For these reasons, there is no reliable way in many
instances for a sender to know if the e-<A NAME = "BB220218"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB634358"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>mail recipient is an adult or a minor.
The difficulty<A NAME = "AO220239"></A><A NAME = "AS220240"></A><A NAME = "AS220241"></A> of e-<A NAME = "AB220247"></A>mail age verification is compounded for mail<A NAME = "BB220261"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB336108"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> exploders such
as listservs<A NAME = "AO220270"></A><A NAME = "AS220271"></A><A NAME = "AS220272"></A><A NAME = "BB220273"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB634352"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, which automatically send information to all e-<A NAME = "BB220289"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF220142"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>mail addresses on a
sender's list.  Government expert Dr. Olsen agreed that no current technology
could give a speaker assurance that only<A NAME = "AO220333"></A><A NAME = "AS220334"></A> adults were listed in a particular mail<A NAME = "AB220349"></A>
exploder's mailing list.  </P>
<P>91.  Because of similar technological difficulties, individuals posting a
message to a newsgroup<A NAME = "BB22125"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF87221"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or engaging in chat room discussions cannot ensure that
all readers are adults, and Dr. Olsen agreed.  Although some newsgroups are
moderated, the moderator's control is limited to what is posted and the
moderator cannot control who receives the messages.  </P>
<P>92.  The Government<A NAME = "AO2225"></A> offered no evidence that there is a reliable way to
ensure that recipients and participants in such fora can be screened for age.
The Government<A NAME = "AO22257"></A> presented no evidence demonstrating the feasibility of its
suggestion that chat rooms, newsgroups and other fora that contain material
deemed indecent could be effectively segregated to &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;moderated&quot;
areas of cyberspace.  </P>
<P>93.  Even if it were technologically feasible to block minors' access to
newsgroups and similar fora, there is no<A NAME = "AO22337"></A><A NAME = "AS22338"></A> method by which the creators<A NAME = "AB22349"></A> of
newsgroups which contain discussions of art, politics or any other subject<A NAME = "AO22374"></A> that
could potentially elicit &quot;indecent&quot; contributions could limit the
blocking of access by minors to such &quot;indecent&quot; material and still
allow them access to the remaining content, even if the overwhelming majority of
that content was not indecent.</P>
<P>94.  Likewise, participants<A NAME = "AO2245"></A> in MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and  MUSEs
(Multi-User Simulation Environments) do not know whether the other participants
are adults or minors.  Although MUDs<A NAME = "AO22458"></A> and MUSEs require a password for permanent
participants, they need not give their real name nor verify their age, and there
is no current technology to enable the administrator of these fantasy worlds to
know if the participant is an adult or a minor.  </P>
<P>95.  Unlike other forms of communication on the Internet<A NAME = "BB22517"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22937"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, there is
technology<A NAME = "AO22524"></A><A NAME = "AS22525"></A><A NAME = "AS22526"></A> by which an operator of a World<A NAME = "AB22541"></A> Wide Web server may interrogate a
user of a Web<A NAME = "BB22562"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB225113"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site.  An HTML<A NAME = "AO22569"></A><A NAME = "AS22570"></A><A NAME = "AS22571"></A><A NAME = "AS22572"></A><A NAME = "AS22573"></A><A NAME = "BB22574"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB621151"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> document can include a fill-in-the-blank &quot;form&quot;
to request information from a visitor to a Web<A NAME = "BB225113"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB225226"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site, and this information can be
transmitted back to the Web<A NAME = "AB225136"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB225177"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> server and be processed by a computer<A NAME = "AB225151"></A> program,
usually a Common Gateway Interface (cgi) script.  The Web<A NAME = "AO225175"></A><A NAME = "AS225176"></A><A NAME = "BB225177"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF225136"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> server could then

grant or deny access to the information sought.  The cgi<A NAME = "AO225205"></A><A NAME = "AS225206"></A><A NAME = "AS225207"></A><A NAME = "AS225208"></A><A NAME = "AB225209"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22679"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> script is the means by
which a Web<A NAME = "BB225226"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB234122"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site can process a fill-in form and thereby screen visitors by
requesting a credit<A NAME = "AB225257"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23215"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card number or adult password.</P>
<P>96.  Content<A NAME = "AO2263"></A><A NAME = "AS2264"></A><A NAME = "AS2265"></A><A NAME = "AS2266"></A><A NAME = "AS2267"></A><A NAME = "AS2268"></A><A NAME = "AS2269"></A> providers who publish on the World<A NAME = "BB22622"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB634425"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Wide Web via one of the
large commercial<A NAME = "BB22639"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52361"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> online services, such as America Online or CompuServe, could
not use an online<A NAME = "AB22666"></A> age verification system that requires cgi<A NAME = "BB22679"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF225209"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> script because the
server software<A NAME = "AB22690"></A> of these online services available to subscribers cannot process
cgi<A NAME = "AB226111"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB226148"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> scripts.  There is no<A NAME = "AO226120"></A><A NAME = "AS226121"></A><A NAME = "AS226122"></A> method currently available for Web<A NAME = "AB226133"></A> page publishers who
lack access to cgi<A NAME = "BB226148"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF226111"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> scripts to screen recipients online for age.</P>
<H1>The Practicalities of the Proffered Defenses</H1>
<P>Note:  The Government<A NAME = "AO2295"></A><A NAME = "AS2296"></A> contends the CDA makes available three potential
defenses to all content providers on the Internet<A NAME = "BB22937"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23226"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>:  credit card verification,
adult verification by password or adult identification number, and &quot;tagging&quot;.</P>
<H1>Credit Card Verification </H1>
<P>97.  Verification(19) of a credit<A NAME = "AO23212"></A><A NAME = "AS23213"></A><A NAME = "AS23214"></A><A NAME = "BB23215"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB232120"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card number over the Internet<A NAME = "BB23226"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23259"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is not now
technically possible.  Witnesses<A NAME = "AO23239"></A><A NAME = "AS23240"></A> testified that neither Visa nor Mastercard
considers the Internet<A NAME = "BB23259"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB232111"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to be sufficiently secure under the current technology to
process transactions in that manner.  Although users<A NAME = "AO23292"></A><A NAME = "AS23293"></A><A NAME = "AS23294"></A> can and do purchase
products over the Internet<A NAME = "BB232111"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB232218"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> by transmitting their credit<A NAME = "BB232120"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB486118"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card number, the seller<A NAME = "AO232129"></A>
must then process the transaction with Visa or Mastercard off-line using phone
lines in the traditional way.  There was testimony by several witnesses that
Visa<A NAME = "AO232182"></A><A NAME = "AS232183"></A><A NAME = "AS232184"></A> and Mastercard are in the process of developing means of credit<A NAME = "AB232207"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB2367"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card
verification over the Internet<A NAME = "BB232218"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23633"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  </P>
<P>98. Verification by credit card, if and when operational, will remain
economically and practically unavailable for many of the non-commercial
plaintiffs in these actions.  The Government's expert &quot;suspect[ed]&quot;
that verification<A NAME = "AB23366"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23422"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> agencies would decline to process a card unless it accompanied
a commercial<A NAME = "AB23391"></A> transaction.  There was no evidence to the contrary.  </P>
<P>99. There was evidence that the fee<A NAME = "AO23413"></A><A NAME = "AS23414"></A><A NAME = "AS23415"></A> charged by verification<A NAME = "BB23422"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF23366"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> agencies to
process a card, whether for a purchase or not, will preclude use of the

credit<A NAME = "AB23458"></A>-card verification defense by many non-profit, non<A NAME = "AB23475"></A>-commercial Web sites,
and there was no evidence to the contrary.  Plaintiffs' witness Patricia Nell
Warren, an author<A NAME = "AO234113"></A><A NAME = "AS234114"></A><A NAME = "AS234115"></A> whose free Web<A NAME = "BB234122"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB234173"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site allows users to purchase gay and lesbian<A NAME = "AB234139"></A>
literature, testified that she must pay $1 per verification to a verification
agency.  Her Web<A NAME = "AO234171"></A><A NAME = "AS234172"></A><A NAME = "BB234173"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB235239"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site can absorb this cost because it arises in connection with
the sale of books available there.  </P>
<P>100. Using credit card possession as a surrogate for age, and requiring use
of a credit card to enter a site, would impose a significant economic cost on
non-commercial entities.  Critical<A NAME = "AO23563"></A><A NAME = "AS23564"></A><A NAME = "BB23565"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB235102"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Path, for example, received 3,300 hits daily
from February 4 through March 4, 1996.  If Critical<A NAME = "AO23598"></A><A NAME = "AS23599"></A><A NAME = "AS235100"></A><A NAME = "AS235101"></A><A NAME = "BB235102"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25539"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Path must pay a fee<A NAME = "AB235113"></A> every
time a user initially enters its site, then, to provide free access to its
non<A NAME = "AB235146"></A>-commercial site, it would incur a monthly cost far beyond its modest
resources.  The ACLU's<A NAME = "AO235177"></A><A NAME = "AS235178"></A><A NAME = "AS235179"></A><A NAME = "AS235180"></A><A NAME = "AS235181"></A><A NAME = "AB235182"></A> Barry Steinhardt testified that maintenance<A NAME = "AB235193"></A> of a credit
card verification system for all visitors to the ACLU's<A NAME = "AB235218"></A> Web site would require
it to shut down its Web<A NAME = "BB235239"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26161"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site because the projected cost would exceed its budget.
</P>
<P>101. Credit<A NAME = "AO2363"></A><A NAME = "AS2364"></A><A NAME = "AS2365"></A><A NAME = "AS2366"></A><A NAME = "BB2367"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23775"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card verification would significantly delay the retrieval<A NAME = "BB23622"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF9256"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of
information on the Internet<A NAME = "BB23633"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB236135"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Dr. Olsen, the expert testifying for the
Government, agreed that even &quot;a minute is [an] absolutely unreasonable
[delay] . . . [P]eople will not put up with a minute.&quot;  Plaintiffs'<A NAME = "AO236101"></A><A NAME = "AS236102"></A><A NAME = "AS236103"></A> expert
Donna<A NAME = "AB236108"></A> Hoffman similarly testified that excessive delay disrupts the &quot;flow&quot;
on the Internet<A NAME = "BB236135"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25278"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and stifles both &quot;hedonistic&quot; and &quot;goal-directed&quot;
browsing. </P>
<P>102.  Imposition<A NAME = "AO2373"></A><A NAME = "AS2374"></A><A NAME = "AS2375"></A><A NAME = "AB2376"></A> of a credit card requirement would completely bar adults
who do not have a credit<A NAME = "BB23737"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24349"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card and lack the resources to obtain one from
accessing any blocked material.  At this time, credit<A NAME = "AO23772"></A><A NAME = "AS23773"></A><A NAME = "AS23774"></A><A NAME = "BB23775"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB2447"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card verification is
effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet<A NAME = "BB23798"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB244128"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> content providers as
a potential defense to the CDA.</P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(5) He<A NAME = "AO11912"></A> will win who has military capacity and
is not interfered with by the sovereign.
<P>

<P>

18. Hence the saying:  If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not
fear the result of a hundred battles.  If you know yourself but not the
enemy<A NAME = "AO12161"></A>, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know
neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
<P>

<H1>IV. TACTICAL<A NAME = "AS1234"></A><A NAME = "AB1235"></A> DISPOSITIONS</H1>

<P>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO1255"></A><A NAME = "AS1256"></A><A NAME = "BB1257"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB1637"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  The good fighters of old first put
themselves beyond the possibility<A NAME = "AO12534"></A> of defeat, and then waited for an
opportunity of defeating the enemy.
<P>

2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the
opportunity<A NAME = "AO12629"></A> of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
<P>

<P>

3. Thus the good<A NAME = "AO1289"></A> fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,but cannot
make certain of defeating the enemy.
<P>

<P>

4. Hence the saying:  One may know how to conquer without being able to do it.
<P>

<P>

5. Security<A NAME = "AO1325"></A><A NAME = "AS1326"></A> against defeat implies defensive<A NAME = "AB13215"></A> tactics;
ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
<P>

<P>

6. Standing<A NAME = "AO1345"></A> on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a
superabundance of strength.
<P>

<P>

7. The general<A NAME = "AO1367"></A> who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses
of the earth; he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost
heights of heaven. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves
; on the other, a victory that is complete.
<P>

<P>

8. To see victory only when it is within the ken<A NAME = "AO13823"></A> of the common herd is not
the acme of excellence.
<P>

<P>

9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and the
whole Empire says, &quot;Well done!&quot;
<P>

<P>

10. To lift<A NAME = "AO1427"></A> an autumn hair is no sign of great strength; to see<A NAME = "AO14230"></A> the sun and
moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear<A NAME = "AO14255"></A> the noise of thunder is no sign of a
quick ear.
<P>

<P>

11. What the ancients<A NAME = "AO1449"></A> called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but
excels in winning with ease.
<P>

<P>

12. Hence his victories<A NAME = "AO1469"></A> bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor credit
for courage.
<P>

<P>

13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making<A NAME = "AO14821"></A> no mistakes is what
establishes the certainty of victory, for it means conquering an enemy that
is already defeated.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By LIONEL GILES,
M.A<A NAME = "AS320"></A><A NAME = "AB321"></A>. (1910)
<P>

[This is the basic<A NAME = "AS410"></A><A NAME = "AS411"></A> text of Sun<A NAME = "AB418"></A><A HREF = "SPP0.HTM#BB87"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu on the Art<A NAME = "AB427"></A> of War.  It was extracted from
Mr. Giles' complete work as titled above.  The commentary itself, which, of
course includes this work embedded within it, has been released as
suntzu10.txt (or suntzu10.zip). This is being released only as an adjunct to
that work, which contains a wealth of commentary upon this text.]
<P>

<H1>I. LAYING<A NAME = "AS64"></A><A NAME = "AB65"></A> PLANS</H1>

<P>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO85"></A><A NAME = "AS86"></A><A NAME = "BB87"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB547"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  The art<A NAME = "AO816"></A><A NAME = "AS817"></A> of war<A NAME = "AB822"></A> is of vital importance to the state.
<P>

<P>

2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin.
Hence it is a subject<A NAME = "AO1046"></A> of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.
<P>

3. The art<A NAME = "AO117"></A> of war, then, is governed by five constant
factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations,when seeking to
determine the conditions obtaining in the field.


<P>

4. These are:  (1) The Moral<A NAME = "AS1215"></A><A NAME = "AB1216"></A><A HREF = "SPP0.HTM#BB149"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander;
(5) Method and discipline.
<P>

<P>

5,6. The Moral<A NAME = "AO147"></A><A NAME = "AS148"></A><A NAME = "BB149"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF1216"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their
ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by
any danger.
<P>

<P>

7. Heaven<A NAME = "AO165"></A> signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.
<P>

<P>

8. Earth<A NAME = "AO185"></A> comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open
ground and narrow passes;the chances of life and death.
<P>

<P>

9. The Commander<A NAME = "AO207"></A> stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevolence,
courage and strictness.
<P>

<P>

10. By method<A NAME = "AO227"></A> and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army
in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the
maintenance<A NAME = "AO2256"></A><A NAME = "AS2257"></A><A NAME = "AS2258"></A><A NAME = "AB2259"></A> of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control
of military<A NAME = "AB2288"></A> expenditure.
<P>

<P>

11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them
will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.
<P>

12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military
conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise:--

<P>

13. (1) Which of the two<A NAME = "AO2615"></A><A NAME = "AS2616"></A> sovereigns is imbued with the Moral<A NAME = "AB2629"></A> law?
(2) Which of the two<A NAME = "AO2645"></A> generals has most ability?  (3) With whom lie<A NAME = "AO2665"></A> the advantages derived from
Heaven and Earth?  (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
  (5) Which army is stronger?  (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
(7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?
<P>


14. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.

<P>

<P>
These three<A NAME = "AO4193"></A><A NAME = "AS4194"></A> cases recognize that the FCC<A NAME = "BB41915"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB419130"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> did not define &quot;indecency&quot;
for cable and dial-a-porn in a vacuum.  Rather, it borrowed from the Supreme<A NAME = "AB41956"></A>
Court's decision in FCC<A NAME = "BB41965"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB42154"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  In that
case (which I describe in greater detail below), the Supreme<A NAME = "AO419108"></A><A NAME = "AS419109"></A><A NAME = "AS419110"></A><A NAME = "BB419111"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB419163"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court established
the rough outline from which the FCC<A NAME = "BB419130"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB435124"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> fashioned its three-part definition.  For
the first two parts of the test, the Supreme<A NAME = "AO419161"></A><A NAME = "AS419162"></A><A NAME = "BB419163"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB422407"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court emphasized the &quot;importance
of context&quot; in examining arguably indecent material.  Id. at 747 n.25.  &quot;Context<A NAME = "AO419200"></A><A NAME = "AS419201"></A>&quot;
in the Pacifica<A NAME = "AB419209"></A> opinion includes consideration of both the particular medium
from which the material originates and the particular community that receives
the material.  Id. at 746 (assuming that the Carlin monologue &quot;would be
protected in other contexts&quot;); id. at 748-51 (discussing the attributes of
broadcast); see also Information Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 876
(discussing the &quot;content/context dichotomy&quot;).  Second, the opinion
limits its discussion to &quot;patently offensive sexual and excretory<A NAME = "AB419362"></A> language&quot;,
Pacifica, 438<A NAME = "AO419371"></A><A NAME = "AS419372"></A> U.S. at 747, and this type of content has remained the FCC's<A NAME = "AB419397"></A>
touchstone.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 112.(5)</P>
<P>We have quoted from the CDA extensively above and I will only briefly
rehearse that discussion here.  Section<A NAME = "AO42035"></A><A NAME = "AS42036"></A><A NAME = "AS42037"></A><A NAME = "AB42038"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB42082"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> 223(a) of the CDA criminalizes &quot;indecent&quot;
speech on the Internet<A NAME = "BB42064"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB423234"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  This is the &quot;indecency&quot; provision.  Section<A NAME = "AO42079"></A><A NAME = "AS42080"></A><A NAME = "AS42081"></A><A NAME = "BB42082"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF42038"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
223(d) of the CDA addresses speech that, &quot;in context, depicts or describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory<A NAME = "BB420139"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF38140"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> activities or organs&quot;.  This is the &quot;patently
offensive&quot; provision.  The foregoing discussion leads me to conclude that
these two provisions describe the same kind of speech.  That is, the use of &quot;indecent&quot;
in &#167; 223(a) is shorthand for the longer description in &#167; 223(d).
Conversely, the longer description in &#167; 223(d) is itself the definition of &quot;indecent&quot;
speech.  I believe Congress could have used the word &quot;indecent&quot; in
both &#167; 223(a) and &#167; 223(d), or it could have used the &quot;patently
offensive&quot; description of &#167; 223(d) in &#167; 223(a), without a change
in the meaning of the Act.  I do not believe that Congress intended that this
distinction alone would change the reach of either section of the CDA.(6)</P>
<P>The CDA's<A NAME = "AO4213"></A><A NAME = "AS4214"></A><A NAME = "AB4215"></A> legislative history confirms this conclusion.  There, the
conference<A NAME = "AO42122"></A><A NAME = "AS42123"></A> committee explicitly noted that &#167; 223(d) &quot;codifies the
definition of indecency from FCC<A NAME = "BB42154"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB421137"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). .
. .  The conferees<A NAME = "AO42179"></A><A NAME = "AS42180"></A><A NAME = "AS42181"></A><A NAME = "AS42182"></A> intend that the term indecency (and the rendition of the
definition of that term in new section 502) has the same meaning as established
in FCC<A NAME = "BB421137"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF213348"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and Sable<A NAME = "BB421158"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF370208"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Communications of
California, Inc<A NAME = "BB421167"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF370217"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).&quot;  Senate Report at 188,
reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.  The legislative<A NAME = "AO421215"></A><A NAME = "AS421216"></A><A NAME = "BB421217"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB617114"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> history makes clear
that Congress<A NAME = "AO421228"></A><A NAME = "AS421229"></A> did not intend to create a distinction in meaning when it used the
generic<A NAME = "AB421258"></A> term &quot;indecency&quot; in &#167; 223(a) and the definition of that
term in &#167; 223(d).(7)</P>
<P>There is no doubt that the CDA<A NAME = "AO42213"></A> requires the most stringent review for
vagueness, since it is a criminal<A NAME = "BB42238"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB465108"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> statute that &quot;threatens to inhibit the
exercise of constitutionally protected rights&quot;.  Colautti v. Franklin, 439
U.S 379, 391 (1979); see also Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8 (1983);
Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09.  My analysis here nevertheless leads ineluctably to
the conclusion that the definition of indecency is not unconstitutionally vague.
 The Miller<A NAME = "AO422161"></A><A NAME = "AS422162"></A><A NAME = "AB422163"></A> definition of obscenity has survived such challenges, see, e.g.,
Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 118-19 (1974); Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v.
Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57<A NAME = "AO422227"></A> (1989), and the definition of indecency contains a
subset of the elements of obscenity.  If the Miller<A NAME = "AO422264"></A><A NAME = "AS422265"></A><A NAME = "AS422266"></A><A NAME = "AB422267"></A> test &quot;give[s] the
person of ordinary intelligence<A NAME = "BB422286"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF380125"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> a reasonable opportunity to know what is
prohibited, so that he may act accordingly&quot;, Grayned v. City of Rockford,
408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972), the omission<A NAME = "AO422343"></A> of parts of that test does not warrant a
contrary conclusion.  See Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1541-42.
Similarly, since the definition<A NAME = "AO422393"></A><A NAME = "AS422394"></A> of indecency arose from the Supreme<A NAME = "BB422407"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44134"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court itself
in Pacifica, we may fairly<A NAME = "AO422422"></A><A NAME = "AS422423"></A><A NAME = "AS422424"></A> imply that the Court did not believe its own
interpretation to invite &quot;arbitrary and discriminatory<A NAME = "AB422456"></A> enforcement&quot; or
&quot;abut upon sensitive areas of basic First<A NAME = "BB422477"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47192"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment freedoms&quot;.
Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations and alterations omitted).  Sable<A NAME = "AO422508"></A><A NAME = "AS422509"></A><A NAME = "BB422510"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB423318"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, while
not explicitly addressing the issue of vagueness, reinforces this conclusion.
See Information Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 875-76 (citing Sable, 492 U.S.
at 126-27).  It follows, then, that plaintiffs' vagueness challenge is not
likely to succeed on the merits and does not support preliminary injunctive<A NAME = "BB422612"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB591188"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
relief.</P>
<P>The possible interpretations of the defenses in &#167; 223(e) do not alter
this conclusion.  As a matter of statutory construction, &#167; 223(e)(5)(B)
could not be clearer.  This section, which imports the dial-a-porn defenses into
the CDA, creates &quot;specific and objective&quot; methods to avoid liability.
See Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 629 (1984).  Section
223(e)(5)(A) is more suspect, since it arguably &quot;fail[s] to describe with
sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to satisfy&quot; it.
Kolender 461 U.S. at 361.(8)  Yet even though the defenses<A NAME = "AO423216"></A><A NAME = "AS423217"></A> in both sections are
unavailable to many Internet<A NAME = "BB423234"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB423371"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users, their unavailability does not render the
liability provisions vague.  Rather, their unavailability just transforms &#167;
223(a) and &#167; 223(d) into a total ban, in violation of Butler v. Michigan,
352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957), and Sable<A NAME = "BB423318"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB434180"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.  I am sensitive to
plaintiffs' arguments that the statute<A NAME = "AO423347"></A><A NAME = "AS423348"></A>, as written, does not create safe harbors
through which all Internet<A NAME = "BB423371"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB4455"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users may shield themselves from liability.
Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 37-38.  Here again, however, the absence of safe
harbors relates to the (over)breadth of a statute, and not its vagueness.  See
Sable, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.</P>
<H1>C.  Plaintiffs' Likelihood of Prosecution Under the Act</H1>
<P>The Government<A NAME = "AO4263"></A> has consistently argued that the speech of many of the
plaintiffs here is almost certainly not indecent.  They point, for example, to
the educational and political content of plaintiffs' speech, and they also
suggest that the occasional curse word in a card catalogue will probably not
result in prosecution.  See Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N.
at 203 (&quot;Material with serious redeeming value is quite obviously intended
to edify and educate, not to offend.&quot;).  In this section I address that
argument.</P>
<P>I agree with the Government that some of plaintiffs' claims are somewhat
exaggerated, but hyperbolic claims do not in themselves weigh in the
Government's<A NAME = "AB42747"></A> favor.  In recent First Amendment challenges, the Supreme Court has
itself paid close attention to extreme applications of content-based laws.  </P>
<P>In Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State Crimes Victim
Board, 502 U.S. 105 (1991), the Court<A NAME = "AO42843"></A> addressed the constitutionality of a law
that required criminals to turn over to their victims any income<A NAME = "AO42878"></A><A NAME = "AS42879"></A><A NAME = "AS42880"></A><A NAME = "AB42881"></A> derived from
books, movies, or other commercial<A NAME = "AB42896"></A> exploitation of their crimes.  Id. at 504-05.
 In its opinion, the Court<A NAME = "AO428124"></A><A NAME = "AS428125"></A> evaluated the argument of an amicus<A NAME = "AB428138"></A> curiae that the
law's reach could include books such as The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Civil<A NAME = "AB428171"></A>
Disobedience, and Confessions<A NAME = "AB428178"></A> of Saint Augustine, and authors such as Emma<A NAME = "AB428195"></A>
Goldman, Martin<A NAME = "AB428200"></A> Luther King, Jr., Sir<A NAME = "AB428210"></A> Walter Raleigh, Jesse Jackson, and
Bertrand<A NAME = "AB428223"></A> Russell.  Id. at 121-22.  The Court<A NAME = "AO428238"></A> credited the argument even while
recognizing that it was laced with &quot;hyperbole&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The argument that [the] statute . . . would prevent publication of all of
these works is hyperbole -- some would have been written without compensation --
but the . . . law<A NAME = "AO42961"></A> clearly reaches a wide range of literature that does not
enable a criminal to profit from his crime while a victim remains uncompensated.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 122.  If a content-based law &quot;can produce such an outcome&quot;,
id. at 123 (emphasis added), then Simon &amp; Schuster allows us to consider
those outcomes in our analysis.</P>
<P>Even more recently, in United<A NAME = "BB4319"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF406182"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States v. National Treasury Employees Union,
115 S. <A NAME = "AB43128"></A>Ct. 1003 (1995), the Court<A NAME = "AO43140"></A> addressed the constitutionality of a law that
banned federal employees from accepting honoraria for publications unrelated to
their work.  Id. at 1008.  The Court noted that the law<A NAME = "AO43197"></A><A NAME = "AS43198"></A><A NAME = "AS43199"></A> would reach &quot;literary
giants like Nathaniel<A NAME = "AB431113"></A> Hawthorne and Herman<A NAME = "AB431120"></A> Melville, . . . Walt<A NAME = "AB431128"></A> Whitman, . . .
and Bret Harte&quot;.  Id. at 1012.  This concern resurfaced later in the
opinion, see id. at 1015 (&quot;[W]e cannot ignore the risk that [the ban] might
deprive us of the work of a future Melville<A NAME = "AB431213"></A> or Hawthorne<A NAME = "AB431218"></A>.&quot;), even though a
footnote immediately renders this concern at least hyperbolic:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These authors'<A NAME = "AO4323"></A><A NAME = "AS4324"></A><A NAME = "AS4325"></A> familiar masterworks<A NAME = "AB43210"></A> would survive the honoraria<A NAME = "AB43219"></A> ban as
currently administered.  Besides exempting all books, the [regulations
implementing the ban] protect fiction and poetry from the ban's coverage,
although the statute's language is not so clear.  But some great artists deal in
fact as well as fiction, and some deal in both.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. n.16 (citations omitted).</P>
<P>Here, even though it is perhaps unlikely that the Carnegie<A NAME = "AO43419"></A><A NAME = "AS43420"></A><A NAME = "AS43421"></A><A NAME = "AS43422"></A><A NAME = "BB43423"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF20038"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Library will ever
stand in the dock for putting its card catalogue online, or that the Government
will hale the ACLU<A NAME = "BB43466"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB441186"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> into court for its online<A NAME = "AB43477"></A> quiz of the seven dirty words, we
cannot ignore that the Act could reach these activities.  The definition of
indecency, like the definition of obscenity, is not a rigid formula.  Rather, it
confers a large degree of autonomy to individual communities to set the bounds
of decency for themselves.  Cf. Sable<A NAME = "BB434180"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB4713"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 125-26.  This is as it should
be, since this flexibility recognizes that ours is a country with diverse
cultural and historical roots.  See, e.g., Hamling, 418 U.S. at 104 (&quot;A
<A NAME = "AO434253"></A><A NAME = "AS434254"></A>juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average
person in the community or vicinage<A NAME = "AB434296"></A> from which he comes for making the required
determination, just as he is entitled to draw on his knowledge of the
propensities of a 'reasonable' person in other areas of the law.&quot;).</P>
<P>Putting aside hyperbolic application, I also have little doubt that some
communities could well consider plaintiffs' speech indecent, and these
plaintiffs could -- perhaps should -- have a legitimate fear of prosecution.  In
Action for Children's<A NAME = "BB43571"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF387489"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1995), the

<P>Id. at 657 (citing In re Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 3 FCC R. 930, 932
(1987)).  In Infinity Broadcasting, one of the broadcasts that the FCC<A NAME = "AO43754"></A><A NAME = "AS43755"></A><A NAME = "BB43756"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43933"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> found
indecent was an excerpt of a play about AIDS, finding that the excerpts<A NAME = "AO43785"></A> &quot;contained
the concentrated and repeated use of vulgar and shocking language to portray
graphic and lewd depictions of excretion, anal intercourse, ejaculation,
masturbation, and oral-genital sex&quot;.  3 FCC R. at 934.(9)  To the FCC, even
broadcasts with &quot;public value . . . addressing the serious problems posed
by AIDS&quot; can be indecent if &quot;that material is presented in a manner
that is patently offensive&quot;.  Id. (emphasis in original).(10)  </P>
<P>Yet, this is precisely the kind<A NAME = "AO43811"></A><A NAME = "AS43812"></A> of speech that occurs, for example, on
Critical<A NAME = "AB43829"></A> Path AIDS Project's Web site, which includes safer sex instructions
written in street language for easy comprehension.  The Web<A NAME = "AO43868"></A><A NAME = "AS43869"></A><A NAME = "AS43870"></A><A NAME = "AS43871"></A><A NAME = "BB43872"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB482111"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site also describes
the risk of HIV<A NAME = "AB43887"></A> transmission for particular sexual<A NAME = "AB43896"></A> practices.  The FCC's
implication in In the Matter of King Broadcasting Co., 5 FCC R. 2971 (1990),
that a &quot;candid discussion[] of sexual<A NAME = "AB438150"></A> topics&quot; on television<A NAME = "BB438158"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB448511"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> was decent
in part because it was &quot;not presented in a pandering, titillating or vulgar
manner&quot; would be unavailing to Critical<A NAME = "BB438203"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF20485"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Path, other plaintiffs, and some
amici<A NAME = "AB438216"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44070"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  These organizations<A NAME = "AO438221"></A><A NAME = "AS438222"></A><A NAME = "AS438223"></A> want to pander and titillate<A NAME = "AB438234"></A> on their Web<A NAME = "BB438241"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB485134"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> sites, at
least to a degree, to attract a teen audience and deliver their message in an
engaging and coherent way.(11)</P>
<P>In In re letter to Merrell Hansen, 6 FCC R. 3689 (1990), the FCC<A NAME = "AO43929"></A><A NAME = "AS43930"></A><A NAME = "AS43931"></A><A NAME = "AS43932"></A><A NAME = "BB43933"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43981"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> found
indecent a morning discussion between two announcers regarding Jim<A NAME = "AB43954"></A> Bakker's
alleged rape<A NAME = "AB43961"></A> of Jessica Hahn.  Id.  Here, too, the FCC<A NAME = "AO43978"></A><A NAME = "AS43979"></A><A NAME = "AS43980"></A><A NAME = "BB43981"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44175"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> recognized that the
broadcast had public<A NAME = "AB43994"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB62020"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> value.  Id. (noting that the broadcast concerned &quot;an
incident that was at the time 'in the news'&quot;).  Yet, under the FCC's
interpretation of Pacifica, &quot;the merit of a work is 'simply one of the many
variables' that make up a work's context&quot;.  Id. (citation omitted).</P>
<P>One of the plaintiffs here, Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., has as its core
purpose the issue of prison rape.  The organization creates chat rooms in which
members can discuss their experiences.  Some amici<A NAME = "AO44066"></A><A NAME = "AS44067"></A><A NAME = "AS44068"></A><A NAME = "AS44069"></A><A NAME = "BB44070"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF438216"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have also organized Web sites
dedicated to survivors of rape, incest<A NAME = "AB44093"></A>, and other sexual<A NAME = "AB440100"></A> abuse.  These Web sites
provide fora for the discussion and contemplation of shared experiences.  The
operators of these sites, and their participants, could legitimately fear
prosecution under the CDA.</P>
<P>With respect to vulgarity, the Government is in a similarly weak position.
In Pacifica, the Supreme<A NAME = "AO44132"></A><A NAME = "AS44133"></A><A NAME = "BB44134"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB445231"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court held that multiple repetition of expletives could
be indecent.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750.  Although the FCC<A NAME = "AO44171"></A><A NAME = "AS44172"></A><A NAME = "AS44173"></A><A NAME = "AS44174"></A><A NAME = "BB44175"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB460204"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> did not follow this
rationale with respect to a broadcast of &quot;a bona fide news<A NAME = "AB441107"></A> story&quot; on
National<A NAME = "AB441115"></A> Public Radio, Letter to Mr. Peter Branton, 6 FCC R. 610 (1991), aff'd
on other grounds sub<A NAME = "AB441152"></A> nom. Branton v. FCC, 993 F.2d 906, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1993),
the ACLU<A NAME = "AO441183"></A><A NAME = "AS441184"></A><A NAME = "AS441185"></A><A NAME = "BB441186"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB570241"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, a plaintiff here, could take little comfort from that administrative<A NAME = "AB441207"></A>
decision.  It would need to discern, for example, whether a chat room that it
organized to discuss the meaning of the word fuck was more like the Carlin
monologue or more like a National Public Radio broadcast.(12)  Plaintiffs'
expert would have found expletives indecent in a community consisting only of
himself,(13) and his views undoubtedly -- and reasonably -- reflect the view of
many people.  </P>
<P>In sum, I am less confident than the Government that societal mores have
changed so drastically since Pacifica that an online equivalent of the Carlin
monologue, or the Carlin monologue itself online, would pass muster under the
CDA.  Under existing precedent, plaintiffs' fear of prosecution under the Act is
legitimate, even though they are not the pornographers Congress had in mind when
it passed the CDA.(14)   Cf<A NAME = "AB442137"></A>. City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987).
My discussion of the effect and reach of the CDA, therefore, applies both to
plaintiffs' hyperbolic concerns and to their very real ones.</P>
<H1>D.  A Medium-Specific Analysis</H1>
<P>The Internet<A NAME = "AO4453"></A><A NAME = "AS4454"></A><A NAME = "BB4455"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB445175"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is a new medium of mass communication.(15)  As such, the
Supreme<A NAME = "AO44532"></A><A NAME = "AS44533"></A><A NAME = "AS44534"></A><A NAME = "BB44535"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF405117"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court's First Amendment jurisprudence compels us to consider the special
qualities of this new medium in determining whether the CDA is a constitutional<A NAME = "AB44582"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB45739"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
exercise of governmental power.  Relying on these special qualities, which we
have described at length in our Findings of fact above, I conclude<A NAME = "AO445129"></A><A NAME = "AS445130"></A><A NAME = "AS445131"></A> that the CDA
is unconstitutional and that the First<A NAME = "BB445150"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB448439"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment denies Congress the power to
regulate protected speech on the Internet<A NAME = "BB445175"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB457194"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  This analysis<A NAME = "AO445180"></A><A NAME = "AS445181"></A> and conclusions are
consistent with Congress's<A NAME = "AB445194"></A> intent to avoid tortuous and piecemeal review of the
CDA by authorizing expedited, direct review in the Supreme<A NAME = "BB445231"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB448127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court &quot;as a
matter of right&quot; of interlocutory, and not merely final, orders upholding
facial challenges to the Act.  See &#167; 561(b) of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996.(16)</P>
<H1>1.  The Differential Treatment of Mass Communication Media</H1>
<P>Nearly fifty years ago, Justice<A NAME = "AO4489"></A><A NAME = "AS44810"></A><A NAME = "AB44811"></A> Jackson recognized that &quot;[t]he moving
picture screen, the radio<A NAME = "BB44834"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB448506"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, the newspaper, the handbill, the sound<A NAME = "AO44847"></A><A NAME = "AS44848"></A> truck and the
street corner orator have differing natures<A NAME = "AB44867"></A>, values, abuses and dangers.  Each .
. . is a law unto itself&quot;.  Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 97 (1949)
(Jackson, J., concurring).  The Supreme<A NAME = "AO448124"></A><A NAME = "AS448125"></A><A NAME = "AS448126"></A><A NAME = "BB448127"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB448463"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court has expressed this sentiment time
and again since that date, and differential treatment of the mass media has
become established First<A NAME = "AB448172"></A> Amendment doctrine.  See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting
Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2456 (1994) (&quot;It is true that our cases
have permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers than of speakers
in other media.&quot;); Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748 (&quot;We have long recognized
that each medium of expression presents special First Amendment problems.&quot;);

(&quot;Different<A NAME = "AO448334"></A><A NAME = "AS448335"></A><A NAME = "AS448336"></A><A NAME = "AB448337"></A> communications media are treated differently for First<A NAME = "BB448352"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF31545"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Amendment purposes.&quot;) (Blackmun, J., concurring); Metromedia<A NAME = "AB448371"></A>, Inc<A NAME = "AB448374"></A>. v. City
of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 500-01 (1981) (plurality opinion) (&quot;This Court<A NAME = "AO448411"></A><A NAME = "AS448412"></A>
has often faced the problem of applying the broad principles of the First<A NAME = "BB448439"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB457159"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Amendment to unique forums of expression.&quot;).  Thus, the Supreme<A NAME = "AO448461"></A><A NAME = "AS448462"></A><A NAME = "BB448463"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB46025"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court has

Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), cable television, Turner, 114 S.
Ct. at 2456-57, and even billboards, Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 501, and drive-in

(6)The statute at &#167; 509 amends 47 U.S.C. to add &#167; 230(e)(2), which
defines such a service<A NAME = "AO56943"></A><A NAME = "AS56944"></A><A NAME = "AS56945"></A><A NAME = "AS56946"></A><A NAME = "AS56947"></A><A NAME = "AS56948"></A> as &quot;any information service, system, or access
software provider that provides or enables computer<A NAME = "AB56978"></A> access by multiple users to
a computer<A NAME = "AB56993"></A> server, including specifically a service or system that provides
access to the Internet<A NAME = "BB569120"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB581104"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and such systems operated or services offered by
libraries<A NAME = "BB569139"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF6689"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or educational<A NAME = "BB569144"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF6657"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> institutions.&quot;</P>
<P>(7)In the Government's Opposition to plaintiffs' motion for a temporary
restraining order in C.A. No. 96-963, it notes &quot;the Department has a
longstanding policy that previous<A NAME = "AO57057"></A> such provisions are unconstitutional and will
not be enforced&quot;, and that both President Clinton and General Reno &quot;have
made th[e] point clear&quot; that no<A NAME = "AO570112"></A> one will be prosecuted under &quot;the
abortion-related provision of newly-amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462(c).&quot; 
Opposition at 19, n.11 (February 14, 1996).  In view of this &quot;longstanding
policy&quot;, the Government<A NAME = "AO570188"></A> contends there is no realistic fear of prosecution
and, so the argument goes, no need for equitable relief.  Id.  In their
post-hearing brief, the ACLU<A NAME = "BB570241"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF200236"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> plaintiffs inform us that in view of the
Government's statement, &quot;they do not seek a preliminary injunction against

the enforcement of &#167; 1462(c).&quot;  Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffs at

2 n.2.</P>
<P>(8)The court<A NAME = "AO5716"></A><A NAME = "AS5717"></A> again expresses its appreciation to the parties for their
cooperative<A NAME = "AB57128"></A> attitude in evolving the stipulation.</P>
<P>(9)The Government has not by motion challenged the standing of any plaintiff
in either case, and we harbor no doubts of our own on that point,
notwithstanding the Government's suggestion in a footnote of its post-hearing
brief.  See Defendants' Post-Hearing Memorandum at 37 n.46 (&quot;Plaintiffs'
assertions as to the speech at issue are so off-point as to raise standing
concerns.&quot;).  Descriptions of these plaintiffs, as well as of the nature
and content of the speech they contend is or may be affected by the CDA, are set
forth in paragraphs 70 through 356 at pages 30 through 103 of the parties'
stipulation filed in these actions.  These paragraphs will not be reproduced
here, but will be deemed adopted as Findings of the court.</P>
<P>(10)It became clear from the testimony that moderated newsgroups<A NAME = "BB57320"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB57333"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are the
exception and unmoderated newsgroups<A NAME = "BB57333"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB634349"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are the rule.</P>
<P>(11)The evidence adduced at the hearings provided detail to this paragraph
of the parties' stipulation.  See Findings 95 to 107.</P>
<P>(12)Testimony<A NAME = "AO5754"></A><A NAME = "AS5755"></A> adduced at the hearing suggests that market<A NAME = "BB57520"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF52392"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> forces exist to
limit the availability of material on-line that parents consider inappropriate
for their children.  Although the parties sharply dispute the efficacy of
so-called &quot;parental<A NAME = "AB57578"></A> empowerment&quot; software, there is a sufficiently
wide zone of agreement on what is available to restrict access to unwanted sites
that the parties were able to enter into twenty-one paragraphs of stipulated
facts on the subject, which form the basis of paragraphs 49 through 69 of our
Findings of fact.  Because of the rapidity of developments in this field, some

of the technological facts we have found may become partially obsolete by the
time of publication of these Findings.</P>
<P>(13)This membership is constantly growing, according to the testimony of
Albert Vezza, Chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium.  See also Defendants'
Ex. D-167.</P>
<P>(14)See also Defendants' Ex. D-174 and the testimony of Mr. Vezza.</P>
<P>(15) From this point, our Findings are, unless noted, no longer based upon
the parties' stipulation, but upon the record adduced at the hearings.  </P>
<P>(16)Mr. Bradner is a member of the Internet<A NAME = "AB57918"></A> Engineering Task Force, the

service.&quot;</P>
<P>(19)By &quot;verification&quot;, we mean the method by which a user types in

valid before it allows the user to enter the site.</P>
<P>(20)InterNIC is a naming organization, not a regulator of content.  InterNIC<A NAME = "AO58324"></A><A NAME = "AS58325"></A><A NAME = "AS58326"></A>
and two other European<A NAME = "AB58335"></A> organizations maintain a master list of domain<A NAME = "AB58350"></A> names to

domain<A NAME = "BB58386"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF258178"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> name with InterNIC, and the agency will instruct the creator to choose
another name if the new Web<A NAME = "BB583123"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB630149"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site has the name of an already-existing site. 
InterNIC has no control over content on a site after registration.</P>
<P>(21)This paragraph<A NAME = "AO5846"></A> and the preceding paragraph also illustrate that a
content provider might store its own material or someone else's on a caching
server.  The goal -- saving money and time -- is the same in both cases.</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Sloviter)</H2>
<P>(1)It also probably covers<A NAME = "AO58710"></A><A NAME = "AS58711"></A> speech protected by the First<A NAME = "BB58722"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB59980"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment for some

minors, an issue which it is not necessary to decide in light of the other
conclusions reached.</P>
<P>(2)See 141 Cong. Rec. S8342 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (letter from Kent
Markus, Acting Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, to
Senator Leahy).</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Buckwalter)</H2>
<P>(1)If by virtue of the statute's authorization of expedited review of its
constitutionality, &quot;on its face,&quot; 47 U.S.C. &#167;561(a), we were

<P>
<H1>Preliminary Injunction</H1>
<P>When Congress<A NAME = "AO3613"></A><A NAME = "AS3614"></A> decided that material unsuitable for minors was available on
the Internet<A NAME = "BB36127"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB37141"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, it could have chosen to assist and support the development of
technology that would enable parents, schools, and libraries to screen such
material from their end.  It did not do so, and thus did not follow the example
available in the print media where non-obscene but indecent and patently
offensive books and magazines abound.  Those responsible for minors undertake
the primary obligation to prevent their exposure to such material.  Instead, in
the CDA<A NAME = "AO361176"></A><A NAME = "AS361177"></A><A NAME = "AB361178"></A> Congress chose to place on the speakers the obligation of screening the
material that would possibly offend some communities. </P>
<P>Whether Congress' decision was a wise one is not at issue here.  It was
unquestionably a decision that placed the CDA in serious conflict with our most
cherished protection - the right to choose the material to which we would have
access.  </P>
<P>The government makes what I view as an extraordinary argument in its brief.
It argues that blocking technology needed for effective parental control is not
yet widespread but that it &quot;will imminently be in place.&quot; Government's
Post-hearing Memorandum at 66.  It then states that if we uphold the CDA, it &quot;will
likely unleash the 'creative genius' of the Internet<A NAME = "AB363124"></A> community to find a myriad
of possible solutions.&quot;  I can imagine few arguments less likely to
persuade a court to uphold a criminal<A NAME = "BB363173"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB380509"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> statute than one that depends on future
technology to cabin the reach of the statute within constitutional bounds.</P>
<P>The government makes yet another argument that troubles me.  It suggests
that the concerns expressed by the plaintiffs and the questions posed by the
court reflect an exaggerated supposition of how it would apply<A NAME = "AO36467"></A><A NAME = "AS36468"></A><A NAME = "AS36469"></A><A NAME = "AS36470"></A> the law, and that
we should, in effect, trust the Department<A NAME = "AB36493"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB364310"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Justice to limit the CDA's<A NAME = "AB364106"></A>
application in a reasonable fashion that would avoid prosecution for placing on
the Internet<A NAME = "AB364135"></A> works of serious literary or artistic merit.  That would require a
broad trust indeed from a generation of judges not far removed from the attacks
on James Joyce's Ulysses as obscene.  See United States v. One Book Entitled
Ulysses, 72 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1934); see also Book Named &quot;John Cleland's
Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot; v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413
(1966).  Even if we were to place confidence in the reasonable judgment of the
representatives of the Department<A NAME = "BB364310"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF36493"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of Justice who appeared before us, the
Department<A NAME = "AO364327"></A><A NAME = "AS364328"></A><A NAME = "AS364329"></A> is not a monolithic structure, and individual U.S<A NAME = "AB364346"></A>. Attorneys in the
various districts of the country have or appear to exercise some independence,
as reflected by the Department's<A NAME = "AB364388"></A> tolerance of duplicative challenges in this
very case.</P>
<P>But the bottom<A NAME = "AO3655"></A><A NAME = "AS3656"></A> line is that the First<A NAME = "BB36517"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB37239"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment should not be interpreted to
require us to entrust the protection it affords to the judgment of prosecutors.
Prosecutors come and go. Even<A NAME = "AO36567"></A><A NAME = "AS36568"></A> federal<A NAME = "AB36571"></A> judges are limited to life tenure.  The
First Amendment remains to give protection to future generations as well.  I
have no hesitancy in concluding that it is likely that plaintiffs will prevail
on the merits of their argument that the challenged<A NAME = "AO365154"></A><A NAME = "AS365155"></A> provisions of the CDA are
facially invalid under both the First and Fifth<A NAME = "AB365182"></A> Amendments.  </P>
<HR>
<P>BUCKWALTER, District Judge</P>
<H1>A.</H1>
<P>I believe that plaintiffs should prevail in this litigation.  </P>
<P>My conclusion<A NAME = "AO3703"></A><A NAME = "AS3704"></A> differs in part from my original memorandum filed in
conjunction with the request for a Temporary<A NAME = "AB37037"></A> Restraining Order.  As part of the
expedited review (per &#167; 561 of the CDA), and in contrast to the limited
documentation available to me at the time of the T.R.O. hearing, we have now

gathered voluminous evidence presented by way of sworn declarations, live
testimony, demonstrative evidence, and other exhibits.(1)  Based upon our
findings of fact derived from careful consideration of that evidence, I now
conclude that this statute is overbroad and does not meet the strict scrutiny
standard in Sable<A NAME = "AB370208"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB421158"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Communications of California, Inc<A NAME = "AB370217"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB421167"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115
(1989).</P>
<P>More specifically, I now find that current technology is inadequate to
provide a safe harbor to most speakers on the Internet<A NAME = "BB37141"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB374142"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  On this issue, I concur
in Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion.  In addition, I continue to believe that the
word &quot;indecent&quot; is unconstitutionally vague, and I find that the terms
&quot;in context&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; also are so vague as
to violate the First and Fifth Amendments.</P>
<P>It is, of course, correct that statutes<A NAME = "AO37213"></A><A NAME = "AS37214"></A> that attempt to regulate the content
of speech presumptively violate the First<A NAME = "BB37239"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB372195"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment.  <I>See e.g.</I> R.A.V. v.
City of Saint Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 381 (1992).  That is as it should be.  The
prohibition against Government's regulation of speech cannot be set forth any
clearer than in the language of the First Amendment itself.  I suspect, however,
that it may come<A NAME = "AO372146"></A><A NAME = "AS372147"></A><A NAME = "AS372148"></A><A NAME = "AS372149"></A> as a surprise to many people who have not followed the
evolution of constitutional<A NAME = "BB372178"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB60766"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> law that, by implication at least, the First<A NAME = "BB372195"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB37945"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of
speech <I>unless that law advances a compelling governmental<A NAME = "AB372237"></A> interest</I>.(2)
Our cherished<A NAME = "AO372249"></A><A NAME = "AS372250"></A> freedom of speech does not cover as broad a spectrum as one may
have gleaned from a simple reading<A NAME = "AB372289"></A> of the Amendment.(3)  </P>
<P>First<A NAME = "AO3731"></A><A NAME = "AS3732"></A><A NAME = "AB3733"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB49631"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment jurisprudence has developed into a study of intertwining
standards and applications, perhaps as a necessary response to our ever-evolving
culture and modes of communication.(4)  </P>
<P>Essentially, my concerns are these:  above all, I believe that the
challenged provisions are so vague as to violate both the First and Fifth
Amendments, and in particular that Congress' reliance on Pacifica is misplaced.
In addition, I believe that technology as it currently exists -- and it bears
repeating that we are at the preliminary injunction phase only -- cannot provide
a safe harbor for most speakers on the Internet<A NAME = "BB374142"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB375164"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, thus rendering the statute
unconstitutional under a strict scrutiny analysis.  I refer to Chief Judge
Sloviter's more detailed analysis of this issue. </P>
<P>While I believe that our findings of fact clearly show that as yet no
defense is technologically feasible, and while I also have found the present Act
to be unconstitutionally vague, I believe it is too early in the development of
this new medium to conclude that other attempts to regulate protected speech
within the medium will fail a challenge.  That is to say that I specifically do
not find that any and all statutory<A NAME = "AB375149"></A> regulation of protected speech on the
Internet<A NAME = "BB375164"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB390967"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> could not survive constitutional<A NAME = "AB375173"></A> scrutiny.  Prior<A NAME = "AO375178"></A><A NAME = "AS375179"></A><A NAME = "AS375180"></A> cases have
established that government<A NAME = "AB375191"></A> regulation to prevent access by minors to speech
protected for adults, even in media considered the vanguard of our First
Amendment protections, like print, may withstand a constitutional<A NAME = "AB375248"></A> challenge.
<I> See e.g.</I> Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 635 (1968) (&quot;`Material<A NAME = "AO375285"></A>
which is protected for distribution to adults is not necessarily
constitutionally protected from restriction upon its dissemination to children.'&quot;)
(quoting Bookcase Inc. v. Broderick, 18 N.Y.2d 71, 75, 271 N.Y.S.2d 947, 952,
218 N.E.2d 668, 671 (1966), <I>appeal dismissed, sub nom</I> Bookcase, Inc. v.
Leary, 385 U.S. 12 (1966)).  It should be noted that those restrictions that
have been found constitutional were sensitive to the unique qualities of the
medium at which the restriction was aimed.  </P>
<H1>B.</H1>
<P>This statute, all parties agree, deals with protected speech, the
preservation of which has been extolled by court after court in case after case
as the keystone, the bulwark, the very heart of our democracy. What is more, the
CDA<A NAME = "AO37879"></A><A NAME = "AS37880"></A><A NAME = "AS37881"></A><A NAME = "AB37882"></A> attempts to regulate protected speech through criminal<A NAME = "AB37897"></A> sanctions, thus
implicating not only the First but also the Fifth Amendment of our Constitution.
 The concept<A NAME = "AO378134"></A> of due process is every bit as important to our form of government
as is free speech.  If free speech is at the heart<A NAME = "AB378183"></A> of our democracy, then surely
due process is the very lifeblood of our body politic; for without it, democracy
could not survive.  Distilled to its essence, due process is, of course, nothing
more and nothing less than fair play.  If our citizens cannot rely on fair play
in their relationship with their government, the stature of our government as a
shining example of democracy would be greatly diminished.  I believe that an
exacting or strict scrutiny of a statute which attempts to criminalize protected
speech requires a word by word look at that statute to be sure that it clearly
sets forth as precisely as possible what constitutes a violation of the statute.</P>

<P>The reason for such an examination is obvious.  If the Government<A NAME = "AO37921"></A><A NAME = "AS37922"></A> is going
to intrude upon the sacred ground of the First<A NAME = "BB37945"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB38682"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment and tell its citizens
that their exercise<A NAME = "AO37962"></A> of protected speech could land them in jail, the law
imposing such a penalty must clearly define the prohibited speech not only for
the potential offender but also for the potential enforcer.  Kolender, 461 U.S.

<P>In dealing with issues of vagueness and due process over the years, the
Supreme<A NAME = "AO38027"></A><A NAME = "AS38028"></A><A NAME = "BB38029"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB3851028"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court has enunciated many notable principles.  One concern with vague
laws relates to the issue of notice.  The older cases have used phrases such as
&quot;a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so
vague that men<A NAME = "AO380117"></A><A NAME = "AS380118"></A> of common intelligence<A NAME = "AB380125"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB382106"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> must necessarily guess at its meaning and
differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law,&quot;
 Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926) (citations omitted); &quot;it
will not do to hold an average man to the peril of indictment for the unwise
exercise of his . . . knowledge involving so many factors of varying effect that
neither the person to decide in advance nor the jury to try him after the fact
can safely and certainly judge the result,&quot; Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., 274
U.S. 445, 465 (1927); and &quot;[n]o one may be required at peril of life,
liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.  All are
entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids,&quot; Lanzetta
v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939).  Second, the Court<A NAME = "AO380438"></A> has said that laws
must provide precise standards for those who apply them to prevent arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement, because &quot;[w]hen the legislature<A NAME = "AO380489"></A> fails to
provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal<A NAME = "AO380506"></A><A NAME = "AS380507"></A><A NAME = "AS380508"></A><A NAME = "BB380509"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB42238"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> statute may permit `a standardless<A NAME = "AB380521"></A>
sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal
predilections.'&quot;  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 (citing Goguen, 415 U.S. at
575).  Finally, when First<A NAME = "AB380579"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB46185"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment concerns have been implicated, a stricter
standard of examination for vagueness is imperative.  &quot;[T]his court has
intimated that stricter standards of permissible statutory vagueness may be
applied to a statute having a potentially inhibiting effect on speech; a man may
the less be required to act at his peril here, because the free dissemination of
ideas may be the loser.&quot;  Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 151 (1959).
<I>See also</I> Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 499 (&quot;[P]erhaps the most
important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is
whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected
rights.  If, for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech . . .
, a more stringent vagueness test should apply.&quot;) (citations omitted).</P>
<P>A case which sums up vagueness as it relates to due process as succinctly as
any other is Grayned v. City of Rockford.  Here the court said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for
vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.  Vague laws offend
several important values.  First, because we assume that man is free to steer

between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of
ordinary intelligence<A NAME = "BB382106"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB422286"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so
that he may act accordingly.  Vague laws<A NAME = "AO382139"></A> may trap the innocent by not providing
fair warning.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be
prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.  A
vague law<A NAME = "AO382204"></A><A NAME = "AS382205"></A> impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and
juries for resolution on an <I>ad hoc</I> and subjective basis, with the
attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory<A NAME = "AB382262"></A> application.  Third, but
related, where a vague statute<A NAME = "AO382279"></A><A NAME = "AS382280"></A> &quot;abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First<A NAME = "BB382299"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB422477"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Amendment freedoms,&quot; it &quot;operates to inhibit the exercise of [those]
freedoms.&quot;  Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to &quot;'steer far
wider of the unlawful zone' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas
were clearly marked.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations omitted).  </P>
<P>At the same time, in considering the vagueness issue, as the Government
correctly points out, &quot;[C]ondemned to the use of words, we can never expect
mathematical certainty from our language.&quot; Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110.  <I>See
also </I>Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. 489; Hynes v. Mayor &amp; Council of Oradell,
425 U.S. 610 (1976); Goguen, 415 U.S. 566.   In addition, it will always be true
that the fertile legal &quot;imagination can conjure hypothetical cases in which
the meaning of [disputed] terms will be in nice question.&quot;  American
Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 412 (1950).  Thus, as I considered
the vagueness issue I have kept in mind the observation of Justice Holmes,
denying a challenge to vagueness in Nash<A NAME = "AB384256"></A> v. United States, 229 U.S. 373 (1913).
To Justice Holmes, &quot;the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends
on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some
matter of degree.  If his judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a
short imprisonment . . ., he may incur the penalty of death.&quot;  Nash, 229
U.S. at 377.  Even more recently the court has stated that &quot;due process
does not require `impossible standards' of clarity.&quot;  Kolender, 461 U.S. at
361, (quoting United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1947)).  It is with
all of these principles in mind, as they interplay with the unique features of
the Internet, that I have reached my conclusion.</P>
<P>The fundamental constitutional<A NAME = "AB3855"></A> principle that concerns me is one of simple
fairness, and that is absent in the CDA.  The Government<A NAME = "AO38542"></A> initially argues that &quot;indecent&quot;
in this statute is the same as &quot;patently offensive.&quot;  I do not agree
that a facial reading of this statute supports that conclusion.  The CDA<A NAME = "AO385106"></A><A NAME = "AS385107"></A> does
not define the term &quot;indecent,&quot; and the FCC<A NAME = "AB385129"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB387132"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has not promulgated
regulations defining indecency in the medium of cyberspace.   If &quot;indecent&quot;
and &quot;patently offensive&quot; were intended to have the same meaning,
surely section (a) could have mirrored section (d)'s language.(5)  Indecent in
this statute is an undefined word which, standing alone, offers no guidelines
whatsoever as to its parameters.  Interestingly, another<A NAME = "AO385250"></A><A NAME = "AS385251"></A> federal<A NAME = "AB385254"></A> crime gives a
definition to indecent entirely different from that proposed in the present
case.(6)  While not applicable here, this example<A NAME = "AO385301"></A><A NAME = "AS385302"></A> shows the indeterminate<A NAME = "AB385309"></A> nature
of the word and the need for clear definition, particularly in a statute which
infringes upon protected speech.  Although the use of different terms in &#167;
223(a) and (d) suggests that Congress intended that the terms have different
meanings, the Conference<A NAME = "AO385399"></A><A NAME = "AS385400"></A><A NAME = "BB385401"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF339184"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Report indicates an intention to treat &#167; 223(a) as
containing the same language as &#167; 223(d).  Conf. Rep. at 188-89 (&quot;The
conferees intend that the term indecency . . . has the same<A NAME = "AO385475"></A><A NAME = "AS385476"></A><A NAME = "AS385477"></A><A NAME = "AS385478"></A> meaning as
established in FCC<A NAME = "BB385489"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40542"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and [Sable<A NAME = "BB385511"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB38651"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>] and &quot;New<A NAME = "AB385518"></A>
section 223(d)(1) codifies the definition of indecency from [Pacifica] . . . .
The precise contours of the definition of indecency have varied . . . .  The
essence of the phrase -- patently offensive descriptions of sexual and excretory
activities -- has remained constant, however.&quot;).  Therefore, I will
acknowledge that the term indecency is &quot;reasonably susceptible&quot; to the
definition offered in the Conference Report and might therefore adopt such a
narrowing construction if it would thereby preserve the constitutionality of the
statute.  <I>See</I> Virginia v. American Booksellers Association, 484 U.S.
383, 397 (1988);  Erznoznik<A NAME = "BB385720"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF321312"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).
Accepting<A NAME = "AO385742"></A> these terms as synonymous, however, provides no greater help to a
speaker attempting to comply with the CDA.  Contrary to the Government's
suggestion, Pacifica does not answer the question of whether the terms pass
constitutional<A NAME = "BB385813"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB626153"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> muster in the present case.  In Pacifica, the Court did not
consider a vagueness challenge to the term &quot;indecent,&quot; but considered
only whether the Government had the authority to regulate the particular
broadcast at issue -- George<A NAME = "AO385891"></A><A NAME = "AS385892"></A><A NAME = "AS385893"></A><A NAME = "AB385894"></A> Carlin's Monologue entitled &quot;Filthy<A NAME = "AB385904"></A> Words.&quot;
 In finding in the affirmative, the Court<A NAME = "AO385924"></A> emphasized that its narrow holding
applied only to broadcasting, which is &quot;uniquely accessible to children,
even those too young to read.&quot;  438 U.S. at 749.  Thus, while the Court<A NAME = "AO385987"></A><A NAME = "AS385988"></A><A NAME = "AS385989"></A>
sanctioned the FCC's<A NAME = "AB385996"></A> time restrictions on a radio<A NAME = "AB3851007"></A> program that repeatedly used

vulgar language, the Supreme<A NAME = "AO3851025"></A><A NAME = "AS3851026"></A><A NAME = "AS3851027"></A><A NAME = "BB3851028"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB3868"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court did not hold that use of the term &quot;indecent&quot;
in a statute applied to other media, particularly a criminal statute, would be
on safe constitutional<A NAME = "AB3851083"></A> ground.</P>
<P>The Supreme<A NAME = "AO3863"></A><A NAME = "AS3864"></A><A NAME = "AS3865"></A><A NAME = "AS3866"></A><A NAME = "AS3867"></A><A NAME = "BB3868"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB387240"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court more recently had occasion to consider a statute banning &quot;indecent&quot;
material in the dial-a-porn context in Sable<A NAME = "BB38651"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB387273"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. 115, and found that a
complete ban on such programming violated the First<A NAME = "BB38682"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB403254"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment because it was not
narrowly tailored to serve the purpose of limiting children's access to
commercial<A NAME = "AB386117"></A> pornographic telephone messages.  Once again, the Court did not
consider a challenge to the term &quot;indecent&quot; on vagueness grounds, and
indeed has never directly ruled on this issue.</P>
<P>Several<A NAME = "AO3871"></A> other courts have, however, upheld the use of the term in statutes
regulating different media.  For example, in Information Providers' Coalition v.
FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991), the Ninth<A NAME = "AO38768"></A><A NAME = "AS38769"></A><A NAME = "AS38770"></A><A NAME = "AS38771"></A><A NAME = "AB38772"></A> Circuit Court of Appeals considered
whether the term &quot;indecent&quot; in the 1989 Amendment to the
Communications<A NAME = "AB387107"></A> Act regulating access to telephone dial-a-porn services and the
FCC's<A NAME = "BB387132"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB387153"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> implementing regulations was void for vagueness.  The FCC<A NAME = "AO387149"></A><A NAME = "AS387150"></A><A NAME = "AS387151"></A><A NAME = "AS387152"></A><A NAME = "BB387153"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB38827"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had defined &quot;indecent&quot;
as &quot;the description or depiction of sexual or excretory<A NAME = "BB387181"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB415122"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> activities or
organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards for the telephone<A NAME = "AB387216"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB41786"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> medium.&quot;  928 F.2d at 874.  Although
recognizing that the Supreme<A NAME = "BB387240"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB390697"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court had never explicitly ruled on a vagueness
challenge to the term, the court read Sable<A NAME = "BB387273"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB390654"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and Pacifica as having implicitly
accepted the use of this definition of &quot;indecent.&quot;  The court<A NAME = "AO387307"></A><A NAME = "AS387308"></A><A NAME = "AS387309"></A> further
stated that the FCC's<A NAME = "AB387320"></A> definition of &quot;indecent&quot; was no less imprecise
than was the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot; as announced in Miller<A NAME = "AB387359"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40241"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v.
California, 413 U.S. 15, 25 (1973), and thus concluded that &quot;indecent&quot;
as pertained to dial-a-porn regulations must survive a vagueness challenge.
<I>See also</I> Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir.
1991), (upholding the use of &quot;indecent&quot; in the same amendment to the
Communications Act and FCC regulations.); Action for Children's<A NAME = "AB387489"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43571"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Television v.
FCC, 932 F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C.Cir. 1991) (rejecting vagueness challenge to &quot;indecency&quot;
provision in broadcast television regulations).(7)</P>
<P>Notably, however, in these telephone<A NAME = "AO3889"></A><A NAME = "AS38810"></A><A NAME = "AS38811"></A><A NAME = "AS38812"></A><A NAME = "BB38813"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB628111"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and cable<A NAME = "AB38818"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB41475"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> television cases the FCC<A NAME = "BB38827"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB394314"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had
defined indecent as patently offensive by reference to contemporary community
standards for that particular medium.  <I>See, e.g.</I>, Pacifica, 438 U.S. at
732 (defining &quot;indecent&quot; by reference to terms &quot;patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium&quot;); Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1540 (defining indecency
by reference to contemporary community standards for the telephone medium).
Here, the provision is not so limited.  In fact, there is no effort to conform
the restricting terms to the medium of cyberspace, as is required under Pacifica
and its progeny.</P>

Campaign, National Coalition for the Protection of Children and Families, and
Morality in Media.</P>
<P>(5)The Act<A NAME = "AO5676"></A><A NAME = "AS5677"></A> does not define &quot;telecommunications<A NAME = "BB56717"></A><A HREF = "SPP18.HTM#BB56823"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> device&quot;.  By Order<A NAME = "AO56725"></A>
dated February 27, 1996, we asked the parties to address whether a modem is a &quot;telecommunications
device&quot;.  Plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO56764"></A><A NAME = "AS56765"></A> and the Government answered in the affirmative, and we
agree that the plain meaning of the phrase and the legislative<A NAME = "AB567106"></A> history of the
Act strongly support their conclusion.  &quot;Telecommunications&quot; under 47
U.S.C. &#167; 153(48) means &quot;the transmission, between or among points
specified by the user, of information of the user's choosing, without change in
the form of content of the information as sent and received.&quot;  The plain
meaning of &quot;device&quot; is &quot;something that is formed or formulated by
design and usu[ally] with consideration of possible alternatives, experiment,
and testing.&quot;  Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 618 (1986). 
Clearly, the sponsors of the CDA thought it would reach individual Internet
users, many of whom still connect through modems.  See, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec.
S8329-46 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statements of Sen. Exon and Sen. Coats).</P>
<P>The resolution<A NAME = "AO5683"></A><A NAME = "AS5684"></A><A NAME = "AS5685"></A> of the tension between the scope of &quot;telecommunications<A NAME = "BB56823"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF2899"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
device&quot; and the scope of &quot;interactive<A NAME = "BB56838"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB581113"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> computer service&quot; as
defined in 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230(a)(2), see infra note 6, must await another day.
 It is sufficient for us to conclude that the exclusion of &#167; 223(h)(1)(B)
is probably a narrow one (as the Government has argued), insulating an
interactive computer service from criminal liability under the CDA but not
insulating users who traffic in indecent and patently offensive materials on the
Internet<A NAME = "BB568192"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB569120"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> through those services.</P>

38. When envoys<A NAME = "AO4507"></A> are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that
the enemy wishes for a truce.
<P>

<P>

39. If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long
time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the
situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.
<P>

<P>

40. If our troops<A NAME = "AO4549"></A> are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply
sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.  What we can do
is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on
the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.
<P>

<P>

41. He who exercises<A NAME = "AS4569"></A> no forethought<A NAME = "AB45614"></A> but makes light of his opponents is sure
to be captured by them.
<P>

<P>

42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they
will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically
useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are
not enforced, they will still be unless.
<P>

<P>

43. Therefore soldiers<A NAME = "AO4607"></A> must be treated in the first instance with humanity,
but kept<A NAME = "AS46031"></A> under control by means of iron<A NAME = "AB46044"></A> discipline.  This is a certain road
to victory.
<P>

<P>

44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will
be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.
<P>

<P>

45. If a general<A NAME = "AO4649"></A> shows confidence in his men but always
insists on his orders being obeyed, the gain will be mutual.<BR>
<P>

<H1>X. <A NAME = "AS4663"></A><A NAME = "AB4664"></A>TERRAIN</H1>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO4695"></A><A NAME = "AS4696"></A><A NAME = "BB4697"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB5337"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  We may distinguish six kinds of terrain,
to wit:  (1) Accessible<A NAME = "AS46937"></A><A NAME = "AB46938"></A> ground; (2) entangling ground; (3) temporizing
ground; (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great
distance from the enemy.
<P>

<P>

2. Ground<A NAME = "AO4715"></A> which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible.

<P>

<P>

3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy<A NAME = "AO47325"></A> in occupying
the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies.  Then
you will be able to fight with advantage.
<P>

4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called
entangling.
<P>

<P>

5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally
forth and defeat him. But if the enemy<A NAME = "AO47647"></A> is prepared for your coming, and you
fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.

<P>

<P>

6. When the position is such that neither<A NAME = "AO47817"></A> side will gain by making the first
move, it is called temporizing ground.

64. Be stern in the council-chamber, so that you may control the situation.

<P>

<P>

65. If the enemy<A NAME = "AO6619"></A> leaves a door open, you must rush in.
<P>

<P>

66. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,
and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.
<P>

<P>

67. Walk<A NAME = "AO6655"></A> in the path defined by rule, and accommodate yourself to the enemy
until you can fight a decisive battle.
<P>

<P>

68. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy gives
you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running<A NAME = "AS66749"></A> hare<A NAME = "AB66752"></A>, and it
will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.

<H1>XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE</H1>

<P>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO6725"></A><A NAME = "AS6726"></A><A NAME = "BB6727"></A><A HREF = "SPP24.HTM#BB7197"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  There are five ways of attacking with fire.  The first is
to burn soldiers in their camp; the second is
to burn stores; the third<A NAME = "AO67262"></A> is to burn baggage trains; the fourth is to burn
arsenals and magazines; the fifth<A NAME = "AO67293"></A> is to hurl dropping fire amongst the
enemy.
<P>

<P>

2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.  The
material<A NAME = "AO67431"></A> for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.
<P>

<P>

3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days
for starting a conflagration.
<P>

<P>

4. The proper<A NAME = "AO6787"></A> season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are
those when the moon<A NAME = "AO67840"></A><A NAME = "AS67841"></A> is in the constellations<A NAME = "AB67850"></A> of the Sieve, the Wall, the
Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.
<P>

<P>

5. In attacking with fire, one<A NAME = "AO68013"></A> should be prepared to meet five possible
developments:
<P>

<P>

6. (1) When fire<A NAME = "AO68211"></A><A NAME = "AS68212"></A> breaks out inside to enemy's<A NAME = "AB68223"></A> camp, respond at once with an
attack from without.
<P>

<P>

7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain
quiet, bide your time and do not attack.
<P>

<P>

8. (3) When the force<A NAME = "AO68613"></A> of the flames has reached its height, follow it up
with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.
<P>

<P>

9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not
wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable
moment.
<P>

19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move,
fall<A NAME = "AS29932"></A> like a thunderbolt<A NAME = "AB29939"></A>.
<P>

<P>

20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your
men; when you capture new territory, cut<A NAME = "AS30141"></A> it up into allotments for the
benefit of the soldiery<A NAME = "AB30162"></A>.
<P>

<P>

21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.
<P>

<P>

22. He will conquer who has learnt<A NAME = "AS30515"></A><A NAME = "AB30516"></A> the artifice of deviation.  Such is the
art of maneuvering.
<P>

<P>

23. The Book<A NAME = "AO3077"></A><A NAME = "AS3078"></A><A NAME = "AB3079"></A> of Army Management says:  On the field of battle, the spoken
word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of gongs and drums.
Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough:  hence the institution of
banners and flags.
<P>

<P>

24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears<A NAME = "AO30925"></A><A NAME = "AS30926"></A> and eyes<A NAME = "AB30931"></A>
of the host may be focused on one particular point.
<P>

<P>

25. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either for
the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.  This is
the art of handling large masses of men.
<P>

<P>

26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums, and in
fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing the ears
and eyes of your army.
<P>

<P>

27. A whole<A NAME = "AO3157"></A> army may be robbed of its spirit; a commander-in-chief may be
robbed of his presence of mind.
<P>

<P>

28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning; by noonday<A NAME = "AS31725"></A><A NAME = "AB31726"></A> it has
begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to
camp.
<P>

<P>

29. A clever<A NAME = "AO3197"></A> general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but
attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return.  This is the art of
studying moods.
<P>

<P>

30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub
amongst the enemy:--this is the art of retaining self-possession.
<P>

<P>

31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at
ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well<A NAME = "AO32357"></A>-fed while the
enemy is famished:--this is the art of husbanding one's strength.
<P>

<P>

32. To refrain<A NAME = "AO3257"></A> from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect
order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident
array:--this is the art of studying circumstances.
<P>

<P>

33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to
oppose him when he comes downhill.
<P>

<P>

<P>
The Government<A NAME = "AO3893"></A><A NAME = "AS3894"></A><A NAME = "AS3895"></A><A NAME = "BB3896"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF3386"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> attempts to save the &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;patently
offensive&quot; provisions by claiming that the provisions would only be used to
prosecute pornographic<A NAME = "AB38953"></A> works which, when considered &quot;in context&quot; as
the statute requires, would be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in any community.  The Government<A NAME = "AO389104"></A><A NAME = "AS389105"></A><A NAME = "AS389106"></A> thus contends that plaintiffs'
fears of prosecution for publishing material about matters of health<A NAME = "AB389135"></A>, art,
literature or civil<A NAME = "BB389145"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF200268"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> liberties are exaggerated and unjustified.  The Government's
argument raises two issues:  first is the question<A NAME = "AO389176"></A> of which &quot;community
standards&quot; apply in cyberspace, under the CDA; and second is the
proposition that citizens should simply rely upon prosecutors to apply the
statute constitutionally.</P>
<P>Are the contemporary community standards to be applied those of the vast
world of cyberspace, in accordance with the Act's apparent intent to establish a
uniform national standard of content regulation?  The Government<A NAME = "AO39066"></A> offered no
evidence of any such national standard or nationwide consensus as to what would
be considered &quot;patently offensive&quot;.  On the contrary, in supporting
the use of the term &quot;indecent&quot; in the CDA, the Government<A NAME = "AO390141"></A><A NAME = "AS390142"></A> suggests
that, in part, this term was chosen as a means of insulating children from

material not restricted under current obscenity<A NAME = "AB390186"></A> laws.  This additional term is
necessary, the Government states, because &quot;whether something rises to the
level of obscene is a legal conclusion that, by definition, may vary from
community to community.&quot;  Govt. Brief at 31.  In support of its argument,
the Government<A NAME = "AB390275"></A> points to the Second<A NAME = "AB390284"></A> Circuit's decision in United<A NAME = "AB390293"></A> States v.
Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise, Schedule<A NAME = "AB390311"></A> No. 2102, 709 F.2d 132, 134,
137 (2d Cir. 1983), which upheld the district court's conclusion that &quot;detailed
portrayals of genitalia, sexual<A NAME = "AB390361"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43635"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> intercourse, fellatio<A NAME = "AB390366"></A>, and masturbation<A NAME = "BB390371"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43621"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>&quot;
including the film<A NAME = "AB390379"></A> &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and other pornographic<A NAME = "AB390392"></A> films and
magazines, are not obscene in light of the community standards prevailing in New<A NAME = "BB390423"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB521137"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
York City.&quot;  What this argument indicates is that as interpretations of
obscenity<A NAME = "AB390450"></A> ebb and flow throughout various communities, restrictions<A NAME = "AO390465"></A><A NAME = "AS390466"></A> on indecent
material are meant to cover a greater or lesser quantity of material not reached
by each community's obscenity<A NAME = "AB390507"></A> standard.  It follows that to do this, what
constitutes indecency must be as open to fluctuation as the obscenity standard
and cannot be rigidly constructed as a single national standard if it is meant
to function as the Government has suggested.  As Justice Scalia stated, &quot;[t]he
more narrow the understanding of what is `obscene,' . . . the more pornographic
what is embraced within the residual category of `indecency.'&quot;  Sable<A NAME = "BB390654"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB405155"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492
U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J. concurring).  This understanding is consistent with the
case law, in which the Supreme<A NAME = "AO390695"></A><A NAME = "AS390696"></A><A NAME = "BB390697"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB405188"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court has explained that the relevant community
is the one where the information is accessed and where the local jury sits.
<I>See</I> Sable, 492 U.S. at 125; Hamling<A NAME = "AB390757"></A> v. United States, 418 U.S. 87
(1974); Miller, 413 U.S. at 30 (&quot;[O]ur nation is simply too big and too
diverse for this Court to reasonably expect that such standards [of what is
patently offensive] could be articulated for all 50 states in a single
formulation.&quot;).  However, the Conference Report with regard to the CDA
states that the Act<A NAME = "AO390888"></A> is &quot;intended to establish a uniform national standard
of content regulation.&quot;  Conf. Rep. at 191.  This conflict inevitably
leaves the reader of the CDA unable to discern the relevant &quot;community
standard,&quot; and will undoubtedly cause Internet<A NAME = "BB390967"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB3901022"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users to &quot;steer far
wider of the unlawful zone&quot; than if the community standard to be applied
were clearly defined.  The chilling effect on the Internet<A NAME = "BB3901022"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB402183"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users' exercise of
free speech is obvious.  <I>See</I> Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372
(1964).  This is precisely the vice of vagueness.</P>
<P>In addition, the Government's argument that the challenged<A NAME = "AO39115"></A><A NAME = "AS39116"></A> provisions will
be applied only to &quot;pornographic<A NAME = "AB39132"></A>&quot; materials, and will not be applied
to works with serious value is without support in the CDA itself.  Unlike in the
obscenity context, indecency<A NAME = "AO39182"></A><A NAME = "AS39183"></A><A NAME = "AS39184"></A> has not been defined to exclude works of serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific<A NAME = "AB391113"></A> value, and therefore the
Government's<A NAME = "AB391124"></A> suggestion that it will not be used to prosecute publishers of such
material is without foundation in the law itself.  The Government's claim that
the work must be considered patently offensive &quot;in context&quot; does

nothing to clarify the provision, for it fails to explain which context is
relevant.  &quot;Context&quot; may refer to, among other things, the nature of
the communication as a whole, the time of day it was conveyed, the medium used,
the identity of the speaker, or whether or not it is accompanied by appropriate
warnings.  <I>See e.g.</I>, Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 741 n.16, n.17 (referring to &quot;the
context of the whole book,&quot; and to the unique interpretation of the First
Amendment &quot;in the broadcasting context&quot;).</P>
<P>The thrust<A NAME = "AO3923"></A><A NAME = "AS3924"></A><A NAME = "AS3925"></A> of the Government's<A NAME = "AB39212"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB62116"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> argument is that the court should trust
prosecutors to prosecute only a small segment of those speakers subject to the
CDA's<A NAME = "AB39255"></A> restrictions, and whose works would reasonably be considered &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in every community.  Such unfettered discretion to prosecutors,
however, is precisely what due process does not allow.  &quot;It will not do to
say that a prosecutor's sense of fairness and the Constitution would prevent a
successful . . . prosecution for some of the activities seemingly embraced
within the sweeping statutory<A NAME = "AB392179"></A> definitions.  The hazard of being prosecuted . . .
nevertheless remains . . . .  Well<A NAME = "AO392206"></A><A NAME = "AS392207"></A>-intentioned prosecutors and judicial<A NAME = "AB392216"></A>
safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a vague law.&quot;  Baggett, 377 U.S.
at 373-74; <I>see also</I> Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 599
(1967)(&quot;[i]t is no answer&quot; to a vague law for the Government &quot;to
say that the statute would not be applied in such a case.&quot;).  And we cannot
overlook the vagaries of politics.  What may be, figuratively speaking, one
administration's pen may be another's sword.</P>
<P>The evidence<A NAME = "AO3933"></A> and arguments presented by the Government illustrate the
possibility of arbitrary enforcement of the Act.  For example, one Government
expert opined that any of the so<A NAME = "AO39356"></A>-called &quot;seven dirty words&quot; used in
the Carlin monologue would be subject to the CDA and therefore should be &quot;tagged,&quot;
as should paintings<A NAME = "AO393108"></A><A NAME = "AS393109"></A> of nudes displayed on a museum's<A NAME = "AB393122"></A> web site.  The Government<A NAME = "AO393131"></A>
has suggested in its brief, however, that the Act should not be so applied.
<I>See</I> Govt. Brief at 37 (suggesting that &quot;seven dirty words&quot; if
used &quot;in the context of serious discussions&quot;<B> </B>would not be
subject to the Act).  Even<A NAME = "AO393223"></A><A NAME = "AS393224"></A> Government<A NAME = "AB393227"></A> counsel was unable to define &quot;indecency&quot;
with specificity.  The Justice<A NAME = "AO393250"></A><A NAME = "AS393251"></A><A NAME = "AS393252"></A><A NAME = "AS393253"></A><A NAME = "AS393254"></A><A NAME = "AS393255"></A><A NAME = "AB393256"></A> Department attorney could not respond to numerous
questions from the court regarding whether, for example, artistic photographs<A NAME = "AB393291"></A> of
a nude man with an erect penis<A NAME = "AB393308"></A>, depictions of Indian<A NAME = "AB393315"></A> statues portraying
different methods of copulation, or the transcript<A NAME = "AB393334"></A> of a scene from a
contemporary play about AIDS could be considered &quot;indecent&quot; under the
Act.  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO3941"></A> also argue that section 223(e)(5)(A) of the CDA, offering a
defense for speakers who take &quot;good faith, reasonable, effective<A NAME = "AO39450"></A> and
appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by
minors to a communication&quot; covered by the Act, is unconstitutionally vague
because it fails to specify what would constitute an effective defense to
prosecution.  The plain<A NAME = "AO394128"></A><A NAME = "AS394129"></A> language<A NAME = "AB394132"></A> of the safe harbor provision indicates an
effort to ensure that the statute limits speech in the least restrictive means
possible by taking into account emerging technologies in allowing for any and
all &quot;reasonable, effective and appropriate&quot; approaches to restricting
minors' access to the proscribed material.  But, the statute itself does not
contain any description of what, other than credit card verification and adult
identification codes -- which we have established remain unavailable to most
content providers -- will protect a speaker from prosecution.  Significantly,
although the FCC<A NAME = "AO394312"></A><A NAME = "AS394313"></A><A NAME = "BB394314"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB41579"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is authorized to specify measures that might satisfy this
defense, the FCC's views will not be definitive but will only &quot;be admitted
as evidence of good faith efforts&quot; that the defendant has met the
requirements of the defense.  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(6).  Thus, individuals
attempting to comply with the statute presently have no clear indication of what
actions will ensure that they will be insulated from criminal sanctions under
the CDA.           </P>
<H1>C.</H1>
<P>The consequences of posting indecent content are severe.(8)  I recognize
that people must make judgments each and every day, many times in the most
intimate of relationships and that an error in judgment can have serious
consequences.  It is also true that where those consequences involve penal
sanctions, a criminal<A NAME = "AO397103"></A><A NAME = "AS397104"></A><A NAME = "AB397105"></A> law or statute has more often than not carefully defined
the proscribed conduct.  It is not so much that the accused needs these precise
definitions, as it has been said he or she rarely reads the law in advance.
What is more important is that the enforcer of statutes must be guided by clear
and precise standards.  In statutes that break into relatively new areas, such
as this one, the need for definition of terms is greater, because even commonly
understood terms may have different connotations or parameters in this new
context.(9)   Words<A NAME = "AO397297"></A> cannot define conduct with mathematical certainty, and
lawyers, like the bright and intelligent ones now before us, will most certainly
continue to devise ways by which to challenge them.  This rationale<A NAME = "AO397360"></A><A NAME = "AS397361"></A>, however,
can neither support a finding of constitutionality nor relieve legislators from
the very difficult task of carefully drafting<A NAME = "AB397401"></A> legislation tailored to its goal
and sensitive to the unique characteristics of, in this instance, cyberspace.</P>
<HR>
<P>DALZELL, District Judge</P>
<H1>A. Introduction</H1>
<P>I begin with first principles:  As a general rule, the Constitution<A NAME = "AO40121"></A> forbids
the Government from silencing speakers because of their particular message.
R.A.V. v. City of Saint Paul, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 2542 (1992).  &quot;Our political
system and cultural life rest upon this ideal.&quot;  Turner Broadcasting Sys.
v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994).  This general rule is subject only to &quot;narrow
and well-understood exceptions&quot;.  Id.  A law that, as here, regulates
speech on the basis of its content, is &quot;presumptively invalid&quot;.
R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2542.</P>
<P>Two of the exceptions to this general rule deal with obscenity (commonly
understood to include so-called hardcore pornography), Miller<A NAME = "BB40241"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF387359"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. California, 413
U.S. 15 (1973), and child<A NAME = "AB40260"></A> pornography, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982).
The Government<A NAME = "AO40286"></A><A NAME = "AS40287"></A> can and does punish with criminal<A NAME = "AB402100"></A> sanction people who engage in
these forms of speech.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1464-65 (criminalizing obscene
material); id. &#167;&#167; 2251-52 (criminalizing child pornography).  Indeed,
the Government<A NAME = "AO402163"></A><A NAME = "AS402164"></A> could punish these forms of speech on the Internet<A NAME = "BB402183"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40329"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> even without
the CDA.  E.g., United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995)

Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105, 112 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at
2545), cert. granted sub nom. Denver<A NAME = "AB403190"></A> Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium,
116 S. Ct. 471 (1996); see also Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756.  As R.A.V. notes, &quot;'the

to disregard these traditional limitations.&quot;  R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2543.</P>
<P>The cases before us, however, are not about obscenity or child<A NAME = "BB40421"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40741"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pornography.
Plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO40427"></A> in these actions claim no right to engage in these forms of speech in
the future, nor does the Government intimate that plaintiffs have engaged in
these forms of speech in the past.</P>
<P>This case is about &quot;indecency&quot;, as that word has come to be
understood since the Supreme<A NAME = "AB40533"></A> Court's decisions in FCC<A NAME = "BB40542"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB41965"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. Pacifica Foundation,
438 U.S. 726 (1976), and Sable<A NAME = "AB40564"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB4705"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).  The
legal difficulties in these actions arise because of the special place that
indecency occupies in the Supreme<A NAME = "AB405117"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44535"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court's First Amendment jurisprudence.  While
adults<A NAME = "AO405130"></A><A NAME = "AS405131"></A> have a First<A NAME = "AB405138"></A> Amendment right to engage in indecent speech, Sable<A NAME = "BB405155"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40637"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492
U.S. at 126; see also Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747-48, the Supreme<A NAME = "AO405184"></A><A NAME = "AS405185"></A><A NAME = "AS405186"></A><A NAME = "AS405187"></A><A NAME = "BB405188"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB419111"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court has also
held that the Government may, consistent with the Constitution, regulate
indecency on radio<A NAME = "BB405221"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44834"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and television<A NAME = "BB405226"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB438158"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and in the &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; context,
as long as the regulation does not operate as a complete ban.  Thus, any
regulation<A NAME = "AO405274"></A> of indecency in these areas must give adults access to indecent
speech, which is their right.</P>
<P>The Government<A NAME = "AO4063"></A> may only regulate indecent speech for a compelling reason,
and in the least restrictive manner.  Sable<A NAME = "BB40637"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB407127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 126.  &quot;It is not
enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be
carefully tailored to achieve those ends.&quot;  Id.  This &quot;most exacting
scrutiny&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2459, requires the Government to &quot;demonstrate
that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation
will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.&quot;  United<A NAME = "AB406182"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB4319"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>

(citing Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 1017).  Thus, although our analysis here must
balance ends and means, the scales tip at the outset in plaintiffs' favor.  This
is so because &quot;[r]<A NAME = "AO406277"></A><A NAME = "AS406278"></A>egulations which permit the Government to discriminate on
the basis of the content of the message cannot be tolerated under the First<A NAME = "BB406322"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB445150"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Amendment.&quot;  Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State
Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105, 116 (1991) (citation omitted).  </P>
<P>The Government<A NAME = "AO4073"></A><A NAME = "AS4074"></A><A NAME = "AS4075"></A> argues that this case is really about pornography<A NAME = "BB40722"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40754"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> on the
Internet<A NAME = "BB40729"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB42064"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Apart from hardcore<A NAME = "AB40736"></A> and child<A NAME = "BB40741"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52292"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pornography, however, the word<A NAME = "AO40750"></A><A NAME = "AS40751"></A>
pornography<A NAME = "BB40754"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB407142"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> does not have a fixed legal meaning.  When I use the word
pornography in my analysis below, I refer to for-profit purveyors of sexually
explicit, &quot;adult&quot; material similar to that at issue in Sable<A NAME = "BB407127"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB407177"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  See 492
U.S. at 118.  Pornography<A NAME = "AO407140"></A><A NAME = "AS407141"></A><A NAME = "BB407142"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB51214"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is normally either obscene or indecent, as Justice<A NAME = "AO407159"></A><A NAME = "AS407160"></A><A NAME = "AS407161"></A><A NAME = "BB407162"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF322198"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Scalia noted in his concurrence in Sable<A NAME = "BB407177"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB422510"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Id. at 132.  I would avoid using such
an imprecise (and overbroad) word, but I feel compelled to do so here, since
Congress<A NAME = "AO407226"></A> undoubtedly had such material in mind when it passed the CDA.  See S.
Rep. No. 230, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 187-91 (1996), reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 200-05 [hereinafter Senate Report].  Moreover, the Government<A NAME = "AO407309"></A>
has defended the Act before this court by arguing that the Act could be
constitutionally applied to such material.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs have, as noted, moved for a preliminary injunction.  The
standards for such relief are well-settled.  Plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO40835"></A><A NAME = "AS40836"></A><A NAME = "AS40837"></A><A NAME = "AS40838"></A> seeking preliminary
injunctive<A NAME = "AB40845"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB422612"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> relief must show (1) &quot;[a] reasonable probability<A NAME = "BB40865"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF27313"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of eventual
success in the litigation&quot; and (2) &quot;irreparabl[e] injur<A NAME = "AB40893"></A>[y] pendente
lite&quot; if relief is not granted.  Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.2d 645,
653 (3d Cir. 1994).  We must also consider, if appropriate, (3) &quot;the
possibility<A NAME = "AO408161"></A><A NAME = "AS408162"></A> of harm to other interested persons from the grant or denial of the
injunction&quot;, and (4) &quot;the public<A NAME = "BB408203"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF273172"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> interest&quot;.  Id.; see also
Opticians Ass'n v. Independent Opticians, 920 F.2d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>
<P>In a First Amendment challenge, a plaintiff<A NAME = "AO40913"></A> who meets the first prong of the
test for a preliminary injunction will almost certainly meet the second, since
irreparable<A NAME = "AO40954"></A><A NAME = "AS40955"></A> injury normally arises out of the deprivation of speech<A NAME = "AB40974"></A> rights, &quot;for
even minimal periods of time&quot;.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74
(1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848
(1989).  Of course, neither the Government<A NAME = "AO409157"></A><A NAME = "AS409158"></A> nor the public generally can claim an
interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional<A NAME = "BB409187"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF273161"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> law.  Thus, I focus my legal
analysis today primarily on whether plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of
success on their claim that the CDA is unconstitutional.  The issues of
irreparable harm to plaintiffs, harm to third parties, and the public interest
all flow from that determination.(1)</P>
<P>Plaintiffs' challenge here is a &quot;facial&quot; one.  A law that
regulates the content of speech is facially invalid if it does not pass the &quot;most
exacting scrutiny&quot; that we have described above, or if it would &quot;penalize
a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected&quot;.
Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 112 S. Ct. 2395, 2401 (1992).  This is
so even if some applications would be &quot;constitutionally unobjectionable&quot;.
 Id.; see also National Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 990 F.2d
1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Randolph, J., concurring), aff'd, 115 S. Ct.
1003 (1995).  Sometimes facial<A NAME = "AB410216"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB60114"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> challenges require an inquiry into a party's &quot;standing&quot;
(i.e., whether a party may properly challenge a law as facially invalid).  See,
e.g., Ferber, 458 U.S. at 767-79.  At other times a facial<A NAME = "AB410290"></A> challenge requires
only an inquiry into the law's<A NAME = "AB410307"></A> reach.  See, e.g., R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2547.(2)
 As I describe it in part C below, I have no question that plaintiffs here have
standing to challenge the validity of the CDA, and, indeed, the Government<A NAME = "AO410389"></A> has
not seriously challenged plaintiffs' standing to do so.  See, e.g., Virginia v.
American Booksellers Assoc., 484 U.S. 383, 392 (1988).  Thus, the focus is
squarely on the merits of plaintiffs' facial challenge.(3)</P>
<P>I divide my legal analysis below into three parts.  In Part B, I <A NAME = "AO41126"></A>examine the
traditional definition of indecency and relate it to the provisions of the CDA
at issue in this action.  From this analysis I conclude that &#167; 223(a) and &#167;
223(d) of the CDA reach the same kind of speech.  My analysis also convinces me
that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed in their claim that the CDA is
unconstitutionally vague.  In Part C, I address the Government's argument that
plaintiffs are not the CDA's target, nor would they likely face prosecution
under the Act.  Here, I conclude that plaintiffs could reasonably fear
prosecution under the Act, even if some of their fears border on the farfetched.
 In Part D, I <A NAME = "AO411255"></A><A NAME = "AS411256"></A>consider the legal implications of the special attributes of
Internet<A NAME = "BB411276"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB411337"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication, as well as the effect that the CDA would have on these
attributes.  In this Part<A NAME = "AO411311"></A><A NAME = "AS411312"></A><A NAME = "AS411313"></A><A NAME = "AB411314"></A> I conclude that the disruptive effect of the CDA on
Internet<A NAME = "BB411337"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB476247"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication, as well as the CDA's broad reach into protected speech,
not only render the Act unconstitutional but also would render unconstitutional
any regulation of protected speech on this new medium.</P>
<H1>B.  Defining Indecency</H1>
<P>Although no court of appeals has ever to my knowledge upheld a vagueness
challenge to the meaning of &quot;indecency&quot;, several<A NAME = "AO41441"></A><A NAME = "AS41442"></A> recent cases have
grappled with the elusive meaning of that word in the context of cable<A NAME = "BB41475"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB415100"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
television and &quot;dial-a-porn&quot;.  Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56

has codified the meaning of &quot;'indecent' programming&quot; on cable<A NAME = "BB415100"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47374"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
television as &quot;programming that describes or depicts sexual or excretory<A NAME = "BB415122"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB41751"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>

8. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees.
So much for operations in salt-marches.
<P>

<P>

9. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising
ground to your right and on your rear, so that the danger<A NAME = "AO39251"></A><A NAME = "AS39252"></A> may be in front,
and safety<A NAME = "AB39266"></A> lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country.

10. These are the four<A NAME = "AO39411"></A><A NAME = "AS39412"></A><A NAME = "AS39413"></A><A NAME = "AS39414"></A> useful branches of military<A NAME = "AB39423"></A> knowledge which enabled

11. All armies<A NAME = "AO3967"></A> prefer high ground to low and sunny places to dark.
<P>

<P>

12. If you are careful of your men, and camp on hard ground, the army<A NAME = "AO39831"></A> will
be free from disease of every kind, and this will spell victory.
<P>

<P>

13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once<A NAME = "AO40053"></A>
act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of
the ground.
<P>

<P>

14. When, in consequence<A NAME = "AO4029"></A> of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish
to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.
<P>

<P>

15. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running
between, deep natural hollows, confined places, tangled thickets, quagmires
and crevasses, should be left with all possible speed and not approached.

<P>

<P>

16. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach
them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.

<P>

<P>

17. If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country,
ponds<A NAME = "AO40832"></A><A NAME = "AS40833"></A> surrounded by aquatic<A NAME = "AB40840"></A> grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods
with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for
these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be
lurking.
<P>

<P>

18. When the enemy<A NAME = "AO4109"></A> is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the
natural strength of his position.
<P>

<P>

19. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the
other side to advance.
<P>

<P>

20. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.
<P>

<P>

21. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is
advancing.  The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick
grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.
<P>

<P>

22. The rising<A NAME = "AO4187"></A> of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.
Startled<A NAME = "AO41833"></A> beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.

men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a
drain on the resources<A NAME = "BB71964"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF5821"><img src="link.GIF"></A> of the State. The daily<A NAME = "AO71975"></A><A NAME = "AS71976"></A> expenditure will amount to a
thousand ounces of silver<A NAME = "AB71995"></A><A HREF = "SPP24.HTM#BB72191"><img src="link.GIF"></A>.  There will be commotion at home and abroad, and
men<A NAME = "AO719116"></A> will drop down exhausted on the highways.
As many as seven<A NAME = "AO719140"></A> hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor.

<P>

<P>

2. Hostile<A NAME = "AO7215"></A> armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory
which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain<A NAME = "AS72152"></A><A NAME = "AS72153"></A> in ignorance of
the enemy's<A NAME = "AB72164"></A> condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred
ounces of silver<A NAME = "BB72191"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF71995"><img src="link.GIF"></A> in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity.

<P>

<P>

3. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign,
no master of victory.
<P>

<P>

4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and
conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is
foreknowledge.
<P>

<P>

5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be
obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.

<P>

<P>

6. Knowledge<A NAME = "AO7295"></A><A NAME = "AS7296"></A><A NAME = "AB7297"></A> of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men.
<P>

<P>

7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local<A NAME = "AS73131"></A><A NAME = "AB73132"></A> spies;
(2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving
spies.
<P>

<P>

8. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none<A NAME = "AO73325"></A> can discover the
secret system.  This is called &quot;divine manipulation of the threads.
&quot;  It is the sovereign's&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;most precious
faculty.
<P>

<P>

9. Having local<A NAME = "AO7357"></A> spies means employing the services of the inhabitants of a
district.
<P>

<P>

10. Having inward spies, making use of officials of the enemy.
<P>

<P>

11. Having converted spies, getting hold of the enemy's spies and using them
for our own purposes.
<P>

<P>

12. Having doomed spies, doing<A NAME = "AO74111"></A> certain things openly for purposes of
deception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy.
<P>

<P>

13. Surviving spies, finally, are those who bring back news from the enemy's camp.
<P>

<P>

14. Hence it is that which none<A NAME = "AO74515"></A> in the whole army are more intimate
relations to be maintained than with spies. None<A NAME = "AO74546"></A> should be more liberally
rewarded.  In no other business should greater<A NAME = "AS74569"></A> secrecy<A NAME = "BB74572"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF22118"><img src="link.GIF"></A> be preserved.
<P>

<P>

15. Spies<A NAME = "AO7475"></A> cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity.

Four<A NAME = "AO4791"></A><A NAME = "AS4792"></A><A NAME = "AS4793"></A> related characteristics of Internet<A NAME = "BB47912"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48019"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication have a transcendent<A NAME = "AB47921"></A>
importance to our shared holding that the CDA is unconstitutional on its face. 
We explain these characteristics in our Findings of fact above, and I only
rehearse them briefly here.  First, the Internet<A NAME = "AO47989"></A><A NAME = "AS47990"></A><A NAME = "BB47991"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB479162"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> presents very low barriers to
entry.  Second, these barriers to entry are identical for both speakers and
listeners.  Third, as a result of these low barriers, astoundingly<A NAME = "AO479146"></A><A NAME = "AS479147"></A> diverse
content is available on the Internet<A NAME = "BB479162"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB479171"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Fourth, the Internet<A NAME = "AO479169"></A><A NAME = "AS479170"></A><A NAME = "BB479171"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48095"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> provides significant
access to all who wish to speak in the medium, and even creates a relative
parity among speakers.</P>
<P>To understand<A NAME = "AO4803"></A><A NAME = "AS4804"></A> how disruptive the CDA is to Internet<A NAME = "BB48019"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB488116"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication, it must
be remembered that the Internet evolved free of content-based considerations. 
Before the CDA, it only mattered how, and how quickly, a particular<A NAME = "AO48073"></A><A NAME = "AS48074"></A> packet of
data travelled from one point on the Internet<A NAME = "BB48095"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB480120"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to another.  In its earliest
incarnation as the ARPANET, the Internet<A NAME = "AO480118"></A><A NAME = "AS480119"></A><A NAME = "BB480120"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB480258"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> was for many years a private means of
access among the military, defense contractors, and defense-related researchers.
 The developers<A NAME = "AO480163"></A><A NAME = "AS480164"></A><A NAME = "AB480165"></A> of  the technology focused on creating a medium designed for the
rapid transmittal of the information through overlapping and redundant
connections, and without direct human involvement.  Out of these considerations
evolved the common transfer protocols, packet switching, and the other
technology in which today's Internet<A NAME = "AO480256"></A><A NAME = "AS480257"></A><A NAME = "BB480258"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48125"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> users flourish.  The content of the data
was, before the CDA, an irrelevant consideration.</P>
<P>It is fair<A NAME = "AO4815"></A><A NAME = "AS4816"></A>, then, to conclude that the benefits of the Internet<A NAME = "BB48125"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48180"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to private
speakers arose out of the serendipitous development of its underlying
technology.  As more<A NAME = "AO48156"></A><A NAME = "AS48157"></A> networks joined the &quot;network of networks&quot; that is
the Internet<A NAME = "BB48180"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB482211"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, private speakers have begun to take advantage of the medium.  This
should not be surprising, since participation<A NAME = "AO481115"></A> in the medium requires only that
networks (and the individual users associated with them) agree to use the common
data transfer protocols and other medium-specific technology.  Participation
does not require, and has never required, approval of a user's or network's
content.</P>
<P>After the CDA, however, the content of a user's speech will determine the
extent of participation in the new medium.  If a speaker's content is even
arguably indecent in some communities, he must assess, inter alia, the risk of
prosecution and the cost of compliance with the CDA.  Because the creation and
posting of a Web<A NAME = "BB482111"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48692"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site allows users anywhere in the country to see that site,
many speakers will no doubt censor their speech so that it is palatable in every
community.  Other speakers will decline to enter the medium at all.  Unlike
other media, there is no technologically feasible way for an Internet<A NAME = "BB482211"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48338"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> speaker to
limit the geographical<A NAME = "AB482222"></A> scope of his speech (even if he wanted to), or to &quot;implement[]
a system for screening the locale of incoming&quot; requests.  Sable 492 U.S. at
125.</P>
<P>The CDA<A NAME = "AO4833"></A> will, without doubt, undermine the substantive, speech<A NAME = "AO48318"></A><A NAME = "AS48319"></A><A NAME = "AS48320"></A><A NAME = "AB48321"></A>-enhancing
benefits that have flowed from the Internet<A NAME = "BB48338"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48454"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. Barriers<A NAME = "AO48341"></A> to entry to those speakers
affected by the Act would skyrocket, especially for non-commercial and
not-for-profit information providers.  Such costs include those attributable to
age or credit<A NAME = "BB483102"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF232207"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card verification (if possible), tagging (if tagging is even a
defense under the Act(20)), and monitoring or review of one's content. </P>
<P>The diversity<A NAME = "BB4843"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF2029"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of the content will necessarily diminish as a result.  The
economic<A NAME = "AO48426"></A><A NAME = "AS48427"></A><A NAME = "AS48428"></A><A NAME = "AB48429"></A> costs associated with compliance with the Act will drive from the
Internet<A NAME = "BB48454"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB484126"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> speakers whose content falls within the zone of possible prosecution. 
Many Web sites, newsgroups, and chat rooms will shut down, since users cannot
discern the age of other participants.  In this respect, the Internet<A NAME = "AO484124"></A><A NAME = "AS484125"></A><A NAME = "BB484126"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48533"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> would
ultimately come to mirror broadcasting and print, with messages tailored to a
mainstream society from speakers who could be sure that their message was likely
decent in every community in the country.</P>
<P>The CDA<A NAME = "AO4853"></A><A NAME = "AS4854"></A> will also skew the relative parity among speakers that currently
exists on the Internet<A NAME = "BB48533"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB485194"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Commercial<A NAME = "AO48536"></A><A NAME = "AS48537"></A><A NAME = "BB48538"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF65266"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> entities who can afford the costs of
verification, or who would charge a user to enter their sites, or whose content
has mass appeal, will remain unaffected by the Act.  Other users, such as
Critical Path or Stop Prisoner Rape, or even the ACLU, whose Web<A NAME = "AO485131"></A><A NAME = "AS485132"></A><A NAME = "AS485133"></A><A NAME = "BB485134"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB485161"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> sites before
the CDA were as equally accessible as the most popular Web<A NAME = "BB485161"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF107186"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> sites, will be
profoundly affected by the Act.  This change<A NAME = "AO485182"></A><A NAME = "AS485183"></A> would result in an Internet<A NAME = "BB485194"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48717"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> that
mirrors broadcasting and print, where economic<A NAME = "AB485209"></A> power has become relatively
coterminous with influence.</P>
<P>Perversely, commercial<A NAME = "AO4863"></A><A NAME = "AS4864"></A><A NAME = "BB4865"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF33849"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pornographers would remain relatively unaffected by
the Act, since we learned that most of them already use credit card or adult
verification anyway.  Commercial<A NAME = "AO48654"></A><A NAME = "AS48655"></A><A NAME = "AS48656"></A><A NAME = "AB48657"></A> pornographers normally provide a few free
pictures to entice a user into proceeding further into the Web<A NAME = "BB48692"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB58251"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site.  To proceed
beyond these teasers, users<A NAME = "AO486107"></A><A NAME = "AS486108"></A><A NAME = "AS486109"></A> must provide a credit<A NAME = "BB486118"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB58240"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card number or adult
verification<A NAME = "AB486129"></A> number.  The CDA<A NAME = "AO486136"></A> will force these businesses to remove the teasers
(or cover the most salacious content with cgi scripts), but the core, commercial<A NAME = "AO486181"></A><A NAME = "AS486182"></A><A NAME = "AB486183"></A>
product of these businesses will remain in place. </P>
<P>The CDA's<A NAME = "AO4873"></A><A NAME = "AS4874"></A><A NAME = "AS4875"></A><A NAME = "AB4876"></A> wholesale disruption on the Internet<A NAME = "BB48717"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB487142"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> will necessarily affect adult
participation in the medium.  As some speakers leave or refuse to enter the
medium, and others bowdlerize their speech or erect the barriers that the Act<A NAME = "AO48778"></A>
envisions, and still others remove bulletin boards, Web sites, and newsgroups,
adults will face a shrinking ability to participate in the medium.  Since much
of the communication<A NAME = "AO487134"></A><A NAME = "AS487135"></A> on the Internet<A NAME = "BB487142"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490139"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is participatory, i.e., is a form of
dialogue, a decrease in the number of speakers, speech fora, and permissible
topics will diminish the worldwide dialogue that is the strength and signal
achievement of the medium.</P>
<P>It is no answer to say that the defenses and exclusions of &#167; 223(e)
mitigate the disruptive forces of the Act.  We have already found as facts that
the defenses either are not available to plaintiffs here or would impose
excessive costs on them.  These defenses<A NAME = "AO48894"></A><A NAME = "AS48895"></A> are also unavailable to participants in
specific forms of Internet<A NAME = "BB488116"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB508177"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication.</P>
<P>I am equally dubious that the exclusions of &#167; 223(e) would provide
significant relief from the Act.  The &quot;common carrier&quot; exclusion of &#167;
223(e)(1), for example, would not insulate America Online from liability for the
content it provides to its subscribers.  It is also a tricky question whether an
America<A NAME = "BB489110"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF200243"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Online chat room devoted to, say, women's reproductive<A NAME = "AB489127"></A> health, is or is
not speech of the service itself, since America<A NAME = "BB489152"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB489211"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Online, at least to some extent,
&quot;creat[es] the content of the communication&quot; simply by making the room
available and assigning it a topic.  Even if America<A NAME = "BB489211"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB61383"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Online has no liability
under this example, the service might legitimately choose not to provide fora
that led to the prosecution of its subscribers.  Similarly, it is unclear
whether many caching servers are devoted &quot;solely&quot; to the task of &quot;intermediate
storage&quot;.  The &quot;vicarious liability&quot; exclusion of &#167;
223(e)(4) would not, for example, insulate either a college professor or her
employer from liability for posting an indecent online reading assignment for
her freshman sociology<A NAME = "AB489370"></A> class.</P>
<P>We must of course give appropriate deference to the legislative<A NAME = "AB49019"></A> judgments of
Congress.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 129; Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472-73 (Blackmun,
J., concurring).  After hearing the parties' testimony and reviewing the
exhibits, declarations, and transcripts, we simply cannot in my view defer to
Congress's<A NAME = "AB490104"></A> judgment that the CDA<A NAME = "AO490113"></A><A NAME = "AS490114"></A> will have only a minimal impact on the
technology of the Internet<A NAME = "BB490139"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB49115"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, or on adult participation in the medium.  As in
Sable<A NAME = "BB490160"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490208"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, &quot;[d]<A NAME = "AO490166"></A><A NAME = "AS490167"></A><A NAME = "AS490168"></A><A NAME = "AS490169"></A>eference to a legislative<A NAME = "BB490177"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF32762"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> finding cannot limit judicial<A NAME = "BB490186"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF32771"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> inquiry
when First<A NAME = "BB490193"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF32736"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment rights are at stake.&quot;  Sable<A NAME = "BB490208"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB600182"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 129
(citation omitted).  Indeed, the Government<A NAME = "AO490229"></A><A NAME = "AS490230"></A> has not revealed Congress's<A NAME = "AB490239"></A> &quot;extensive
record&quot; in addressing this issue, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring), or otherwise convinced me that the record here is somehow factually
deficient to the record before Congress when it passed the Act.  </P>

<P>Nearly eighty years ago, Justice Holmes, in dissent, wrote of the ultimate
constitutional importance of the &quot;free trade in ideas&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[W]hen men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may

<P>Abrams<A NAME = "AB4951"></A> v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). 
</P>
<P>For nearly as long, critics<A NAME = "AO4969"></A><A NAME = "AS49610"></A> have attacked this much-maligned &quot;marketplace&quot;
theory of First<A NAME = "BB49631"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB51115"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment jurisprudence as inconsistent with economic and
practical reality.  Most marketplaces of mass speech, they charge, are dominated
by a few wealthy voices.  Miami<A NAME = "BB49680"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF448480"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241,
248-50 (1974).  These voices dominate -- and to an extent, create -- the
national debate.  Id.  Individual citizens' participation is, for the most part,
passive.  Id. at 251.  Because most people lack the money and time to buy a
broadcast station or create a newspaper, they are limited to the role of
listeners, i.e., as watchers of television<A NAME = "BB496220"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB63055"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or subscribers to newspapers.  Id.</P>
<P>Economic<A NAME = "AB4971"></A> realities limit the number of speakers even further.  Newspapers
competing with each other and with (free) broadcast tend toward extinction, as
fixed costs drive competitors either to consolidate or leave the marketplace.

sources:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The elimination of competing newspapers in most of our large cities, and the
concentration of control of media that results from the only newspaper's being
owned by the same interests which own a television<A NAME = "AB49867"></A> station and a radio<A NAME = "AB49876"></A> station,
are important components of this trend toward concentration of control of
outlets to inform the public.</P>
<P>The result<A NAME = "AO4993"></A><A NAME = "AS4994"></A><A NAME = "AS4995"></A> of these vast changes has been to place in a few hands the power

has not offered significant relief from this problem.  Although the number of
cable channels is exponentially greater than broadcast, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
2452, cable imposes relatively high entry costs, id. at 2451-52 (noting that the
creation of a cable system requires &quot;[t]he construction of [a] physical
infrastructure&quot;).</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the Supreme<A NAME = "AO5025"></A><A NAME = "AS5026"></A><A NAME = "AS5027"></A><A NAME = "AS5028"></A><A NAME = "BB5029"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB50243"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court has resisted governmental<A NAME = "AB50218"></A> efforts to
alleviate these market<A NAME = "AB50229"></A> dysfunctions.  In Tornillo, the Supreme<A NAME = "AO50240"></A><A NAME = "AS50241"></A><A NAME = "AS50242"></A><A NAME = "BB50243"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB6058"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court held that
market<A NAME = "AB50252"></A> failure simply could not justify the regulation of print, 418 U.S. at
258, regardless of the validity of the criticisms of that medium, id. at 251. 
Tornillo<A NAME = "AO502108"></A><A NAME = "AS502109"></A> invalidated a state &quot;right-of-reply&quot; statute, which required
a newspaper critical of a political<A NAME = "AB502142"></A> candidate to give that candidate equal time
to reply to the charges.  Id. at 244.  The Court<A NAME = "AO502177"></A> held that the statute would be
invalid even if it imposed no cost on a newspaper, because of the statute's
intrusion into editorial discretion:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A newspaper<A NAME = "AO5033"></A><A NAME = "AS5034"></A> is more than a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment,
and advertising<A NAME = "BB50332"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF243156"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  The choice<A NAME = "AO50337"></A><A NAME = "AS50338"></A> of material to go into a newspaper, and the
decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and
treatment of public<A NAME = "AB50391"></A> issues and public officials -- whether fair or unfair --
constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 258.</P>
<P>Similarly, in Turner, the Supreme Court rejected the Government's argument
that market<A NAME = "AO50523"></A><A NAME = "AS50524"></A><A NAME = "AS50525"></A><A NAME = "AS50526"></A><A NAME = "AB50527"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB50825"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> dysfunction justified deferential review of speech<A NAME = "AB50540"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB505315"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> regulations for
cable<A NAME = "BB50547"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF38818"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> television.  Even recognizing that the cable market &quot;suffers certain
structural impediments&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2457, the Court<A NAME = "AO50588"></A><A NAME = "AS50589"></A> could not
accept the Government's<A NAME = "AB505100"></A> conclusion that this dysfunction justified
broadcast-type standards of review, since &quot;the mere assertion of
dysfunction or failure in a speech market, without more, is not sufficient to
shield a speech regulation from the First Amendment standards applicable to
nonbroadcast media.&quot;  Id. at 2458.  &quot;[L]aws that single out the press,
or certain elements thereof, for special<A NAME = "AO505221"></A><A NAME = "AS505222"></A> treatment 'pose a particular danger of
abuse by the State,' and so are always subject to at least some degree of
heightened First<A NAME = "AB505271"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB518310"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment scrutiny.&quot;  Id. (citation omitted).(21)  The
Court then eloquently reiterated that government-imposed, content<A NAME = "AO505308"></A><A NAME = "AS505309"></A><A NAME = "AS505310"></A>-based speech<A NAME = "BB505315"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF50540"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
regulations are generally inconsistent with &quot;[o]ur political<A NAME = "AB505334"></A> system and
cultural life&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At the heart<A NAME = "AO5065"></A><A NAME = "AS5066"></A><A NAME = "AB5067"></A> of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person
should decide for him or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression,
consideration, and adherence.  Our political system and cultural life rest upon
this ideal.  Government<A NAME = "AO50683"></A><A NAME = "AS50684"></A><A NAME = "AB50685"></A> action that stifles speech on account of its message, or
that requires the utterance of a particular message favored by the Government,
contravenes this essential right.  Laws of this sort pose the inherent risk that
the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to
suppress unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public<A NAME = "AB506199"></A> debate through
coercion rather than persuasion.  These restrictions &quot;rais[e] the specter
that the Government<A NAME = "AO506232"></A> may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the
marketplace.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. (citation omitted).</P>
<P>Both Tornillo<A NAME = "AO5083"></A><A NAME = "AS5084"></A> and Turner recognize, in essence, that the cure for market<A NAME = "BB50825"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF50527"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
dysfunction (government-imposed, content-based speech restrictions) will almost
always be worse than the disease.  Here, however, I am hard-pressed even to
identify the disease.  It is no exaggeration to conclude that the Internet<A NAME = "BB50898"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB509119"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has
achieved, and continues to achieve, the most participatory marketplace of mass
speech that this country -- and indeed the world -- has yet seen.  The
plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO508153"></A><A NAME = "AS508154"></A> in these actions correctly describe the &quot;democratizing&quot;
effects of Internet<A NAME = "BB508177"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB50978"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication:  individual<A NAME = "AO508182"></A> citizens of limited means can
speak to a worldwide audience on issues of concern to them.  Federalists<A NAME = "AO508217"></A> and
Anti-Federalists may debate the structure of their government nightly, but these
debates<A NAME = "AO508246"></A><A NAME = "AS508247"></A> occur in newsgroups<A NAME = "BB508254"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB57320"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or chat rooms rather than in pamphlets.  Modern-day
Luthers still post their theses, but to electronic<A NAME = "AO508289"></A><A NAME = "AS508290"></A><A NAME = "AS508291"></A><A NAME = "AB508292"></A> bulletin boards rather than
the door of the Wittenberg<A NAME = "AB508311"></A> Schlosskirche.  More mundane (but from a
constitutional perspective, equally important) dialogue<A NAME = "AO508336"></A><A NAME = "AS508337"></A> occurs between aspiring
artists, or French<A NAME = "AB508350"></A> cooks, or dog lovers, or fly fishermen.</P>

21. The natural<A NAME = "AO5097"></A> formation of the country is the soldier's best ally; but a
power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and
of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the
test of a great general.
<P>

<P>

22. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into
practice, will win his battles.  He who knows them not, nor practices them,
will surely be defeated.
<P>

<P>

23. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even
though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you
must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.
<P>

<P>

24. The general<A NAME = "AO5157"></A> who advances without coveting fame and retreats without
fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good
service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.
<P>

<P>

25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the
deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will
stand by you even unto death.
<P>

<P>

26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt;
kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover,
of quelling disorder: then your soldiers<A NAME = "AO51963"></A><A NAME = "AS51964"></A> must be likened to spoilt<A NAME = "AB51975"></A> children;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;they are useless for any practical purpose.

<P>

<P>

27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are
unaware that the enemy<A NAME = "AO52141"></A> is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway
towards victory.
<P>

<P>

28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our
own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards
victory.
<P>

<P>

29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men
are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground
makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards
victory.
<P>

<P>

30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once
he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.
<P>

<P>

31. Hence the saying:  If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory
will not stand in doubt; if you know<A NAME = "AO52945"></A> Heaven and know Earth, you may make
your&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;victory complete.<BR>

19. Rapidity is the essence of war:  take advantage of the enemy's
unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots.

<P>

<P>

20. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force:
The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity
of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you.
<P>

<P>

21. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food.

<P>

<P>

22. Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them.
Concentrate<A NAME = "AO57532"></A> your energy and hoard your strength.  Keep your army continually
on the move, and devise unfathomable plans.
<P>

<P>

23. Throw<A NAME = "AO5775"></A> your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they
will prefer death to flight.  If they will face death, there is nothing they
may not achieve.  Officers<A NAME = "AO57764"></A><A NAME = "AS57765"></A> and men alike will put forth their uttermost<A NAME = "AB57782"></A>
strength.
<P>

<P>

24. Soldiers<A NAME = "AO5795"></A> when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear.  If there is
no place of refuge, they will stand firm.  If they are in hostile country,
they will show a stubborn front.  If there is no help for it, they will
fight hard.
<P>

<P>

25. Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers<A NAME = "AO58119"></A> will be constantly
on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will;
without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can
be trusted.
<P>

<P>

26. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts.
Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.
<P>

<P>

27. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they
have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not
because they are disinclined to longevity.
<P>

<P>

28. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep, those
sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting the tears
run down their cheeks.  But let them once be brought to bay, and they will
display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei.
<P>

<P>

29. The skillful<A NAME = "AO5897"></A> tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the
shuai-jan is a snake<A NAME = "AO58938"></A> that is found in the ChUng mountains.  Strike at its
head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will
be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by
head and tail both.
<P>

<P>

30. Asked<A NAME = "AO5915"></A> if an army can be made to imitate the shuai-jan, I should answer,
Yes.  For the men<A NAME = "AO59143"></A> of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are
crossing<A NAME = "AO59172"></A> a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come
to each other's assistance just as the left hand helps the right.
<P>

<P>

31. Hence it is not<A NAME = "AS59311"></A> enough to put one's trust in the tethering of horses<A NAME = "BB59332"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF7481"><img src="link.GIF"></A>,
and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.
<P>

<P>

32. The principle on which to manage<A NAME = "AO59515"></A> an army is to set up one standard of
courage which all must reach.
<P>

<P>

33. How to make the best of both strong and weak--that is a question
involving the proper use of ground.

(2)Justice<A NAME = "AO5994"></A><A NAME = "AS5995"></A><A NAME = "AS5996"></A><A NAME = "AB5997"></A> Kennedy argues in his opinion in Simon &amp; Schuster<A NAME = "AB59926"></A> v. New York
Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 120 (1991), that &quot;[t]he regulated<A NAME = "AO59962"></A><A NAME = "AS59963"></A> content
has the full protection of the First<A NAME = "BB59980"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB599230"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment and this, I submit, is itself a
full and sufficient reason for holding the statute unconstitutional.  In my view
it is both unnecessary and incorrect to ask whether the state can show that the
statute 'is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn
to achieve that end.'&quot;  In the present case, there is no disagreement that
indecent<A NAME = "AO599206"></A><A NAME = "AS599207"></A> and patently offensive speech have the full protection of the First<A NAME = "BB599230"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB62869"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Amendment.</P>
<P>(3)Not only has speech been divided up and given values -- with some types
of speech given little or no protection (obscenity, fighting words, possibly
commercial speech) -- but also, by court decisions over the years, it has been
decided that the content of speech can indeed be regulated provided that the
regulation will directly and materially advance a compelling government
interest, and that it is narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest in the
least restrictive manner.  However, any content-based restriction must survive
this most exacting scrutiny.  Sable<A NAME = "BB600182"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB60261"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. 115; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S.
397 (1989).</P>
<P>(4)The plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO6016"></A><A NAME = "AS6017"></A> have made facial<A NAME = "BB60114"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF410216"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> challenges to the disputed provisions of
the CDA on grounds of both vagueness and overbreadth.  The approach taken and
language used in evaluating a statute under each of these doctrines commingles,
and frequently is treated as a single approach.  &quot;We have traditionally
viewed vagueness and overbreadth as logically related and similar doctrines.&quot;
 Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8 (1983) (citing Keyishian v. Board of
Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 609, (1967); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)). 
Even in cases where the court attempts to distinguish these two doctrines, it
acknowledges some interplay between them.  <I>See e.g.</I> Village of Hoffman
Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, and n. 6 (1982).</P>
<P>In addition, when discussing overbreadth, one<A NAME = "AO60211"></A> cannot avoid reference to the
same language used to describe and apply the strict scrutiny standard to
constitutionally protected activities.  <I>See e.g.</I> Sable<A NAME = "BB60261"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB61436"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 131;
Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984).  While there are occasional
attempts to argue for clear distinctions among these doctrines, <I>see e.g.</I>
Kolender, 461 U.S. at 369 (White, J., Rehnquist, J. dissenting), such bright
lines simply have not been, and most likely cannot be, drawn in this area.</P>
<P>(5)Comparing<A NAME = "AO6034"></A> a different portion of each of these two provisions suggests
that different terms are not to be read to mean the same thing.  As written,
section<A NAME = "AO60358"></A><A NAME = "AS60359"></A><A NAME = "AS60360"></A> (a) pertains to telecommunications<A NAME = "AB60371"></A> devices, and section (d) to
interactive<A NAME = "AB60386"></A> computer services.  While we have not entirely resolved the tension
between these definitions at this stage, it has been established that these
terms are not synonymous, but are in fact intended to denote different
technologies.  This, together with the rule of statutory construction set forth
in Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion, seems to suggest on the face of the statute
that indecent and patently offensive also are not to be read as synonymous.</P>
<P>(6)18 U.S.C. &#167;1461 states, &quot;The term<A NAME = "AO60417"></A><A NAME = "AS60418"></A> `indecent' as used in this
section includes matter of a character tending to incite arson<A NAME = "AB60450"></A>, murder or
assassination.&quot;</P>
<P>(7)Although the Supreme<A NAME = "BB6058"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF108195"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court may rule on the vagueness question in the
context of cable television regulation in Alliance for Community Media v. FCC,
56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995), currently pending on certiorari before the Court,
we will not defer adjudication of this issue as the constitutionality of the
term in the cable context may not be determinative of its use in cyberspace.</P>
<P>(8)Each<A NAME = "AO6064"></A><A NAME = "AS6065"></A><A NAME = "AB6066"></A> intentional act of posting indecent content for display shall be
considered a separate violation of this subsection and carries with it a fine, a
prison term of up to two years, or both.  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a),(d) and Conf.
Rep. at 189.</P>
<P>(9)As I have noted, the unique nature of the medium cannot be overemphasized
in discussing and determining the vagueness issue.  This is not to suggest<A NAME = "AO60752"></A><A NAME = "AS60753"></A> that
new technology should drive constitutional<A NAME = "BB60766"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF327163"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> law.  To the contrary, I remain of
the belief that our fundamental<A NAME = "AO60791"></A><A NAME = "AS60792"></A><A NAME = "AS60793"></A> constitutional<A NAME = "AB60796"></A> principles can accommodate any
technological<A NAME = "AB607107"></A> achievements, even those which, presently seem to many to be in
the nature of a miracle such as the Internet<A NAME = "BB607148"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB62941"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Dalzell)</H2>
<P>(1)By Order<A NAME = "AO6106"></A> dated March 13, 1996, we asked the parties to submit their views
on questions regarding allocation of the burdens of proof in these cases.  Since
I believe that the outcome of these cases is clear regardless of the allocation
of proof between the parties, none of my conclusions in this opinion requires me
to choose between the arguments that the parties have presented to us.</P>
<P>(2)Although I do not believe the statue is unconstitutionally vague, I agree
with Judge Buckwalter that the Government's<A NAME = "AB61138"></A> promise not to enforce the plain
reach of the law cannot salvage its overbreadth.  Even accepting the
Government's argument that prosecution<A NAME = "AO61181"></A><A NAME = "AS61182"></A><A NAME = "AS61183"></A> of non-obscene pornography<A NAME = "BB61192"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF33957"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> would be a &quot;legitimate
application&quot; of the CDA, City<A NAME = "AB611113"></A> of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987),
it is clear that the Act<A NAME = "AO611147"></A> would &quot;make unlawful a substantial amount of
constitutionally protected conduct&quot;, id.  As in Hill<A NAME = "AO611178"></A><A NAME = "AS611179"></A><A NAME = "AB611180"></A>, the Government's
circular reasoning -- that the law is constitutional because prosecutors would
only apply it to those against whom it could constitutionally be applied -- must
fail.  See id. at 464-67.</P>
<P>(3)Plaintiffs have argued that we may consider their challenge under the
standards governing both &quot;facial&quot; and &quot;as-applied&quot;
challenges.  That is, they suggest that we may pass judgment on the decency of
the plaintiffs' speech, even if we are unable to conclude that the act is
facially unconstitutional.  Surely this procedural<A NAME = "AO612108"></A><A NAME = "AS612109"></A><A NAME = "AS612110"></A> confusion arises out of the
three opinions of the D.C<A NAME = "AB612131"></A>. Circuit in National<A NAME = "AB612138"></A> Treasury Employees Union v.
United States, 990 F.3d 1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003.</P>
<P>I doubt that we could undertake an as-applied inquiry, since we do not know
the exact content of plaintiffs' speech.  Indeed, it is impossible to know the
exact content of some plaintiffs' speech, since plaintiffs themselves cannot
know that content.  America<A NAME = "BB61383"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF7252"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Online, for example, cannot know what its
subscribers will spontaneously say in chat rooms or post to bulletin boards.  In
any event, I need not address this issue, in the light of our disposition today.</P>

<P>(5)In turn, Pacifica's<A NAME = "AO6158"></A><A NAME = "AS6159"></A><A NAME = "AS61510"></A><A NAME = "AB61511"></A> definition of indecency has its roots in the Supreme<A NAME = "AB61530"></A>
Court's obscenity jurisprudence.  Indecency includes some but not all of the
elements of obscenity.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at
113-14 n.4.</P>
<P>(6)The reach of the two provisions is not coterminous, however.  As we
explain in the introduction to this Adjudication, &#167; 223(a) reaches the
making, creation, transmission, and initiation of indecent speech.  Section
223(d) arguably reaches more broadly to the &quot;display&quot; of indecent
speech.  I conclude here only that both sections refer to the identical type of
proscribed speech.</P>
<P>(7)At oral argument, counsel<A NAME = "AO61710"></A> for the Government candidly recognized that &quot;there's
nothing quite like this statute before&quot;, and that the CDA's<A NAME = "AO61747"></A><A NAME = "AS61748"></A><A NAME = "AS61749"></A><A NAME = "AB61750"></A> novelty raised
some &quot;legislative<A NAME = "AB61760"></A> craftsmanship problem[s]&quot;.  Transcript of May 10,
1996, at 81-82.  I believe that my analysis here makes sense in the light of the
legislative<A NAME = "BB617114"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF29753"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> history and the jurisprudence on which Congress relied in enacting
the CDA.  See Senate Report at 188, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.</P>
<P>(8)The counterargument is that &#167; 223(e)(5)(A), when read together with &#167;
223(e)(6), merely confers jurisdiction on the FCC to prescribe the &quot;reasonable,
effective, and appropriate actions&quot; that count as defenses.  Congress<A NAME = "AO61882"></A>
employed a similar scheme for dial-a-porn.  See Dial Information Servs., 938
F.2d at 1539 (citing 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(b)(3)); Information Providers'

<P>(9)The play was &quot;critically acclaimed and long-running in Los<A NAME = "AB61923"></A> Angeles
area theaters&quot;.  Infinity Broadcasting, 3 FCC R. at 932.</P>
<P>(10)Analytically, it makes sense that indecent speech has public<A NAME = "BB62020"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB62096"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> value. 
After all, indecent speech is nevertheless protected speech, see, e.g., Sable,
492 U.S. at 126, and it must therefore have some public value that underlies the
need for protection.  Obscenity, by contrast, has no public<A NAME = "BB62096"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF43994"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> value, id. at 124,
and thus has no protection from proscription.</P>
<P>(11)Internet<A NAME = "AO6214"></A><A NAME = "AS6215"></A><A NAME = "AS6216"></A><A NAME = "BB6217"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF21460"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> technology undercuts the Government's<A NAME = "BB62116"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF39212"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> argument that the &quot;in
context&quot; element of &#167;&#167; 223(a) and 223(d) would insulate
plaintiffs such as Critical Path from liability.  See, e.g., Transcript of May
10, 1996, at 89-91.  A user<A NAME = "AO62191"></A><A NAME = "AS62192"></A><A NAME = "AS62193"></A><A NAME = "AS62194"></A> who clicks on a link in the Critical<A NAME = "AB621111"></A> Path database
(see Findings 33, 77-78) might travel to a highly graphic<A NAME = "AB621140"></A> page in a larger HTML<A NAME = "BB621151"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF97121"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
document.  The social value of that page, in context, might be debatable, but
the use of links effectively excerpts that document by eliminating content
unrelated to the link.</P>
<P>(12)Moreover, because of the technology of Internet<A NAME = "AB62216"></A> relay chat, it would
need to make this determination before it organized the chat room, since it
could not pre-screen the discussion among the participants.  Thus, it would need
to predict, in advance, what the participants were likely to say.  The
participants would need to make a similar determination, unaided (I expect) by
First Amendment lawyers.</P>
<P>(13)Testimony of April 12, 1996, at 235-36.</P>
<P>(14)In this section I do not<A NAME = "AO62414"></A><A NAME = "AS62415"></A><A NAME = "AS62416"></A> imply that the FCC<A NAME = "BB62425"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB624151"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has jurisdiction to process
Internet<A NAME = "AB62436"></A> complaints in the same manner as it does for broadcast.  The extent of
the FCC's<A NAME = "AB62467"></A> jurisdiction under the CDA is a sticky question not relevant here. 
See Senate Report at 190-91, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 204.  Because the
administrative<A NAME = "AO624125"></A><A NAME = "AS624126"></A><A NAME = "AS624127"></A><A NAME = "AB624128"></A> decisions cited above arose out of citizens' complaints to the
FCC<A NAME = "BB624151"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF385129"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, however, they provide a kind of surrogate insight into the kinds of speech
that citizens have charged as indecent in the past.</P>
<P>(15)See Finding of fact 81.  See also Symposium, Emerging Media:  Technology
and the First Amendment, 104 Yale L.J. 1613 (1995).</P>
<P>(16)A <A NAME = "AO6265"></A>narrow holding for this new medium also will not eliminate the chill
to plaintiffs, who could well stifle the extent of their participation in this
new medium while awaiting a future iteration of the CDA.  Such a holding would
also lead Congress to believe that a rewritten CDA (using, for example, a &quot;harmful
to minors&quot; standard, see Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 202) would pass constitutional<A NAME = "BB626153"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF4221"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> muster.  In my view, a holding<A NAME = "AO626166"></A>
consistent with the novel qualities of this medium provides Congress with prompt
and clear answers to the questions that the CDA asks.</P>
<P>(17)The history of dial-a-porn regulation both before and after Sable<A NAME = "BB62726"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB6286"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is
tortuous, and involves the intervention of all three branches of government.  I
will not rehearse that history here, deferring instead to the other courts that
have recounted it. See, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 118-23; Dial Information Serv.,
938 F.2d at 1537-40; Information Providers Coalition, 928 F.2d at 870-73.</P>

proper fit between the First<A NAME = "BB62869"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF25164"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment and governmental<A NAME = "AB62876"></A> regulation of the
telephone.  The case<A NAME = "AO62889"></A><A NAME = "AS62890"></A> also includes no discussion of the technology of the
telephone<A NAME = "BB628111"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF89174"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> generally.  The plaintiff in that case, a purveyor of dial-a-porn,
challenged the statute only with respect to that type of content.  Sable<A NAME = "BB628161"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB62970"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492
U.S. at 117-18.  Thus, the Court's opinion discussed only the &quot;dial-in

This medium<A NAME = "AO4493"></A><A NAME = "AS4494"></A>-specific approach to mass communication examines the underlying
technology of the communication to find the proper fit between First<A NAME = "AB44943"></A> Amendment
values and competing interests.  In print media, for example, the proper fit
generally forbids governmental<A NAME = "AB44976"></A> regulation of content, however minimal.
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  In other media (billboards, for example), the proper<A NAME = "AO449116"></A>
fit may allow for some regulation of both content and of the underlying
technology (such as it is) of the communication.  Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 502.</P>
<P>Radio<A NAME = "BB4501"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB45664"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and television<A NAME = "AB4506"></A> broadcasting present the most expansive approach to
medium-specific regulation of mass communication.  As a result of the scarcity
of band widths on the electromagnetic<A NAME = "AB45057"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB45131"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> spectrum, the Government<A NAME = "AO45064"></A> holds broad
authority both to parcel out the frequencies and to prohibit others from
speaking on the same frequency:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As a general matter, there are more would-be broadcasters than frequencies
available in the electromagnetic<A NAME = "BB45131"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB451137"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> spectrum.  And if two broadcasters were to
attempt to transmit over the same frequency in the same locale, they would
interfere with one another's signals, so that neither could be heard at all.
The scarcity<A NAME = "AO451103"></A><A NAME = "AS451104"></A><A NAME = "AS451105"></A> of broadcast frequencies thus required the establishment of some
regulatory<A NAME = "AB451126"></A> mechanism to divide the electromagnetic<A NAME = "BB451137"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF45057"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> spectrum and assign specific
frequencies to particular broadcasters.  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456 (citing FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S.

assigns a license:</P>

may use the broadcast medium has been thought to require some adjustment in
traditional First<A NAME = "AB45458"></A> Amendment analysis to permit the Government to place limited

<P>In this case, the Government<A NAME = "AO4579"></A><A NAME = "AS45710"></A><A NAME = "AS45711"></A> relies on the Pacifica<A NAME = "AB45720"></A> decision in arguing that
the CDA is a constitutional<A NAME = "BB45739"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF44582"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> exercise of governmental power.  Since the CDA<A NAME = "AO45754"></A><A NAME = "AS45755"></A>
regulates indecent speech, and since Pacifica authorizes governmental<A NAME = "AB45772"></A> regulation
of indecent speech (so the Government's argument goes), it must follow that the
CDA is a valid exercise of governmental power.  That argument<A NAME = "AO457123"></A><A NAME = "AS457124"></A><A NAME = "AS457125"></A>, however, ignores
Pacifica's<A NAME = "AB457132"></A> roots as a decision addressing the proper fit between broadcasting
and the First<A NAME = "BB457159"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB46483"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment.  The argument also assumes that what is good<A NAME = "AO457178"></A><A NAME = "AS457179"></A> for
broadcasting is good for the Internet<A NAME = "BB457194"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47677"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.</P>
<H1> 2.  The Scope of the Pacifica Decision</H1>
<P>In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), the Supreme<A NAME = "AO46023"></A><A NAME = "AS46024"></A><A NAME = "BB46025"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB460319"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court first
decided whether the Government had the power to regulate indecent speech.  Id.
at 729.  In Pacifica, a radio<A NAME = "AO46067"></A><A NAME = "AS46068"></A><A NAME = "AS46069"></A><A NAME = "BB46070"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF202130"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> listener complained about the broadcast of George<A NAME = "AB46085"></A>
Carlin's &quot;Filthy Words&quot; monologue at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon.
 Id. at 729-30.  The Carlin monologue was replete with &quot;the words you couldn't<A NAME = "AO460143"></A><A NAME = "AS460144"></A><A NAME = "AB460145"></A>
say on the public . . . airwaves . . . , ever&quot;, and the listener
had tuned in while driving with his young son in New York.  Id.  The FCC<A NAME = "AO460202"></A><A NAME = "AS460203"></A><A NAME = "BB460204"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB460269"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> issued
a declaratory order, holding that it could have subjected the Pacifica
Foundation (owner of the radio station) to an administrative sanction.  Id. at
730.  In its order<A NAME = "AO460263"></A><A NAME = "AS460264"></A> the FCC<A NAME = "BB460269"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB461114"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> also described the standards that it would use in the
future to regulate indecency in the broadcast medium.  Id. at 731.  The Supreme<A NAME = "AO460316"></A><A NAME = "AS460317"></A><A NAME = "AS460318"></A><A NAME = "BB460319"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB46637"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Court upheld the FCC's<A NAME = "AB460328"></A> decision and confirmed the power of that agency to
regulate indecent speech.  Id. at 750-51.</P>
<P>The rationale<A NAME = "AO4613"></A> of Pacifica rested on three overlapping considerations.
First, using as its example the Carlin monologue before it, the Court<A NAME = "AO46143"></A><A NAME = "AS46144"></A><A NAME = "AS46145"></A> weighed
the value of indecent speech and concluded that such speech<A NAME = "AB46168"></A> &quot;lie[s] at the
periphery of First<A NAME = "BB46185"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF380579"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment concerns.&quot;  Id. at 743.  Although the Court<A NAME = "AO461104"></A><A NAME = "AS461105"></A>
recognized that the FCC<A NAME = "BB461114"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB62425"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had threatened to punish Pacifica based on the content
of the Carlin monologue, id. at 742, it found that the punishment would have
been permissible because four-letter words &quot;offend for the same reasons
that obscenity offends.&quot;  Id. at 746 (footnote omitted).  The Court<A NAME = "AO461208"></A><A NAME = "AS461209"></A> then
described the place of four-letter words &quot;in the hierarchy of first<A NAME = "AB461237"></A>
amendment values&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such<A NAME = "AO4621"></A><A NAME = "AS4622"></A> utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of
such slight social<A NAME = "AB46235"></A> value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived
from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 746 (citing Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942)).
</P>
<P>Second, the Court<A NAME = "AO4645"></A> recognized that &quot;broadcasting . . . has received the
most limited First Amendment protection.&quot;  Id. at 748.  The Government<A NAME = "AO46444"></A> may
regulate broadcast consistent with the Constitution, even though the same<A NAME = "AO46467"></A><A NAME = "AS46468"></A>
regulation would run afoul of the First<A NAME = "BB46483"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB476338"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment in the print medium.  Id.
(comparing Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969) with Miami
Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974)).  This is so because
broadcasting<A NAME = "AO464157"></A> has a &quot;uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all
Americans&quot; and &quot;is uniquely accessible to children, even those too
young to read.&quot;  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.</P>
<P>Third, the Court<A NAME = "AO4655"></A><A NAME = "AS4656"></A> found the FCC's<A NAME = "AB46513"></A> sanction -- an administrative sanction --
to be an appropriate means of regulating indecent speech.  At the outset of the
opinion, the Court<A NAME = "AO46560"></A><A NAME = "AS46561"></A> disclaimed that its holding was a &quot;consider[ation of]
any question relating to the possible application of &#167; 1464 as a criminal<A NAME = "BB465108"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF34915"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
statute.&quot;  Id. at 739 n.13.  Later in the opinion, the Court<A NAME = "AO465134"></A> &quot;emphasize[d]
the narrowness of [its] holding&quot;, and explicitly recognized that it had not
held that the Carlin monologue would justify a criminal prosecution.  Id. at
750.  Instead, the Court allowed the FCC to regulate indecent speech with
administrative penalties under a &quot;nuisance&quot; rationale -- &quot;like a
pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.&quot;  Id. at 750 (citation omitted).</P>
<P>Time has not been kind to the Pacifica decision.  Later<A NAME = "AO46619"></A><A NAME = "AS46620"></A> cases have eroded
its reach, and the Supreme<A NAME = "BB46637"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB46732"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court has repeatedly instructed against overreading
the rationale of its holding.</P>
<P>First, in Bolger v. Young Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), the
Supreme<A NAME = "AO46730"></A><A NAME = "AS46731"></A><A NAME = "BB46732"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47028"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court refused to extend Pacifica to a law unrelated to broadcasting.  In
that case, a federal<A NAME = "AO46765"></A><A NAME = "AS46766"></A><A NAME = "AS46767"></A><A NAME = "AB46768"></A> law prohibited the unsolicited mailing of contraceptive<A NAME = "AB46783"></A>
advertisements.  Id. at 61.  The Government<A NAME = "AO46796"></A> defended the law by claiming an
interest in protecting children from the advertisements.  The Court rejected
this argument as overbroad:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In [Pacifica], this Court<A NAME = "AO4689"></A><A NAME = "AS46810"></A> did recognize that the Government's<A NAME = "AB46821"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52125"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> interest in
protecting the young justified special treatment of an afternoon broadcast heard
by adults as well as children.  At the same time, the majority &quot;emphasize[d]
the narrowness of our holding&quot;, explaining that broadcasting is &quot;uniquely
pervasive&quot; and that it is &quot;uniquely accessible to children, even those
too young to read.&quot;  The receipt of mail is far less intrusive and
uncontrollable.  Our decisions<A NAME = "AO468158"></A><A NAME = "AS468159"></A> have recognized that the special<A NAME = "AB468170"></A> interest of the
Federal Government in regulation of the broadcast media does not readily
translate into a justification for regulation of other means of communication.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 74 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original) see also
id. at 72 (&quot;[T]he 'short, though regular, journey from mail box to trash
can . . . is an acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is
concerned.'&quot;) (citation omitted) (alterations in original).</P>
<P>Second, in Sable<A NAME = "BB4705"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF40564"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989), the Supreme<A NAME = "AO47026"></A><A NAME = "AS47027"></A><A NAME = "BB47028"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47335"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Court again limited Pacifica.  In that case, the Court considered the validity
of a ban on indecent &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; communications.  Id. at 117-18.(17)
 As in Bolger, the Government<A NAME = "AO47095"></A> argued that Pacifica justified a complete ban of
that form of speech.  The Supreme Court disagreed, holding instead that
Pacifica's &quot;emphatically narrow&quot; holding arose out of the &quot;unique
attributes of broadcasting&quot;.  Id. at 127.  The Court<A NAME = "AO470172"></A> held that the ban was
unconstitutional.  Id. at 131.</P>
<P>Sable<A NAME = "AO4711"></A><A NAME = "AS4712"></A><A NAME = "BB4713"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47270"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> narrowed Pacifica in two ways.  First, the Court<A NAME = "AO47120"></A><A NAME = "AS47121"></A> implicitly rejected
Pacifica's<A NAME = "AB47128"></A> nuisance rationale for dial-a-porn, holding instead that the
Government<A NAME = "AO47151"></A><A NAME = "AS47152"></A> could only regulate the medium &quot;by narrowly drawn regulations
designed to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First<A NAME = "BB47192"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF305106"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Amendment freedoms&quot;.  Id. at 126 (citation omitted).  Under this strict
scrutiny, &quot;[i]t is not enough to show that the Government's ends are
compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends.&quot; 
Id.; see also Fabulous Assoc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm., 896 F.2d 780,
784-85 (3d Cir. 1990). </P>
<P>Second, the Court<A NAME = "AO4725"></A> concluded that the law, like a law it had struck down in
1957, &quot;denied adults their free speech rights by allowing them to read only
what was acceptable for children&quot;.  Sable<A NAME = "BB47270"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490160"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 126 (citing Butler
v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957)).  Thus, any regulation of dial-a-porn would
have to give adults the opportunity to partake of that medium.  Id.  This
conclusion echoes Bolger.  See Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74 (&quot;The level of
discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be
suitable for a sandbox.&quot;).(18)</P>
<P>Finally, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994),
the Supreme<A NAME = "AO47332"></A><A NAME = "AS47333"></A><A NAME = "AS47334"></A><A NAME = "BB47335"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB474301"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court implicitly limited Pacifica once again when it declined to
adopt the broadcast rationale for the medium of cable<A NAME = "BB47374"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47432"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> television.  The Court<A NAME = "AO47381"></A><A NAME = "AS47382"></A><A NAME = "AS47383"></A>
concluded that the rules for broadcast were &quot;inapt<A NAME = "AB473101"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB62979"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>&quot; for cable because
of the &quot;fundamental technological<A NAME = "AB473118"></A> differences between broadcast and cable
transmission&quot;.  Id. at 2457.</P>
<P>The legal significance to this case of Turner's<A NAME = "AB47415"></A> refusal to apply the
broadcast rules to cable<A NAME = "BB47432"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB474119"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> television cannot be overstated.  Turner's holding
confirms beyond doubt that the holding in Pacifica arose out of the scarcity
rationale unique to the underlying technology of broadcasting, and not out of
the end product that the viewer watches.  That is, cable<A NAME = "AO474115"></A><A NAME = "AS474116"></A><A NAME = "AS474117"></A><A NAME = "AS474118"></A><A NAME = "BB474119"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB474153"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> television has no less
of a &quot;uniquely pervasive presence&quot; than broadcast television<A NAME = "BB474146"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB474205"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, nor is
cable<A NAME = "BB474153"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB50125"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> television more &quot;uniquely accessible to children&quot; than
broadcast.  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.  From the viewer's<A NAME = "AO474192"></A><A NAME = "AS474193"></A> perspective,
cable and broadcast television<A NAME = "BB474205"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB474270"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are identical:  moving pictures with sound from a
box in the home.  Whether one receives a signal through an antenna or through a
dedicated wire, the end<A NAME = "AO474260"></A><A NAME = "AS474261"></A> result is just television<A NAME = "BB474270"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB496220"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> in either case.  In declining
to extend broadcast's scarcity rationale for cable, the Supreme<A NAME = "AO474299"></A><A NAME = "AS474300"></A><A NAME = "BB474301"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB476283"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court also
implicitly limited Pacifica, the holding of which flows directly from that
rationale.(19)</P>
<P>Turner<A NAME = "AO4751"></A> thus confirms that the analysis of a particular medium of mass
communication must focus on the underlying technology that brings the
information to the user.  In broadcast, courts focus on the limited number of
band widths and the risk of interference with those frequencies.  See, e.g.,
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57.  In cable<A NAME = "AO475114"></A><A NAME = "AS475115"></A>, courts focus on the number of
channels, the different kinds of cable<A NAME = "AB475140"></A> operators, and the cost to the consumer. 
Id. at 2452. </P>
<P>I draw two conclusions from the foregoing analysis.  First, from the Supreme
Court's many decisions regulating different media differently, I conclude that
we cannot simply assume that the Government has the power to regulate protected
speech over the Internet<A NAME = "BB47677"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB476372"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, devoting<A NAME = "AO47680"></A><A NAME = "AS47681"></A> our attention solely to the issue of whether
the CDA is a constitutional<A NAME = "AB476108"></A> exercise of that power.  Rather, we must also decide
the validity of the underlying assumption as well, to wit, whether the
Government has the power to regulate protected speech at all.  That decision
must take into account the underlying technology, and the actual and potential
reach, of that medium.  Second, I conclude that Pacifica's holding is not
persuasive authority here, since plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO476233"></A><A NAME = "AS476234"></A> and the Government agree that
Internet<A NAME = "BB476247"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47855"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication is an abundant and growing resource.  Nor is Sable<A NAME = "AB476268"></A>
persuasive authority, since the Supreme<A NAME = "AO476279"></A><A NAME = "AS476280"></A><A NAME = "AS476281"></A><A NAME = "AS476282"></A><A NAME = "BB476283"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB5016"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court's holding in that case addressed
only one particular type of communication (dial-a-porn), and reached no
conclusions about the proper fit between the First<A NAME = "BB476338"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB51089"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment and telephone<A NAME = "AB476345"></A>
communications generally.  Again, plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO476354"></A><A NAME = "AS476355"></A> and the Government here agree that
the Internet<A NAME = "BB476372"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB47890"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> provides content as broad as the imagination.</P>
<P><B>3.  The Effect<A NAME = "AB4776"></A> of the CDA and the Novel<A NAME = "AB47719"></A> Characteristics of Internet
Communication</B></P>
<P>Over the course of five days of hearings and many hundreds of pages of
declarations, deposition transcripts, and exhibits, we have learned about the
special attributes of Internet<A NAME = "BB47855"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB47912"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication.  Our Findings of fact -- many of
them undisputed -- express our understanding of the Internet<A NAME = "BB47890"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB478124"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  These Findings<A NAME = "AO47895"></A>
lead to the conclusion that Congress<A NAME = "AO478108"></A><A NAME = "AS478109"></A> may not regulate indecency on the Internet<A NAME = "BB478124"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB47991"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
at all.  </P>

Here, however, plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO6295"></A><A NAME = "AS6296"></A> represent forty-seven different speakers
(including educational associations and consortia) who provide content to the
Internet<A NAME = "BB62941"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF24201"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> on a broad range of topics.  The limited<A NAME = "AO62958"></A><A NAME = "AS62959"></A><A NAME = "AS62960"></A><A NAME = "AS62961"></A> reach of the Sable<A NAME = "BB62970"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF313162"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> holding

actions.</P>
<P>(19)I note here, too, that we have found as a fact that operation<A NAME = "AO63028"></A><A NAME = "AS63029"></A><A NAME = "AS63030"></A> of a
computer is not as simple as turning on a television<A NAME = "BB63055"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB63070"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and that the assaultive
nature of television<A NAME = "BB63070"></A><A HREF = "SPAP4.HTM#AF202127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, see Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49, is quite absent in
Internet<A NAME = "AB63095"></A> use.  See Findings 87-89.  The use<A NAME = "AO630110"></A><A NAME = "AS630111"></A><A NAME = "AS630112"></A> of warnings and headings, for
example, will normally shield users from immediate entry into a sexually
explicit Web<A NAME = "BB630149"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF10372"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> site or newsgroup<A NAME = "AB630156"></A> message.  See Finding 88.  The Government may
well be right that sexually explicit content is just a few clicks of a mouse<A NAME = "BB630201"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF21775"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
away from the user, but there is an immense legal significance to those few
clicks.</P>
<P>(20)In a May 3, 1996 letter to a three-judge court in the Southern District
of New York, John C. Keeney, Acting Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal
Division of the Department of Justice, has advised that tagging would be &quot;substantial
evidence&quot; in support of a &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) defense:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under present technology, non<A NAME = "AO6327"></A><A NAME = "AS6328"></A><A NAME = "AS6329"></A><A NAME = "AB63210"></A>-commercial content providers can take steps to
list their site[s] in URL<A NAME = "AB63238"></A> registries of covered sites, register their site[s]
with the marketplace of browsers and blocking software (including listing an IP
address), place their material in a directory blocked by screening software, or
take other similarly effective affirmative steps to make their site[s] known to
the world to allow the site[s] to be blocked.  Under present technology, it is
the position of the Department of Justice that, absent extraordinary
circumstances, such efforts would constitute substantial evidence that a content<A NAME = "AO632204"></A>
provider had taken good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions
under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to the covered
material.  The same would be true for tagging by content providers coupled with
evidence that the tag would be screened by the marketplace of browsers and
blocking software.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Letter of May 3, 1996 from Acting Assistant Attorney General John C. Keeney
to Hons. Denise L. Cote, Leonard B. Sand, and Jose A. Cabranes, attached to
Defendants'<A NAME = "AB63355"></A> Motion for Leave to File<A NAME = "AB63366"></A> Supplemental Statement.  On May 8, 1996<A NAME = "AO63379"></A><A NAME = "AS63380"></A>,
the Government moved to file the Kenney<A NAME = "AB63396"></A> letter in this action, and we granted
the motion as unopposed the next day.</P>
<P>The letter certainly raises more questions than it answers.  I wonder, for
example, whether it is consistent with the plain language of the Act simply for
content providers to &quot;make their site[s] known to the world&quot; and
thereby &quot;to allow [them] to be blocked&quot;, even though this form of
notice alone would not reduce the availability of indecent content.  Cf. Senate
Report at 178, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201 (noting that &#167; 223(d) &quot;applies
to content providers who post indecent material for online display without
taking precautions that shield that material from minors&quot;).  It is also an
unanswered question<A NAME = "AO634215"></A><A NAME = "AS634216"></A> whether the Keeney letter would eliminate any of the CDA's<A NAME = "AB634237"></A>
chill, since the Government acknowledged that the letter<A NAME = "AO634254"></A><A NAME = "AS634255"></A> would not prohibit a
United<A NAME = "AB634266"></A> States Attorney from taking a contrary position in a particular
prosecution.  See Defendants' May 9, 1996 Response to the May 8, 1996 Order of
Court.  The letter<A NAME = "AO634321"></A><A NAME = "AS634322"></A><A NAME = "AS634323"></A><A NAME = "AS634324"></A> also fails to mention how users who participate in chat
rooms, newsgroups<A NAME = "BB634349"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF8765"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, listservs<A NAME = "BB634352"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF86363"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and e-<A NAME = "BB634358"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF8591"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>mail might take advantage of &#167;
223(e)(5)(A).  Finally, it is undisputed that neither<A NAME = "AO634393"></A><A NAME = "AS634394"></A> PICS nor the hypothetical
&quot;-L18&quot; tag are available to speakers using the World<A NAME = "BB634425"></A><A HREF = "SPAP5.HTM#AF989"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Wide Web today,
whom the Government<A NAME = "AO634439"></A> has explicitly reserved its right to prosecute should the
CDA ultimately be found constitutional.  See Stipulation and Order of February
26, 1996, quoted supra.</P>
<P>(21)Turner<A NAME = "AO6354"></A> examined certain &quot;must-carry&quot; provisions under an
intermediate scrutiny, since those laws imposed incidental burdens on speech but
did not directly regulate content.  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2469.  The Court<A NAME = "AO63569"></A>
remanded the case to the district court without passing on the constitutionality
of the must-carry provisions.  Id. at 2472.</P>
<P>(22)Arguably, a valid<A NAME = "AO6368"></A><A NAME = "AS6369"></A> CDA would create an incentive for overseas
pornographers<A NAME = "AB63626"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB63654"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> not to label their speech. If we upheld the CDA, foreign<A NAME = "AO63649"></A><A NAME = "AS63650"></A><A NAME = "AS63651"></A>
pornographers<A NAME = "BB63654"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF63626"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> could reap the benefit of unfettered access to American<A NAME = "AB63673"></A> audiences.
 A valid<A NAME = "AO63682"></A><A NAME = "AS63683"></A><A NAME = "AS63684"></A> CDA might also encourage American<A NAME = "AB63695"></A> pornographers to relocate in foreign
countries or at least use anonymous remailers<A NAME = "AB636120"></A> from foreign servers.</P>

I am far less confident than the government that its quotations from earlier
cases in the Supreme<A NAME = "BB32933"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB38029"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court signify that it has shown a compelling interest in
regulating the vast range of online material covered or potentially covered by
the CDA.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge that there is certainly a compelling<A NAME = "AO329100"></A><A NAME = "AS329101"></A><A NAME = "AS329102"></A>
government<A NAME = "AB329105"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB34793"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> interest to shield a substantial number of minors from some of the
online material that motivated Congress to enact the CDA, and do not rest my
decision on the inadequacy of the government's<A NAME = "AB329172"></A> showing in this regard.</P>
<H1>E.</H1>
<H1>The Reach of the Statute</H1>
<P>Whatever<A NAME = "AO3341"></A> the strength of the interest the government has demonstrated in
preventing minors from accessing &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently
offensive&quot; material online, if the means it has chosen sweeps more broadly
than necessary and thereby chills the expression of adults, it has overstepped
onto rights protected by the First Amendment.  Sable<A NAME = "BB334104"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB336328"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 131.  </P>
<P>The plaintiffs<A NAME = "AO3353"></A><A NAME = "AS3354"></A> argue that the CDA violates the First<A NAME = "BB33519"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB34141"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment because it
effectively bans a substantial category of protected speech from most parts of
the Internet<A NAME = "BB33554"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB342128"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  The  government<A NAME = "AO33559"></A> responds that the Act does not on its face or in
effect ban indecent material that is constitutionally protected for adults.
Thus one<A NAME = "AO335107"></A> of the factual issues before us was the likely effect of the CDA on the
free availability of constitutionally protected material.  A wealth of
persuasive evidence, referred to in detail in the Findings of Fact, proved that
it is either technologically impossible or economically prohibitive for many of
the plaintiffs to comply with the CDA without seriously impeding their posting
of online material which adults have a constitutional<A NAME = "AB335244"></A> right to access.</P>
<P>With the possible exception of an e-mail to a known recipient, most content
providers cannot determine the identity and age of every user accessing their
material.  Considering separately content providers that fall roughly into two
categories, we have found that no technology exists which allows those posting
on the category of newsgroups<A NAME = "BB336105"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB508254"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, mail<A NAME = "BB336108"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF8654"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> exploders or chat rooms to screen for age.
Speakers<A NAME = "AO336128"></A> using those forms of communication cannot control who receives the
communication, and in most instances are not aware of the identity of the
recipients.  If it is not<A NAME = "AO336185"></A> feasible for speakers who communicate via these forms

of communication to conduct age screening, they would have to reduce the level
of communication to that which is appropriate for children in order to be
protected under the statute.   This would effect<A NAME = "AO336269"></A><A NAME = "AS336270"></A> a complete ban even for adults
of some expression, albeit &quot;indecent,&quot; to which they are
constitutionally entitled, and thus would be unconstitutional under the holding
in Sable<A NAME = "BB336328"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB385511"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 131.</P>
<P>Even as to content<A NAME = "AO3377"></A><A NAME = "AS3378"></A> providers in the other broad category, such as the World
Wide Web, where efforts at age verification are technically feasible through the
use of Common<A NAME = "AB33759"></A> Gateway Interface (cgi) scripts (which enable creation of a
document that can process information provided by a Web visitor), the Findings
of Fact show that as a practical<A NAME = "AO337120"></A><A NAME = "AS337121"></A><A NAME = "AS337122"></A> matter, non<A NAME = "BB337127"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF24119"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>-commercial organizations and even
many commercial<A NAME = "AB337140"></A> organizations using the Web would find it prohibitively
expensive and burdensome to engage in the methods of age verification proposed
by the government, and that even if they could attempt to age verify, there is
little assurance that they could successfully filter out minors.</P>
<P>The government<A NAME = "AO3383"></A><A NAME = "AS3384"></A><A NAME = "AS3385"></A><A NAME = "AB3386"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB3896"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> attempts to circumvent this problem by seeking to limit the
scope of the statute to those content providers who are commercial<A NAME = "AB33849"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB338132"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
pornographers, and urges that we do likewise in our obligation to save a
congressional enactment from facial unconstitutionality wherever possible.  But
in light of its plain language and its legislative history, the CDA cannot
reasonably be read as limited to commercial<A NAME = "BB338132"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB4865"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pornographers.  A court may not
impose a narrowing construction on a statute unless it is &quot;readily
susceptible&quot; to such a construction.  Virginia v. American Booksellers

Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988).  The court may not &quot;rewrite a . . . law to

conform it to constitutional requirements.&quot;  Id.  Although we may prefer an

interpretation of a statute that will preserve the constitutionality of the
statutory scheme, United State v. Clark, 445 U.S. 23, 27 (1980), we do not have
license to rewrite a statute to &quot;create distinctions where none were
intended.&quot;  American<A NAME = "AB338329"></A> Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 72 n.6 (1982);
see also Consumer Party v. Davis, 778 F.2d 140, 147 (3d Cir. 1985).  The Court<A NAME = "AO338387"></A><A NAME = "AS338388"></A>
has often stated that &quot;absent a clearly expressed legislative<A NAME = "AB338408"></A> intention to
the contrary, [statutory<A NAME = "AB338420"></A>] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.&quot;
 Escondido Mut. Water Co. v. La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765, 772
(1984)(quoting North Dakota v. United States, 460 U.S. 300, 312 (1983)).</P>
<P>It is clear from the face of the CDA and from its legislative history that
Congress<A NAME = "AO33931"></A><A NAME = "AS33932"></A> did not intend to limit its application to commercial purveyors of
pornography<A NAME = "AB33957"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40722"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Congress unquestionably knew how to limit the statute to such
entities if that was its intent, and in fact it did so in provisions relating to
dial-a-porn services.  See 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(b)(2)(A) (criminalizing making
any indecent telephone communication &quot;for commercial purposes&quot;).  It
placed no similar limitation in the CDA.  Moreover, the Conference<A NAME = "AO339182"></A><A NAME = "AS339183"></A><A NAME = "AB339184"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB385401"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Report makes
clear that Congress<A NAME = "AO339195"></A> did not intend to limit the application of the statute to
content providers such as those which make available the commercial material
contained in the government's<A NAME = "AB339248"></A> exhibits, and confirms that Congress intended &quot;content
regulation of both commercial and non-commercial providers.&quot;  Conf. Rep. at
191.  See also, 141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (Statement of
Senator Exon).     </P>
<P>The scope<A NAME = "AO3403"></A> of the CDA is not confined to material that has a prurient
interest or appeal, one of the hallmarks of obscenity, because Congress sought
to reach farther.  Nor did Congress<A NAME = "AO34064"></A> include language that would define &quot;patently
offensive&quot; or &quot;indecent&quot; to exclude material of serious value.
It follows that to narrow the statute in the manner the government<A NAME = "AB340124"></A> urges would
be an impermissible exercise of our limited judicial<A NAME = "AB340145"></A> function, which is to
review the statute as written for its compliance with constitutional<A NAME = "AB340174"></A> mandates.
 </P>
<P>I conclude<A NAME = "AO3413"></A><A NAME = "AS3414"></A><A NAME = "AS3415"></A> inexorably from the foregoing that the CDA reaches speech<A NAME = "AB34124"></A> subject
to the full protection of the First<A NAME = "BB34141"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36517"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment, at least for adults.(1)  In
questions of the witnesses and in colloquy with the government attorneys, it
became evident that even if &quot;indecent&quot; is read as parallel to &quot;patently
offensive,&quot; the terms<A NAME = "AO341117"></A><A NAME = "AS341118"></A><A NAME = "AS341119"></A> would cover a broad range of material from
contemporary films, plays and books showing or describing sexual<A NAME = "AB341154"></A> activities
(e.g., Leaving Las Vegas) to controversial contemporary art and photographs
showing sexual<A NAME = "AB341184"></A> organs in positions that the government conceded would be
patently offensive in some communities (e.g., a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph
depicting a man with an erect penis). </P>
<P>We have also found that there is no effective way for many Internet<A NAME = "BB34225"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35337"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> content
providers to limit the effective reach of the CDA to adults because there is no
realistic way for many providers to ascertain the age of those accessing their
materials.  As a consequence, we have found that &quot;[m]any speakers who
display<A NAME = "AO342112"></A><A NAME = "AS342113"></A><A NAME = "AS342114"></A><A NAME = "BB342115"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF26712"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> arguably indecent content on the Internet<A NAME = "BB342128"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35635"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> must choose between silence
and the risk of prosecution.&quot;  Such a choice, forced by sections 223(a) and
(d) of the CDA, strikes at the heart of speech of adults as well as minors.</P>
<H1>F.</H1>
<H1>Whether CDA<A NAME = "AS3454"></A> is Narrowly<A NAME = "AB3459"></A> Tailored</H1>
<P>In the face of such a patent intrusion on a substantial category of
protected speech for adults, there is some irony<A NAME = "AO34741"></A><A NAME = "AS34742"></A> in considering whether the
statute is narrowly tailored or, as sometimes put, whether Congress has used the
least restrictive means to achieve a compelling government<A NAME = "BB34793"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF329105"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> interest.  See Sable,
492 U.S. at 126.  It would appear that the extent of the abridgement of the
protected speech of adults that it has been shown the CDA would effect is too
intrusive to be outweighed by the government's asserted interest, whatever its
strength, in protecting minors from access to indecent material.  Nonetheless,
the formulation of the inquiry requires that we consider the government's
assertion that the statute is narrowly drafted, and I proceed to do so.  </P>
<P>In this case, the government relies on the statutory<A NAME = "AB34817"></A> defenses for its
argument of narrow tailoring.  There are a number of reasons why I am not
persuaded that the statutory defenses can save the CDA from a conclusion of
facial unconstitutionality.</P>
<P>First, it is difficult to characterize a criminal<A NAME = "AB34915"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB363173"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> statute that hovers over
each content provider, like the proverbial sword of Damocles, as a narrow
tailoring.  Criminal prosecution, which carries with it the risk of public
obloquy as well as the expense of court preparation and attorneys' fees, could
itself cause incalculable harm.  No provider, whether an individual, non-profit
corporation, or even large publicly held corporation, is likely to willingly
subject itself to prosecution for a miscalculation of the prevalent community
standards or for an error in judgment as to what is indecent.  A successful
defense to a criminal prosecution would be small solace indeed.</P>
<P>Credit<A NAME = "AO3501"></A><A NAME = "AS3502"></A><A NAME = "AS3503"></A><A NAME = "BB3504"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB58262"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> card and adult verification<A NAME = "AB35013"></A> services are explicitly referred to as
defenses in &#167; 223(e)(5)(B) of the CDA.  As is set forth fully in the
detailed Findings of Fact, these defenses are not technologically or
economically feasible for most providers.  </P>
<P>The government then falls back on the affirmative<A NAME = "AB35115"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35252"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> defense to prosecution
provided in &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) for a person who &quot;has taken, in good faith,
reasonable, effective<A NAME = "AO35163"></A>, and appropriate actions under the circumstances to
restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication specified in such
subsections . . . including any method which is feasible under available
technology.&quot;  The government<A NAME = "AO351131"></A> emphasizes that &quot;effective&quot; does not
require 100% restriction, and that this defense is &quot;open-ended&quot; and
requires only reasonable efforts based on current technology.</P>
<P>But, as the evidence made clear, there is no such technology at this time.
The government proffered as one option that would constitute a valid affirmative<A NAME = "BB35252"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF35115"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
defense under &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) a &quot;tagging&quot; scheme conceived by Dr.
Olsen in response to this lawsuit whereby a string of characters would be
imbedded in all arguably indecent or patently offensive material.  Our Findings
of Fact set forth fully the reasons why we found that the feasibility and
effectiveness of tagging in the manner proposed by the government has not been
established.  All parties agree that tagging alone does nothing to prevent
children from accessing potentially indecent material, because it depends upon
the cooperation of third parties to block the material on which the tags are
embedded.  Yet these third parties, over which the content providers have no
control, are not subject to the CDA.  I do not believe a statute is narrowly
tailored when it subjects to potential criminal penalties those who must depend
upon third parties for the effective operation of a statutory defense.</P>
<P>Most important, the government's<A NAME = "AO3537"></A><A NAME = "AS3538"></A> &quot;tagging&quot; proposal is purely
hypothetical and offers no currently operative defense to Internet<A NAME = "BB35337"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF11960"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> content
providers.  At this time, there is no agreed-upon &quot;tag&quot; in existence,
and no web browsers or user-based screening systems are now configured to block
tagged material.  Nor, significantly, has the government<A NAME = "AO353109"></A> stipulated that a
content provider could avoid liability simply by tagging its material.   </P>
<P>Third, even if the technology catches up, as the government confidently
predicts, there will still be a not insignificant burden attached to effecting a
tagging defense, a burden one should not have to bear in order to transmit
information protected under the constitution.  For example, to effect tagging
content providers must review all of their material currently published online,
as well as all new material they post in the future, to determine if it could be
considered &quot;patently offensive&quot; in any community nationwide.  This
would be burdensome for all providers, but for the many not-for-profit entities
which currently post thousands of Web pages, this burden would be one impossible
to sustain.</P>
<P>Finally, the viability<A NAME = "AO3555"></A><A NAME = "AS3556"></A> of the defenses is intricately tied to the clarity of
the CDA's<A NAME = "AB35531"></A> scope.  Because, like Judge Buckwalter, and for many of the reasons he
gives, I believe that &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot;
are inherently vague, particularly in light of the government's inability to
identify the relevant community by whose standards the material will be judged,
I am not persuaded by the government that the statutory defenses in &#167;
223(e) provide effective protection from the unconstitutional reach of the
statute.</P>
<P>Minors<A NAME = "AO3561"></A><A NAME = "AS3562"></A> would not be left without any protection from exposure to patently
unsuitable material on the Internet<A NAME = "BB35635"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> should the challenged provisions of the CDA
be preliminarily enjoined. Vigorous enforcement<A NAME = "AO35660"></A><A NAME = "AS35661"></A> of current obscenity and child<A NAME = "AB35672"></A>
pornography laws should suffice to address the problem the government identified
in court and which concerned Congress.  When the CDA was under consideration by
Congress, the Justice Department itself communicated its view that it was not
necessary because it was prosecuting<A NAME = "AO356155"></A><A NAME = "AS356156"></A><A NAME = "AS356157"></A> online<A NAME = "AB356160"></A> obscenity, child<A NAME = "BB356165"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40320"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pornography and
child solicitation under existing laws, and would continue to do so.(2)  It
follows that the CDA is not narrowly tailored, and the government's attempt to

defend it on that ground must fail.</P>

10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward<A NAME = "AS69023"></A><A NAME = "AB69024"></A> of it.  Do not attack from the
leeward.
<P>

<P>

11. A wind<A NAME = "AO6927"></A> that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon
falls.
<P>

<P>

12. In every army, the five<A NAME = "AO69413"></A> developments connected with fire must be known,
the movements<A NAME = "AO69433"></A> of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days.

<P>

<P>

13. Hence those who use<A NAME = "AO69611"></A><A NAME = "AS69612"></A> fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence<A NAME = "BB69631"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF44843"><img src="link.GIF"></A>;
those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength.

<P>

<P>

14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all
his belongings.
<P>

<P>

15. Unhappy is the fate<A NAME = "AO70011"></A> of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in
his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the result<A NAME = "AO70056"></A> is
waste of time and general stagnation.
<P>

<P>

16. Hence the saying:  The enlightened<A NAME = "AO70213"></A> ruler lays his plans well ahead; the
good<A NAME = "AO70230"></A> general cultivates his resources.
<P>

<P>

17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there
is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical.
<P>

<P>

18. No<A NAME = "AO7065"></A><A NAME = "AS7066"></A> ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own
spleen<A NAME = "AB70633"></A>; no<A NAME = "AO70636"></A> general should fight a battle simply out of pique.
<P>

<P>

19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you
are.
<P>

<P>

20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content.
<P>

<P>

51. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate resistance
when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey
promptly when he has fallen into danger.
<P>

52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are
acquainted with their designs.  We are not fit to lead an army on the march
unless we are familiar with the face of the country--its mountains and
forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be
unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local
guides.
<P>

<P>

53. To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does
not befit a warlike prince.
<P>

<P>

54. When a warlike<A NAME = "AO6389"></A> prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship<A NAME = "AO63824"></A><A NAME = "AS63825"></A> shows
itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's<A NAME = "AB63844"></A> forces.  He overawes
his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him.

<P>

<P>

55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all
<P>

and sundry, nor does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his
own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe.  Thus he is able<A NAME = "AO64155"></A> to
capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.
<P>

<P>

56. Bestow rewards without regard to rule, issue orders without regard to
previous arrangements; and you will be able to handle a whole army as though
you had to do with but a single man.
<P>

<P>

57. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your
design.  When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell
them nothing when the situation is gloomy.
<P>

<P>

58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into
desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.
<P>

<P>

59. For it is precisely when a force<A NAME = "AO64917"></A> has fallen into harm's way that is
capable of striking a blow for victory.
<P>

<P>

60. Success<A NAME = "AO6515"></A><A NAME = "AS6516"></A> in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the
enemy's<A NAME = "AB65129"></A> purpose.
<P>

<P>

61. By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank, we shall succeed in the
long run in killing the commander-in-chief.
<P>

<P>

62. This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.
<P>

<P>

63. On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier passes,
destroy the official tallies, and stop the passage of all emissaries.
<P>

7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an
attractive bait, it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to
retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army
has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.
<P>

<P>

8. With regard to narrow passes, if you can occupy them first, let them be
strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.
<P>

<P>

9. Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if
the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.
<P>

<P>

10. With regard to precipitous heights, if you are beforehand with your
adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for
him to come up.
<P>

<P>

11. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but
retreat and try to entice him away.
<P>

<P>

12. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength
of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, and fighting
will be to your disadvantage.
<P>

<P>

13. These six<A NAME = "AO4927"></A> are the principles connected with Earth. The general<A NAME = "AO49224"></A> who has
attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.
<P>

<P>

14. Now an army<A NAME = "AO4949"></A> is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from
natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible.  These
are:
<P>

(1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5) disorganization
; (6) rout.
<P>

<P>

15. Other conditions being equal, if one<A NAME = "AO49715"></A> force is hurled against another ten
times its size, the result will be the flight of the former.
<P>

<P>

16. When the common<A NAME = "AO4999"></A> soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the
result<A NAME = "AO49932"></A> is insubordination. When the officers<A NAME = "AO49943"></A> are too strong and the common
soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.
<P>

<P>

17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting<A NAME = "AO50125"></A> the
enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before
the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight,
the result is ruin.
<P>

<P>

18. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not
clear and distinct; when there are no<A NAME = "AO50343"></A> fixes duties assigned to officers and
men, and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is
utter disorganization.
<P>

<P>

19. When a general<A NAME = "AO5059"></A><A NAME = "AS50510"></A><A NAME = "AS50511"></A>, unable to estimate the enemy's<A NAME = "AB50522"></A> strength, allows an
inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls<A NAME = "AB50547"></A> a weak detachment against a
powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the
result must be rout.
<P>

<P>

20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by
the general who has attained a responsible post.

<P>
Indeed, the Government's<A NAME = "AB5095"></A> asserted &quot;failure&quot; of the Internet rests
on the implicit premise that too much speech occurs in that medium, and that
speech there is too available to the participants.  This is exactly the benefit
of Internet<A NAME = "BB50978"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB51015"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication, however.  The Government<A NAME = "AO50987"></A><A NAME = "AS50988"></A>, therefore, implicitly asks
this court to limit both the amount of speech on the Internet<A NAME = "BB509119"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB51056"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and the
availability of that speech.  This argument is profoundly repugnant to First
Amendment principles.</P>
<P>My examination of the special characteristics of Internet<A NAME = "BB51015"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52239"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication, and
review of the Supreme<A NAME = "AB51028"></A> Court's medium-specific First Amendment jurisprudence,
lead me to conclude that the Internet<A NAME = "BB51056"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB511186"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> deserves the broadest possible protection
from government-imposed, content-based regulation.  If &quot;the First<A NAME = "AO51086"></A><A NAME = "AS51087"></A><A NAME = "AS51088"></A><A NAME = "BB51089"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52858"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment
erects a virtually insurmountable<A NAME = "AB510100"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB510179"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> barrier between government and the print media&quot;,
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 259 (White, J., concurring), even though the print medium
fails to achieve the hoped-for diversity in the marketplace of ideas, then that
&quot;insurmountable<A NAME = "AO510177"></A><A NAME = "AS510178"></A><A NAME = "BB510179"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF510100"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> barrier&quot; must also exist for a medium that succeeds in
achieving that diversity.  If our Constitution<A NAME = "AO510213"></A><A NAME = "AS510214"></A> &quot;prefer[s] 'the power of
reason as applied through public<A NAME = "AB510237"></A> discussion'&quot;, id. (citation omitted), &quot;[r]egardless
of how beneficent-sounding the purposes of controlling the press might be&quot;,
id., even though &quot;occasionally debate on vital matters will not be
comprehensive and . . . all viewpoints may not be expressed&quot;, id. at 260, a
medium that does capture comprehensive debate and does allow for the expression
of all viewpoints should receive at least the same protection from intrusion. 
</P>
<P>Finally, if the goal<A NAME = "AO5117"></A><A NAME = "AS5118"></A> of our First<A NAME = "BB51115"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF3733"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment jurisprudence is the &quot;individual
dignity and choice&quot; that arises from &quot;putting the decision as to what
views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us&quot;, Leathers v.
Medlock, 499 U.S. 439, 448-49 (1991) (citing Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15,
24 (1971)), then we should be especially vigilant in preventing content-based
regulation of a medium that every minute allows individual citizens actually to
make those decisions.  Any content-based regulation of the Internet<A NAME = "BB511186"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB5196"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, no matter
how benign the purpose, could burn the global village to roast the pig.  Cf.
Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.</P>
<H1> 5.  Protection<A NAME = "AB5125"></A> of Children from Pornography<A NAME = "BB51214"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB51433"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A></H1>
<P>I accept without reservation that the Government<A NAME = "AO51413"></A><A NAME = "AS51414"></A> has a compelling interest
in protecting children from pornography<A NAME = "BB51433"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52138"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  The proposition finds one of its
clearest expressions in Mill, who recognized that his exposition regarding
liberty itself &quot;is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of
their faculties&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the

law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood.  Those who are still in a state to
require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own
actions as well as against external injury.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 69 (Gertrude Himmelfarb ed., Penguin<A NAME = "AO51621"></A><A NAME = "AS51622"></A><A NAME = "AS51623"></A><A NAME = "AB51624"></A> Books
1982) (1859), cited in Harry<A NAME = "AB51640"></A> Kalven Jr., A Worthy Tradition 54 (Jamie Kalven ed.
1988).</P>
<P>This rationale, however, is as dangerous as it is compelling.  Laws<A NAME = "AO51721"></A>
regulating speech for the protection of children have no limiting principle, and
a well-intentioned law restricting protected speech on the basis of its content
is, nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship.  Regulations<A NAME = "AO51784"></A> that &quot;drive
certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace&quot; for children's benefit,
Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. at 116, risk destroying the very &quot;political
system and cultural life&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2458, that they will
inherit when they come of age.</P>
<P>I therefore have no doubt that a Newspaper Decency Act, passed because
Congress discovered that young girls had read a front page article in the New
York Times on female genital mutilation in Africa, would be unconstitutional. 
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  Nor would a Novel Decency Act, adopted after
legislators had seen too many pot-boilers in convenience store book racks, pass
constitutional muster.  Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.  There is no question that a
Village Green Decency Act, the fruit of a Senator's overhearing of a ribald
conversation between two adolescent boys on a park bench, would be
unconstitutional.  Perry Education Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460
U.S. 37, 45 (1983).  A Postal Decency Act, passed because of constituent
complaints about unsolicited lingerie catalogues, would also be

unconstitutional.  Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73.  In these forms of communication,
regulations<A NAME = "AO518288"></A><A NAME = "AS518289"></A> on the basis of decency simply would not survive First<A NAME = "BB518310"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF505271"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment
scrutiny.  </P>
<P>The Internet<A NAME = "AO5193"></A><A NAME = "AS5194"></A><A NAME = "AS5195"></A><A NAME = "BB5196"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52015"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is a far more speech<A NAME = "AB51917"></A>-enhancing medium than print, the village
green, or the mails.  Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself,
the CDA<A NAME = "AO51959"></A> would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. 
This is a constitutionally intolerable result.</P>
<P>Some of the dialogue<A NAME = "AO5207"></A><A NAME = "AS5208"></A> on the Internet<A NAME = "BB52015"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52040"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> surely tests the limits of conventional
discourse.  Speech<A NAME = "AO52032"></A><A NAME = "AS52033"></A> on the Internet<A NAME = "BB52040"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52145"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> can be unfiltered, unpolished, and
unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar -- in a
word, &quot;indecent&quot; in many communities.  But we should expect such
speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a
voice.  We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to
ordinary people as well as media magnates.</P>
<P>Moreover, the CDA<A NAME = "AO5215"></A><A NAME = "AS5216"></A><A NAME = "AS5217"></A><A NAME = "AS5218"></A> will almost certainly fail to accomplish the Government's<A NAME = "BB52125"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF46821"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
interest in shielding children from pornography<A NAME = "BB52138"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52188"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> on the Internet<A NAME = "BB52145"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB521127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Nearly half<A NAME = "AO52150"></A><A NAME = "AS52151"></A><A NAME = "AS52152"></A><A NAME = "AS52153"></A> of
Internet<A NAME = "BB52158"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB62986"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communications originate outside the United<A NAME = "BB52169"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB5353"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States, and some percentage
of that figure represents pornography<A NAME = "BB52188"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52191"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Pornography<A NAME = "BB52191"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB521132"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> from, say, Amsterdam<A NAME = "AO52198"></A><A NAME = "AS52199"></A><A NAME = "AS521100"></A><A NAME = "AS521101"></A><A NAME = "AS521102"></A><A NAME = "AS521103"></A><A NAME = "AB521104"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB521150"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> will be
no less appealing to a child on the Internet<A NAME = "BB521127"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52271"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> than pornography<A NAME = "BB521132"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52264"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> from New<A NAME = "BB521137"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF213168"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> York
City, and residents of Amsterdam<A NAME = "BB521150"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF521104"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have little incentive to comply with the
CDA.(22)</P>
<P>My analysis<A NAME = "AO5223"></A><A NAME = "AS5224"></A><A NAME = "AS5225"></A> does not deprive the Government<A NAME = "AB52216"></A> of all means of protecting
children from the dangers of Internet<A NAME = "BB52239"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF201118"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication.  The Government<A NAME = "AO52246"></A><A NAME = "AS52247"></A><A NAME = "AS52248"></A><A NAME = "AS52249"></A> can
continue to protect children from pornography<A NAME = "BB52264"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB61192"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> on the Internet<A NAME = "BB52271"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB523146"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> through vigorous
enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child<A NAME = "BB52292"></A><A HREF = "SPP18.HTM#BB547112"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pornography.  See
United<A NAME = "AB52299"></A> States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995).  As we learned at
the hearing, there is also a compelling<A NAME = "AO522147"></A><A NAME = "AS522148"></A> need for public<A NAME = "AB522155"></A> education about the
benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role
as well.  In my view, our action today should only mean that the Government's<A NAME = "AB522218"></A>
permissible supervision of Internet content stops at the traditional line of
unprotected speech.</P>
<P>Parents, too, have options available to them.  As we learned at the hearing,
parents<A NAME = "AO52328"></A><A NAME = "AS52329"></A><A NAME = "AS52330"></A><A NAME = "AS52331"></A> can install blocking software on their home<A NAME = "AB52346"></A> computers, or they can
subscribe to commercial<A NAME = "BB52361"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF7239"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> online services that provide parental<A NAME = "AB52372"></A> controls.  It is
quite clear that powerful market<A NAME = "AO52389"></A><A NAME = "AS52390"></A><A NAME = "AS52391"></A><A NAME = "AB52392"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB57520"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> forces are at work to expand parental<A NAME = "AB523107"></A> options
to deal with these legitimate concerns.  More fundamentally, parents<A NAME = "AO523128"></A><A NAME = "AS523129"></A> can
supervise their children's use of the Internet<A NAME = "BB523146"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52531"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or deny their children the
opportunity to participate in the medium until they reach an appropriate age. 
See Fabulous, 896 F.2d at 788-89 (noting that &quot;our society has
traditionally placed&quot; these decisions &quot;on the shoulders of the parent&quot;).</P>
<P><B>E.</B>  <B>Conclusion</B></P>
<P>Cutting<A NAME = "AO5251"></A><A NAME = "AS5252"></A> through the acronyms and argot that littered the hearing<A NAME = "AB52521"></A> testimony,
the Internet<A NAME = "AO52529"></A><A NAME = "AS52530"></A><A NAME = "BB52531"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB525101"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> may fairly be regarded as a never-ending worldwide conversation. 
The Government<A NAME = "AO52557"></A> may not, through the CDA, interrupt that conversation.  As the
most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet<A NAME = "AO52598"></A><A NAME = "AS52599"></A><A NAME = "AS525100"></A><A NAME = "BB525101"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52625"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> deserves the
highest protection from governmental<A NAME = "AB525114"></A> intrusion.</P>
<P>True it is that many find some of the speech on the Internet<A NAME = "BB52625"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52719"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to be
offensive, and amid the din of cyberspace many hear discordant voices that they
regard as indecent.  The absence<A NAME = "AO52666"></A><A NAME = "AS52667"></A> of governmental<A NAME = "AB52672"></A> regulation of Internet content
has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of plaintiffs' experts
put it with such resonance at the hearing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet<A NAME = "BB52719"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52735"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is.  The strength<A NAME = "AO52726"></A><A NAME = "AS52727"></A>

of the Internet<A NAME = "BB52735"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52815"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is that chaos.(23)  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Just as the strength<A NAME = "AO5287"></A><A NAME = "AS5288"></A> of the Internet<A NAME = "BB52815"></A><A HREF = "SPP18.HTM#BB568192"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is chaos, so the strength<A NAME = "AO52826"></A><A NAME = "AS52827"></A> of our
liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First<A NAME = "BB52858"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB58722"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Amendment protects. </P>
<P>For these reasons, I without hesitation hold that the CDA is
unconstitutional on its face.</P>

<strong>This is a full-text facsimile of the original document.</STRONG>
<P>


<P>

11. The art<A NAME = "AO3607"></A> of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's
not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of
his not attacking,&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;but rather on the fact that
we have made our position unassailable.
<P>

<P>

12. There are five<A NAME = "AO3629"></A> dangerous faults which may affect a general:
<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(1) Recklessness<A NAME = "AO36312"></A>, which leads to destruction;

<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(2) cowardice, which leads to capture;
<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(3) a hasty<A NAME = "AO36514"></A> temper, which can be provoked by
insults;
<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to
shame;
<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes
him to worry and trouble.
<P>

<P>

13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct
of war.
<P>

<P>

14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause<A NAME = "AO37125"></A> will surely
be found among these five dangerous faults.  Let them be a subject<A NAME = "AS37154"></A> of
meditation<A NAME = "AB37159"></A>.
<P>

<P>

<H1>IX.  THE ARMY ON THE MARCH</H1>

<P>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO3765"></A><A NAME = "AS3766"></A><A NAME = "BB3767"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB4697"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  We come now to the question of encamping the army, and
observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the
neighborhood of valleys.
<P>

<P>

2. Camp in high places, facing the sun.  Do not climb heights in order to
fight.  So much for mountain warfare.
<P>

<P>

3. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.
<P>

<P>

4. When an invading<A NAME = "AO3829"></A> force crosses a river in its onward march, do not
advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get
across, and then deliver your attack.
<P>

<P>

5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross.
<P>

<P>

6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.  Do not
move up-stream to meet the enemy. So much for river warfare.
<P>

<P>

7. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them
quickly, without any delay.
<P>
<P>

4. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is
contentious ground.
<P>

<P>

5. Ground<A NAME = "AO5415"></A> on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.
<P>

<P>

6. Ground<A NAME = "AO5435"></A> which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who
occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of
intersecting highways.
<P>

<P>

7. When an army<A NAME = "AO5459"></A><A NAME = "AS54510"></A> has penetrated into the heart<A NAME = "AB54521"></A> of a hostile country, leaving
a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.
<P>

<P>

8. Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens--all
country that is hard to traverse:  this is difficult ground.
<P>

<P>

9. Ground<A NAME = "AO5495"></A> which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only
retire by tortuous paths, so that a small<A NAME = "AO54946"></A> number of the enemy would suffice
to crush a large body of our men:  this is hemmed in ground.
<P>

<P>

10. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting
without delay, is desperate ground.
<P>

<P>

11. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not.
On contentious ground, attack not.
<P>

<P>

12. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way. On the ground of
intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.
<P>

<P>

13. On serious ground, gather in plunder.  In difficult ground, keep
steadily on the march.
<P>

<P>

14. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. On desperate ground, fight.

<P>

<P>

15. Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge
between the enemy's front and rear; to prevent co-operation between his
large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad,
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the officers from rallying their men.
<P>

<P>

16. When the enemy's men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder.

<P>

<P>

17. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when
otherwise, they stopped still.
<P>

<P>

18. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and
on the point of marching to the attack, I should say:  &quot;Begin by
seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable
to your will.&quot;

<P>
Plaintiffs note the difference but do not press this as a basis for
distinguishing between the two sections in their preliminary injunction
arguments and therefore I will also use the words interchangeably for this
purpose, leaving open the issue for consideration at the final judgment stage if
it becomes relevant.</P>
<H1>B.</H1>
<H1>Preliminary Injunction Standard</H1>
<P>To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must establish that they are
likely to prevail on the merits and that they will suffer irreparable harm if
injunctive relief is not granted.  We also must consider whether the potential
harm to the defendant from issuance of a temporary restraining order outweighs
possible harm to the plaintiffs if such relief is denied, and whether the
granting of injunctive relief is in the public interest.  See Campbell Soup Co.
v. ConAgra, Inc., 977 F.2d 86, 90-91 (3d Cir. 1992); Bradley<A NAME = "AB304178"></A> v. Pittsburgh Bd.
of Educ., 910 F.2d 1172, 1175 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>
<P>In a case<A NAME = "AO3055"></A><A NAME = "AS3056"></A> in which the injury alleged is a threat to First<A NAME = "AB30527"></A> Amendment
interests, the finding<A NAME = "AO30536"></A> of irreparable injury is often tied to the likelihood of
success on the merits.  In Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), the Supreme<A NAME = "AO30587"></A><A NAME = "AS30588"></A><A NAME = "AS30589"></A><A NAME = "BB30590"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB321237"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
Court emphasized that &quot;the loss of First<A NAME = "AB305106"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB382299"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment freedoms, for even
minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.&quot;
Id. at 373 (citing New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)).</P>
<P>Subjecting speakers to criminal<A NAME = "AB3067"></A> penalties for speech that is
constitutionally protected in itself raises the spectre of irreparable harm.
Even if a court were unwilling to draw that conclusion from the language of the
statute itself, plaintiffs have introduced ample evidence that the challenged
provisions, if not enjoined, will have a chilling effect on their free
expression.  Thus, this is not a case in which we are dealing with a mere
incidental inhibition on speech, see Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 73 (3d Cir.),
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989), but with a regulation that directly penalizes
speech.</P>
<P>Nor could there be any dispute about the public interest factor which must
be taken into account before a court grants a preliminary injunction.  No<A NAME = "AO30749"></A><A NAME = "AS30750"></A> long
string of citations is necessary to find that the public<A NAME = "BB30773"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32412"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> interest weighs in
favor of having access to a free flow of constitutionally protected speech.
See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458
(1994); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S.
748, 763-65 (1976).  </P>
<P>Thus, if plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, they
will have shown the irreparable injury needed to entitle them to a preliminary
injunction.</P>
<H1>C.</H1>
<H1>Applicable Standard of Review</H1>
<P>The CDA<A NAME = "AO3133"></A><A NAME = "AS3134"></A> is patently a government<A NAME = "AB31313"></A>-imposed content-based restriction on

speech, and the speech at issue, whether denominated &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive,&quot; is entitled to constitutional protection.  See Sable

Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).  As such,
the regulation is subject to strict scrutiny, and will only be upheld if it is
justified by a compelling government interest and if it is narrowly tailored to
effectuate that interest.  Sable<A NAME = "AB313162"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB320238"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 126; see also Turner Broadcasting,
114 S. Ct. at 2459 (1994).  &quot;[T]he benefit gained [by a content-based
restriction] must outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights.&quot;
Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. at 363.</P>
<P>The government's<A NAME = "AO3143"></A><A NAME = "AS3144"></A><A NAME = "AS3145"></A><A NAME = "AB3146"></A> position on the applicable standard has been less than
pellucid<A NAME = "AB31427"></A> but, despite some references to a somewhat lesser burden employed in
broadcasting<A NAME = "AB31452"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB4565"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> cases, it now appears to have conceded that it has the burden of
proof to show both a compelling interest and that the statute regulates least
restrictively.  Tr. of Preliminary Injunction Hearing at 121 (May 10, 1996).  In
any event, the evidence<A NAME = "AO314139"></A><A NAME = "AS314140"></A> and our Findings<A NAME = "AB314147"></A> of Fact based thereon show that
Internet<A NAME = "AO314162"></A><A NAME = "AS314163"></A><A NAME = "BB314164"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB411276"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> communication, while unique, is more akin to telephone communication,
at issue in Sable, than to broadcasting, at issue in Pacifica, because, as with
the telephone<A NAME = "BB314216"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB38813"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, an Internet<A NAME = "AO314221"></A><A NAME = "AS314222"></A><A NAME = "BB314223"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB323238"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> user must act affirmatively and deliberately to
retrieve specific information online.  Even if a broad search will, on occasion,
retrieve unwanted materials, the user virtually always receives some warning of
its content, significantly reducing the element of surprise or &quot;assault&quot;
involved in broadcasting.  Therefore, it is highly<A NAME = "AO314321"></A> unlikely that a very young
child will be randomly &quot;surfing&quot; the Web and come across &quot;indecent&quot;

or &quot;patently offensive&quot; material.  </P>
<P>Judge<A NAME = "AO3151"></A><A NAME = "AS3152"></A><A NAME = "AS3153"></A><A NAME = "AS3154"></A><A NAME = "AS3155"></A><A NAME = "AB3156"></A> Dalzell's separate opinion fully explores the reasons for the
differential treatment of radio<A NAME = "BB31533"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB405221"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and television<A NAME = "AB31538"></A> broadcasting for First<A NAME = "AB31545"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB448352"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment
purposes from that accorded other means of communication.  It follows that to
the extent the Court employed a less than strict scrutiny standard of review in
Pacifica and other broadcasting cases, see, e.g., Red<A NAME = "AB315117"></A> Lion Broadcasting Co. v.
FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), there is no reason to employ a less than strict
scrutiny standard of review in this case.</P>
<H1>D.</H1>
<H1>The Nature of the Government's Interest</H1>
<P>The government asserts that shielding minors from access to indecent
materials is the compelling interest supporting the CDA.  It cites in support
the statements of the Supreme Court that &quot;[i]t is evident beyond the need
for elaboration that a State's interest in `safeguarding the physical and
psychological well-being of a minor' is `compelling,'&quot;  New York v. Ferber,
458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982)(quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S.
596, 607 (1982)), and &quot;there is a compelling interest in protecting the
physical and psychological well-being of minors.  This interest extends to
shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult
standards.&quot;  Sable<A NAME = "BB320238"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32191"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S at 126.  It also cites the similar quotation
appearing in Fabulous Assoc., Inc. v. Pennsylvania<A NAME = "AB320274"></A> Public Utility Comm'n, 896
F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990). </P>
<P>Those statements were made in cases where the potential harm to children
from the material was evident.  Ferber<A NAME = "AO32135"></A><A NAME = "AS32136"></A> involved the constitutionality of a
statute which prohibited persons from knowingly promoting sexual<A NAME = "AB32163"></A> performances by
children under 16 and distributing material depicting such performances.  Sable<A NAME = "AO32188"></A><A NAME = "AS32189"></A><A NAME = "AS32190"></A><A NAME = "BB32191"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB322207"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
and Fabulous involved the FCC's<A NAME = "AB321102"></A> ban on &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; (dealing by
definition with pornographic telephone messages).  In contrast to the material
at issue in those cases, at least some of the material<A NAME = "AO321163"></A><A NAME = "AS321164"></A> subject to coverage under
the &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; provisions of the
CDA may contain valuable literary, artistic or educational<A NAME = "AB321209"></A> information of value
to older minors as well as adults.  The Supreme<A NAME = "AO321234"></A><A NAME = "AS321235"></A><A NAME = "AS321236"></A><A NAME = "BB321237"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB32933"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Court has held that &quot;minors
are entitled to a significant measure of First<A NAME = "AB321265"></A> Amendment protection, and only in
relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public
dissemination of protected materials to them.&quot;  Erznoznik<A NAME = "AB321312"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB385720"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> v. City of
Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213 (1975)(citations omitted).  </P>
<P>In Erznoznik, the Court rejected an argument that an ordinance<A NAME = "AO32219"></A><A NAME = "AS32220"></A><A NAME = "AS32221"></A> prohibiting

the display<A NAME = "AB32229"></A> of films containing nudity at drive-in movie<A NAME = "AB32246"></A> theatres served a
compelling interest in protecting minor passersby from the influence of such
films.  The Court<A NAME = "AO32281"></A> held that the prohibition was unduly broad, and explained that
&quot;[s]peech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other
legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from
ideas or images that a legislative<A NAME = "AO322166"></A><A NAME = "AS322167"></A><A NAME = "AB322168"></A> body thinks unsuitable for them.&quot;  422
U.S. at 213-14.  As Justice<A NAME = "AO322195"></A><A NAME = "AS322196"></A><A NAME = "AS322197"></A><A NAME = "AB322198"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB407162"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Scalia noted in Sable<A NAME = "BB322207"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB322272"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, &quot;[t]he more pornographic
what is embraced within the . . .  category of `indecency,' the more reasonable
it becomes to insist upon greater assurance of insulation from minors.&quot;
Sable<A NAME = "BB322272"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32778"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).  It follows that where
non-pornographic, albeit sexually explicit, material also falls within the sweep
of the statute, the interest will not be as compelling.  </P>
<P>In part, our consideration of the government's showing of a &quot;compelling
interest&quot; trenches upon the vagueness issue, discussed in detail in Judge
Buckwalter's opinion but equally pertinent to First Amendment analysis.
Material routinely acceptable according to the standards of New<A NAME = "BB32382"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB390423"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> York City, such
as the Broadway play Angels in America which concerns homosexuality and AIDS
portrayed in graphic language, may be far less acceptable in smaller, less
cosmopolitan communities of the United<A NAME = "BB323147"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB326101"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States.  Yet the play<A NAME = "AO323156"></A><A NAME = "AS323157"></A><A NAME = "AS323158"></A> garnered two Tony<A NAME = "AB323165"></A>
Awards and a Pulitzer<A NAME = "AB323174"></A> prize for its author, and some uninhibited parents and
teachers might deem it to be material to be read or assigned to eleventh and

twelfth graders.  If available on the Internet<A NAME = "BB323238"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB324100"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> through some libraries<A NAME = "BB323245"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB569139"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, the text<A NAME = "AO323250"></A>
of the play would likely be accessed in that manner by at least some students,
and it would also arguably fall within the scope of the CDA.</P>
<P>There has been recent public<A NAME = "AO3249"></A><A NAME = "AS32410"></A><A NAME = "AS32411"></A><A NAME = "BB32412"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB408203"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> interest in the female genital<A NAME = "AB32423"></A> mutilation
routinely practiced and officially condoned in some countries.  News articles
have been descriptive, and it is not stretching to assume that this is a subject<A NAME = "AO32476"></A><A NAME = "AS32477"></A><A NAME = "AS32478"></A>
that occupies news<A NAME = "AB32485"></A> groups and chat rooms on the Internet<A NAME = "BB324100"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32530"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  We have no assurance
that these discussions, of obvious interest and relevance to older teenage
girls, will not be viewed as patently offensive - even in context - in some
communities.</P>
<P>Other<A NAME = "AO3251"></A><A NAME = "AS3252"></A><A NAME = "AS3253"></A> illustrations abound of non-obscene material likely to be available on
the Internet<A NAME = "BB32530"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB326178"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> but subject to the CDA's criminal<A NAME = "AB32543"></A> provisions.  Photographs
appearing in National<A NAME = "AB32554"></A> Geographic or a travel magazine<A NAME = "AB32565"></A> of the sculptures in India<A NAME = "AB32576"></A>
of couples copulating in numerous positions, a written description of a brutal
prison rape, or Francesco Clemente's painting &quot;Labirinth,&quot; see Def.
Exh. 125, all might be considered to &quot;depict or describe, in terms patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.&quot;  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)(1).  But the government has
made no showing that it has a compelling interest in preventing a
seventeen-year-old minor from accessing such images.  </P>
<P>By contrast, plaintiffs presented testimony that material that could be
considered indecent, such as that offered by Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path
AIDS project, may be critically important for certain older minors.  For
example, there was testimony that one<A NAME = "AO32679"></A><A NAME = "AS32680"></A><A NAME = "AS32681"></A> quarter of all new HIV<A NAME = "AB32692"></A> infections in the
United<A NAME = "BB326101"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB52169"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> States is estimated to occur in young people between the ages of 13 and
20, an estimate the government made no effort to rebut.  The witnesses believed
that graphic material that their organizations<A NAME = "AO326168"></A><A NAME = "AS326169"></A> post on the Internet<A NAME = "BB326178"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32875"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> could help
save lives, but were concerned about the CDA's effect on their right to do so.</P>
<P>The government counters that this court<A NAME = "AO32711"></A><A NAME = "AS32712"></A> should defer to legislative<A NAME = "AB32721"></A>
conclusions about this matter.  However, where First<A NAME = "AB32736"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490193"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment rights are at
stake, &quot;[d]<A NAME = "AO32752"></A><A NAME = "AS32753"></A><A NAME = "AS32754"></A>eference to a legislative<A NAME = "AB32762"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490177"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> finding cannot limit judicial<A NAME = "AB32771"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490186"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> inquiry.&quot;
Sable<A NAME = "BB32778"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB334104"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, 492 U.S. at 129 (quoting Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435
U.S. 829, 843 (1978)).  &quot;[W]<A NAME = "AO327118"></A><A NAME = "AS327119"></A><A NAME = "AS327120"></A>hatever deference is due legislative<A NAME = "AB327130"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32816"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> findings
would not foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearing on an issue of
constitutional<A NAME = "AB327163"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB372178"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> law.&quot;  Id. </P>
<P>Moreover, it appears<A NAME = "AO3285"></A><A NAME = "AS3286"></A><A NAME = "AS3287"></A><A NAME = "AS3288"></A><A NAME = "AS3289"></A> that the legislative<A NAME = "BB32816"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF327130"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> &quot;findings&quot; the

government cites concern primarily testimony and statements by legislators about

the prevalence of obscenity, child<A NAME = "BB32855"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB328236"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> pornography, and sexual<A NAME = "AB32862"></A> solicitation of
children on the Internet<A NAME = "BB32875"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB33554"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  Similarly, at the hearings<A NAME = "AO32884"></A><A NAME = "AS32885"></A> before us the government
introduced exhibits of sexually explicit material through the testimony of Agent<A NAME = "AB328116"></A>
Howard Schmidt, which consisted primarily of the same type of hard-core
pornographic materials (even if not technically obscene) which concerned<A NAME = "AO328161"></A><A NAME = "AS328162"></A>
Congress and which fill the shelves of &quot;adult&quot; book and magazine<A NAME = "AB328187"></A>
stores.  Plaintiffs emphasize that they do not challenge the Act's<A NAME = "AB328208"></A> restrictions
on speech not protected by the First<A NAME = "BB328225"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB33519"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> Amendment, such as obscenity, child<A NAME = "BB328236"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB356165"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
pornography or harassment of children.  Their suit is based on their assertion,
fully supported by their evidence and our findings, that the CDA reaches much
farther.</P>

34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers
whose temper is keen.
<P>

<P>

<P>

35. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army
that is returning home.
<P>

<P>

36. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a
desperate foe too hard.
<P>

<P>

37. Such is the art of warfare.

<H1>VIII. VARIATION IN TACTICS</H1>

<P>

1. Sun<A NAME = "AO3415"></A><A NAME = "AS3416"></A><A NAME = "BB3417"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB3767"><img src="link.GIF"></A> Tzu said:  In war, the general<A NAME = "AO34120"></A> receives his commands from the
sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.
<P>

<P>

2. When in difficult country, do not encamp.  In country where high roads
intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously
isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem.
In desperate position, you must fight.
<P>

<P>

3. There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not
attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be
contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
<P>

<P>

4. The general<A NAME = "AO3477"></A> who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany
variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.
<P>

<P>

5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with
the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his
knowledge to practical account.
<P>

<P>

6. So, the student<A NAME = "AO3519"></A><A NAME = "AS35110"></A><A NAME = "AB35111"></A> of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his
plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to
make the best use of his men.
<P>

<P>

7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of
disadvantage will be blended together.
<P>

<P>

8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed
in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.
<P>

<P>

9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready
to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.
<P>

10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble
for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements,
and make them rush to any given point.
<P>

16. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and
straightforwardness.
<P>

<P>

17. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one<A NAME = "AO75115"></A> cannot make certain of the truth
of their reports.
<P>

<P>

18. Be subtle! Be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business.
<P>

<P>

19. If a secret<A NAME = "AO7559"></A> piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe,
he must be put<A NAME = "AO75545"></A> to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.

<P>

<P>

20. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to
assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding out
the names of the attendants, the aides-de-camp, and door-keepers and
sentries of the general in command.  Our spies must be commissioned to
ascertain these.
<P>

<P>

21. The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, tempted
with bribes, led away and comfortably housed.  Thus they will become
converted spies and available for our service.
<P>

<P>

22. It is through the information<A NAME = "AO76113"></A> brought by the converted spy that we are
able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.
<P>

<P>

23. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy
to carry false tidings to the enemy.
<P>

<P>

24. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving<A NAME = "AO76521"></A> spy can be used on
appointed occasions.
<P>

<P>

25. The end<A NAME = "AO7677"></A> and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the
enemy; and this knowledge<A NAME = "AO76742"></A> can only be derived, in the first instance, from
the converted spy. Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated
with the utmost liberality.
<P>

<P>

26. Of old, the rise<A NAME = "AS76911"></A> of the Yin<A NAME = "AB76918"></A> dynasty was due to I Chih<A NAME = "AO76931"></A> who had served
under the Hsia.  Likewise, the rise<A NAME = "AO76950"></A><A NAME = "AS76951"></A> of the Chou<A NAME = "AB76958"></A> dynasty was due to Lu Ya who
had served under the Yin.
<P>

<P>

27. Hence it is only the enlightened<A NAME = "AO77115"></A><A NAME = "AS77116"></A> ruler and the wise general who will use
the highest intelligence<A NAME = "AB77139"></A> of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they
achieve great results.  Spies<A NAME = "AO77168"></A> are a most important element in water, because
on them depends an army's ability to move.

34. Thus the skillful<A NAME = "AO5999"></A> general conducts his army just as though he were
leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.
<P>

<P>

35. It is the business<A NAME = "AO60111"></A><A NAME = "AS60112"></A> of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy<A NAME = "BB60133"></A><A HREF = "SPP24.HTM#BB74572"><img src="link.GIF"></A>;
upright and just, and thus maintain order.
<P>

<P>

36. He must be able<A NAME = "AO60311"></A> to mystify his officers and men by false reports and
appearances, and thus keep them in total ignorance.
<P>

<P>

37. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, he keeps the enemy
without definite knowledge. By shifting his camp and taking circuitous
routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose.
<P>

<P>

38. At the critical moment, the leader<A NAME = "AO60715"></A> of an army acts like one who has
climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him.  He carries
his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.
<P>

<P>

39. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd<A NAME = "AS60927"></A> driving
a flock of sheep<A NAME = "AB60938"></A>, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows
whither he is going.
<P>

<P>

40. To muster his host and bring it into danger:--this may be termed the business of the general.
<P>

<P>

41. The different<A NAME = "AO6137"></A> measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the
expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of
human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.
<P>

<P>

42. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that
penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating<A NAME = "AO61531"></A> but a short way means
dispersion.
<P>

<P>

43. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across
neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.  When there
are means of communication on all four sides, the ground<A NAME = "AO61767"></A> is one of
intersecting highways.
<P>

<P>

44. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground.  When
you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.
<P>

<P>

45. When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in
front, it is hemmed-in ground. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When there is
no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground.
<P>

<P>

46. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of
purpose.  On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection
between all parts of my army.
<P>

<P>

47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.
<P>

<P>

48. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defenses.  On ground
of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.
<P>

<P>

23. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots
advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens
the approach of infantry.  When it branches out in different directions, it
shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust
moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping.
<P>

<P>

24. Humble<A NAME = "AO4225"></A> words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is
about to advance.  Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack
are signs that he will retreat.
<P>

<P>

25. When the light<A NAME = "AO4249"></A> chariots come out first and take up a position on the
wings, it is a sign that the enemy<A NAME = "AO42448"></A> is forming for battle.
<P>

<P>

26. Peace<A NAME = "AO4265"></A> proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.
<P>

<P>

27. When there is much running about and the soldiers fall into rank, it
means that the critical moment has come.
<P>

<P>

28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.
<P>

<P>

29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from
want of food.
<P>

<P>

30. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the
army is suffering from thirst.
<P>

<P>

31. If the enemy<A NAME = "AO4369"></A> sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to
secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.
<P>

<P>

32. If birds<A NAME = "AO4387"></A> gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. Clamor<A NAME = "AO43824"></A> by night betokens
nervousness.
<P>

<P>

33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak.
If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition<A NAME = "AS44046"></A><A NAME = "AB44047"></A> is afoot.  If the
officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.
<P>

<P>

34. When an army<A NAME = "AO4429"></A><A NAME = "AS44210"></A><A NAME = "AS44211"></A> feeds its horses<A NAME = "BB44218"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB59332"><img src="link.GIF"></A> with grain<A NAME = "BB44223"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF15848"><img src="link.GIF"></A> and kills its cattle for food,
and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing
that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are
determined to fight to the death.
<P>

<P>

35. The sight<A NAME = "AO4447"></A> of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in
subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.
<P>

<P>

36. Too frequent<A NAME = "AO4467"></A> rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his
resources; too many punishments<A NAME = "AO44638"></A> betray a condition of dire distress.
<P>

<P>

37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's numbers, shows<A NAME = "AO44831"></A><A NAME = "AS44832"></A> a supreme lack of intelligence<A NAME = "AB44843"></A><A HREF = "SPP23.HTM#BB69631"><img src="link.GIF"></A>.

<li>  The operational<A NAME = "AO2695"></A><A NAME = "AS2696"></A><A NAME = "AB2697"></A> complexities of a large-scale infrastructure are significant (especially in an international context of cross-
border communications), and a prudent approach to policy would be to develop a base of experience that would guide policy decisions on
 how escrowed encryption might work on a large scale in practice.<BR>



<P><li>  It is not at all clear that escrowed encryption will be a real solution to the most serious problems that law enforcement 
authorities will face, because those most likely to have information<A NAME = "AO27166"></A><A NAME = "AS27167"></A> to conceal will be motivated to exploit technical<A NAME = "AB27184"></A> circumventions of 
escrowed encryption.<BR>



<P><li>  Imposing<A NAME = "AO2733"></A><A NAME = "AS2734"></A><A NAME = "AS2735"></A><A NAME = "AS2736"></A> a particular solution to the encryption<A NAME = "AB27319"></A> dilemma at this time is likely to have a significant negative<A NAME = "BB27342"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF19230"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> impact on the 
natural market<A NAME = "AB27354"></A> development of applications made possible by new information services and technologies.  While the nation may choose to 
bear these costs in the future, it is particularly unwise to bear them in the absence of a large-scale need that may not arise and 
in light of the operational uncertainties described in the first bulleted item above.<BR>



<P><li>  Given the importance of market forces to the long-term success of national cryptography policy, policy makers should learn 
more about how the market will respond before adopting a specific solution driven by the needs of government.  For example, if 
Administration<A NAME = "AO27585"></A><A NAME = "AS27586"></A><A NAME = "AB27587"></A> advocates of escrowed encryption are correct that the private<A NAME = "AO275106"></A><A NAME = "AS275107"></A><A NAME = "AS275108"></A><A NAME = "AS275109"></A><A NAME = "BB275110"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB279108"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector needs exceptional access to encrypted<A NAME = "BB275123"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF125167"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> data for sound 
business<A NAME = "AB275133"></A> reasons, the law<A NAME = "AO275140"></A><A NAME = "AS275141"></A><A NAME = "AS275142"></A><A NAME = "AS275143"></A><A NAME = "AS275144"></A><A NAME = "AS275145"></A><A NAME = "AS275146"></A><A NAME = "AB275147"></A> enforcement need for access to encrypted<A NAME = "AB275160"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB275235"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> records could be substantially met by the exercise of the 
government's<A NAME = "AB275184"></A> compulsory process authority (including search warrants and subpoenas) for information relevant to the investigation and 
prosecution of criminal<A NAME = "BB275224"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB289158"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> activity against both the encrypted<A NAME = "BB275235"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF275160"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> records and any relevant cryptographic<A NAME = "BB275246"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF200105"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> keys, whether held by outside escrow 
agents or by the targets of the compulsory process.<BR>



<P><li>  For these reasons, the committee<A NAME = "AO27711"></A><A NAME = "AS27712"></A> believes that a policy of deliberate exploration of the concept of escrowed<A NAME = "BB27737"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB27999"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption is 
better suited to the circumstances of today than is the current policy of aggressive promotion.  The most appropriate vehicle for such
 an exploration is, quite naturally, government applications.  Such exploration would enable the U.S. government to develop and 
document the base of experience on which to build a more aggressive promotion of escrowed encryption should circumstances develop in 
such a way<A NAME = "AO277168"></A><A NAME = "AS277169"></A> that encrypted communications come to pose a significant problem for law<A NAME = "BB277192"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB28313"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement.  <BR>



<P>In the future, when experience has been developed, the U.S<A NAME = "AO27919"></A><A NAME = "AS27920"></A>. government, by legislation and associated regulation, will have to 
clearly specify the responsibilities, obligations, and liabilities<A NAME = "AB27954"></A> of escrow agents.  Such action<A NAME = "AO27965"></A><A NAME = "AS27966"></A><A NAME = "AS27967"></A> is a necessary (but not sufficient) 
condition for the growth and spread of escrowed<A NAME = "BB27999"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB279133"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption in the private<A NAME = "BB279108"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB31437"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector.  Parties<A NAME = "AO279113"></A><A NAME = "AS279114"></A> whose needs may call for the use of escrowed<A NAME = "BB279133"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB279202"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
encryption will need confidence in the supporting infrastructure before they will entrust sensitive information to the safekeeping of 
others.  Moreover, if the government<A NAME = "AO279182"></A><A NAME = "AS279183"></A> is to actively promote the voluntary use of escrowed<A NAME = "BB279202"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB549103"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption in the future, it will need to 
convince users that it has taken into account their concerns about compromise and abuse of escrowed information.  The best way to 
convince users that these agents will be able to live up to their responsibilities is to point to a body of experience that demonstrates
 their ability to do so.  <BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO2813"></A> recognizes that communications (i.e., digital information in transit) pose a special problem for government.  
Neither<A NAME = "AO28138"></A><A NAME = "AS28139"></A> private individuals nor businesses have substantial needs for exceptional access to the plaintext<A NAME = "AB28166"></A> of encrypted communications
.  Thus, it is unlikely that users<A NAME = "AO28186"></A> would voluntarily adopt on a large scale measures intended to assure exceptional access to such 
communications.  Law enforcement authorities are understandably concerned that they will be denied information vital for the investigation and
 prosecution of criminal activity.  At the same time, it is not clear that encrypted digital communications will in fact be the 
most important problem for law enforcement authorities seeking to gain access to digital information.<BR>



<P>The short<A NAME = "AO2833"></A><A NAME = "AS2834"></A>-term problem for law<A NAME = "BB28313"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB285168"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement is almost certainly more related to voice communications than to data communications
, a problem addressed through Recommendation 5.2.  Over the longer term, the challenge<A NAME = "AO28365"></A><A NAME = "AS28366"></A> from data communications is likely to grow 
as data communications become more ubiquitous and as the technical<A NAME = "AB283102"></A> distinction between voice and data blurs.  To cope with this 
challenge, Recommendation 5.3 sets into motion a prudent &quot;hedge&quot; strategy against this eventuality; Recommendation<A NAME = "AO283154"></A><A NAME = "AS283155"></A> 5.4 begins 
the process of seeking to discourage criminal<A NAME = "AB283175"></A> use of cryptography; Recommendation<A NAME = "AO283184"></A><A NAME = "AS283185"></A><A NAME = "AS283186"></A> 5.5 addresses new technical<A NAME = "AB283195"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29739"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities to meet 
the challenge of encryption<A NAME = "BB283211"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB293227"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>.  (Note that advanced information technologies are likely to lead to explosive increases in the amount 
of electronic information being transmitted (e.g., e-mail); given the likelihood that the spread<A NAME = "AO283275"></A><A NAME = "AS283276"></A><A NAME = "AS283277"></A> of encryption<A NAME = "BB283282"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB34650"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities will 
be much slower than the rate at which the volume of electronic<A NAME = "AB283312"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB301161"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> communications increases, the opportunities<A NAME = "AO283321"></A><A NAME = "AS283322"></A> for authorized law<A NAME = "AB283329"></A> 
enforcement exploitation of larger amounts of unprotected computer-readable information will also increase.)<BR>



<P>Finally, the U.S. government should pursue discussions with other nations on how escrowed encryption might operate 
internationally.  Given that the developed nations of the world share a number of interests (e.g., in preserving authorized law enforcement 
access to communications, in protecting information assets of their domestic businesses), the process<A NAME = "AO285102"></A><A NAME = "AS285103"></A><A NAME = "AS285104"></A><A NAME = "AS285105"></A><A NAME = "AS285106"></A> begun at the Organization for 
Economic<A NAME = "AB285120"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB492374"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> Cooperation and Development (OECD) in December 1995 is a promising forum in which these nations can bring together 
representatives from business, law<A NAME = "BB285168"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29747"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement, and national<A NAME = "BB285175"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29754"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security to discuss matters related to cryptography<A NAME = "BB285190"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB31219"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy over national borders.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation<A NAME = "AO2873"></A><A NAME = "AS2874"></A><A NAME = "AS2875"></A><A NAME = "AS2876"></A><A NAME = "AS2877"></A> </U>5.4--Congress should seriously consider legislation that would impose criminal<A NAME = "AB28729"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36027"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> penalties on the use of encrypted<A NAME = "BB28742"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29380"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
communications in interstate<A NAME = "AB28750"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36048"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> commerce with the intent to commit a federal<A NAME = "AB28767"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36065"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> crime.</B><BR>



<P>The purpose of such a statute<A NAME = "AO28911"></A><A NAME = "AS28912"></A> would be to discourage the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB28929"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB28950"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for illegitimate purposes.  Criminalizing<A NAME = "AO28938"></A><A NAME = "AS28939"></A><A NAME = "AS28940"></A> the use 
of cryptography<A NAME = "BB28950"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB289181"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> in this manner would provide sanctions analogous to the existing mail<A NAME = "AB28973"></A> fraud statutes, which add penalties to 
perpetrators of fraud who use the mail to commit their criminal acts.  Such<A NAME = "AO289113"></A><A NAME = "AS289114"></A><A NAME = "AS289115"></A> a law would focus the weight of the criminal<A NAME = "AB289134"></A> justice system on 
individuals who were in fact guilty of criminal<A NAME = "BB289158"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF57298"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> activity, whereas a mandatory<A NAME = "AO289167"></A><A NAME = "AS289168"></A> prohibition on the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB289181"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB29925"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> would have an impact 
on law-abiding citizens and criminals alike.<BR>



<P>A concern<A NAME = "AO2913"></A><A NAME = "AS2914"></A><A NAME = "AS2915"></A> raised about the imposition of penalties based on a peripheral<A NAME = "AB29126"></A> aspect of a criminal<A NAME = "AB29135"></A> act is that it may be used to 
secure a conviction even when the underlying criminal act has not been accomplished.  The statute<A NAME = "AO29183"></A><A NAME = "AS29184"></A> proposed for consideration in 
Recommendation<A NAME = "AB29196"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29352"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 5.4 is <I>not</I> intended for this purpose, although the committee understands that it is largely the integrity of the judicial and 
criminal justice process that will be the ultimate check on preventing its use for such purposes.<BR>



<P>Any statute that criminalizes the use of encryption in the manner described in Recommendation 5.4 should be drawn narrowly.  The
 statute<A NAME = "AO29342"></A><A NAME = "AS29343"></A><A NAME = "AS29344"></A><A NAME = "AS29345"></A> envisioned by Recommendation<A NAME = "BB29352"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29520"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 5.4 would be limited to federal<A NAME = "AB29365"></A> crimes only and would focus on encrypted<A NAME = "BB29380"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36040"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> <I>communications</I> (in
 recognition of the fact that private parties have significant incentives to escrow keys used for encrypting stored data).  
Drafters of the statute would also have to anticipate other potential ambiguities such as the use<A NAME = "AO293159"></A> of data compression techniques that 
also obscure the true content of a communication and lack of a common understanding about what it means<A NAME = "AO293207"></A><A NAME = "AS293208"></A><A NAME = "AS293209"></A> to &quot;<I>use</I> encrypted 
communications&quot; when encryption<A NAME = "BB293227"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29557"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> may be a ubiquitous and automatic feature in a communications<A NAME = "AB293248"></A> product. <BR>



<P>Finally, the committee<A NAME = "AO2955"></A><A NAME = "AS2956"></A><A NAME = "AS2957"></A> notes the fundamental difference between Recommendation<A NAME = "BB29520"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF29196"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 5.4 and Recommendation<A NAME = "AB29527"></A> 1.  Recommendation<A NAME = "AO29532"></A><A NAME = "AS29533"></A><A NAME = "AS29534"></A> 1 says 
that the <I>use of any type of encryption<A NAME = "BB29557"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB295137"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A></I> within the United<A NAME = "BB29565"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB33846"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States should be legal, but <I>not that any use of encryption</I> should be legal
.  Recommendation<A NAME = "AO29599"></A><A NAME = "AS295100"></A> 5.4 says that the nation should consider legislation that would make illegal <I>a specific use</I> of encryption<A NAME = "BB295137"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB299165"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> (of 
whatever type), namely the use of encrypted communications in interstate commerce when the intent is to commit a federal crime.<BR>

<P>In an age of explosive worldwide growth of electronic data storage and communications, many vital national interests require the
 effective protection of information.  When used in conjunction with other approaches to information security, cryptography is a 
very powerful tool for protecting information.  Consequently, current<A NAME = "AO2289"></A><A NAME = "AS2290"></A><A NAME = "AS2291"></A> U.S. policy should be changed to promote and encourage the 
widespread use of cryptography<A NAME = "AB22121"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4731"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for the protection of the information interests of individuals, businesses, government<A NAME = "AB22144"></A> agencies, and the

him that by this action he was weakening himself, depriving himself of 

<P>

friends and those who had thrown themselves into his lap, whilst he 
<P>

aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual, 

<P>

thus giving it great authority. And having committed this prime error, 

<P>

he was obliged to follow it up, so much so that, to put an end to 
<P>

the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of 
<P>

Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into Italy. 
<P>

And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and 
<P>

deprived himself friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom<A NAME = "AS24719"></A> of Naples<A NAME = "BB24724"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB2586"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 
<P>

divides<A NAME = "AS2483"></A> it with the King<A NAME = "BB24812"></A><A HREF = "SPP75.HTM#BB22506"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Spain, and where he was the prime 
<P>

arbiter of Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of 
<P>

that country and the malcontents of his own should have where to 
<P>

shelter; and whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own 
<P>

pensioner as king, he drove him out, to put one there who was able 
<P>

to drive him, Louis, out in turn. 
<P>

The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men 
<P>

always do so when they can, and for this they will be praised not 
<P>

blamed; but when they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, 
<P>

then there is folly and blame. Therefore, if France<A NAME = "AS25719"></A><A NAME = "BB25720"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB27616"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> could have 
<P>

attacked<A NAME = "AS2583"></A> Naples<A NAME = "BB2586"></A><A HREF = "SPP22.HTM#BB67916"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> with her own forces she ought to have done so; if 
<P>

she could not, then she ought not to have divided it. And if the 
<P>

partition which she made with the Venetians in Lombardy was 
<P>

justified by the excuse that by it she got a foothold in Italy, this 
<P>

other partition merited blame, for it had not the excuse of that 
<P>

necessity. 
<P>

Therefore Louis<A NAME = "AO2645"></A> made these five errors: he destroyed the minor 
<P>

powers, he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in

<P><li>  Vendors<A NAME = "AO1803"></A><A NAME = "AS1804"></A><A NAME = "AS1805"></A><A NAME = "AS1806"></A> of products covered under Recommendation<A NAME = "BB18017"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB18432"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.1 (and 4.2 below) must provide to the U.S. government<A NAME = "AB18040"></A> full technical 
specifications of their product and reasonable technical<A NAME = "AB18060"></A> assistance upon request in order to assist the U.S. government in understanding the 
product's internal operations, thereby providing assurance that the product<A NAME = "AO180106"></A><A NAME = "AS180107"></A> complies with conditions required for export<A NAME = "AB180120"></A> jurisdiction 
under the CCL; appropriate<A NAME = "AO180132"></A><A NAME = "AS180133"></A><A NAME = "AS180134"></A> nondisclosure<A NAME = "AB180137"></A> agreements would protect vendors' interests in proprietary<A NAME = "BB180152"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF7346"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> information embedded in their 
products.  This requirement<A NAME = "AO180168"></A><A NAME = "AS180169"></A><A NAME = "AS180170"></A> would also allow more cost-effective use of intelligence<A NAME = "AB180189"></A> budgets for understanding the design of exported<A NAME = "AB180204"></A> 
cryptographic systems.<BR>



<P><li>  The level<A NAME = "AO1825"></A><A NAME = "AS1826"></A><A NAME = "AS1827"></A><A NAME = "AS1828"></A> of cryptographic<A NAME = "AB18213"></A> strength that determines the threshold of easy exportability<A NAME = "AB18230"></A> should be set at a level that promotes
 the broad use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB18258"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB18843"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> and should be adjusted upward periodically as technology evolves.<BR>



<P><li>  Public<A NAME = "AO1843"></A><A NAME = "AS1844"></A><A NAME = "AS1845"></A><A NAME = "AS1846"></A><A NAME = "AS1847"></A><A NAME = "AS1848"></A><A NAME = "AB1849"></A>-key protection of secret keys used by products covered by Recommendation<A NAME = "BB18432"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB186143"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.1 should be allowed that is at least as 
strong as the cryptographic<A NAME = "AB18460"></A> protection of message or file text provided by those products, with appropriate safety<A NAME = "AB18487"></A> margins that 
protect against possible attacks on these public<A NAME = "AB184107"></A>-key algorithms.<BR>



<P>The committee believes that today, products<A NAME = "AO18611"></A> that incorporate 56-bit DES for confidentiality meet most general commercial 
requirements and thus should be easily exportable.  The ability<A NAME = "AO18653"></A><A NAME = "AS18654"></A> to use 56-bit DES abroad will significantly enhance the confidentiality 
available to U.S. multinational corporations conducting business overseas with foreign partners, suppliers, and customers and improve the
 choice of products with encryption<A NAME = "BB186123"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB186179"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities available to domestic users.  Furthermore, Recommendation<A NAME = "AO186138"></A><A NAME = "AS186139"></A><A NAME = "AS186140"></A><A NAME = "AS186141"></A><A NAME = "AS186142"></A><A NAME = "BB186143"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB192417"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.1 will help the 
United<A NAME = "BB186155"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB18850"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States to maintain its worldwide market<A NAME = "AB186168"></A> leadership in products with encryption<A NAME = "BB186179"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB202126"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities.  The committee<A NAME = "AO186186"></A><A NAME = "AS186187"></A><A NAME = "AS186188"></A> believes that many 
foreign customers unwilling to overlook the perceived weaknesses of 40-bit RC2/RC4 encryption<A NAME = "BB186226"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB19632"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, despite superior noncryptography 
features in U.S. information technology products, are likely to accept DES<A NAME = "AB186256"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB186290"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>-based encryption as being adequate.  Global<A NAME = "AO186269"></A><A NAME = "AS186270"></A><A NAME = "AS186271"></A><A NAME = "AS186272"></A><A NAME = "AS186273"></A><A NAME = "AS186274"></A> market acceptance
 of U.S. products incorporating DES<A NAME = "BB186290"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF186256"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>-based encryption is more conducive to U.S. national<A NAME = "BB186307"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24363"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security interests in intelligence<A NAME = "AB186316"></A> 
collection than is market<A NAME = "AB186326"></A> acceptance of foreign products incorporating even stronger algorithm and key size combinations that might emerge
 to fill the vacuum if U.S. export<A NAME = "BB186372"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB229229"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> controls were not relaxed.<BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO1883"></A><A NAME = "AS1884"></A><A NAME = "AS1885"></A> believes that DES is appropriate because it has gained widespread acceptance as a standard for secret-key 
cryptography<A NAME = "BB18843"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB202217"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> within the United<A NAME = "BB18850"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB190253"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States and throughout the world.  DES provides many benefits, including a significantly higher level of 
confidentiality protection than that of 40-bit RC2/RC4 encryption, certification by the U.S. government as a high-quality solution for 
nonclassified security problems, the unavailability of practical methods to undertake cryptanalytic attacks on it other than exhaustive key 
search, freedom from intellectual property concerns and royalty arrangements, and high name recognition among both product vendors and
 users.  The bottom<A NAME = "AO188207"></A><A NAME = "AS188208"></A> line for the committee is that DES is &quot;good enough&quot; for most information security<A NAME = "AB188239"></A> applications and 
is likely to be good enough for the next decade, because only the most highly<A NAME = "AO188275"></A> motivated and well-funded organizations will be 
capable of sustaining brute-force attacks on DES during that time.<BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO1903"></A> recognizes that a replacement for DES will eventually be needed in the not-so-distant future.  Thus, product<A NAME = "AO19040"></A><A NAME = "AS19041"></A> 
designers and users would be well advised to anticipate the need for future products using a DES<A NAME = "AB19077"></A> replacement to be compatible with the 
products they develop today.  However, for today, only DES has the record<A NAME = "AO190115"></A><A NAME = "AS190116"></A><A NAME = "AS190117"></A> of public<A NAME = "BB190122"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF12989"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> scrutiny and practical experience that is necessary 
to engender public<A NAME = "BB190144"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF129139"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> confidence, and waiting for a replacement to achieve such a record will leave many of today's information 
vulnerabilities without a viable remedy.  Adopting DES as today's standard will do much to relieve<A NAME = "AO190210"></A><A NAME = "AS190211"></A><A NAME = "AS190212"></A> pressures on the export<A NAME = "BB190221"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB192307"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> control regime 
stemming from commercial users needing to improve security, and will give the United<A NAME = "BB190253"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB196179"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States and other nations time to formulate a long-
term global solution.<BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO1923"></A><A NAME = "AS1924"></A><A NAME = "AS1925"></A><A NAME = "AS1926"></A> recognizes that the adoption<A NAME = "AB19215"></A> of Recommendation 4.1 may have a negative<A NAME = "AB19230"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB192407"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> impact on the collection of signals<A NAME = "BB19243"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB192434"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
intelligence.  Much of the general<A NAME = "AO19255"></A><A NAME = "AS19256"></A> intelligence<A NAME = "AB19259"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490147"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> produced today depends heavily on the ability to monitor and select items of interest from 
the large volumes of communications sent in the clear.  If most of this traffic were encrypted, even at the levels allowed for 
liberal export today, the selection process would become vastly more difficult.  Increasing the threshold of liberal exportability from
 40-bit RC2/RC4 to 56-bit DES will not, in itself, add substantially to the difficulties of message selection.  Foreign<A NAME = "AO192217"></A><A NAME = "AS192218"></A><A NAME = "AS192219"></A><A NAME = "AS192220"></A> users of 
selected channels<A NAME = "AB192230"></A> of high-interest communications would, in many cases, not be expected to purchase and use U.S. encryption<A NAME = "BB192265"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB229238"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> products 
under any circumstances and thus in these cases would not be affected by a change in the U.S. export<A NAME = "BB192307"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB214249"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> control regime.  However, it is 
likely that the general use of 56-bit DES abroad will reduce the probability that potentially significant messages can be successfully
 decrypted.  Recommendation<A NAME = "AO192366"></A><A NAME = "AS192367"></A><A NAME = "AS192368"></A> 5 addresses measures that will help national<A NAME = "BB192383"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB214281"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security authorities to develop capabilities necessary 
to deal with the negative<A NAME = "BB192407"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB27342"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> impact that Recommendation<A NAME = "AO192414"></A><A NAME = "AS192415"></A><A NAME = "AS192416"></A><A NAME = "BB192417"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB210108"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.1 may have on the collection of signals<A NAME = "BB192434"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22773"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> intelligence.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation<A NAME = "AO1943"></A> </U>4.2--Products providing stronger confidentiality should be exportable on an expedited basis to a list of approved
 companies if the proposed product user is willing to provide access to decrypted information upon legally authorized request.</B><BR>



<P>Recommendation<A NAME = "AO1961"></A> 4.1 addresses the needs of most general commercial users.  Recognizing<A NAME = "AO19622"></A><A NAME = "AS19623"></A> the need for encryption<A NAME = "BB19632"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB19689"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> stronger than is 
currently available under the CCL, the Administration<A NAME = "AO19654"></A><A NAME = "AS19655"></A><A NAME = "AS19656"></A><A NAME = "AS19657"></A> has proposed to give liberal export<A NAME = "AB19670"></A> consideration to software<A NAME = "AB19677"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB37186"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> products with 64-bit 
encryption<A NAME = "BB19689"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB196147"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> provided that those products are escrowed with a qualified escrow agent.  The philosophy underlying this proposal<A NAME = "AO196122"></A><A NAME = "AS196123"></A><A NAME = "AS196124"></A><A NAME = "AS196125"></A><A NAME = "AS196126"></A><A NAME = "AS196127"></A> is that the 
wide foreign availability of strong encryption<A NAME = "BB196147"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB198100"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> will not significantly damage U.S. intelligence<A NAME = "BB196160"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF57309"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> gathering and law<A NAME = "AB196167"></A> enforcement efforts
 if the United<A NAME = "BB196179"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29565"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States can be assured of access to plaintext<A NAME = "AB196196"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB19870"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> when necessary.  Recommendation 4.2 builds on this philosophy to 
permit liberal export consideration of products with encryption capabilities stronger than that provided by 56-bit DES to users that 
are likely to be &quot;trustworthy,&quot; i.e., willing to cooperate in providing access to plaintext for U.S. law enforcement 
authorities when a legally authorized request is made to those companies.  Firms on the list of approved companies will determine for 
themselves how to assure access to plaintext; many of them may well choose to use escrowed encryption products, and they would be free to 
escrow the relevant keys with agents situated within the firm itself.<BR>



<P>From the standpoint<A NAME = "AO1985"></A><A NAME = "AS1986"></A><A NAME = "AS1987"></A> of U.S. law<A NAME = "AB19814"></A> enforcement interests, continued inclusion on the list of approved firms is a powerful incentive
 for a company to abide by its agreement to provide access to plaintext<A NAME = "BB19870"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB210293"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> under the proper circumstances.  Recommendation<A NAME = "AO19881"></A><A NAME = "AS19882"></A><A NAME = "AS19883"></A><A NAME = "AS19884"></A> 4.2 also 
helps to promote escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB198100"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB198163"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> in foreign nations by facilitating the deployment in those nations of a base of products on 
which the governments<A NAME = "AB198140"></A> of the relevant nations may build policy regimes supporting escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB198163"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22942"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>.  Finally, it hastens<A NAME = "AO198170"></A><A NAME = "AS198171"></A><A NAME = "AS198172"></A><A NAME = "AS198173"></A><A NAME = "AS198174"></A> the 
deployment of escrowed<A NAME = "BB198184"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22958"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption in other countries because the shipment of escrowed<A NAME = "AB198203"></A> encryption products need not be delayed until the 
completion of formal agreements regarding the transfer of escrowed<A NAME = "AB198239"></A> keys across international<A NAME = "BB198246"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF140119"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> boundaries.  <BR>



<P>U.S<A NAME = "AO2001"></A><A NAME = "AS2002"></A>. vendors benefit from Recommendation<A NAME = "AB20011"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB200135"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.2 because the foreign customers on the list of approved companies need not wait for 
the successful negotiation of formal agreements.  Furthermore, a potential customer of U.S. products that objects to Administration
 proposals on export of escrowed encryption on the grounds that its cryptographic<A NAME = "AO200102"></A><A NAME = "AS200103"></A><A NAME = "AS200104"></A><A NAME = "AB200105"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB275246"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> keys might be compromised can be reassured that
 keys to products covered by Recommendation<A NAME = "BB200135"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20463"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.2 could remain within its full control; indeed, these customers benefit because 
they retain the choice about how they will provide access to decrypted information.<BR>



<P>What firms constitute the list of approved companies? Under current practice, it is generally the case that a U.S<A NAME = "AO20238"></A><A NAME = "AS20239"></A><A NAME = "AS20240"></A><A NAME = "AS20241"></A>.-controlled 
firm (i.e., a U.S. firm operating abroad, a U.S.-controlled foreign firm, or a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. firm) will be granted a 
USML<A NAME = "AB202101"></A> license to acquire and export for its own use products with encryption<A NAME = "BB202126"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB206108"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities stronger than that provided by 40-bit RC<A NAME = "AB202145"></A>2/
RC4 encryption.  Banks and financial institutions (including stock brokerages and insurance companies), whether U.S<A NAME = "AO202179"></A><A NAME = "AS202180"></A>.-controlled<A NAME = "AB202184"></A>/
owned or foreign-owned, are also generally granted<A NAME = "AO202202"></A><A NAME = "AS202203"></A><A NAME = "AS202204"></A><A NAME = "AS202205"></A> USML<A NAME = "AB202208"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB204113"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> licenses for stronger cryptography<A NAME = "BB202217"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB204120"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for use in internal communications and 
communications with other banks even if these communications are not limited strictly to banking<A NAME = "BB202259"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF170150"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> or money transactions.  Such licenses are 
granted on the basis of an individual review rather than through a categorical exemption from the USML.<BR>



<P>Building on this practice, the committee<A NAME = "AO20411"></A><A NAME = "AS20412"></A><A NAME = "AS20413"></A> believes that this category should be expanded so that a U.S.-controlled firm is able 
to acquire and export<A NAME = "AB20454"></A> products covered under Recommendation<A NAME = "BB20463"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB204146"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.2 to its foreign suppliers and customers for the purpose of regular 
communications with the U.S.-controlled firm.  A number<A NAME = "AO204106"></A><A NAME = "AS204107"></A><A NAME = "AS204108"></A> of USML<A NAME = "BB204113"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF202208"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> licenses for cryptography<A NAME = "BB204120"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB21243"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> have implemented just such an arrangement, but the 
purpose<A NAME = "AO204140"></A><A NAME = "AS204141"></A> of Recommendation<A NAME = "BB204146"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF20011"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.2 is to make these arrangements far more systematic and routine.<BR>



<P>In addition, foreign<A NAME = "AO2065"></A> firms specifically determined by U.S. authorities to be major and trustworthy firms should qualify for the 
list of approved companies.  To minimize delay for U.S. information technology vendors and to help assure their competitiveness with
 foreign vendors, a list<A NAME = "AO20686"></A><A NAME = "AS20687"></A> of these firms eligible for purchasing U.S. products with encryption<A NAME = "BB206108"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB229199"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities and/or the criteria 
for inclusion on the list should be made available upon request.  Over time, it would be expected that the criteria would grow to 
be more inclusive so that more companies would qualify.<BR>



<P>Recommendation 4.2 is silent on whether companies must periodically requalify for the list; however, a refusal<A NAME = "AO20831"></A> or inability to 
cooperate when required might well result in a company being dropped from the list and publicly identified as a noncooperating company, 
and subject the parties involved to the full range of sanctions that are available today to enforce compliance of product 
recipients with end-use restrictions.<BR>

Over the past 50 years, both law<A NAME = "AO23913"></A><A NAME = "AS23914"></A><A NAME = "AS23915"></A><A NAME = "AS23916"></A><A NAME = "BB23917"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB239111"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB23924"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB29969"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security authorities have had to cope with a variety of changing 
technological<A NAME = "AB23950"></A> circumstances.  For the most part, they have coped with these changes quite well.  Today, however, an explosion<A NAME = "AO23985"></A><A NAME = "AS23986"></A><A NAME = "AS23987"></A><A NAME = "AS23988"></A><A NAME = "AB23989"></A> of advanced 
information technologies is creating new challenges to law<A NAME = "BB239111"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB239151"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB239118"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB239158"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security.  &quot;Business as usual&quot; will not<A NAME = "AO239133"></A><A NAME = "AS239134"></A><A NAME = "AS239135"></A> 
suffice to bring agencies responsible for law<A NAME = "BB239151"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB239184"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB239158"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB239192"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security into the information age.  At the same time, both law<A NAME = "AO239181"></A><A NAME = "AS239182"></A><A NAME = "AS239183"></A><A NAME = "BB239184"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24356"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB239192"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB249196"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security have demonstrated considerable adaptability to new environments; this record of adaptability provides 
considerable confidence that they can adapt to a future of digital communications and stored data as well, and the specific 
subrecommendations that follow attempt to build on this adaptability.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation </U>5.1--The U.S<A NAME = "AO24110"></A><A NAME = "AS24111"></A>. government should actively encourage the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB24128"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24313"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> in nonconfidentiality applications 
such as user authentication and integrity checks.</B><BR>



<P>The nonconfidentiality<A NAME = "AO2433"></A><A NAME = "AS2434"></A><A NAME = "AS2435"></A><A NAME = "AS2436"></A> applications of cryptography<A NAME = "BB24313"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB243121"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> (e.g., digital signatures, authentication and access controls, 
nonrepudiation, secure time/date stamps, integrity checks) do not directly threaten law<A NAME = "BB24356"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB259116"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement or national<A NAME = "BB24363"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF146199"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security interests and do not 
in general pose the same policy dilemma as confidentiality does.  Since the deployment<A NAME = "AO243101"></A><A NAME = "AS243102"></A><A NAME = "AS243103"></A> of infrastructures for the 
nonconfidentiality uses of cryptography<A NAME = "BB243121"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB243148"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB243148"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB243240"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for confidentiality, the 
nation may take large steps in this area without having to resolve the policy dilemmas over confidentiality, confident that those 
steps will be beneficial to the nation in their own right.  Policy<A NAME = "AO243221"></A><A NAME = "AS243222"></A> can and should promote nonconfidentiality applications of 
cryptography<A NAME = "BB243240"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24573"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> in all relevant areas.<BR>



<P>One<A NAME = "AO2451"></A> of the most important of these areas concerns protection against systemic national vulnerabilities.  Indeed, in areas in 
which confidence in and availability of a national information network are most critical, nonconfidentiality<A NAME = "AO24565"></A><A NAME = "AS24566"></A> uses of cryptography<A NAME = "BB24573"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB247234"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> are
 even more important than are capabilities for confidentiality.  For example, ensuring<A NAME = "AO24599"></A><A NAME = "AS245100"></A> the integrity of data that circulates in 
the air<A NAME = "BB245120"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF4156"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> traffic control system is almost certainly more important than ensuring its confidentiality; ensuring<A NAME = "AO245147"></A><A NAME = "AS245148"></A> the integrity (
accuracy) of data in the banking<A NAME = "AB245168"></A> system is often more important than ensuring its confidentiality.  (This is not to say that 
confidentiality plays no role in protecting national information systems from unauthorized penetration.  Cryptographically provided 
confidentiality can be one important (though secondary) dimension of protecting information systems from unauthorized penetration.)<BR>



<P>Nonconfidentiality applications of cryptography support reliable user authentication.  Authentication of users is an important 
crime-fighting measure, because authentication is the antithesis of anonymity.  Nonconfidentiality applications of cryptography 
support reliable integrity checks on data; used properly, they can help to reduce crimes that result from the alteration of data (such 
as changing the payable amount on a check).  To date, national<A NAME = "AO247126"></A><A NAME = "AS247127"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB247130"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26748"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy has not fully supported such nonconfidentiality
 uses.  Some actions have been taken in this area, but these actions have sometimes conflicted with government concerns about 
confidentiality.  As importantly, government<A NAME = "AO247193"></A><A NAME = "AS247194"></A><A NAME = "AS247195"></A> has expressed considerably more concern in the public<A NAME = "BB247212"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB46428"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> debate regarding the deleterious impact of 
widespread use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB247234"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24931"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for confidentiality than over the deleterious impact of not deploying cryptographic capabilities for user 
authentication and data integrity.  <BR>



<P>A final<A NAME = "AO2493"></A><A NAME = "AS2494"></A> dimension of this issue is that keys used in nonconfidentiality applications of cryptography<A NAME = "BB24931"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB28929"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, especially ones that 
support established and essential business practices or legal constructs (e.g., digital signatures, authentication, integrity checks), 
must be controlled solely by the immediate and intended parties to those applications.  Without such assurances, outside<A NAME = "AO249107"></A><A NAME = "AS249108"></A> access to 
such keys could undermine the legal basis and threaten the integrity of these practices carried out in the electronic<A NAME = "AB249152"></A> domain.  
Whatever<A NAME = "AO249158"></A><A NAME = "AS249159"></A><A NAME = "AS249160"></A><A NAME = "AS249161"></A><A NAME = "AS249162"></A><A NAME = "AS249163"></A> benefits might accrue to government<A NAME = "AB249174"></A> authorities acting in the interests of public<A NAME = "BB249189"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40180"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> safety or national<A NAME = "BB249196"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB285175"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security from being able 
to forge digital<A NAME = "AB249212"></A> signatures or alter digital<A NAME = "AB249221"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB59467"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> data clandestinely would pale by comparison to the loss of trust in such mechanisms 
that would result from even a hint that such activities were possible.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation </U>5.2--The U.S<A NAME = "AO25110"></A><A NAME = "AS25111"></A>. government should promote the security<A NAME = "AB25122"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35620"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> of the telecommunications networks more actively.  At a 
minimum, the U.S<A NAME = "AO25146"></A><A NAME = "AS25147"></A><A NAME = "AS25148"></A>. government should promote the link encryption<A NAME = "AB25161"></A> of cellular communications</B>[3] <B>and the improvement of security at 
telephone<A NAME = "AB25188"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB2577"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> switches.</B><BR>



<P>The public<A NAME = "AO2533"></A><A NAME = "AS2534"></A> switched telecommunications<A NAME = "BB2539"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB261109"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> network (PSTN) is both critical to many sectors of the national economy and is undergoing
 rapid evolution.  While the U.S<A NAME = "AO25353"></A><A NAME = "AS25354"></A>. government has taken some steps to improve the security<A NAME = "AB25373"></A> of the PSTN, much more could be done 
based on the regulatory authority that the U.S. government has in this area.<BR>



<P>The encryption<A NAME = "AO2553"></A><A NAME = "AS2554"></A><A NAME = "AB2555"></A> of wireless voice communications would prevent eavesdropping that is all too easy in today's largely analog 
cellular telephone market.  As wireless<A NAME = "AO25549"></A><A NAME = "AS25550"></A> communications shift from analog to digital<A NAME = "AB25563"></A> modes of transport, encryption<A NAME = "AO25572"></A><A NAME = "AS25573"></A><A NAME = "BB25574"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26539"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> will become easier 
even as the traffic itself becomes harder to understand.  A requirement<A NAME = "AO255104"></A><A NAME = "AS255105"></A> to encrypt wireless communications may also accelerate the 
shift to wireless modes of digital<A NAME = "AB255135"></A> transport.  However, because of the cost of retrofitting existing cellular services, this 
recommendation is intended to apply only to the deployment of future cellular services.<BR>



<P>Security<A NAME = "AO2571"></A><A NAME = "AS2572"></A> in telephone<A NAME = "BB2577"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35680"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> switches could be improved in many ways.  For example, a requirement for adequate authentication to access
 such switches would prevent unauthorized access from maintenance ports; such ports often provide remote access to all switch 
functions, a level of access equal to what could be obtained by an individual standing in the control center.  Yet such ports are often 
protected with nothing more than a single password.  Telecommunications<A NAME = "AO257145"></A><A NAME = "AS257146"></A><A NAME = "AS257147"></A><A NAME = "AS257148"></A><A NAME = "AB257149"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25913"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> service providers could also provide services for link encryption<A NAME = "AB257168"></A>
 of traffic on wired landlines<A NAME = "AB257180"></A>.<BR>



<P>By addressing<A NAME = "AO2593"></A><A NAME = "AS2594"></A><A NAME = "AS2595"></A><A NAME = "AS2596"></A> through the telecommunications<A NAME = "BB25913"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490210"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> service providers public<A NAME = "AB25920"></A> demands for greater security in voice<A NAME = "AB25933"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26196"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> communications (
especially those such as cellular telephone traffic) that are widely known to be nonsecure, government<A NAME = "AO25969"></A><A NAME = "AS25970"></A><A NAME = "AS25971"></A><A NAME = "AS25972"></A> would maintain law<A NAME = "BB25979"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB259259"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement 
access for lawfully authorized wiretaps<A NAME = "AB25993"></A> through the requirements imposed on carriers today to cooperate with law<A NAME = "BB259116"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26154"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement in such 
matters.  For example, a cellular<A NAME = "AO259134"></A><A NAME = "AS259135"></A><A NAME = "AB259136"></A> telephone connects to the PSTN through a ground station; since, in general, the cellular<A NAME = "AO259165"></A><A NAME = "AS259166"></A><A NAME = "AS259167"></A><A NAME = "AB259168"></A> telephone 
service provider must feed its traffic to the PSTN in unencrypted<A NAME = "AB259194"></A> form, encrypted<A NAME = "AO259199"></A><A NAME = "AS259200"></A> cellular<A NAME = "AB259203"></A> telephone traffic from the mobile handset 
would be decrypted at the ground station, at which point law enforcement could gain authorized access.  Thus, legitimate<A NAME = "AO259253"></A><A NAME = "AS259254"></A><A NAME = "AS259255"></A><A NAME = "AS259256"></A> law<A NAME = "BB259259"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF7382"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
enforcement access would not, in general, be impeded by link encryption<A NAME = "AB259283"></A> of cellular traffic until communications<A NAME = "AB259294"></A> systems that bypass the 
PSTN entirely become common.  <BR>



<P>Recommendation 5.2 is an instance of a general philosophy that link<A NAME = "AO26121"></A><A NAME = "AS26122"></A> (or node) security provided by a service provider offers 
more opportunities for providing law<A NAME = "BB26154"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB263102"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement with legally authorized access than does security provided by the end user.  In the
 case<A NAME = "AO26188"></A><A NAME = "AS26189"></A><A NAME = "AS26190"></A><A NAME = "AS26191"></A> of voice<A NAME = "BB26196"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB261118"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> communications, improved security over the telecommunications<A NAME = "BB261109"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32480"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> network used for voice<A NAME = "BB261118"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26311"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> communications and provided 
by the owners and operators of that network--a good thing in its own right and consistent with the basic principle of this report
--would also reduce the demand for (and thus the availability of) devices<A NAME = "AO261201"></A><A NAME = "AS261202"></A> used to provide end-to-end encryption<A NAME = "AB261217"></A> of voice 
communications.  Without a ready supply of such devices, a criminal<A NAME = "AO261243"></A><A NAME = "AS261244"></A> user would have to go to considerable trouble to obtain a device that 
could thwart a lawfully authorized wiretap<A NAME = "AB261284"></A>.<BR>



<P>Recommendation<A NAME = "AO2631"></A><A NAME = "AS2632"></A> 5.2 focuses on voice<A NAME = "BB26311"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF25933"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> communications given that for the foreseeable future, voice<A NAME = "AO26328"></A> is likely to be the most common 
form of communication used by the general public (and hence by criminals as well).  The committee<A NAME = "AO26378"></A><A NAME = "AS26379"></A><A NAME = "AS26380"></A> recognizes that data 
communications will pose certain problems for law<A NAME = "BB263102"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB277192"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement, and this is the focus of Recommendation<A NAME = "AB263119"></A> 5.3.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation </U>5.3--To better understand how escrowed encryption might operate, the U.S<A NAME = "AO26526"></A><A NAME = "AS26527"></A>. government should explore escrowed 
encryption<A NAME = "BB26539"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26725"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for its own uses.  To address the critical international dimensions of escrowed communications, the U.S. government should work
 with other nations on this topic.</B><BR>



<P>As noted above, the U.S<A NAME = "AO2679"></A><A NAME = "AS26710"></A><A NAME = "AS26711"></A><A NAME = "AS26712"></A>. government has aggressively promoted escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB26725"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26758"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> as a pillar of the technical<A NAME = "BB26738"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF22973"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> foundation for 
national cryptography<A NAME = "BB26748"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB285190"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy.  Escrowed<A NAME = "AO26753"></A><A NAME = "AS26754"></A><A NAME = "AS26755"></A> encryption<A NAME = "BB26758"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB283211"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> has both benefits and risks from a public<A NAME = "AB26775"></A> policy standpoint (<A HREF="2816.html">Box 5</A>).  The committee<A NAME = "AO26792"></A><A NAME = "AS26793"></A> 
believes that many policy benefits can be gained by an operational<A NAME = "AB267117"></A> exploration of escrowed encryption by the U.S. government, but also 
that aggressive promotion of the concept is not appropriate at this time for several reasons:<BR>

THE PRINCE
<P>

by Nicolo Machiavelli
<P>

translated by W. K. Marriott
<P>

<h3>CHAPTER I
<P>

HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE,

AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED</h3>
<P>

<P>

ALL STATES, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have
<P>

been and are either republics or principalities.
<P>

Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been
<P>

long established; or they are new.
<P>

The new are either entirely new, as was Milan<A NAME = "AS1219"></A><A NAME = "AB1220"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6926"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> to Francesco Sforza,
<P>

or they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of
<P>

the prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom<A NAME = "AS1421"></A> of Naples<A NAME = "AB1426"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24724"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> to that

<P>

of the King<A NAME = "AS157"></A><A NAME = "AB158"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24812"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Spain.
<P>

Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a
<P>

prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms
<P>

of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.

<P>

<h3>CHAPTER II
<P>

CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES</h3>
<P>

<P>

I WILL leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another
<P>

place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only
<P>

to principalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated
<P>

above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and
<P>

preserved.
<P>

I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary

therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful. 
<P>

Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above 
<P>

respects ought to make himself the head and defender of his powerful 
<P>

neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking 
<P>

care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any 
<P>

accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a 
<P>

one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through

Romans<A NAME = "AO1573"></A><A NAME = "AS1574"></A> were brought into Greece<A NAME = "BB15713"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB1758"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> by the Aetolians; and in every other 
<P>

country where they obtained a footing they were brought in by the 
<P>

inhabitants. And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a 
<P>

powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are 
<P>

drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling 
<P>

power. So that in respect to these subject states he has not to take 
<P>

any trouble to gain them over to himself, for the whole of them 
<P>

quickly rally to the state which he has acquired there. He has only to 

<P>

take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much 
<P>

authority, and then with his own forces, and with their goodwill, he 
<P>

can easily keep down the more powerful of them, so as to remain 
<P>

entirely master in the country. And he who does not properly manage 
<P>

this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and whilst he 
<P>

does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles. 
<P>

The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely 
<P>

these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations 
<P>

with the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept 
<P>

down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to 
<P>

gain authority. Greece<A NAME = "AS1757"></A><A NAME = "BB1758"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20026"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> appears to me sufficient for an example. The 
<P>

Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of 
<P>

Macedonia<A NAME = "AS1773"></A><A NAME = "AB1774"></A> was humbled, Antiochus<A NAME = "AS17711"></A><A NAME = "AB17712"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20021"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> was driven out; yet the merits of the 

<P>

Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for them permission to increase

There are many laws regulating variation, some few of which can be dimly
seen, and will be hereafter briefly mentioned. I will here only allude to
what may be called correlation of growth. Any change<A NAME = "AO2970"></A> in the embryo or larva
will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. In monstrosities<A NAME = "AS29103"></A><A NAME = "BB29104"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF24105"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many
instances<A NAME = "AO29130"></A><A NAME = "AS29131"></A> are given in Isidore<A NAME = "AB29140"></A> Geoffroy St Hilaire's great work on this
subject. Breeders<A NAME = "AO29159"></A> believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by
an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical; thus
cats<A NAME = "AO29202"></A> with blue eyes are invariably deaf; colour<A NAME = "AO29217"></A><A NAME = "AS29218"></A> and constitutional<A NAME = "AB29223"></A>
peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable cases<A NAME = "AO29240"></A> could be given
amongst animals and plants. From the facts<A NAME = "AO29261"></A> collected by Heusinger, it
appears<A NAME = "AO29272"></A><A NAME = "AS29273"></A><A NAME = "AS29274"></A><A NAME = "AS29275"></A> that white sheep<A NAME = "AB29282"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB3891"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and pigs<A NAME = "AB29287"></A> are differently affected from coloured
individuals by certain vegetable<A NAME = "AB29306"></A> poisons. Hairless<A NAME = "AO29311"></A><A NAME = "AS29312"></A><A NAME = "AB29313"></A> dogs have imperfect teeth
; long<A NAME = "AO29325"></A>-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted,
long or many horns; pigeons<A NAME = "AO29361"></A><A NAME = "AS29362"></A><A NAME = "BB29363"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB29386"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> with feathered feet have skin between their
outer toes; pigeons<A NAME = "AO29384"></A><A NAME = "AS29385"></A><A NAME = "BB29386"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4139"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> with short beaks have small feet, and those with long
beaks large feet. Hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any
peculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of
the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth.
<p>
The result<A NAME = "AO304"></A><A NAME = "AS305"></A> of the various, quite unknown, or dimly seen laws<A NAME = "AB3024"></A> of variation is
infinitely complex and diversified. It is well<A NAME = "AO3045"></A> worth while carefully to
study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants,
as on the hyacinth<A NAME = "AS3087"></A><A NAME = "AB3088"></A>, potato<A NAME = "AS3091"></A><A NAME = "AB3092"></A>, even the dahlia<A NAME = "AS3099"></A><A NAME = "AB30100"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB62148"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, &amp;c.; and it is really
surprising<A NAME = "AO30115"></A><A NAME = "AS30116"></A> to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which
the varieties and sub<A NAME = "AB30147"></A> varieties differ slightly from each other. The whole<A NAME = "AO30164"></A>
organization seems to have become plastic, and tends to depart in some small
degree from that of the parental type.<p>
Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the number<A NAME = "AS3126"></A>
and diversity<A NAME = "AB3131"></A> of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight
and those of considerable physiological importance, is endless. Dr<A NAME = "AO3168"></A><A NAME = "AS3169"></A><A NAME = "AB3170"></A> Prosper
Lucas's treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this
subject. No<A NAME = "AO31105"></A> breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance: like
produces like is his fundamental belief: doubts<A NAME = "AO31140"></A> have been thrown on this
principle by theoretical writers alone. When a deviation<A NAME = "AO31167"></A> appears not
unfrequently, and we see it in the father and child, we cannot tell whether
it may not be due to the same original cause acting on both; but when
amongst individuals<A NAME = "AO31234"></A>, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very
rare<A NAME = "AO31253"></A> deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances,
appears in the parent say, once amongst several million individuals and it
reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to
attribute its reappearance to inheritance. Every<A NAME = "AO31333"></A><A NAME = "AS31334"></A> one must have heard of
cases of albinism<A NAME = "AB31351"></A>, prickly skin, hairy bodies, &amp;c. appearing in several
members of the same family. If strange and rare<A NAME = "AO31387"></A><A NAME = "AS31388"></A> deviations of structure are
truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted
to be inheritable<A NAME = "AB31425"></A>. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject,
would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the
rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.<p>
The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no<A NAME = "AO3216"></A> one can say why the
same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, and in
individuals of different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not
so; why the child<A NAME = "AO3277"></A> often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or
grandmother or other much more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity<A NAME = "AO32116"></A> is often
transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to one sex alone, more commonly
but not exclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of some little importance
to us, that peculiarities<A NAME = "AO32187"></A> appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are
often transmitted either exclusively, or in a much greater degree, to males
alone. A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at
whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to appear in
the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many
cases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited<A NAME = "AO32326"></A><A NAME = "AS32327"></A> peculiarities in the
horns<A NAME = "AB32336"></A> of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature;
peculiarities<A NAME = "AO32362"></A><A NAME = "AS32363"></A><A NAME = "AS32364"></A> in the silkworm<A NAME = "AB32371"></A> are known to appear at the corresponding
caterpillar or cocoon<A NAME = "AB32392"></A> stage. But hereditary<A NAME = "AO32399"></A> diseases and some other facts
make me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that when there is
no<A NAME = "AO32442"></A> apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age,
yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which
it first appeared in the parent. I believe<A NAME = "AO32514"></A><A NAME = "AS32515"></A> this rule to be of the highest
importance in explaining the laws<A NAME = "AB32540"></A> of embryology. These remarks<A NAME = "AO32549"></A> are of course
confined to the first <I>appearance</I> of the peculiarity, and not to its
primary cause, which may have acted on the ovules or male element; in nearly
the same<A NAME = "AS32614"></A> manner as in the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow<A NAME = "AB32637"></A> by a
long-horned bull, the greater length of horn, though appearing late in life,
is clearly due to the male element.<p>
Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement
often made by naturalists namely, that our domestic varieties, when run
wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal
stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from
domestic races to species in a state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured
to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so
boldly been made. There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we
may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly<A NAME = "AO33198"></A>-marked domestic
varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we do not
know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not
nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be quite necessary, in order
to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single<A NAME = "AO33305"></A> variety should
be turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties<A NAME = "AO33332"></A><A NAME = "AS33333"></A> certainly do
occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral<A NAME = "AB33356"></A> forms, it seems
to me not improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to
cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the
cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect would have
to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil), that they would to
a large<A NAME = "AO33475"></A><A NAME = "AS33476"></A> extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal<A NAME = "AB33495"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB38175"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> stock. Whether
or not the experiment would succeed, is not of great importance for our line
of argument; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are
changed. If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a
strong tendency to reversion, that is, to lose their acquired characters,
whilst kept under unchanged conditions, and whilst kept in a considerable
body, so that free<A NAME = "AO33629"></A> intercrossing might check, by blending together, any
slight deviations of structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce
nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a
shadow of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not<A NAME = "AO33724"></A><A NAME = "AS33725"></A> breed
our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle and poultry<A NAME = "AB33752"></A> of
various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number of
generations, would be opposed to all experience. I may add, that when under
nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of
character probably do occur; but natural<A NAME = "AS33837"></A><A NAME = "AB33838"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB64140"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> selection, as will hereafter be
explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be
preserved.<p>
When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals
and plants, and compare them with species closely allied together, we
generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less
uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic<A NAME = "AO3484"></A> races of the same
species, also, often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean,
that, although differing<A NAME = "AO34124"></A> from each other, and from the other species of the
same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme
degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more
especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are
nearest allied. With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect
fertility of varieties when crossed, a subject hereafter to be discussed),
domestic<A NAME = "AO34270"></A> races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner
as, only in most cases in a lesser degree than, do closely-allied species of
the same genus in a state of nature. I think this must be admitted, when we
find that there are hardly any domestic races, either amongst animals or
plants, which have not been ranked<A NAME = "AO34395"></A> by some competent judges as mere
varieties, and by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally
distinct species. If any marked<A NAME = "AO34440"></A> distinction existed between domestic races
and species, this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur. It has
often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in
characters of generic value. I think it could be shown that this statement
is hardly correct; but naturalists differ most widely in determining what
characters are of generic value; all such valuations being at present
empirical. Moreover, on the view of the origin of genera which I shall
presently give, we have no right to expect often to meet with generic
differences in our domesticated productions.<p>
When we attempt<A NAME = "AO356"></A> to estimate the amount of structural difference between the
domestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt, from not
knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent-species. This
point, if could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for instance, it
could be shown<A NAME = "AO35109"></A><A NAME = "AS35110"></A><A NAME = "AS35111"></A><A NAME = "AS35112"></A> that the greyhound<A NAME = "AB35119"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB52142"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, bloodhound, terrier<A NAME = "AB35124"></A>, spaniel<A NAME = "AB35127"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB58457"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and bul
l-dog, which we all know propagate their kind so truly, were the offspring
of any single species, then such facts<A NAME = "AO35174"></A><A NAME = "AS35175"></A> would have great weight in making us
doubt about the immutability<A NAME = "AB35198"></A> of the many very closely allied and natural
species for instance, of the many foxes<A NAME = "AS35229"></A><A NAME = "AB35230"></A> inhabiting different quarters of the
world. I do not<A NAME = "AO35249"></A><A NAME = "AS35250"></A> believe, as we shall presently see, that all our dogs<A NAME = "AB35271"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB3868"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have
descended from any one wild species; but, in the case of some other domestic
races, there is presumptive, or even strong, evidence in favour of this
view.<p>
It has often been assumed<A NAME = "AO3610"></A><A NAME = "AS3611"></A> that man has chosen for domestication<A NAME = "AB3624"></A> animals and
plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to
withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these capacities have
added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions; but how
could a savage<A NAME = "AO36105"></A> possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it
would vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other
climates? Has the little<A NAME = "AS36157"></A><A NAME = "AS36158"></A> variability of the ass or guinea-fowl, or the small
power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer<A NAME = "AB36195"></A>, or of cold by the common
camel<A NAME = "AB36210"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB52416"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, prevented their domestication? I cannot doubt that if other animals
and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and belonging
to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state of nature,
and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under
domestication, they would vary on an average as largely as the parent<A NAME = "AO36331"></A>
species of our existing domesticated productions have varied.<p>
In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, I do
not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they
have descended from one or several species. The argument mainly relied on by
those who believe<A NAME = "AS3786"></A> in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is, that we
find in the most ancient records, more especially on the monuments of Egypt<A NAME = "AB37135"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB37396"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
much diversity in the breeds; and that some of the breeds closely resemble,
perhaps are identical with, those still existing. Even if this latter<A NAME = "AO37186"></A> fact
were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case,
what does it show, but that some of our breeds originated there, four or
five thousand years ago? But Mr<A NAME = "AO37261"></A>. Horner's researches have rendered it in some
degree probable that man<A NAME = "AO37284"></A><A NAME = "AS37285"></A><A NAME = "AS37286"></A> sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery<A NAME = "AB37299"></A>
existed in the valley of the Nile<A NAME = "AB37314"></A> thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago;
and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods, savages,
like those of Tierra del Fuego or Australia, who possess a semi-domestic
dog, may not have existed<A NAME = "AS37391"></A> in Egypt<A NAME = "BB37396"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF37135"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>?<p>
The whole subject must, I think, remain vague; nevertheless, I may, without
here entering on any details, state that, from geographical and other
considerations, I think it highly probable that our domestic<A NAME = "AO3864"></A><A NAME = "AS3865"></A> dogs<A NAME = "BB3868"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB39567"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have
descended from several wild species. In regard<A NAME = "AS3885"></A><A NAME = "AS3886"></A> to sheep<A NAME = "BB3891"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB39134"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and goats<A NAME = "BB3896"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB39142"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> I can form
no opinion. I should think, from facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on
the habits, voice, and constitution, &amp;c., of the humped Indian cattle,
that these had descended<A NAME = "AO38164"></A><A NAME = "AS38165"></A><A NAME = "AS38166"></A> from a different aboriginal<A NAME = "BB38175"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB5567"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> stock from our European<A NAME = "AB38184"></A>
cattle; and several<A NAME = "AO38191"></A> competent judges believe that these latter have had more
than one wild parent. With respect<A NAME = "AS38222"></A> to horses<A NAME = "AB38227"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB57241"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, from reasons which I cannot
give here, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several
authors, that all the races have descended from one wild stock. Mr. Blyth,
whose opinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, I should value
more than that of almost any one, thinks<A NAME = "AO38331"></A><A NAME = "AS38332"></A><A NAME = "AS38333"></A> that all the breeds of poultry<A NAME = "AB38346"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB50346"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have
proceeded from the common wild Indian<A NAME = "AB38361"></A> fowl (Gallus bankiva). In regard<A NAME = "AS38374"></A><A NAME = "AS38375"></A> to
ducks<A NAME = "AB38380"></A> and rabbits<A NAME = "AB38385"></A>, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other
in structure, I do not doubt that they all have descended<A NAME = "AO38426"></A><A NAME = "AS38427"></A><A NAME = "AS38428"></A> from the common
wild duck<A NAME = "BB38439"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB50351"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and rabbit<A NAME = "AB38444"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB50356"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.<p>
The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several
aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors.
They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive
characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. At this rate<A NAME = "AO3997"></A> there
must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many sheep<A NAME = "AS39130"></A><A NAME = "AS39131"></A><A NAME = "AS39132"></A><A NAME = "AS39133"></A><A NAME = "BB39134"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB39304"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
and several goats<A NAME = "BB39142"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF28221"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> in Europe<A NAME = "AB39147"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB39333"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> alone, and several even within Great<A NAME = "AB39160"></A> Britain.
One<A NAME = "AO39166"></A><A NAME = "AS39167"></A> author believes that there formerly existed in Great<A NAME = "AB39184"></A> Britain eleven wild
species of sheep peculiar to it! When we bear in mind that Britain<A NAME = "AO39218"></A><A NAME = "AS39219"></A><A NAME = "AS39220"></A><A NAME = "AB39221"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB59208"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has now
hardly one peculiar mammal, and France<A NAME = "AB39238"></A> but few distinct from those of
Germany<A NAME = "AS39253"></A><A NAME = "AB39254"></A> and conversely, and so with Hungary<A NAME = "AS39267"></A><A NAME = "AS39268"></A><A NAME = "AS39269"></A><A NAME = "AB39270"></A>, Spain<A NAME = "AB39273"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB58667"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, &amp;c., but that each
of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep<A NAME = "BB39304"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB5379"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, &amp;
c., we must admit<A NAME = "AS39316"></A> that many domestic breeds have originated in Europe<A NAME = "BB39333"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4954"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>; for
whence could they have been derived, as these several<A NAME = "AO39354"></A> countries do not
possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? So it is in
India<A NAME = "AS39392"></A><A NAME = "AB39393"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB41109"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. Even in the case<A NAME = "AS39402"></A> of the domestic dogs<A NAME = "AB39411"></A> of the whole world, which I
fully admit have probably descended from several wild species, I cannot
doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation. Who can
believe<A NAME = "AO39474"></A><A NAME = "AS39475"></A> that animals closely resembling the Italian<A NAME = "AB39488"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB39675"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> greyhound, the
bloodhound, the bull<A NAME = "AO39499"></A><A NAME = "AS39500"></A>-dog, or Blenheim<A NAME = "AB39507"></A> spaniel, &amp;c. so unlike all wild
Canidae ever existed freely in a state of nature? It has often been loosely<A NAME = "AO39550"></A><A NAME = "AS39551"></A><A NAME = "AS39552"></A>
said that all our races of dogs<A NAME = "BB39567"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB52497"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have been produced by the crossing of a few
aboriginal<A NAME = "AB39588"></A> species; but by crossing we can get only forms in some degree
intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several
domestic races by this process, we must admit<A NAME = "AO39651"></A><A NAME = "AS39652"></A> the former existence of the
most extreme forms, as the Italian<A NAME = "BB39675"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF39488"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, &amp;c.,
in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct races by
crossing has been greatly exaggerated. There can be no doubt that a race<A NAME = "AO39739"></A> may
be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of
those individual mongrels, which present any desired character; but that a
race<A NAME = "AO39790"></A> could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different
races or species, I can hardly believe. Sir<A NAME = "AO39825"></A> J. Sebright expressly
experimentised for this object, and failed. The offspring<A NAME = "AO39848"></A> from the first
cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found
with pigeons) extremely uniform, and everything seems simple enough; but
when these mongrels<A NAME = "AO39909"></A><A NAME = "AS39910"></A><A NAME = "AB39911"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4713"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are crossed one with another for several generations,
hardly two of them will be alike, and then the extreme difficulty, or rather
utter hopelessness, of the task becomes apparent. Certainly, a breed<A NAME = "AO39977"></A>
intermediate between two <I>very distinct</I> breeds could not be got
without extreme care and long-continued selection; nor can I find a single
case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed.

On the Breeds<A NAME = "AS407"></A><A NAME = "AB408"></A> of the Domestic pigeon.<p>
Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after
deliberation, taken<A NAME = "AS4132"></A> up domestic pigeons<A NAME = "BB4139"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB41150"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. I have kept every breed which I
could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured with skins from
several quarters of the world, more<A NAME = "AS4192"></A> especially by the Hon. W. Elliot from
India<A NAME = "BB41109"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4961"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and by the Hon<A NAME = "AS41118"></A>. C. Murray from Persia<A NAME = "AB41127"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB59218"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. Many treatises<A NAME = "AO41132"></A><A NAME = "AS41133"></A> in different
languages have been published on pigeons<A NAME = "BB41150"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4316"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and some of them are very
important, as being of considerably antiquity. I have associated<A NAME = "AO41181"></A><A NAME = "AS41182"></A> with
several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted to join two of the London<A NAME = "AB41211"></A>
Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the breeds is something astonishing. Compare<A NAME = "AO41234"></A><A NAME = "AS41235"></A>
the English<A NAME = "AB41240"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB43108"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful
difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their
skulls. The carrier, more especially the male bird, is also remarkable from
the wonderful development<A NAME = "AO41309"></A><A NAME = "AS41310"></A> of the carunculated skin about the head, and this
is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids<A NAME = "AB41341"></A>, very large external orifices to
the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth. The short<A NAME = "AO41372"></A>-faced tumbler has a beak
in outline almost like that of a finch<A NAME = "AS41399"></A><A NAME = "AB41400"></A>; and the common<A NAME = "AO41407"></A><A NAME = "AS41408"></A> tumbler has the
singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in a
compact flock, and tumbling in the air<A NAME = "AB41455"></A> head over heels. The runt<A NAME = "AO41466"></A><A NAME = "AS41467"></A><A NAME = "AS41468"></A><A NAME = "AB41469"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB43124"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> is a bird<A NAME = "AB41476"></A>
of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the sub<A NAME = "AO41505"></A><A NAME = "AS41506"></A><A NAME = "AB41507"></A>-
breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and tails,
others singularly short tails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but,
instead of a very long beak, has a very short and very broad one. The pouter<A NAME = "AO41593"></A><A NAME = "AS41594"></A><A NAME = "AB41595"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB43132"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed
crop, which it glories in inflating, may well excite astonishment and even
laughter. The turbit<A NAME = "AO41650"></A><A NAME = "AS41651"></A><A NAME = "AB41652"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65611"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has a very short and conical beak, with a line<A NAME = "AO41673"></A> of
reversed feathers down the breast; and it has the habit<A NAME = "AS41696"></A> of continually
expanding slightly the upper part of the oesophagus<A NAME = "AB41717"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB42305"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. The Jacobin has the
feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form<A NAME = "AO41752"></A> a hood,
and it has, proportionally to its size, much elongated wing and tail
feathers. The trumpeter<A NAME = "AO41788"></A><A NAME = "AS41789"></A><A NAME = "AS41790"></A><A NAME = "AB41791"></A> and laugher<A NAME = "AB41796"></A>, as their names express, utter a very
different coo from the other breeds. The fantail<A NAME = "AO41827"></A> has thirty or even forty
tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal<A NAME = "AS41856"></A> number in all
members of the great pigeon<A NAME = "AB41873"></A> family; and these feathers are kept expanded,
and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch; the
oil-gland is quite aborted. Several<A NAME = "AO41931"></A> other less distinct breeds might have
been specified.<p>
In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development<A NAME = "AO4218"></A> of the bones of the
face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. The shape, as
well as the breadth<A NAME = "AS4261"></A> and length of the ramus<A NAME = "AB4272"></A> of the lower jaw, varies in a
highly remarkable manner. The number<A NAME = "AO4297"></A><A NAME = "AS4298"></A> of the caudal and sacral<A NAME = "AB42109"></A> vertebrae vary
; as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth and
the presence of processes. The size<A NAME = "AO42153"></A><A NAME = "AS42154"></A> and shape of the apertures in the
sternum<A NAME = "AB42171"></A> are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative
size of the two arms of the furcula. The proportional width of the gape of
mouth, the proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the
nostrils, of the tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length of
beak), the size<A NAME = "AS42282"></A> of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus<A NAME = "BB42305"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65628"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>; the
development<A NAME = "AS42310"></A> and abortion<A NAME = "AB42315"></A> of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing
and caudal feathers; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and
to the body; the relative length of leg and of the feet; the number<A NAME = "AO42392"></A><A NAME = "AS42393"></A> of
scutellae<A NAME = "AB42398"></A> on the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all
points of structure which are variable. The period at which the perfect
plumage is acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the
nestling birds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs
vary. The manner of flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the
voice and disposition. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males<A NAME = "AO42545"></A> and females have
come to differ to a slight degree from each other.<p>
Altogether<A NAME = "AO432"></A><A NAME = "AS433"></A> at least a score of pigeons<A NAME = "BB4316"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4422"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> might be chosen, which if shown<A NAME = "AS4329"></A> to an
ornithologist<A NAME = "AB4336"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4399"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly,
I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not<A NAME = "AO4388"></A><A NAME = "AS4389"></A><A NAME = "AS4390"></A>
believe that any ornithologist<A NAME = "BB4399"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF4336"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> would place the English<A NAME = "BB43108"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB45148"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> carrier, the
short-faced tumbler, the runt<A NAME = "AS43123"></A><A NAME = "BB43124"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF41469"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, the barb, pouter<A NAME = "AS43131"></A><A NAME = "BB43132"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB44268"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and fantail in the same
genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited
sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could be shown him.
<p>
Great<A NAME = "AO442"></A><A NAME = "AS443"></A> as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons<A NAME = "BB4422"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB44841"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, I am fully
convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that
all have descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including under
this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each
other in the most trifling respects. As several<A NAME = "AO44115"></A> of the reasons which have
led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, I will
here briefly give them. If the several<A NAME = "AO44170"></A> breeds are not varieties, and have
not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least
seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present
domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance,
could a pouter<A NAME = "AO44266"></A><A NAME = "AS44267"></A><A NAME = "BB44268"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB45202"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the
parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed<A NAME = "AO44308"></A><A NAME = "AS44309"></A>
aboriginal<A NAME = "AB44312"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB44424"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or
willingly perching on trees. But besides<A NAME = "AS44349"></A><A NAME = "AS44350"></A> C. livia<A NAME = "AB44355"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4926"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, with its geographical<A NAME = "AB44362"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB48241"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
sub-species, only<A NAME = "AO44369"></A> two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and
these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. Hence the
supposed<A NAME = "AO44420"></A><A NAME = "AS44421"></A> aboriginal<A NAME = "BB44424"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB46578"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> stocks must either still exist in the countries where
they were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown<A NAME = "AS44459"></A> to ornithologists<A NAME = "AB44464"></A>; and
this, considering their size, habits, and remarkable characters, seems very
improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But birds
breeding on precipices, and good fliers, are unlikely to be exterminated;
and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with the domestic
breeds, has not been exterminated<A NAME = "AO44572"></A><A NAME = "AS44573"></A><A NAME = "AS44574"></A> even on several of the smaller British<A NAME = "AB44589"></A>
islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean<A NAME = "AB44606"></A>. Hence the supposed<A NAME = "AO44613"></A>
extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon
seems to me a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several<A NAME = "AO44658"></A> above-named
domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world, and,
therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into their native
country; but not<A NAME = "AO44720"></A> one has ever become wild or feral, though the
dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state,
has become feral in several places. Again, all recent experience shows that
it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under
domestication; yet on the hypothesis<A NAME = "AS44826"></A> of the multiple origin of our pigeons<A NAME = "BB44841"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4620"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly
domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific
under confinement.<p>
An argument, as it seems to me, of great weight, and applicable in several
other cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing<A NAME = "AO4548"></A> generally
in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their
structure, with the wild rock-pigeon, yet are certainly highly abnormal in
other parts of their structure: we may look in vain throughout the whole
great family of Columbidae for a beak like that of the English<A NAME = "AS45147"></A><A NAME = "BB45148"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49113"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> carrier, or
that of the short-faced tumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those
of the jacobin; for a crop like that of the pouter<A NAME = "AS45201"></A><A NAME = "BB45202"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF41595"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>; for tail-feathers like
those of the fantail. Hence it must be assumed not only that half-civilized
man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he
intentionally or by chance<A NAME = "AO45267"></A> picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and
further, that these very species<A NAME = "AO45290"></A> have since all become extinct or unknown.
So many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree.
<p>
Some facts<A NAME = "AO464"></A><A NAME = "AS465"></A> in regard to the colouring of pigeons<A NAME = "BB4620"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4730"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> well deserve consideration.
The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, and has a white rump (the Indian
sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, having it bluish); the tail<A NAME = "AO4682"></A><A NAME = "AS4683"></A> has a
terminal<A NAME = "AB4690"></A> dark bar, with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged
with white; the wings<A NAME = "AO46121"></A> have two black bars: some semi<A NAME = "AO46134"></A>-domestic breeds and
some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides the two black bars, the
wings chequered with black. These several<A NAME = "AO46177"></A> marks do not occur together in any
other species of the whole family. Now, in every one of the domestic breeds,
taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the above marks, even to the white
edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes concur perfectly developed.
Moreover, when two<A NAME = "AO46274"></A><A NAME = "AS46275"></A> birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed,
neither of which is blue or has any of the above-specified marks, the
mongrel<A NAME = "AB46323"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB48178"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters; for
instance, I crossed<A NAME = "AO46350"></A> some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black
barbs, and they produced mottled brown and black birds; these I again
crossed<A NAME = "AO46393"></A> together, and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure
black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white rump, double
black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild
rock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on the well-known principle of
reversion to ancestral characters, if all the domestic<A NAME = "AO46513"></A> breeds have descended
from the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one of the two
following highly improbable suppositions. Either, firstly, that all the
several<A NAME = "AO46572"></A><A NAME = "AS46573"></A> imagined aboriginal<A NAME = "BB46578"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF44312"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> stocks were coloured and marked like the
rock-pigeon, although no<A NAME = "AO46601"></A> other existing species is thus coloured and marked,
so that in each<A NAME = "AO46627"></A> separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the
very same colours and markings. Or, secondly, that each<A NAME = "AO46668"></A> breed, even the
purest, has within a dozen or, at most, within a score of generations, been
crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or twenty generations, for
we know of no fact countenancing the belief that the child<A NAME = "AO46753"></A> ever reverts to
some one ancestor, removed by a greater number of generations. In a breed<A NAME = "AO46786"></A>
which has been crossed only once with some distinct breed, the tendency<A NAME = "AO46811"></A> to
reversion to any character derived from such cross will naturally become
less and less, as in each<A NAME = "AO46848"></A> succeeding generation there will be less of the
foreign blood; but when there has been no<A NAME = "AO46881"></A> cross with a distinct breed, and
there is a tendency in both parents to revert to a character, which has been
lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see
to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of
generations. These two<A NAME = "AO46980"></A> distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on
inheritance.<p>
Lastly, the hybrids<A NAME = "AO476"></A><A NAME = "AS477"></A><A NAME = "AS478"></A> or mongrels<A NAME = "BB4713"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB70507"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> from between all the domestic breeds of
pigeons<A NAME = "BB4730"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4840"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are perfectly fertile. I can state this from my own observations,
purposely made on the most distinct breeds. Now, it is difficult, perhaps
impossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two animals
<I>clearly distinct</I> being themselves perfectly fertile. Some authors<A NAME = "AO47122"></A><A NAME = "AS47123"></A>
believe that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to
sterility<A NAME = "BB47146"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF2553"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>: from the history of the dog I think there is some probability in
this hypothesis, if applied to species closely related together, though it
is unsupported by a single experiment. But to extend the hypothesis so far
as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers,
pouters<A NAME = "AS47246"></A><A NAME = "AB47247"></A>, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, <I>
inter se</I>, seems to me rash in the extreme.<p>
From these several reasons, namely, the improbability<A NAME = "AO4814"></A><A NAME = "AS4815"></A> of man having formerly
got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons<A NAME = "BB4840"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49326"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to breed freely under
domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state,
and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very abnormal
characters in certain respects, as compared with all other Columbidae,
though so like in most other respects to the rock-pigeon; the blue colour
and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds, both when kept
pure and when crossed; the mongrel<A NAME = "AS48177"></A><A NAME = "BB48178"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF46323"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> offspring being perfectly fertile; from
these several reasons, taken together, I can feel no doubt that all our
domestic<A NAME = "AO48217"></A><A NAME = "AS48218"></A><A NAME = "AS48219"></A> breeds have descended from the Columba<A NAME = "AB48232"></A> livia with its geographical<A NAME = "BB48241"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF44362"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
sub-species.<p>
In favour of this view, I may add<A NAME = "AO4916"></A><A NAME = "AS4917"></A>, firstly, that C. livia<A NAME = "BB4926"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF44355"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, or the rock-pigeon,
has been found<A NAME = "AS4942"></A><A NAME = "AS4943"></A> capable of domestication in Europe<A NAME = "BB4954"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF39147"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and in India<A NAME = "BB4961"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49578"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>;
and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure
with all the domestic breeds. Secondly, although an English<A NAME = "AO49111"></A><A NAME = "AS49112"></A><A NAME = "BB49113"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF41240"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> carrier or
short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the
rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these breeds, more
especially those brought from distant countries, we can make an almost
perfect series between the extremes of structure. Thirdly, those characters
which are mainly distinctive of each breed, for instance the wattle and
length of beak of the carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler<A NAME = "AO49256"></A>, and the
number of tail-feathers in the fantail, are in each breed eminently variable
; and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we come to treat of
selection. Fourthly, pigeons<A NAME = "AO49324"></A><A NAME = "AS49325"></A><A NAME = "BB49326"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49397"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have been watched, and tended with the utmost
care, and loved by many people. They have been domesticated for thousands of
years in several quarters of the world; the earliest known<A NAME = "AO49389"></A><A NAME = "AS49390"></A> record of pigeons<A NAME = "BB49397"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49459"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
is in the fifth &amp;Aelig;gyptian<A NAME = "AO49411"></A><A NAME = "AS49412"></A><A NAME = "AS49413"></A><A NAME = "AB49414"></A> dynasty, about 3000 B.C., as was pointed
out to me by Professor<A NAME = "AB49440"></A> Lepsius; but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons<A NAME = "AO49457"></A><A NAME = "AS49458"></A><A NAME = "BB49459"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49521"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are
given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans,
as we hear<A NAME = "AS49501"></A> from Pliny<A NAME = "AB49506"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB57431"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, immense prices<A NAME = "AO49511"></A><A NAME = "AS49512"></A> were given for pigeons<A NAME = "BB49521"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49560"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>; 'nay, they are
come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race.' Pigeons<A NAME = "AO49556"></A><A NAME = "AS49557"></A><A NAME = "AS49558"></A><A NAME = "AS49559"></A><A NAME = "BB49560"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49599"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
were much valued by Akber<A NAME = "AB49571"></A> Khan in India<A NAME = "BB49578"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB59213"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, about the year 1600; never<A NAME = "AO49589"></A><A NAME = "AS49590"></A> less
than 20,000 pigeons<A NAME = "BB49599"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49706"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> were taken with the court. 'The monarchs<A NAME = "AO49614"></A><A NAME = "AS49615"></A><A NAME = "AB49616"></A> of Iran and
Turan sent him some very rare birds;' and, continues the courtly historian,
'His Majesty by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised
before, has improved them astonishingly.' About this same<A NAME = "AO49688"></A><A NAME = "AS49689"></A> period the Dutch
were as eager about pigeons<A NAME = "BB49706"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49749"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> as were the old Romans. The paramount importance
of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which
pigeons<A NAME = "AO49747"></A><A NAME = "AS49748"></A><A NAME = "BB49749"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49844"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> have undergone, will be obvious when we treat of Selection. We shall
then, also, see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous
character. It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of
distinct breeds, that male<A NAME = "AO49836"></A><A NAME = "AS49837"></A> and female pigeons<A NAME = "BB49844"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB5020"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> can be easily mated for life;
and thus different<A NAME = "AO49864"></A> breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.<p>
I have discussed<A NAME = "AO506"></A><A NAME = "AS507"></A> the probable origin of domestic pigeons<A NAME = "BB5020"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB5046"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> at some, yet quite
insufficient, length; because when I first<A NAME = "AS5041"></A> kept pigeons<A NAME = "BB5046"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB66190"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and watched the
several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully as much
difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended from a common
parent, as any naturalist<A NAME = "AO50111"></A><A NAME = "AS50112"></A> could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard
to the many species of finches<A NAME = "AB50143"></A>, or other large groups of birds, in nature.
One circumstance has struck me much; namely, that all the breeders of the
various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom I have
ever conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that
the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many
aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of
Hereford cattle, whether his cattle<A NAME = "AO50295"></A> might not have descended from long
horns, and he will laugh you to scorn. I have never<A NAME = "AO50330"></A><A NAME = "AS50331"></A><A NAME = "AS50332"></A><A NAME = "AS50333"></A><A NAME = "AS50334"></A> met a pigeon<A NAME = "AB50341"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB52158"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, or
poultry<A NAME = "BB50346"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF38346"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, or duck<A NAME = "BB50351"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF2878"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, or rabbit<A NAME = "BB50356"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF38444"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> fancier, who was not fully convinced that each
main breed was descended from a distinct species. Van<A NAME = "AO50391"></A><A NAME = "AS50392"></A><A NAME = "AB50393"></A> Mons, in his treatise
on pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several
sorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have
proceeded from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples could
be given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study
they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races;
and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for they win their
prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all general
arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences
accumulated during many successive generations. May not those naturalists
who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and
knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of
descent, yet admit that many of our domestic<A NAME = "AO50685"></A> races have descended from the
same parents may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the
idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other
species?
<P>

Selection<p>
Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been
produced, either from one<A NAME = "AO5234"></A> or from several allied species. Some little<A NAME = "AO5249"></A> effect
may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the external conditions
of life, and some little to habit; but he would be a bold<A NAME = "AO52102"></A><A NAME = "AS52103"></A> man who would
account by such agencies for the differences of a dray and race horse<A NAME = "AB52136"></A>, a
greyhound<A NAME = "AS52141"></A><A NAME = "BB52142"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF35119"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and bloodhound, a carrier<A NAME = "AS52151"></A> and tumbler pigeon<A NAME = "BB52158"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65284"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. One of the most
remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them
adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use
or fancy. Some variations<A NAME = "AO52227"></A> useful to him have probably arisen suddenly, or by
one step; many botanists<A NAME = "AO52254"></A><A NAME = "AS52255"></A>, for instance, believe that the fuller's teazle<A NAME = "AB52270"></A>,
with its hooks, which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance, is
only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and this amount<A NAME = "AO52316"></A> of change may have
suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has probably been with the turnspit<A NAME = "AS52351"></A><A NAME = "AB52352"></A> dog
; and this is known to have been the case<A NAME = "AS52374"></A> with the ancon<A NAME = "AB52381"></A> sheep. But when we
compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary<A NAME = "AS52408"></A><A NAME = "AS52409"></A><A NAME = "AS52410"></A><A NAME = "AB52411"></A> and camel<A NAME = "BB52416"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF36210"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, the various
breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with
the wool<A NAME = "AB52449"></A> of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for
another purpose; when we compare<A NAME = "AS52486"></A> the many breeds of dogs<A NAME = "BB52497"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB57388"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, each good for man
in very different ways; when we compare the gamecock, so pertinacious in
battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with 'everlasting layers'
which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant; when we
compare<A NAME = "AO52582"></A> the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races
of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for different
purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further than
to mere variability. We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly
produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several
cases, we know that this has not been their history. The key<A NAME = "AO52731"></A> is man's power
of accumulative selection: nature<A NAME = "AO52746"></A> gives successive variations; man<A NAME = "AO52755"></A> adds them
up in certain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to make
for himself useful breeds.<p>
The great power<A NAME = "AO536"></A> of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. It is
certain that several<A NAME = "AO5333"></A><A NAME = "AS5334"></A> of our eminent<A NAME = "AB5341"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB5812"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> breeders have, even within a single
lifetime, modified to a large extent some breeds<A NAME = "AS5370"></A> of cattle and sheep<A NAME = "BB5379"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB53382"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. In
order<A NAME = "AS5384"></A> fully to realise<A NAME = "AB5391"></A> what they have done, it is almost<A NAME = "AO53106"></A> necessary to read
several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect the
animals. Breeders<A NAME = "AO53143"></A><A NAME = "AS53144"></A> habitually speak of an animal's organisation<A NAME = "BB53157"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF23384"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> as something
quite plastic, which they can model almost as they please. If I had space I
could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent
authorities. Youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the works of
agriculturalists than almost any other individual, and who was himself a
very good judge of an animal, speaks of the principle of selection as 'that
which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his
flock, but to change it altogether. It is the magician's wand, by means of
which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases.' Lord
Somerville, speaking of what breeders<A NAME = "AO53372"></A><A NAME = "AS53373"></A> have done for sheep<A NAME = "BB53382"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB53565"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, says: 'It would
seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and
then had given it existence.' That most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright,
used to say, with respect to pigeons, that 'he would produce any given
feather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain head and
beak.' In Saxony<A NAME = "AO53508"></A><A NAME = "AS53509"></A><A NAME = "AS53510"></A><A NAME = "AB53511"></A> the importance of the principle of selection in regard to
merino<A NAME = "AB53534"></A> sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the
sheep<A NAME = "AO53563"></A><A NAME = "AS53564"></A><A NAME = "BB53565"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB53621"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur
; this is done<A NAME = "AO53601"></A><A NAME = "AS53602"></A> three times at intervals of months, and the sheep<A NAME = "BB53621"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB60266"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> are each
time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected
for breeding.<p>
What English<A NAME = "AO544"></A><A NAME = "AS545"></A><A NAME = "AB546"></A> breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous
prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have now been
exported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement<A NAME = "AO5471"></A> is by no
means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best<A NAME = "AO5498"></A> breeders are
strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst closely allied
sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest<A NAME = "AO54145"></A> selection is far
more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection<A NAME = "AO54170"></A> consisted
merely in separating some very distinct variety, and breeding from it, the
principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice; but its
importance<A NAME = "AO54225"></A> consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one
direction, during successive generations, of differences<A NAME = "AS54260"></A><A NAME = "AS54261"></A> absolutely
inappreciable<A NAME = "AB54266"></A> by an uneducated eye<A NAME = "AB54275"></A> differences which I for one have vainly
attempted to appreciate. Not<A NAME = "AO54298"></A><A NAME = "AS54299"></A> one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and
judgement sufficient to become an eminent<A NAME = "AB54332"></A> breeder. If gifted with these
qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to
it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great
improvements; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail.
Few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice
requisite to become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.<p>
The same<A NAME = "AO554"></A> principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are
here often more abrupt. No<A NAME = "AO5533"></A><A NAME = "AS5534"></A> one supposes that our choicest productions have
been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal<A NAME = "BB5567"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF33495"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> stock. We have
proofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact records have been
kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily<A NAME = "AO55124"></A><A NAME = "AS55125"></A>-increasing size
of the common gooseberry<A NAME = "AB55138"></A> may be quoted. We see<A NAME = "AO55149"></A><A NAME = "AS55150"></A> an astonishing improvement in
many florists'<A NAME = "AB55163"></A> flowers, when the flowers<A NAME = "AO55172"></A><A NAME = "AS55173"></A><A NAME = "AB55174"></A> of the present day are compared
with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants is
once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best
plants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the 'rogues,' as
they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals
this kind of selection is, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one is so
careless as to allow his worst animals to breed.<p>
In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated
effects of selection namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the
different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity<A NAME = "AO5672"></A><A NAME = "AS5673"></A><A NAME = "AS5674"></A><A NAME = "AB5675"></A>
of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the
kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers<A NAME = "AB56114"></A> of the same varieties; and
the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison
with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See how different
the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how
unlike the flowers<A NAME = "AS56211"></A><A NAME = "AB56212"></A> of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much
the fruit<A NAME = "AO56239"></A><A NAME = "AS56240"></A><A NAME = "AS56241"></A><A NAME = "AB56242"></A> of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour,
shape, and hairiness<A NAME = "AB56270"></A>, and yet the flowers present very slight differences.
It is not that the varieties<A NAME = "AO56300"></A> which differ largely in some one point do not
differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever, perhaps never, the case.
The laws<A NAME = "AO56352"></A><A NAME = "AS56353"></A><A NAME = "AB56354"></A> of correlation of growth, the importance of which should never be
overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, I cannot
doubt that the continued selection of slight variations, either in the
leaves, the flowers<A NAME = "AO56429"></A>, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each
other chiefly in these characters.<p>
It may be objected<A NAME = "AO578"></A> that the principle of selection has been reduced to
methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it
has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have
been published on the subject; and the result, I may add, has been, in a
corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from true that
the principle is a modern discovery. I could give<A NAME = "AO57151"></A> several references to the
full acknowledgement of the importance of the principle in works of high
antiquity. In rude<A NAME = "AO57190"></A><A NAME = "AS57191"></A> and barbarous periods of English<A NAME = "AB57202"></A> history choice animals
were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the
destruction<A NAME = "AO57235"></A><A NAME = "AS57236"></A> of horses<A NAME = "BB57241"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF38227"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> under a certain size was ordered, and this may be
compared to the 'roguing' of plants by nurserymen. The principle of
selection I find<A NAME = "AO57290"></A><A NAME = "AS57291"></A> distinctly given in an ancient Chinese<A NAME = "AB57304"></A> encyclopaedia.
Explicit<A NAME = "AO57310"></A> rules are laid down by some of the Roman classical writers. From
passages in Genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at
that early period attended to. Savages<A NAME = "AO57375"></A><A NAME = "AS57376"></A><A NAME = "AS57377"></A> now sometimes cross their dogs<A NAME = "BB57388"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB57477"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> with
wild canine<A NAME = "AB57395"></A> animals, to improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is
attested<A NAME = "AS57422"></A> by passages in Pliny<A NAME = "BB57431"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF49506"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. The savages<A NAME = "AS57436"></A> in South<A NAME = "AB57441"></A> Africa match their
draught cattle by colour, as do some of the Esquimaux<A NAME = "AS57468"></A> their teams of dogs<A NAME = "BB57477"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB58162"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.
Livingstone<A NAME = "AO57481"></A><A NAME = "AS57482"></A> shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes<A NAME = "AB57505"></A> of
the interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these
facts<A NAME = "AO57536"></A> do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of
domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now
attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange
fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of good
and bad qualities is so obvious.<p>
At the present time, eminent<A NAME = "AO5810"></A><A NAME = "AS5811"></A><A NAME = "BB5812"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF5341"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> breeders try by methodical selection, with a
distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to
anything existing in the country. But, for our purpose, a kind of Selection,
which may be called<A NAME = "AO5890"></A> Unconscious, and which results from every one trying to
possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important. Thus,
a man<A NAME = "AO58138"></A><A NAME = "AS58139"></A> who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs<A NAME = "BB58162"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB58186"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> as he
can, and afterwards<A NAME = "AS58173"></A> breeds from his own best dogs<A NAME = "BB58186"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61227"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, but he has no wish or
expectation of permanently altering the breed. Nevertheless I cannot doubt
that this process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any
breed, in the same way as Bakewell, Collins<A NAME = "AO58257"></A>, &amp;c., by this very same
process, only carried on more methodically, did greatly modify, even during
their own lifetimes, the forms and qualities of their cattle. Slow<A NAME = "AO58314"></A> and
insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual
measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made
long ago, which might serve for comparison. In some cases, however,
unchanged or but little<A NAME = "AO58394"></A><A NAME = "AS58395"></A> changed individuals of the same breed may be found
in less civilised<A NAME = "AB58420"></A> districts, where the breed has been less improved. There
is reason<A NAME = "AO58443"></A><A NAME = "AS58444"></A> to believe that King Charles's spaniel<A NAME = "BB58457"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB58518"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has been unconsciously
modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch. Some highly<A NAME = "AO58490"></A><A NAME = "AS58491"></A>
competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from
the spaniel<A NAME = "BB58518"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF35127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known<A NAME = "AO58541"></A><A NAME = "AS58542"></A> that
the English<A NAME = "AB58549"></A> pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in
this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses
with the fox-hound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been
effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually, that, though
the old<A NAME = "AO58650"></A><A NAME = "AS58651"></A><A NAME = "AS58652"></A><A NAME = "AS58653"></A> Spanish<A NAME = "AB58656"></A> pointer certainly came from Spain<A NAME = "BB58667"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB58701"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, Mr. Barrow has not seen,
as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain<A NAME = "BB58701"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF39273"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> like our pointer.<p>

<P>

Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an 
<P>

ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country 

<P>

and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold 
<P>

them, especially when they have not been accustomed to 
<P>

self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have 
<P>

destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the 
<P>

two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not 
<P>

being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen 
<P>

in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to 

<P>

France<A NAME = "AS993"></A><A NAME = "BB994"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB20714"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> for so long a time: and, although there may be some 
<P>

difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the 
<P>

people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves. He who has 
<P>

annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind 
<P>

two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is 
<P>

extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are 
<P>

altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one 
<P>

body with the old principality. 
<P>

But when states are acquired in a country differing in language, 
<P>

customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great 
<P>

energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most 
<P>

real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside 

<P>

there. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has 

<P>

made that of the Turk<A NAME = "AS11211"></A> in Greece<A NAME = "AB11216"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15713"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, who, notwithstanding all the other 
<P>

measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled 
<P>

there, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on 
<P>

the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly 
<P>

remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they heard of only when they 
<P>

are one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not 
<P>

pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt

WHEN we look<A NAME = "AO237"></A> to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our
older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes
us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the
individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we
reflect<A NAME = "AO23114"></A><A NAME = "AS23115"></A> on the vast diversity<A NAME = "AB23124"></A> of the plants and animals which have been
cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different
climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater
variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised
under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from,
those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature. There is,
also, I think, some probability<A NAME = "AO23275"></A><A NAME = "AS23276"></A> in the view propounded by Andrew<A NAME = "AB23289"></A> Knight,
that this variability<A NAME = "AO23299"></A> may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems
pretty clear that organic<A NAME = "AO23328"></A><A NAME = "AS23329"></A><A NAME = "AB23330"></A> beings must be exposed during several generations
to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation;
and that when the organisation<A NAME = "AO23382"></A><A NAME = "AS23383"></A><A NAME = "AB23384"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB53157"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has once begun to vary, it generally
continues to vary for many generations. No<A NAME = "AO23413"></A> case is on record of a variable
being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest<A NAME = "AO23446"></A> cultivated
plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest<A NAME = "AO23471"></A>
domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.
<p>
It has been disputed at what period of time the causes of variability,
whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late period
of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception. Geoffroy<A NAME = "AO2477"></A><A NAME = "AS2478"></A><A NAME = "AS2479"></A><A NAME = "AB2480"></A> St
Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes
monstrosities<A NAME = "AB24105"></A><A HREF = "SPP0.HTM#BB24112"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>; and monstrosities<A NAME = "AO24110"></A><A NAME = "AS24111"></A><A NAME = "BB24112"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB29104"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> cannot be separated by any clear line of
distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined<A NAME = "AO24147"></A><A NAME = "AS24148"></A> to suspect that
the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and
female reproductive<A NAME = "AB24185"></A> elements having been affected prior to the act of
conception. Several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief one is
the remarkable effect which confinement<A NAME = "AO24240"></A><A NAME = "AS24241"></A> or cultivation has on the functions
of the reproductive<A NAME = "AB24260"></A><A HREF = "SPP0.HTM#BB24856"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> system; this system appearing to be far more susceptible
than any other part of the organization, to the action of any change in the
conditions of life. Nothing<A NAME = "AO24317"></A> is more easy than to tame an animal, and few
things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even
in the many cases when the male and female unite. How many animals there are
which will not breed, though living long under not very close confinement in
their native country! This is generally attributed to vitiated instincts;
but how many cultivated<A NAME = "AO24450"></A><A NAME = "AS24451"></A> plants display the utmost vigour<A NAME = "AB24462"></A>, and yet rarely or
never seed! In some few such cases it has been found out that very trifling
changes, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of
growth, will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed. I cannot here
enter on the copious details which I have collected on this curious subject;
but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of
animals under confinement, I may just<A NAME = "AO24623"></A><A NAME = "AS24624"></A><A NAME = "AS24625"></A> mention that carnivorous<A NAME = "AB24632"></A> animals, even
from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement,
with the exception of the plantigrades<A NAME = "AB24672"></A> or bear family; whereas, carnivorous
birds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic<A NAME = "AO24707"></A>
plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the
most sterile hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and
plants, though often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite freely under
confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken
young from a state of nature, perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of
which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive<A NAME = "AO24854"></A><A NAME = "AS24855"></A><A NAME = "BB24856"></A><A HREF = "SPP0.HTM#BB25143"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> system
so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need
not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting
not quite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their
parents or variable.<p>
Sterility<A NAME = "AO252"></A><A NAME = "AS253"></A> has been said to be the bane of horticulture<A NAME = "AB2522"></A>; but on this view we
owe<A NAME = "AO2535"></A><A NAME = "AS2536"></A> variability to the same cause which produces sterility<A NAME = "AB2553"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB47146"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>; and variability<A NAME = "AO2558"></A>
is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden. I may add, that
as some organisms will breed most freely under the most unnatural conditions
(for instance, the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches), showing that their
reproductive<A NAME = "AO25141"></A><A NAME = "AS25142"></A><A NAME = "BB25143"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7057"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> system has not been thus affected; so will some animals<A NAME = "AO25164"></A> and
plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly
perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.<p>
A long<A NAME = "AO264"></A><A NAME = "AS265"></A> list could easily be given of 'sporting<A NAME = "AB2620"></A> plants;' by this term
gardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and
sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant. Such
buds<A NAME = "AO2685"></A> can be propagated by grafting, &amp;c., and sometimes by seed. These
'sports' are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under
cultivation; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has
affected a bud or offset, and not the ovules or pollen. But it is the
opinion<A NAME = "AO26192"></A> of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between
a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation; so that, in
fact,'sports' support my view, that variability<A NAME = "AO26255"></A> may be largely attributed to
the ovules or pollen, or to both, having been affected by the treatment of
the parent prior to the act of conception. These cases anyhow show that
variation<A NAME = "AO26322"></A> is not necessarily connected, as some authors have supposed, with
the act of generation.<p>
Seedlings<A NAME = "AO272"></A> from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter, sometimes
differ considerably from each other, though both the young<A NAME = "AS2745"></A> and the parents,
as Muller<A NAME = "AB2757"></A> has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same
conditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the direct<A NAME = "AO2798"></A><A NAME = "AS2799"></A> effects of the
conditions of life are in comparison with the laws<A NAME = "AB27124"></A> of reproduction, and of
growth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been
direct, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in
the same manner. To judge how much, in the case of any variation, we should
attribute to the direct action of heat, moisture, light, food, &amp;c., is
most difficult: my impression is, that with animals such agencies have
produced very little direct effect, though apparently more in the case of
plants. Under this point of view, Mr<A NAME = "AO27301"></A>. Buckman's recent experiments on plants
seem extremely valuable. When all or nearly all the individuals<A NAME = "AO27332"></A> exposed to
certain conditions are affected in the same way, the change<A NAME = "AO27357"></A> at first appears
to be directly due to such conditions; but in some cases it can be shown
that quite opposite conditions produce similar changes of structure.
Nevertheless some slight<A NAME = "AO27419"></A> amount of change may, I think, be attributed to the
direct action of the conditions of life as, in some cases, increased size
from amount of food, colour from particular kinds of food and from light,
and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate.<p>
Habit<A NAME = "AO282"></A> also has a deciding influence, as in the period<A NAME = "AO2821"></A> of flowering with
plants when transported from one climate to another. In animals it has a
more marked effect; for instance, I find<A NAME = "AO2868"></A><A NAME = "AS2869"></A> in the domestic duck<A NAME = "AB2878"></A><A HREF = "SPP0.HTM#BB28170"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> that the bones<A NAME = "AO2885"></A>
of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the
whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild-duck; and I presume<A NAME = "AO28146"></A><A NAME = "AS28147"></A> that
this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck<A NAME = "BB28170"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB38439"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> flying much less,
and walking more, than its wild parent. The great and inherited<A NAME = "AS28200"></A><A NAME = "AS28201"></A><A NAME = "AS28202"></A> development
of the udders<A NAME = "AB28211"></A> in cows<A NAME = "AB28216"></A> and goats<A NAME = "AB28221"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB3896"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> in countries where they are habitually
milked, in comparison with the state of these organs in other countries, is
another instance of the effect of use. Not a single<A NAME = "AO28280"></A> domestic animal can be
named which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view suggested by
some authors, that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the
ear, from the animals not being much alarmed by danger, seems probable.<p>

their dominions from the Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized 
<P>

the Church<A NAME = "AO2705"></A><A NAME = "AS2706"></A>, nor brought Spain<A NAME = "AB27013"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB28014"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> into Italy, it would have been very 
<P>

reasonable and necessary to humble them; but having first taken 
<P>

these steps, he ought never to have consented to their ruin, for they, 

<P>

being powerful, would always have kept off others from designs on 
<P>

Lombardy, to which the Venetians would never have consented except 
<P>

to become masters themselves there; also because the others would 
<P>

not<A NAME = "AS2763"></A> wish to take Lombardy from France<A NAME = "BB27616"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29827"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> in order to give it to the 
<P>

Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not have had the 
<P>

courage. 
<P>

And if any one should say: King Louis yielded the Romagna to

Alexander<A NAME = "AS2803"></A> and the kingdom to Spain<A NAME = "BB28014"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29812"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> to avoid war, I answer for the 
<P>

reasons given above that a blunder ought never be perpetrated to avoid 

<P>

war, because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your 
<P>

<P>

had given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in 
<P>

exchange<A NAME = "AS2853"></A><A NAME = "AS2854"></A> for the dissolution<A NAME = "AB28511"></A> of his marriage and for the hat to Rouen<A NAME = "AB28530"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB29214"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 

<P>

to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of 
<P>

princes, and how it ought to be kept. 
<P>

Thus King<A NAME = "AO2885"></A> Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the 
<P>

conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries 
<P>

and wished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but 
<P>

much that is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I 
<P>

spoke<A NAME = "AS2923"></A><A NAME = "AS2924"></A> at Nantes<A NAME = "AB2929"></A> with Rouen<A NAME = "BB29214"></A><A HREF = "SPP25.HTM#BB75417"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, when Valentino,* as Cesare Borgia, the son

Cardinal<A NAME = "AS2943"></A><A NAME = "AB2944"></A> Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand

<P>As cryptography<A NAME = "AO1213"></A><A NAME = "AS1214"></A><A NAME = "AS1215"></A><A NAME = "BB1216"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB121169"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> has assumed greater importance to nongovernment<A NAME = "AB12119"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB320251"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> interests, national<A NAME = "AO12124"></A><A NAME = "AS12125"></A><A NAME = "AS12126"></A><A NAME = "AS12127"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB12130"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB12510"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy has become increasingly 
disconnected from market<A NAME = "AB12146"></A> reality and the needs of parties in the private<A NAME = "BB12165"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB129245"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector.  Many decades<A NAME = "AO12172"></A><A NAME = "AS12173"></A> of experience with technology deployment 
suggest that reliance on user choices and market<A NAME = "BB121101"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB12523"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> forces is generally the most rapid and effective way to promote the widespread 
utilization of any new and useful technology.  Since the committee<A NAME = "AO121149"></A><A NAME = "AS121150"></A> believes that the widespread deployment and use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB121169"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB129216"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> will be 
in the national interest, it believes that national cryptography policy should align itself with user needs and market forces to 
the maximum feasible extent.<BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO1233"></A><A NAME = "AS1234"></A><A NAME = "AS1235"></A> recognizes that considerations of public<A NAME = "BB12316"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB225104"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> safety and national<A NAME = "AB12323"></A> security make it undesirable to maintain an entirely 
laissez-faire approach to national cryptography policy.  But it believes that government intervention in the market should be carefully
 tailored to specific circumstances.  The committee<A NAME = "AO12392"></A><A NAME = "AS12393"></A><A NAME = "AS12394"></A> describes a set of appropriate government<A NAME = "AB123107"></A> interventions in Recommendations<A NAME = "BB123114"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF11723"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4
, 5, and 6.<BR>



<P>A national<A NAME = "AO1253"></A><A NAME = "AS1254"></A><A NAME = "AS1255"></A><A NAME = "AS1256"></A><A NAME = "AS1257"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB12510"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB12716"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy that is aligned with market<A NAME = "BB12523"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB127125"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> forces would emphasize the freedom of domestic users to determine 
cryptographic<A NAME = "AB12547"></A> functionality, protection, and implementations according to their security<A NAME = "AB12564"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32067"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> needs as they see fit.  Innovation in technologies 
such as escrowed encryption would be examined by customers for their business fitness of purpose.  Diverse user needs would be 
accommodated; some users<A NAME = "AO125129"></A><A NAME = "AS125130"></A><A NAME = "AS125131"></A> will find it useful to adopt some form of escrowed<A NAME = "BB125152"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB125191"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption to protect their access to encrypted<A NAME = "AB125167"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB275123"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> data, while 
others<A NAME = "AO125175"></A><A NAME = "AS125176"></A> will find that the risks of escrowed<A NAME = "BB125191"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB198184"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption (e.g., the dangers of compromising sensitive information through a failure of 
the escrowing system) are not worth the benefits.  <BR>



<P>Standards<A NAME = "AO1271"></A><A NAME = "AS1272"></A><A NAME = "AS1273"></A> are another dimension of national cryptography<A NAME = "BB12716"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB127108"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy with a significant impact on commercial<A NAME = "BB12731"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB34233"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> cryptography and the 
market.  Cryptographic<A NAME = "AO12743"></A><A NAME = "AS12744"></A><A NAME = "AS12745"></A><A NAME = "AS12746"></A><A NAME = "AB12747"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB127155"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> standards that are inconsistent with prevailing or emerging industry<A NAME = "AB12766"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB127171"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> practice are likely to encounter 
significant market<A NAME = "AB12782"></A> resistance.  Thus, to the maximum extent possible, national<A NAME = "AO12799"></A><A NAME = "AS127100"></A><A NAME = "AS127101"></A><A NAME = "AS127102"></A><A NAME = "AS127103"></A><A NAME = "AS127104"></A><A NAME = "AS127105"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB127108"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB12953"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy that is more closely aligned with market<A NAME = "BB127125"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB34251"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>
 forces should encourage adoption<A NAME = "AB127135"></A> by the federal<A NAME = "BB127142"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF397"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> government and private parties of cryptographic<A NAME = "BB127155"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF12747"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> standards that are consistent 
with prevailing industry<A NAME = "BB127171"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF12766"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> practice.<BR>



<P>Finally, users in the private sector need confidence that products with cryptographic functionality will indeed perform as 
advertised.  To the maximum degree possible, national<A NAME = "AO12948"></A><A NAME = "AS12949"></A><A NAME = "AS12950"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB12953"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22982"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy should support the use of algorithms, product designs, and 
product implementations that are open to public<A NAME = "AB12989"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB190122"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> scrutiny.  Information<A NAME = "AO12994"></A><A NAME = "AS12995"></A><A NAME = "AS12996"></A><A NAME = "AB12997"></A> security mechanisms for widespread use that depend on a secret 
algorithm or a secret implementation invite a loss of public<A NAME = "AB129139"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB190144"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> confidence, because they do not allow open testing of the security, they 
increase the cost of hardware implementations, and they may prevent the use of software implementations as described below.  Technical<A NAME = "AO129203"></A><A NAME = "AS129204"></A><A NAME = "AS129205"></A><A NAME = "AS129206"></A><A NAME = "AS129207"></A><A NAME = "AB129208"></A> 
work in cryptography<A NAME = "BB129216"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB14019"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> conducted in the open can expose flaws through peer review and assure the private<A NAME = "BB129245"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB214292"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector user community about 
the quality and integrity of the work underlying its cryptographic<A NAME = "AB129275"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB140285"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> protection.<BR>

<P>For many years, the United<A NAME = "AO1389"></A><A NAME = "AS13810"></A><A NAME = "AS13811"></A><A NAME = "AS13812"></A><A NAME = "AS13813"></A><A NAME = "BB13814"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB140296"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States has controlled the export<A NAME = "AB13825"></A> of cryptographic technologies, products, and related technical<A NAME = "AB13840"></A> 
information as munitions (on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) administered by the State<A NAME = "AB13871"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB214135"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> Department).  These controls<A NAME = "AO13879"></A><A NAME = "AS13880"></A><A NAME = "AS13881"></A><A NAME = "AS13882"></A> have been used to deny 
potential adversaries access to U.S. encryption<A NAME = "AB138106"></A> technology that might reveal important characteristics of U.S. information security<A NAME = "AB138127"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB158117"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
products and/or be used to thwart U.S. attempts at collecting signals<A NAME = "AB138153"></A> intelligence information [1].  To date, these controls<A NAME = "AO138170"></A><A NAME = "AS138171"></A><A NAME = "AS138172"></A> have been 
reasonably effective in containing the export of U.S. hardware<A NAME = "AB138196"></A>-based products with encryption<A NAME = "AB138205"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB138226"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities.  However, software<A NAME = "AO138212"></A><A NAME = "AS138213"></A><A NAME = "AS138214"></A><A NAME = "AS138215"></A><A NAME = "AB138216"></A>-based 
products with encryption<A NAME = "BB138226"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB14237"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities and cryptographic<A NAME = "AB138233"></A> algorithms present a more difficult challenge because they can more easily 
bypass controls and be transmitted across national borders.  In the long term, as the use<A NAME = "AO138287"></A><A NAME = "AS138288"></A> of encryption<A NAME = "BB138293"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB142157"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> grows worldwide, it is 
probable that national<A NAME = "AO138309"></A><A NAME = "AS138310"></A> capability to conduct traditional signals<A NAME = "AB138321"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB146186"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> intelligence against foreign parties will be diminished.<BR>



<P>The current<A NAME = "AO1403"></A><A NAME = "AS1404"></A><A NAME = "AS1405"></A> export<A NAME = "AB1408"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB16834"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> control regime on strong cryptography<A NAME = "BB14019"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15284"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is an increasing impediment to the information security efforts of U.S
. firms competing and operating in world markets, developing strategic alliances internationally, and forming closer ties with 
foreign customers and suppliers.  Some businesses<A NAME = "AO14088"></A><A NAME = "AS14089"></A> rely on global networks to tie together branch offices and service centers across 
international<A NAME = "AB140119"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB198246"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> boundaries.  Other<A NAME = "AO140124"></A><A NAME = "AS140125"></A> businesses are moving from a concept of operations that relies on high degrees of vertical integration to 
one that relies on the &quot;outsourcing<A NAME = "AB140174"></A>&quot; of many business functions and activities.  Consistent with rising emphasis on the 
international dimensions of business (for both business operations and markets), many U.S<A NAME = "AO140227"></A>. companies must exchange important and sensitive 
information with an often-changing array of foreign partners, customers, and suppliers.  Under such circumstances, the stronger<A NAME = "AO140275"></A><A NAME = "AS140276"></A><A NAME = "AS140277"></A> level of 
cryptographic<A NAME = "BB140285"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB401120"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> protection available in the United<A NAME = "BB140296"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB154109"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States is not meaningful when an adversary can simply attack the protected information 
through foreign channels.<BR>



<P>Export<A NAME = "AO1421"></A><A NAME = "AS1422"></A><A NAME = "AS1423"></A><A NAME = "BB1424"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15695"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> controls also have had the effect of reducing the domestic availability of products with strong encryption<A NAME = "BB14237"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB14467"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities
.  The need for U.S. vendors (especially software vendors) to market their products to an international audience leads many of them
 to weaken the encryption capabilities of products available to the domestic market, even though no statutory restrictions are 
imposed on that market.  Thus, domestic<A NAME = "AO142133"></A><A NAME = "AS142134"></A> users face a more limited range of options for strong encryption<A NAME = "BB142157"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB186226"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> than they would in the absence
 of export controls.<BR>



<P>Looking to the future, both U.S<A NAME = "AO14411"></A><A NAME = "AS14412"></A><A NAME = "AS14413"></A>. and foreign companies have the technical<A NAME = "AB14426"></A> capability to integrate high-quality cryptographic<A NAME = "AB14439"></A> 
features into their products and services.  As demand<A NAME = "AO14457"></A><A NAME = "AS14458"></A> for products with encryption<A NAME = "BB14467"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB144327"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities grows worldwide, foreign<A NAME = "AO14476"></A> competition 
could emerge at a level significant enough to damage the present U.S. world leadership in this critical industry.  Today, U.S<A NAME = "AO144120"></A>. 
information technology products are widely used in foreign markets because foreign customers find the package of features offered by those 
products to be superior to packages available from other non-U.S. vendors, even though encryption capabilities of U.S. products sold 
abroad are known to be relatively weak.  However, for growing numbers of foreign customers with high security needs, the incremental<A NAME = "AO144244"></A><A NAME = "AS144245"></A><A NAME = "AS144246"></A> 
advantage of superior nonencryption<A NAME = "AB144256"></A> features offered by U.S. products may not be adequate to offset perceived deficiencies in encryption<A NAME = "AB144287"></A> 
capability.  Under such circumstances, foreign customers may well turn to non-U.S. <A NAME = "AO144314"></A><A NAME = "AS144315"></A>sources that offer significantly better encryption<A NAME = "BB144327"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB14664"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
capabilities in their products.<BR>



<P>Overly restrictive export controls thus increase the likelihood that significant<A NAME = "AO14619"></A><A NAME = "AS14620"></A> foreign competition will step into a vacuum 
left by the inability of U.S. vendors to fill a demand for stronger encryption<A NAME = "BB14664"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15043"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities integrated into general-purpose products
.  The emergence<A NAME = "AO14682"></A><A NAME = "AS14683"></A><A NAME = "AS14684"></A> of significant foreign competition for the U.S. information technology industry has a number of possible long-term
 negative<A NAME = "AB146122"></A> effects on U.S. national and economic<A NAME = "AB146135"></A> security that policy makers would have to weigh against the contribution these 
controls<A NAME = "AO146163"></A><A NAME = "AS146164"></A><A NAME = "AS146165"></A> have made to date in facilitating the collection of signals<A NAME = "BB146186"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB19243"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> intelligence in support of U.S. national<A NAME = "AB146199"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB1509"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security interests (a 
contribution that will probably decline over time).  Stimulating<A NAME = "AO146225"></A> the growth of important foreign competitors would undermine a number of 
important national interests:<BR>



<P><li>  <I>The national<A NAME = "AO1486"></A><A NAME = "AS1487"></A> economic<A NAME = "AB14810"></A> interest,</I> which is supported by continuing and even expanding U.S. world leadership in information 
technology supports.  Today, U.S<A NAME = "AO14850"></A><A NAME = "AS14851"></A>. information technology vendors have a window<A NAME = "AB14864"></A> of opportunity to set important standards and deploy an 
installed base of technology worldwide, an opportunity that should be exploited to the maximum degree possible. Conversely, strong 
foreign competition would not be in the U.S. economic self-interest.<BR>

<P>The firms<A NAME = "AO2103"></A><A NAME = "AS2104"></A> on the list of approved companies are likely to have needs for information security<A NAME = "AB21033"></A> products of the highest strength

end-user certification that the exported<A NAME = "AO210151"></A><A NAME = "AS210152"></A><A NAME = "AS210153"></A><A NAME = "AS210154"></A><A NAME = "AS210155"></A><A NAME = "AS210156"></A><A NAME = "AS210157"></A><A NAME = "AB210158"></A> products will be used only for intrafirm<A NAME = "AB210173"></A> business or by foreign parties in regular 
communications with the U.S. firms involved, to take specific measures to prevent the transfer of the exported products to other parties, and 
to provide the U.S. government with plaintext<A NAME = "AB210248"></A> of encrypted information when presented with a properly authorized law<A NAME = "AB210269"></A> enforcement 
request and to prove, if necessary, that the provided plaintext<A NAME = "BB210293"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB594153"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> does indeed correspond to the encrypted<A NAME = "AB210306"></A> information of interest.  
Compliance<A NAME = "AO210316"></A> with these requirements is intended to be a reasonable precaution that protects against possible risks of diversion to

<P><U><B>Recommendation </U>4.3--The U.S<A NAME = "AO21210"></A><A NAME = "AS21211"></A><A NAME = "AS21212"></A>. government should streamline and increase the transparency<A NAME = "AB21227"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35025"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> of the export licensing process for

<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO2143"></A><A NAME = "AS2144"></A> found a great deal of uncertainty regarding rules, time lines, and the criteria used in making decisions about the
 exportability<A NAME = "AB21446"></A> of particular products.  To reduce such uncertainty, as well as to promote the use of cryptography by legitimate 
users, a number of changes in the export licensing process should occur.  For example, the presumptive<A NAME = "AO214116"></A><A NAME = "AS214117"></A><A NAME = "AS214118"></A> decision for cryptography<A NAME = "BB214125"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22342"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
submitted to the State<A NAME = "BB214135"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF13871"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> Department for export licensing should be for approval rather than disapproval.  Efforts<A NAME = "AO214160"></A><A NAME = "AS214161"></A><A NAME = "AS214162"></A> undertaken in recent 
years (1994 and 1995) to streamline the State<A NAME = "AB214188"></A> Department's licensing process for cryptography<A NAME = "AB214199"></A> exports should continue and be 
strengthened.  Finally, the U.S<A NAME = "AO214219"></A><A NAME = "AS214220"></A><A NAME = "AS214221"></A><A NAME = "AS214222"></A>. government should take steps to increase vendor and user understanding of the export<A NAME = "BB214249"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF1408"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> control regime with 
the intent of bridging the profound gap in the perceptions of national<A NAME = "BB214281"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB23924"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security authorities and the private<A NAME = "BB214292"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB275110"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector (including both

<H3><B>Perspective</B></H3>

<P>For both law enforcement and national security, cryptography is a two-edged sword.  From the standpoint of law enforcement, 
cryptography<A NAME = "AO22340"></A><A NAME = "AS22341"></A><A NAME = "BB22342"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22551"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> provides tools to help prevent crime (e.g., by helping law-abiding businesses and individuals defend themselves against 
information crimes, such as the theft of proprietary information and the impersonation of legitimate parties by illegitimate ones).  Crime 
prevention is particularly important when the crimes prevented are difficult to detect, as is the case for many kinds of information crime
.  On the other hand, cryptography's<A NAME = "AO223175"></A><A NAME = "AS223176"></A><A NAME = "AS223177"></A><A NAME = "AB223178"></A> use by criminals can damage the law<A NAME = "AB223193"></A> enforcement mission of investigating and prosecuting 
individuals who have committed crimes (by increasing the difficulty of obtaining information relevant to investigation and prosecution).<BR>



<P>Although crime prevention is an important dimension of law enforcement, the public<A NAME = "AO22523"></A><A NAME = "AS22524"></A><A NAME = "AS22525"></A><A NAME = "AS22526"></A><A NAME = "AB22527"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB247212"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> debate to date has focused primarily on the 
impact of cryptography<A NAME = "BB22551"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22716"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> on criminal<A NAME = "AB22556"></A> prosecutions and investigations.  The committee<A NAME = "AO22567"></A><A NAME = "AS22568"></A> accepts that the onset of an information age is 
likely to create many new challenges for public<A NAME = "BB225104"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB249189"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> safety, among them the greater use of cryptography by criminal elements of society.  
If law<A NAME = "AO225136"></A><A NAME = "AS225137"></A><A NAME = "AS225138"></A><A NAME = "BB225139"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB30142"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement authorities are unable to gain access to the encrypted<A NAME = "AB225160"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB28742"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> communications and stored information of criminals, some
 criminal investigations and prosecutions will be significantly impaired.  For these reasons, specific<A NAME = "AO225200"></A><A NAME = "AS225201"></A> steps should be taken to 
mitigate these difficulties, as outlined in Recommendations<A NAME = "AB225227"></A> 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5; Recommendation 5.2 is also expected to have a positive, 
though indirect, impact on this problem.<BR>



<P>In the realm of national security, cryptography<A NAME = "AO22713"></A><A NAME = "AS22714"></A><A NAME = "AS22715"></A><A NAME = "BB22716"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB22758"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> can help to defend vital information assets<A NAME = "AB22731"></A> of the United States (
Recommendations 5.1 and 5.2).  But cryptography<A NAME = "AO22755"></A><A NAME = "AS22756"></A><A NAME = "AS22757"></A><A NAME = "BB22758"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB24128"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> can also impede the collection of signals<A NAME = "BB22773"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB30332"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> intelligence.  Apart from maintaining some USML 
export controls on cryptography, other steps can be taken to mitigate potential problems in this area (Recommendation 5.5).<BR>



<P>Since 1993, the approach<A NAME = "AO2297"></A><A NAME = "AS2298"></A><A NAME = "AS2299"></A><A NAME = "AS22910"></A><A NAME = "AS22911"></A> of the U.S. government to the problems that can arise from the use of encryption<A NAME = "BB22942"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23124"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> has been an aggressive
 promotion of escrowed<A NAME = "BB22958"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB27737"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption as a pillar of the technical<A NAME = "AB22973"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB26738"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> foundation for national cryptography<A NAME = "BB22982"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB247130"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy, primarily in response
 to the law enforcement concerns described above (see Chapter 5 of the full report).  The U.S<A NAME = "AO229126"></A><A NAME = "AS229127"></A><A NAME = "AS229128"></A><A NAME = "AS229129"></A>. government's<A NAME = "AB229132"></A> promotion initiatives
 include the Escrowed<A NAME = "AB229144"></A> Encryption Standard (a voluntary Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for secure voice<A NAME = "AB229172"></A> telephony)
, the Capstone<A NAME = "AO229181"></A><A NAME = "AS229182"></A><A NAME = "AS229183"></A><A NAME = "AS229184"></A><A NAME = "AS229185"></A><A NAME = "AB229186"></A>/Fortezza initiative that provides escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB229199"></A><A HREF = "SPP9.HTM#BB283282"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities for secure data storage and communications, and 
a recent proposal to liberalize export<A NAME = "BB229229"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB5697"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> controls on certain encryption<A NAME = "BB229238"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF15234"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> products if the keys are &quot;properly escrowed.&quot;  <BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO2313"></A><A NAME = "AS2314"></A><A NAME = "AS2315"></A><A NAME = "AS2316"></A> understands the Administration's<A NAME = "AB23113"></A> rationale for promoting escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB23124"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23135"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> but believes that escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB23135"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25574"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>
 should be only one part of an overall strategy for dealing with the problems that encryption poses for law enforcement and

causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his

<P>

soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon
<P>

his new acquisition. 
<P>

In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in 
<P>

seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those 
<P>

friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy 
<P>

them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures 
<P>

against them, feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very 
<P>

strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need 

<P>

of the goodwill of the natives. 
<P>

For these reasons Louis XII, King<A NAME = "AS6913"></A><A NAME = "AB6914"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB3316"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of France, quickly occupied<A NAME = "AS6923"></A> Milan<A NAME = "BB6926"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7828"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 
<P>

and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only 
<P>

needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the gates 
<P>

to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future 
<P>

benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is 
<P>

very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, 
<P>

they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with 
<P>

little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish 
<P>

the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen 
<P>

himself in the weakest places. Thus to cause<A NAME = "AS7817"></A><A NAME = "AS7818"></A> France<A NAME = "AB7821"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8417"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> to lose Milan<A NAME = "BB7828"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB848"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> 
<P>

the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico to raise 
<P>

insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second 
<P>

time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him, and that 
<P>

his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which 
<P>

followed from the causes above mentioned. 
<P>

Nevertheless Milan<A NAME = "AO845"></A><A NAME = "AS846"></A><A NAME = "AS847"></A><A NAME = "BB848"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23718"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> was taken from France<A NAME = "BB8417"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB896"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> both the first and the 
<P>

second time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it 

<P>

remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources he 
<P>

had, and what any one in his situation would have had for 
<P>

maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the King

Charles [VIII]) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, 

<P>

he having held possession of Italy for the longest period; and you 
<P>

will see that he has done the opposite to those things which ought 
<P>

to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements. 
<P>

King<A NAME = "AO2133"></A> Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the 
<P>

Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his 
<P>

intervention. I will not blame the course taken by the king, 
<P>

because, wishing to get a foothold in Italy, and having no friends 
<P>

there- seeing rather that every door was shut to him owing to the 
<P>

conduct of Charles- he was forced to accept those friendships which he 

<P>

could get, and he would have succeeded very quickly in his design if 
<P>

in other matters he had not made some mistakes. The king, however, 
<P>

having acquired Lombardy, regained at once the authority which Charles 

<P>

had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the 
<P>

Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivoglio, my lady of 
<P>

Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of 
<P>

Piombino, the Lucchesi, the Pisans, the Sienese- everybody made 
<P>

advances to him to become his friend. Then could the Venetians realize 

<P>

the rashness of the course taken by them, which, in order that they 
<P>

might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king master of 
<P>

two-thirds of Italy. 
<P>

Let any one now consider with what little difficulty the king 
<P>

could have maintained his position in Italy had he observed the 
<P>

rules above laid down, and kept all his friends secure and 
<P>

protected; for although they were numerous they were both weak and 
<P>

timid, some afraid of the Church, some of the Venetians, and thus they 

<P>

would always have been forced to stand in with him, and by their means 

<P>

he could easily have made himself secure against those who remained 
<P>

powerful. But he was no sooner in Milan<A NAME = "AS23717"></A><A NAME = "BB23718"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB60919"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> than he did the contrary by 
<P>

assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna. It never occurred to

 restrictions on the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB9364"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB93104"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>.  Objective<A NAME = "AO9367"></A><A NAME = "AS9368"></A><A NAME = "AS9369"></A><A NAME = "AS9370"></A><A NAME = "AS9371"></A> 3 argues that some kind of government<A NAME = "AB9386"></A> role in the deployment and use of

<P>In the interests of brevity, only short rationales for the recommendations are given here.  Readers<A NAME = "AO9729"></A><A NAME = "AS9730"></A> are urged to read the full 
description of rationales for these recommendations in Chapter<A NAME = "AB9760"></A> 8 of the full report.  For the reader's convenience, the text of the 
recommendations (without any discussion) is reprinted at the end of this executive summary.<BR>



<P>

<P>

<H2><B>A FRAMEWORK FOR NATIONAL CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY</B></H2>

<P>The framework<A NAME = "AO1033"></A><A NAME = "AS1034"></A><A NAME = "AS1035"></A> for national cryptography<A NAME = "BB10312"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB11314"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy should provide coherent structure and reduce uncertainty for potential vendors 
and nongovernment and government users of cryptography<A NAME = "BB10350"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10749"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> in ways that it does not do today.  Recommendations 1, 2, and 3 support this

 any kind of cryptography<A NAME = "BB10749"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB1216"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> are inappropriate, and the committee endorses this aspect of the Administration's<A NAME = "AB10772"></A> policy position 
without reservation.  <BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO1093"></A><A NAME = "AS1094"></A><A NAME = "AS1095"></A><A NAME = "AS1096"></A> believes that a legislative<A NAME = "AB10915"></A> ban on the use of unescrowed<A NAME = "AB10928"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB301200"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption would raise both technical and legal or 
constitutional<A NAME = "AB10948"></A> issues.  Technically, many methods are available to circumvent such a ban, such as the use of data storage at easily reachable 
remote sites accessible to the data owner but inaccessible to anyone else lacking knowledge of that site.  Legally, constitutional 
issues, especially those related to free speech, would be almost certain to arise, issues that are not trivial to resolve.<BR>



<P>Finally, a ban<A NAME = "AO1115"></A><A NAME = "AS1116"></A> on the use of any form of encryption<A NAME = "BB11123"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB138293"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> would directly challenge the principle that users should be responsible for 
assessing and determining their own approaches to meeting their security needs.  This principle is discussed in greater detail in 
Recommendation 3.<BR>

government<A NAME = "AB11545"></A> secrecy in this area has led to considerable public<A NAME = "AB11564"></A> distrust and resistance.  If a broadly<A NAME = "AO11577"></A><A NAME = "AS11578"></A> acceptable social<A NAME = "AB11583"></A> consensus that 
satisfies the interests of all legitimate stakeholders is to be found regarding the nation's cryptographic future, a national discussion 
of the issue must occur.

, and only comprehensive congressional<A NAME = "AB115188"></A> deliberation and discussion conducted in the open can generate the public<A NAME = "AB115211"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB115280"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> acceptance that 
is necessary for policy in this area to succeed.  In turn, a consensus<A NAME = "AO115243"></A><A NAME = "AS115244"></A> derived from such deliberations, backed by explicit 
legislation when necessary, will lead to greater degrees of public<A NAME = "BB115280"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF115211"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> acceptance and trust, a more certain planning environment, and better 
connections between policy makers and the private sector on which the nation's economy and social fabric rest.  For these reasons, 
congressional<A NAME = "AO115345"></A><A NAME = "AS115346"></A><A NAME = "AS115347"></A><A NAME = "AB115348"></A> involvement in the debate over cryptography<A NAME = "BB115361"></A><A HREF = "SPP4.HTM#BB11915"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy is an asset rather than a liability.  <BR>

By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, the whole<A NAME = "AO5924"></A><A NAME = "AS5925"></A><A NAME = "AS5926"></A><A NAME = "AS5927"></A><A NAME = "AS5928"></A> body
of English<A NAME = "AB5935"></A> racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness<A NAME = "AB5950"></A> and size the parent
Arab<A NAME = "AB5961"></A> stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood<A NAME = "AB5984"></A> Races,
are favoured in the weights they carry. Lord<A NAME = "AO59104"></A><A NAME = "AS59105"></A> Spencer and others have shown
how the cattle<A NAME = "AB59122"></A> of England have increased in weight and in early maturity,
compared with the stock formerly kept in this country. By comparing<A NAME = "AO59166"></A><A NAME = "AS59167"></A><A NAME = "AS59168"></A> the
accounts given in old pigeon<A NAME = "AB59181"></A> treatises of carriers and tumblers with these
breeds as now existing in Britain<A NAME = "BB59208"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF39221"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, India<A NAME = "AS59211"></A><A NAME = "AS59212"></A><A NAME = "BB59213"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF39393"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and Persia<A NAME = "BB59218"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF41127"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, we can, I think,
clearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed, and come
to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.<p>
Youatt<A NAME = "AO602"></A><A NAME = "AS603"></A> gives an excellent illustration<A NAME = "AB6012"></A> of the effects of a course of
selection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far that
the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have produced
the result which ensued namely, the production of two distinct strains. The
two<A NAME = "AO60103"></A><A NAME = "AS60104"></A> flocks of Leicester<A NAME = "AB60111"></A> sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as Mr.
Youatt remarks, 'have been purely bred from the original stock of Mr.
Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion<A NAME = "AO60180"></A> existing in
the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner<A NAME = "AO60213"></A><A NAME = "AS60214"></A> of
either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr.
Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the sheep<A NAME = "BB60266"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF29282"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> possessed by
these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite
different varieties.'<p>
If there exist<A NAME = "AO616"></A> savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited
character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal
particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully
preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages<A NAME = "AO6191"></A> are so
liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring
than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of
unconscious selection going on. We see<A NAME = "AS61160"></A> the value set on animals even by the
barbarians of Tierra<A NAME = "AB61183"></A> del Fuego, by their killing<A NAME = "AS61194"></A> and devouring their old
women, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs<A NAME = "BB61227"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF35271"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.<p>
In plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the occasional
preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct
to be ranked<A NAME = "AO6248"></A> at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether or
not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing,
may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see<A NAME = "AS62124"></A>
in the varieties of the heartsease<A NAME = "AB62137"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB62204"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, rose, pelargonium<A NAME = "AO62142"></A><A NAME = "AS62143"></A><A NAME = "AS62144"></A><A NAME = "AB62145"></A>, dahlia<A NAME = "BB62148"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB62209"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and other
plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks.
No<A NAME = "AO62180"></A><A NAME = "AS62181"></A><A NAME = "AS62182"></A><A NAME = "AS62183"></A> one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease<A NAME = "BB62204"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF62137"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> or dahlia<A NAME = "BB62209"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF30100"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> from the
seed<A NAME = "AB62216"></A> of a wild plant. No<A NAME = "AO62227"></A><A NAME = "AS62228"></A><A NAME = "AS62229"></A> one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear<A NAME = "AB62250"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB62309"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
from the seed<A NAME = "AB62257"></A> of a wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling
growing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock. The pear<A NAME = "AO62306"></A><A NAME = "AS62307"></A><A NAME = "AS62308"></A><A NAME = "BB62309"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB62529"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, though
cultivated in classical times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have
been a fruit<A NAME = "AB62338"></A> of very inferior quality. I have seen<A NAME = "AO62353"></A><A NAME = "AS62354"></A> great surprise expressed
in horticultural<A NAME = "AB62365"></A> works at the wonderful skill of gardeners, in having
produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art, I
cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned,
has been followed almost unconsciously. It has consisted in always
cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly
better variety has chanced to appear, selecting it, and so onwards. But the
gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated<A NAME = "AO62521"></A><A NAME = "AS62522"></A> the best pear<A NAME = "BB62529"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF62250"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> they could
procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our
excellent fruit, in some small degree, to their having naturally chosen and
preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.<p>
A large amount of change in our cultivated plants, thus slowly and
unconsciously accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that
in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know,
the wild<A NAME = "AO6379"></A><A NAME = "AS6380"></A><A NAME = "AS6381"></A> parent<A NAME = "AB6384"></A>-stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in
our flower and kitchen<A NAME = "AB63113"></A> gardens. If it has taken centuries or thousands of
years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard
of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither<A NAME = "AS63184"></A> Australia<A NAME = "AB63187"></A>,
the Cape<A NAME = "AO63193"></A><A NAME = "AS63194"></A><A NAME = "AS63195"></A><A NAME = "AB63196"></A> of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised<A NAME = "AB63219"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6420"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these
countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance<A NAME = "AO63270"></A><A NAME = "AS63271"></A> possess the
aboriginal<A NAME = "AB63278"></A> stocks of any useful plants, but that the native<A NAME = "AO63297"></A> plants have not
been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection
comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.
<p>
In regard<A NAME = "AO644"></A><A NAME = "AS645"></A> to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised<A NAME = "BB6420"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF63219"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> man, it should not be
overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at
least during certain seasons. And in two countries very differently
circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different
constitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country
than in the other<A NAME = "AS64125"></A>, and thus by a process of 'natural<A NAME = "BB64140"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF33838"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> selection,' as will
hereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed. This,
perhaps, partly explains what has been remarked<A NAME = "AO64188"></A><A NAME = "AS64189"></A> by some authors, namely,
that the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species
than the varieties kept in civilised<A NAME = "AB64237"></A> countries.<p>
On the view<A NAME = "AO656"></A> here given of the all-important part which selection by man has
played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic<A NAME = "AO6555"></A> races show
adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants or fancies.
We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our
domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external
characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. Man can
hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure
excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what
is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting<A NAME = "AO65223"></A> on variations which
are first given to him in some slight degree by nature. No<A NAME = "AO65254"></A> man would ever
try to make a fantail, till he saw<A NAME = "AO65277"></A><A NAME = "AS65278"></A><A NAME = "AS65279"></A> a pigeon<A NAME = "BB65284"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65327"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> with a tail developed in some
slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter<A NAME = "AB65315"></A> till he saw<A NAME = "AS65322"></A> a pigeon<A NAME = "BB65327"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65448"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> with a
crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any
character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch
his attention. But to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail,
is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect. The man who first<A NAME = "AS65441"></A>
selected a pigeon<A NAME = "BB65448"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65476"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> with a slightly larger tail, never<A NAME = "AS65461"></A> dreamed what the
descendants of that pigeon<A NAME = "BB65476"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF50341"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> would become through long-continued, partly
unconscious and partly methodical selection. Perhaps the parent<A NAME = "AO65505"></A><A NAME = "AS65506"></A> bird<A NAME = "AB65509"></A> of all
fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present
Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as
many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted. Perhaps the first
pouter-pigeon did not<A NAME = "AO65592"></A><A NAME = "AS65593"></A><A NAME = "AS65594"></A> inflate its crop much more than the turbit<A NAME = "BB65611"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF41652"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> now does
the upper part of its oesophagus<A NAME = "BB65628"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF41717"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, a habit which is disregarded by all
fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed.<p>
Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be
necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives<A NAME = "AO6642"></A> extremely small
differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight,
in one's own possession. Nor must the value<A NAME = "AO6690"></A> which would formerly be set on
any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of
by the value which would now be set on them, after several breeds have once
fairly been established. Many slight<A NAME = "AO66169"></A><A NAME = "AS66170"></A> differences might, and indeed do now,
arise amongst pigeons<A NAME = "BB66190"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB69136"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, which are rejected as faults or deviations from the
standard of perfection of each breed. The common<A NAME = "AO66225"></A><A NAME = "AS66226"></A> goose<A NAME = "AB66229"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB69444"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> has not given rise to
any marked varieties; hence the Thoulouse and the common breed, which differ
only in colour, that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited
as distinct at our poultry-shows.<p>
I think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticed namely
that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic
breeds. But, in fact, a breed<A NAME = "AO6764"></A>, like a dialect of a language, can hardly be
said to have had a definite origin. A man<A NAME = "AO67101"></A> preserves and breeds from an
individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more care than
usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them, and the improved<A NAME = "AO67162"></A><A NAME = "AS67163"></A>
individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood<A NAME = "AB67178"></A>. But as yet they
will hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their
history will be disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and
gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will get recognised as
something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a
provincial name. In semi<A NAME = "AS67291"></A><A NAME = "AB67292"></A>-civilised countries, with little free
communication, the spreading<A NAME = "AO67309"></A> and knowledge of any new sub-breed will be a
slow process. As soon as the points<A NAME = "AO67344"></A> of value of the new sub-breed are once
fully acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious
selection will always tend, perhaps more at one period than at another, as
the breed rises or falls in fashion, perhaps more<A NAME = "AS67429"></A> in one district than in
another, according to the state of civilisation<A NAME = "AB67454"></A> of the inhabitants slowly to
add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be. But
the chance<A NAME = "AO67495"></A> will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of
such slow, varying, and insensible changes.<p>
I must now say<A NAME = "AO688"></A> a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the reverse,
to man's power of selection. A high degree of variability is obviously
favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work on; not
that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient, with extreme
care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in
almost any desired direction. But as variations manifestly useful or
pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance<A NAME = "AO68160"></A> of their appearance
will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept; and
hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success. On this
principle<A NAME = "AO68221"></A><A NAME = "AS68222"></A> Marshall has remarked, with respect to the sheep<A NAME = "AB68239"></A> of parts of
Yorkshire, that 'as they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly <I>
in small lots,</I> they never can be improved.' On the other hand,
nurserymen, from raising large stocks of the same plants, are generally far
more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. The
keeping<A NAME = "AO68347"></A> of a large number of individuals of a species in any country
requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of
life, so as to breed freely in that country. When the individuals of any
species are scanty, all the individuals, whatever their quality may be, will
generally be allowed to breed, and this will effectually prevent selection.
But probably the most important point of all, is, that the animal or plant
should be so highly useful to man, or so much valued by him, that the
closest<A NAME = "AO68529"></A> attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the
qualities or structure of each individual. Unless such attention be paid
nothing can be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was most
fortunate that the strawberry<A NAME = "AO68610"></A><A NAME = "AS68611"></A><A NAME = "AB68612"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB68649"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> began to vary just when gardeners began to
attend closely to this plant. No<A NAME = "AO68641"></A><A NAME = "AS68642"></A> doubt the strawberry<A NAME = "BB68649"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB68783"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had always varied
since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected. As
soon, however, as gardeners<A NAME = "AO68688"></A> picked out individual plants with slightly
larger, earlier, or better<A NAME = "AO68709"></A> fruit, and raised seedlings from them, and again
picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then, there appeared<A NAME = "AO68750"></A><A NAME = "AS68751"></A> (
aided by some crossing with distinct species) those many admirable varieties
of the strawberry<A NAME = "BB68783"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF68612"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> which have been raised during the last thirty or forty
years.<p>
In the case of animals with separate sexes, facility<A NAME = "AO6918"></A> in preventing crosses
is an important element of success in the formation of new races, at least,
in a country which is already stocked with other races. In this respect<A NAME = "AO6980"></A>
enclosure of the land plays a part. Wandering<A NAME = "AO6997"></A> savages or the inhabitants of
open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species. Pigeons<A NAME = "AO69134"></A><A NAME = "AS69135"></A><A NAME = "BB69136"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB69225"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for
thus many races may be kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and
this circumstance<A NAME = "AO69199"></A> must have largely favoured the improvement and formation
of new breeds. Pigeons<A NAME = "AS69224"></A><A NAME = "BB69225"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF157"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at
a very quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed
they serve for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling
habits, cannot be matched, and, although so much valued by women and
children, we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do
sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country, often from
islands. Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than
others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey<A NAME = "AS69434"></A><A NAME = "AB69435"></A>,
peacock<A NAME = "AS69439"></A><A NAME = "AB69440"></A>, goose<A NAME = "AS69443"></A><A NAME = "BB69444"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF66229"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, &amp;c., may be attributed in main part to selection not
having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them;
in donkeys<A NAME = "AS69498"></A><A NAME = "AB69499"></A>, from only a few<A NAME = "AO69508"></A> being kept by poor people, and little attention
paid to their breeding; in peacocks<A NAME = "AS69537"></A><A NAME = "AB69538"></A>, from not being very easily reared and a
large stock not kept; in geese<A NAME = "AS69567"></A><A NAME = "AB69568"></A>, from being valuable<A NAME = "AO69575"></A><A NAME = "AS69576"></A> only for two purposes,
food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in
the display<A NAME = "AB69616"></A> of distinct breeds.<p>
To sum<A NAME = "AS704"></A> up on the origin of our Domestic<A NAME = "AB7019"></A> Races of animals and plants. I
believe that the conditions of life, from their action<A NAME = "AS7050"></A> on the reproductive<A NAME = "BB7057"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF24260"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
system, are so far of the highest importance as causing variability. I do
not believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency, under
all circumstances, with all organic beings, as some authors have thought.
The effects<A NAME = "AO70133"></A> of variability are modified by various degrees of inheritance
and of reversion. Variability<A NAME = "AO70160"></A> is governed by many unknown laws, more
especially by that of correlation of growth. Something<A NAME = "AO70191"></A> may be attributed to
the direct action of the conditions of life. Something<A NAME = "AO70218"></A> must be attributed to
use and disuse. The final<A NAME = "AO70237"></A> result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In
some cases, I do not doubt that the intercrossing of species, aboriginally
distinct, has played an important part in the origin of our domestic
productions. When in any country<A NAME = "AO70310"></A> several domestic breeds have once been
established, their occasional intercrossing<A NAME = "AO70331"></A>, with the aid of selection, has,
no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the
importance of the crossing of varieties has, I believe, been greatly
exaggerated, both in regard<A NAME = "AO70401"></A> to animals and to those plants which are
propagated by seed. In plants<A NAME = "AO70428"></A> which are temporarily propagated by cuttings,
buds, &amp;c., the importance of the crossing both of distinct species and
of varieties is immense; for the cultivator<A NAME = "AO70482"></A> here quite disregards the
extreme variability both of hybrids<A NAME = "AS70501"></A><A NAME = "AS70502"></A> and mongrels<A NAME = "BB70507"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF39911"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and the frequent sterility<A NAME = "AB70516"></A>
of hybrids; but the cases<A NAME = "AO70527"></A><A NAME = "AS70528"></A> of plants not propagated by seed<A NAME = "AB70541"></A> are of little
importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary. Over all these
causes<A NAME = "AO70574"></A><A NAME = "AS70575"></A> of Change<A NAME = "AB70580"></A> I am convinced that the accumulative action of Selection,
whether applied methodically and more quickly, or unconsciously and more
slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the predominant power.

<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO1563"></A><A NAME = "AS1564"></A><A NAME = "AS1565"></A> believes that the importance of the U.S. information technology industry to U.S. economic<A NAME = "AB15632"></A> interests and national<A NAME = "BB15639"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB158278"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
security is large enough that some prudent<A NAME = "AO15655"></A><A NAME = "AS15656"></A><A NAME = "AS15657"></A> risks can be taken to hedge against the potential damage to that industry, and some 
relaxation of export<A NAME = "BB15695"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB17212"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> controls on cryptography<A NAME = "BB156102"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15816"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is warranted.  In the long term, U.S<A NAME = "AO156117"></A><A NAME = "AS156118"></A>. signals intelligence<A NAME = "AB156123"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB156254"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capability is likely to decrease 
in any case.  Consequently, the committee believes that the benefits of relaxation--namely helping to promote better information 
security for U.S. companies operating internationally and to extend U.S. leadership in this critical industry--are worth the short-term 
risk that the greater<A NAME = "AO156221"></A><A NAME = "AS156222"></A><A NAME = "AS156223"></A> availability of U.S. products with stronger encryption<A NAME = "BB156238"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB170270"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities will further impede U.S. signals 
intelligence<A NAME = "BB156254"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF156123"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capability.<BR>



<P>Relaxation<A NAME = "AO1581"></A><A NAME = "AS1582"></A><A NAME = "AS1583"></A><A NAME = "AS1584"></A><A NAME = "AB1585"></A> of export controls on cryptography<A NAME = "BB15816"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15841"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is consistent with the basic principle of encouraging the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB15841"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB15877"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> in 
an information society for several reasons.  First, relaxation<A NAME = "AO15861"></A><A NAME = "AS15862"></A><A NAME = "AS15863"></A><A NAME = "AS15864"></A> would encourage the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB15877"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB158222"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> by creating an environment 
in which U.S. and multinational firms and users are able to use the same security<A NAME = "BB158117"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF138127"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> products in the United<A NAME = "BB158126"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB160237"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States and abroad and 
thus help promote better information security for U.S. firms operating internationally.  Second, it would increase the availability 
of good cryptography products in the United States.  Third, it would expand<A NAME = "AO158195"></A><A NAME = "AS158196"></A><A NAME = "AS158197"></A><A NAME = "AS158198"></A> U.S. business opportunities overseas for information 
technology sales incorporating stronger cryptography<A NAME = "BB158222"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB160124"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for confidentiality by allowing U.S. vendors to compete with foreign vendors on a 
more equal footing, thereby helping to maintain U.S. leadership in fields critical to national<A NAME = "BB158278"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB160185"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security and economic<A NAME = "AB158285"></A> competitiveness
.<BR>



<P>At the same time, cryptography is inherently dual-use in character (more so than most other items on the USML), with important 
applications to both civilian and military purposes.  While this fact<A NAME = "AO16066"></A><A NAME = "AS16067"></A><A NAME = "AS16068"></A> suggests to some that the export<A NAME = "AB16081"></A> of all cryptography should be 
regulated under the Commerce<A NAME = "AB160101"></A> Control List (CCL), the fact remains that cryptography<A NAME = "AO160120"></A><A NAME = "AS160121"></A><A NAME = "AS160122"></A><A NAME = "AS160123"></A><A NAME = "BB160124"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB17241"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is a particularly critical military<A NAME = "AB160135"></A> application for 
which few technical<A NAME = "AB160147"></A> alternatives are available.  The USML<A NAME = "AO160158"></A><A NAME = "AS160159"></A> is designed to regulate technologies with such applications for reasons of 
national<A NAME = "BB160185"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23736"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security; retention<A NAME = "AO160190"></A><A NAME = "AS160191"></A> of some controls will mitigate the loss to U.S. national<A NAME = "BB160212"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB160256"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security interests in the short term, allow<A NAME = "AO160227"></A><A NAME = "AS160228"></A><A NAME = "AS160229"></A><A NAME = "AS160230"></A><A NAME = "AS160231"></A> the

<H3><B>Specific Recommendations</B></H3>

<P><U><B>Recommendation 4</U>: Export controls on cryptography should be progressively relaxed but not eliminated.</B><BR>



<P>Recommendations<A NAME = "AO1681"></A><A NAME = "AS1682"></A><A NAME = "AS1683"></A> 4.1 and 4.2 below describe the committee's judgments about expeditious changes to the present export<A NAME = "BB16834"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB16894"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> control 
regime that would result in a better alignment with technological and market<A NAME = "AB16862"></A> trends.  Recommendation<A NAME = "AO16867"></A><A NAME = "AS16868"></A><A NAME = "AS16869"></A><A NAME = "AS16870"></A> 4.3 is intended to promote other 
important changes in the export<A NAME = "BB16894"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB168135"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> control regime that would reduce uncertainty about the export<A NAME = "AB168113"></A> control licensing process and eliminate 
unnecessary friction between the export<A NAME = "BB168135"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB17021"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> control regime and those affected by it.<BR>



<P>Recommendations<A NAME = "AO1701"></A><A NAME = "AS1702"></A> 4.1 and 4.2 describe changes to the current export<A NAME = "BB17021"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB190221"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> control regime, and unless stated explicitly, leave current 
regulations and proposals in place.  Two<A NAME = "AO17051"></A><A NAME = "AS17052"></A><A NAME = "AB17053"></A> features of the current export regime are sufficiently desirable to warrant special attention here
.  The first is that the current liberal export control treatment for certain classes of products should be continued: these 
products<A NAME = "AO170124"></A><A NAME = "AS170125"></A> are (1) products that provide confidentiality only for use in banking<A NAME = "AB170150"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB202259"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> or money transactions and (2) products that are limited 
in functionality to providing capabilities for authentication, access control, and data integrity without capabilities for 
confidentiality.  The second<A NAME = "AO170209"></A><A NAME = "AS170210"></A><A NAME = "AS170211"></A><A NAME = "AS170212"></A><A NAME = "AS170213"></A> feature of the current export<A NAME = "AB170224"></A> regime that should be continued is that the United<A NAME = "BB170243"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB186155"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States should maintain its 
embargo on exports<A NAME = "AB170259"></A> of all products with encryption<A NAME = "BB170270"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB172138"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities to rogue nations, even when these products are controlled by the CCL.<BR>



<P>Finally, relaxation<A NAME = "AO1723"></A><A NAME = "AS1724"></A><A NAME = "AS1725"></A> of U.S. export<A NAME = "BB17212"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB186372"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> controls is only the first step on the road to greater use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB17241"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB17275"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> around the world
.  If foreign<A NAME = "AO17253"></A><A NAME = "AS17254"></A> nations decide that their national interests are threatened by cryptography<A NAME = "BB17275"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB18258"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, they may choose to apply import controls
 on products with encryption capabilities; if they do so, U.S<A NAME = "AO172111"></A><A NAME = "AS172112"></A>. vendors may be faced with the need to develop products with 
encryption<A NAME = "BB172138"></A><A HREF = "SPP5.HTM#BB17460"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities on a nation-by-nation basis.  <BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation<A NAME = "AO1743"></A><A NAME = "AS1744"></A> </U>4.1--Products providing confidentiality at a level that meets most general commercial<A NAME = "AB17430"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB34628"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> requirements should be 
easily exportable [2].</B>  <B>Today, products<A NAME = "AO17453"></A><A NAME = "AS17454"></A><A NAME = "AS17455"></A> with encryption<A NAME = "BB17460"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB186123"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities that incorporate the 56-bit DES<A NAME = "AB17475"></A> algorithm provide this level of 
confidentiality and should be easily exportable.</B><BR>



<P>Recommendation 4.1 is made subject to a number of collateral conditions:<BR>



<P><li>  Products<A NAME = "AO1783"></A><A NAME = "AS1784"></A> covered under Recommendation<A NAME = "AB17811"></A><A HREF = "SPP6.HTM#BB18017"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 4.1 must be designed in a way that would preclude their repeated use to increase 
confidentiality beyond the acceptable level.  <BR>

<P>Information vulnerabilities cannot be eliminated through the use of any single tool.  For example, cryptography<A NAME = "AO4729"></A><A NAME = "AS4730"></A><A NAME = "BB4731"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4793"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> cannot prevent a
 party authorized to view information from improperly disclosing that information to someone else.  However, as part of a 
comprehensive approach to addressing information vulnerabilities, cryptography<A NAME = "AO4790"></A><A NAME = "AS4791"></A><A NAME = "AS4792"></A><A NAME = "BB4793"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB493"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> (<A HREF="281e.html">Box 2</A>) is a powerful tool that can help to assure the 
confidentiality and integrity of information in transit and in storage and to authenticate the asserted identity of individuals and computer<A NAME = "AB47163"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8780"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
systems.  Information that has been properly encrypted cannot be understood or interpreted by those lacking the appropriate 
cryptographic &quot;key&quot;; information that has been integrity-checked cannot be altered without detection.  Properly authenticated<A NAME = "AO47232"></A><A NAME = "AS47233"></A> 
identities can help to restrict access to information resources to those properly authorized individuals and to take fuller advantage of 
audit<A NAME = "AB47278"></A> trails to track down parties who have abused their authorized access.<BR>



<P>Cryptography<A NAME = "AO491"></A><A NAME = "AS492"></A><A NAME = "BB493"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4941"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> has limitations.  Against a determined opponent that is highly motivated to gain unauthorized access to data, 
cryptography<A NAME = "AO4939"></A><A NAME = "AS4940"></A><A NAME = "BB4941"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB49117"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> may lead that opponent to exploit some other vulnerability in the system or network on which the relevant data is communicated 
or stored, and such an exploitation may well be successful.  But the use<A NAME = "AO49111"></A><A NAME = "AS49112"></A> of cryptography<A NAME = "BB49117"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB5130"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> can help to raise the cost of gaining 
improper access to data, may prevent a resource-poor opponent from being successful at all, and may force the opponent into a more 
vulnerable position.  For example, trying to bribe a competitor's employee makes a spy more vulnerable to apprehension than does passive 
eavesdropping on unencrypted data.<BR>

that has sought to maximize the protection of U.S. military and diplomatic communications while denying the confidentiality benefits
 of cryptography<A NAME = "BB5990"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB59114"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> to foreign adversaries through the use of export<A NAME = "AB59107"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6113"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> controls on cryptography<A NAME = "BB59114"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB59162"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> and related technical<A NAME = "AB59121"></A> data.  More 
recently, the U.S<A NAME = "AO59133"></A><A NAME = "AS59134"></A><A NAME = "AS59135"></A>. government has aggressively promoted the domestic use of a certain kind of cryptography<A NAME = "BB59162"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61129"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> (escrowed encryption) that 
would provide strong protection for legitimate uses but would permit legally authorized access by law<A NAME = "BB59202"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6186"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement officials when

controversial because its promotion by the U.S. government appears to some important constituencies to assert the primacy of information 
access needs of law<A NAME = "BB6186"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7541"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB6193"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB61177"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security over the information security<A NAME = "AB61104"></A> needs of businesses and individuals.

controls on cryptography<A NAME = "BB61129"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65104"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> have been controversial because they pit the interests of U.S. vendors and some U.S multinational corporations 
against some of the needs of national<A NAME = "BB61177"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB7546"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security.<BR>

security and law enforcement interests of the United States Government, . . . commercial interests of United States industry; and . . . 
privacy interests of United States citizens; and . . . the effect on commercial interests of United States industry of export controls 
on cryptographic technologies.&quot;  The legislation<A NAME = "AO63221"></A><A NAME = "AS63222"></A><A NAME = "AS63223"></A> also directed all appropriate agencies of the Department<A NAME = "AB63240"></A> of Defense, 
including the National Security Agency, to cooperate fully with the National<A NAME = "BB63268"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB50425"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> Research Council in its activities in carrying out the study
.  The committee<A NAME = "AO63294"></A> deliberated for approximately 18 months, gathering input from a large number of unclassified and classified 
sources.  Because the contentious<A NAME = "AO63334"></A><A NAME = "AS63335"></A> public<A NAME = "AB63338"></A> policy problem involves confidentiality, the committee focused its primary efforts there, 
while addressing collateral uses of cryptography such as assurance of data integrity and user or system authentication without going 
into detail.<BR>



<P>Input<A NAME = "AO651"></A><A NAME = "AS652"></A> from these diverse sources demonstrated to the committee a considerable amount of confrontation and disconnect between 
interest groups (e.g., information technology vendors, businesses, law enforcement, private individuals, national security) that fail to
 understand or appreciate the validity of each other's policy needs and interests with respect to cryptography<A NAME = "BB65104"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65253"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>.  Furthermore, 
much of the public debate has been couched in hyperbole and has tended to draw lines that divide the policy issues in an overly 
simplistic manner, i.e., the privacy rights of individuals and businesses against the needs of national security and law enforcement.  As 
observed above, such a dichotomy does have a kernel of truth.  But viewed in the large, the dichotomy as posed is misleading.  If 
cryptography<A NAME = "AO65248"></A><A NAME = "AS65249"></A><A NAME = "AS65250"></A><A NAME = "AS65251"></A><A NAME = "AS65252"></A><A NAME = "BB65253"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB65328"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> can protect the trade<A NAME = "AB65262"></A><A HREF = "SPP22.HTM#BB61460"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> secrets and proprietary<A NAME = "AB65269"></A> information of businesses and thereby reduce economic<A NAME = "AB65284"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB33258"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> espionage (which it can), 
it also supports in a most important manner the job of law enforcement.  If cryptography<A NAME = "AO65326"></A><A NAME = "AS65327"></A><A NAME = "BB65328"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB75129"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> can help protect nationally critical 
information systems and networks against unauthorized penetration (which it can), it also supports the national security of the United 
States.  Framing<A NAME = "AO65385"></A><A NAME = "AS65386"></A> national cryptography<A NAME = "BB65391"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB6719"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy in this larger context would help to reduce some of the polarization among the relevant 
stakeholders.<BR>



<P>The conduct<A NAME = "AO673"></A><A NAME = "AS674"></A><A NAME = "AS675"></A><A NAME = "AS676"></A> of the debate regarding national cryptography<A NAME = "BB6719"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB67119"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy has been complicated because certain elements of the debate 
have been removed from public<A NAME = "AB6751"></A> view due to security<A NAME = "AB6760"></A> classification.  However, for reasons noted in the preface, the cleared<A NAME = "AO6781"></A><A NAME = "AS6782"></A> members 
of the committee (13 of its 16 members) concluded that <B>the debate over national cryptography<A NAME = "BB67119"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB75175"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy can be carried out in a 
reasonable manner on an unclassified basis.</B>  Although many of the details relevant to policy makers are necessarily classified, these 
details are not central to making policy arguments one way or the other.  Classified material, while important to operational matters 
in specific cases, is neither essential to the big picture of why policy has the shape and texture that it does today nor required
 for the general outline of how technology will, and policy should, evolve in the future.<BR>

suited, cryptography<A NAME = "AO7984"></A><A NAME = "AS7985"></A><A NAME = "BB7986"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB79130"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> provides a number of capabilities that few other technologies can provide as effectively.  Furthermore, the 
knowledge<A NAME = "AO79120"></A><A NAME = "AS79121"></A><A NAME = "AS79122"></A><A NAME = "AS79123"></A> underlying good cryptography<A NAME = "BB79130"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB81103"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> easily diffuses through national boundaries, and the United<A NAME = "AB79147"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB79200"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States does not have a monopoly on 
cryptographic<A NAME = "BB79165"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB401212"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> technologies.  The committee<A NAME = "AO79172"></A><A NAME = "AS79173"></A><A NAME = "AS79174"></A> thus believes that the widespread nongovernment<A NAME = "AB79187"></A> use of cryptography in the United<A NAME = "BB79200"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB9165"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States and 
abroad is inevitable in the long run.  If this is true, the role<A NAME = "AO79232"></A><A NAME = "AS79233"></A> of national cryptography<A NAME = "BB79240"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8117"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy should be to facilitate a judicious 
transition between today's world of high information vulnerability and a future world of greater information security, while to the extent
 possible meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement and information gathering for national security and foreign policy 
purposes.  National policy can have a profound effect on the rate and nature of the transition from today's world to that of the long-
term future.  <BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO813"></A><A NAME = "AS814"></A><A NAME = "AS815"></A> found that <B>current national cryptography<A NAME = "BB8117"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8167"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy is not adequate to support the information security<A NAME = "AB8136"></A> requirements 
of an information society.</B>  (The purposes<A NAME = "AO8155"></A><A NAME = "AS8156"></A> and tools of national cryptography<A NAME = "BB8167"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8313"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy are summarized in <A HREF="281a.html">Box 4</A>.)  Indeed, current<A NAME = "AO8188"></A><A NAME = "AS8189"></A> 
policy discourages the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB81103"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8732"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, whether intentionally or not, and in so doing<A NAME = "AO81120"></A><A NAME = "AS81121"></A><A NAME = "AS81122"></A> impedes the ability of the nation to use 
cryptographic<A NAME = "AB81142"></A> tools that would help to remediate<A NAME = "AB81155"></A> certain important vulnerabilities.  For example, through the use of export controls, 
national<A NAME = "AO81181"></A><A NAME = "AS81182"></A> policy has explicitly sought to limit the use of encryption<A NAME = "BB81203"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB10537"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> abroad but has also had the effect of reducing the domestic 
availability to businesses and other users of products with strong encryption capabilities.<BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO833"></A><A NAME = "AS834"></A> believes that national cryptography<A NAME = "BB8313"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB83100"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy must recognize trends in other aspects of information technology such 
as the speed with which such technology evolves.  The committee understands that trade-offs are inevitable and that no stakeholder
 will be fully satisfied with the result.  Moreover, national<A NAME = "AO8396"></A><A NAME = "AS8397"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB83100"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB855"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy is inherently situated internationally, and no 
policy will gain domestic acceptance unless it meshes with policies of other nations.<BR>



<P>National<A NAME = "AO851"></A><A NAME = "AS852"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB855"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB89116"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy should support three objectives:<BR>



<P><B>1.  Broad availability of cryptography to all legitimate elements of U.S. society.</B>  Cryptography<A NAME = "AO8728"></A><A NAME = "AS8729"></A><A NAME = "AS8730"></A><A NAME = "AS8731"></A><A NAME = "BB8732"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB87162"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> supports the confidentiality 
and integrity of digitally represented information (e.g., computer data, software, video) and the authentication of individuals and
 computer<A NAME = "BB8780"></A><A HREF = "SPP2.HTM#BB8791"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> systems communicating with other computer<A NAME = "BB8791"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF47163"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> systems; these capabilities<A NAME = "AO8798"></A><A NAME = "AS8799"></A><A NAME = "AS87100"></A><A NAME = "AS87101"></A> are important in varying degrees to protecting 
the information security<A NAME = "AB87123"></A> interests of many different private and public stakeholders, including law<A NAME = "BB87144"></A><A HREF = "SPP7.HTM#BB23729"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB87151"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB8977"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
security.  Furthermore, cryptography<A NAME = "AO87159"></A><A NAME = "AS87160"></A><A NAME = "AS87161"></A><A NAME = "BB87162"></A><A HREF = "SPP3.HTM#BB89164"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> can help to support law<A NAME = "AB87173"></A> enforcement objectives in preventing information crimes such as economic

their power<A NAME = "AO1795"></A>, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce the 
<P>

Romans to be his friends without first humbling him, nor did the 
<P>

influence<A NAME = "AS1813"></A> of Antiochus<A NAME = "AB1818"></A> make them agree that he should retain any 
<P>

lordship over the country. Because the Romans<A NAME = "AO18215"></A> did in these instances 
<P>

what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only 
<P>

present troubles, but also future ones, for which they must prepare 
<P>

with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy 
<P>

them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer 
<P>

in time because the malady has become incurable; for it happens in 
<P>

this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the 
<P>

beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, 
<P>

but in the course of time, not having been either detected or 
<P>

treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to 
<P>

cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that 
<P>

arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to 
<P>

see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been 

<P>

foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can 

<P>

see them. there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, 
<P>

foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a 
<P>

war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is 
<P>

not to be avoided, but is only put off to the advantage of others; 
<P>

moreover they wished<A NAME = "AS2007"></A><A NAME = "AS2008"></A> to fight with Philip and Antiochus<A NAME = "BB20021"></A><A HREF = "SPP76.HTM#BB22956"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> in Greece<A NAME = "BB20026"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB37822"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> so 
<P>

as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but 
<P>

this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is for 
<P>

ever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:- Let us enjoy the 
<P>

benefits of the time- but rather the benefits of their own valour 
<P>

and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to 
<P>

bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good. 
<P>

But let<A NAME = "AS2075"></A> us turn to France<A NAME = "BB20714"></A><A HREF = "SPP8.HTM#BB25720"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and inquire whether she has done any of

states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince,
<P>

than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs

<P>

of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they
<P>

arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his
<P>

state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive

<P>

force; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything
<P>

sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.
<P>

We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not
<P>

have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor those of
<P>

Pope Julius in '10, unless he had been long established in his
<P>

dominions. For the hereditary<A NAME = "AO399"></A> prince has less cause and less necessity

<P>

to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless
<P>

extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to
<P>

expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards
<P>

him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and
<P>

motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves
<P>

the toothing for another.

<h3>CHAPTER III
<P>

CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES</h3>
<P>

<P>

BUT the difficulties<A NAME = "AO507"></A> occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it
<P>

be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which,
<P>

taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly

<P>

from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new
<P>

principalities; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to
<P>

better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms
<P>

against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they
<P>

afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse. This
<P>

follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always

recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause 

<P>

to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would 
<P>

attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as 
<P>

long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him 
<P>

with the greatest difficulty. 
<P>

The other<A NAME = "AO1245"></A> and better course is to send colonies to one or two 
<P>

places, which may be as keys to that state, for it necessary either to 

<P>

do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and 
<P>

infantry. A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or 

<P>

no expense he can send them out and keep them there, and he offends 
<P>

a minority only of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to 

<P>

give them to the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining 

<P>

poor and scattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest 
<P>

being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are 
<P>

anxious not to err for fear it should happen to them as it has to 
<P>

those who have been despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these 
<P>

colonies are not costly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and 

<P>

the injured, as has been said, I being poor and scattered, cannot 
<P>

hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well 
<P>

treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter 
<P>

injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury 
<P>

that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does 
<P>

not stand in fear of revenge. 
<P>

But in maintaining<A NAME = "AO1427"></A><A NAME = "AS1428"></A> armed men there in place of colonies<A NAME = "AB14223"></A> one spends 
<P>

much more, having to consume on the garrison all income<A NAME = "AS14321"></A><A NAME = "AB14322"></A> from the 
<P>

state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are 
<P>

exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the 
<P>

shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with 
<P>

hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst 
<P>

beaten on their own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason,

them. And they are not to be found otherwise, because men will 
<P>

always prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by 
<P>

constraint. Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels, 
<P>

whencesoever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and 
<P>

not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels. 
<P>

<h3>CHAPTER<A NAME = "AS24652"></A><A NAME = "AS24653"></A><A NAME = "AB24654"></A> XXIV 
<P>

THE PRINCES<A NAME = "AB246515"></A> OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES</h3> 
<P>

<P>

THE previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new 
<P>

prince to appear well established, and render him at once more 
<P>

secure and fixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. 
<P>

For the actions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than 
<P>

those of an hereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they 
<P>

gain more men and bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are 

<P>

attracted more by the present than by the past, and when they find the 

<P>

present good they enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make 
<P>

the utmost defence for a prince if he fails them not in other 
<P>

things. Thus it will be a double glory to him to have established a 
<P>

new<A NAME = "AO24783"></A> principality, and adorned and strengthened it with good laws, good 

<P>

arms, good allies, and with a good example; so will it be a double 
<P>

disgrace to him who, born a prince, shall lose his state by want of 
<P>

wisdom. 
<P>

And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states 
<P>

in Italy in our times, such as the King<A NAME = "AS248319"></A><A NAME = "BB248320"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF110324"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Naples, the Duke of 
<P>

Milan<A NAME = "AS24843"></A><A NAME = "BB24844"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF1220"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and others, there will be found in them, firstly, one common 
<P>

defect in regard to arms from the causes which have been discussed 
<P>

at length; in the next place, some one of them will be seen, either to 

<P>

have had the people hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, 
<P>

he has not known how to secure the nobles. In the absence of these

it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing 
<P>

can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its 
<P>

own strength. And one's own forces  are those which are composed 
<P>

either of subjects, citizens, or dependants; all others are 
<P>

mercenaries or auxiliaries. And the way to take ready one's own forces 

<P>

will be easily found if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected 
<P>

upon, and if one will consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the 

<P>

Great, and many republics and princes have armed and organized 
<P>

themselves, to which rules I entirely commit myself.

<h3>CHAPTER XIV 
<P>

THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE 


ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR</h3> 
<P>

<P>

A PRINCE<A NAME = "AO14235"></A> ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select 
<P>

anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; 
<P>

for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of 
<P>

such force that it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it 

<P>

often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on 

<P>

the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease 
<P>

than of arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of 
<P>

your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire 

<P>

a state is to be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being 
<P>

martial, from a private<A NAME = "AO14329"></A><A NAME = "AS143210"></A> person became Duke<A NAME = "BB143217"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF5764"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Milan; and the sons, 
<P>

through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became 

<P>

private persons. For among other evils which being unarmed brings you, 

<P>

it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies 
<P>

against which a prince ought to guard himself, as is shown later on. 
<P>

Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the 
<P>

unarmed; and it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield 
<P>

their enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In 
<P>

the first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass 
<P>

anything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then 
<P>

they are rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have 
<P>

conquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the 
<P>

reasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it 

<P>

is easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that 
<P>

persuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, 
<P>

when they believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe 
<P>

by force. 
<P>

If Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could 
<P>

not have enforced their constitutions for long- as happened in our 
<P>

time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order 
<P>

of things immediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and 
<P>

he had no means of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making 
<P>

the unbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great 
<P>

difficulties in consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers 
<P>

are in the ascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but 
<P>

when these are overcome, and those who envied them their success are 
<P>

exterminated, they will begin to be respected, and they will 
<P>

continue afterwards powerful, secure, honoured, and happy. 
<P>

To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears 
<P>

some resemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a 
<P>

like kind: it is Hiero the Syracusan. This man rose from a private 
<P>

station to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything 
<P>

to fortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose 

<P>

him for their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made 
<P>

their prince. He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, 
<P>

that one who writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to 
<P>

be a king. This man<A NAME = "AO53811"></A><A NAME = "AS53812"></A> abolished the old soldiery<A NAME = "AB53821"></A>, organized the new,

<LI>  This report<A NAME = "AO4445"></A><A NAME = "AS4446"></A><A NAME = "AS4447"></A> is not a study on the future of the National<A NAME = "BB44428"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB502178"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> Security Agency (NSA) in the post<A NAME = "AB44443"></A>-Cold War era.  A determination of 
what missions the NSA should be pursuing and/or how it should pursue those missions was not in the committee's charge.  The report<A NAME = "AO444103"></A><A NAME = "AS444104"></A><A NAME = "AS444105"></A> 
does touch lightly on technological<A NAME = "AB444117"></A> trends that affect the ability to undertake the missions to which cryptography<A NAME = "BB444142"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB44861"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is relevant, but 
only to the extent necessary to frame the cryptography issue.<BR>



<P>At the same time, this report<A NAME = "AO44611"></A><A NAME = "AS44612"></A> does address certain conditions of the political, social, and technological<A NAME = "AB44633"></A> environment that will 
affect the answers that anyone would formulate to these questions, such as the potential<A NAME = "AO44669"></A> impact on policy of a world that offers many 
users the possibilities of secure communications.  <BR>



<P><LI>  This report<A NAME = "AO4485"></A><A NAME = "AS4486"></A> is not a study of computer and communications<A NAME = "AB44823"></A> security, although of course cryptography is a key element of such 
security.  Even the strongest cryptography<A NAME = "AO44857"></A><A NAME = "AS44858"></A><A NAME = "AS44859"></A><A NAME = "AS44860"></A><A NAME = "BB44861"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB45088"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is not very useful unless it is part of a secure <I>system</I>, and those responsible for security 
must be concerned about everything from the trustworthiness of individuals writing the computer<A NAME = "AB448125"></A> programs to be used to the physical<A NAME = "AB448140"></A> 
security of terminals used to access the system.  A report<A NAME = "AO448162"></A><A NAME = "AS448163"></A><A NAME = "AS448164"></A> that addressed system dimensions of computer<A NAME = "AB448177"></A> security was the National<A NAME = "AB448186"></A> 
Research Council report <I>Computers at Risk</I>;[5] this current<A NAME = "AO448210"></A><A NAME = "AS448211"></A> study draws on that report and others to the extent relevant for its analysis
, findings, and conclusions about cryptography<A NAME = "BB448251"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB45043"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy.<BR>



<P><LI>  This report<A NAME = "AO4505"></A><A NAME = "AS4506"></A><A NAME = "AS4507"></A> is not a study of the many patent<A NAME = "AB45024"></A> disputes that have arisen with respect to national cryptography<A NAME = "BB45043"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB486189"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy in the 
past several years.  While such disputes may well be a sign that the various holders<A NAME = "AO45081"></A><A NAME = "AS45082"></A><A NAME = "AS45083"></A> expect cryptography<A NAME = "BB45088"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB45824"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> to assume substantial 
commercial<A NAME = "AB45098"></A> importance in the next several years, such disputes<A NAME = "AO450115"></A><A NAME = "AS450116"></A><A NAME = "AS450117"></A> are in principle resolvable<A NAME = "AB450126"></A> by the U.S<A NAME = "BB450133"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF6325"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>. Congress, which could simply 
legislate ownership by eminent domain or by requiring compulsory licensing.  Moreover, since many of the key<A NAME = "AO450175"></A> patents will expire in any 
case in the relatively near future (i.e., before any infrastructure that uses them becomes widely deployed), the issue will become 
moot in any case.<BR>



<P><LI>  This report<A NAME = "AO4525"></A><A NAME = "AS4526"></A> is not exclusively a study of national policy associated with the Clipper<A NAME = "AB45231"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB45243"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> chip.  While the Clipper<A NAME = "AO45240"></A><A NAME = "AS45241"></A><A NAME = "AS45242"></A><A NAME = "BB45243"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF45231"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> chip has 
received the lion's<A NAME = "AB45255"></A> share of press and notoriety in the past few years, the issues that this study was chartered to address go far 
beyond those associated simply with the Clipper chip.  This study addresses the larger context and picture of which the Clipper chip 
is only one part.<BR>



<P>

<P>

<H2><B>ON SECRECY AND REPORT TIME LINE</B></H2>

<P>For most of history, the science<A NAME = "AO45811"></A><A NAME = "AS45812"></A><A NAME = "AS45813"></A> and technologies associated with cryptography<A NAME = "BB45824"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB47887"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> have been the purview of national<A NAME = "AB45837"></A> governments and
/or heads of state.  It is only in the last 25 years that cryptographic expertise has begun to diffuse into the nongovernment 
world.  Thus, it is not surprising that much of the basis and rationale underlying national cryptography policy has been and 
continues to be highly classified.  Indeed, in a 1982 article, then-Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Bobby R. Inman 
wrote that <BR>



<P><LI>  [o]ne sometimes hears the view that publication should not be restrained because &quot;the government has not made its case,
&quot; almost always referring to the absence of specific detail for public consumption.  This reasoning is circular and unreasonable
.  It stems from a basic attitude that the government and its public servants cannot be trusted.  Specific details about why 
information must be protected are more often than not even more sensitive than the basic technical information itself.  Publishing examples
, reasons and associated details would certainly damage the nation's interests.  Public<A NAME = "AO460187"></A><A NAME = "AS460188"></A><A NAME = "AB460189"></A> review and discussion of classified 
information which supports decisions is not feasible or workable.  [6]<BR>



<P>Secrecy<A NAME = "AO4621"></A><A NAME = "AS4622"></A><A NAME = "AB4623"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB46234"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is a two-edged sword for a democratic nation--on the one hand, secrecy<A NAME = "AO46232"></A><A NAME = "AS46233"></A><A NAME = "BB46234"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB46413"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> has a legitimate basis in those situations in 
which fundamental national interests are at stake (e.g., the preservation of American lives during wartime).  Moreover, the history<A NAME = "AO46291"></A><A NAME = "AS46292"></A><A NAME = "AB46293"></A> 
of intelligence reveals many instances in which the revelation of a secret, whether intentional or inadvertent, has led to the 
compromise of an information source or the loss of a key battle.[7]<BR>



<P>On the other hand, secrecy<A NAME = "AO4649"></A><A NAME = "AS46410"></A><A NAME = "AS46411"></A><A NAME = "AS46412"></A><A NAME = "BB46413"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB464223"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> has sometimes been used to stifle public<A NAME = "BB46428"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB54913"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> debate and conceal poorly conceived and ill-informed 
national policies, and mistrust is therefore quite common among many responsible critics of government<A NAME = "AB46474"></A> policy.  A common refrain by 
defenders of policies whose origins and rationales are secret is that &quot;if you knew what we knew, you would agree with us.&quot;  
Such a position may be true or false, but it clearly does not provide much reassurance for those not privy to those secrets for one 
very simple reason:  those who fear that government<A NAME = "AO464201"></A><A NAME = "AS464202"></A> is hiding poorly conceived policies behind a wall of secrecy<A NAME = "BB464223"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF4623"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> are not likely to 
trust the government, yet in the absence of a substantive argument being called for, the government's claim is essentially a plea for
 trust.<BR>



<P>In pursuing this study, the committee has adopted the position that some secrets are still legitimate in today's global 
environment, but that its role is to illuminate as much as possible without compromising those legitimate interests.  Thus, the committee 
has tried to act as a surrogate for well-intentioned and well-meaning people who fear that the worst is hiding behind the wall of 
secrecy--it has tried to ask the questions that these people would have asked if they could have done so.  Public Law 103-160 called 
for all defense agencies, including the National Security Agency, to cooperate fully with the National Research Council in this 
study.  <BR>



<P>For obvious reasons, the committee cannot determine if it did not hear a particular piece of information because an agency 
withheld that information or because that piece of information simply did not exist.  But for a number of reasons, the committee 
believes that to the best of its knowledge, the relevant<A NAME = "AO468103"></A><A NAME = "AS468104"></A> agencies have complied with Public<A NAME = "BB468115"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF6332"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> Law 103-160 and other agencies have 
cooperated with the committee.  One<A NAME = "AO468141"></A> important reason is that several members of the committee have had extensive experience (on a 
classified basis) with the relevant agencies, and these members heard nothing in the briefings held for the committee that was 
inconsistent with that experience.  A second<A NAME = "AO468228"></A> reason is that these agencies had every motivation and self-interest to make the best possible 
case for their respective positions on the issues before the committee.  Thus, on the basis of agency assurances that the committee 
has indeed received all information relevant to the issue at hand, they cannot plausibly argue that &quot;if the committee knew 
what Agency X knew, it would agree with Agency X's position.&quot;<BR>



<P>This unclassified report does not have a classified annex, nor is there a classified version of it.  After receiving a number of
 classified briefings on material relevant to the subject of this study, the fully cleared members of the committee (13 out of 
the total of 16) agree that these details, while necessarily important to policy makers who need to decide tomorrow what to do in a
 specific case, are not particularly relevant to the larger issues of why policy has the shape and texture that it does today nor
 to the general outline of how technology will and policy should evolve in the future.  For example, the committee<A NAME = "AO470223"></A><A NAME = "AS470224"></A> was briefed on
 certain intelligence<A NAME = "AB470236"></A> activities of various nations.  Policy<A NAME = "AO470247"></A> makers care that the activities of nation X (a friendly nation) fall
 into certain categories and that those of nation Y (an unfriendly nation) fall into other categories, because they must craft a 
policy toward nation X in one way and one toward nation Y in another way.  But for analytical purposes, the exact<A NAME = "AO470362"></A><A NAME = "AS470363"></A> names of the nations
 involved are much less relevant than the fact that there will always be nations friendly and unfriendly to the United<A NAME = "BB470413"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB531126"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States.  
Committee members are prepared to respond on a classified basis if necessary to critiques and questions that involve classified material.
[8]<BR>



<P>As for the time line of this study, the committee was acutely aware of the speed with which the market and product technologies 
evolve.  The legislation<A NAME = "AO47252"></A><A NAME = "AS47253"></A> called for a study to be delivered within 2 years after the full processing of all necessary security<A NAME = "AB47290"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB504109"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
clearances, and the study committee accelerated its work schedule to deliver a report in 18 months from its first meeting (and only 13 
months from the final granting of the last clearance).  The delivery date of this study was affected by the fact that the contract to 
fund this study was signed by the Department of Defense on September 30, 1994.<BR>

<P>


times fortune would not have changed. 
<P>

Pope<A NAME = "AO25803"></A><A NAME = "AS25804"></A><A NAME = "AB25805"></A> Julius II went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and 
<P>

found the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of 
<P>

action that he always met with success. Consider his first 
<P>

enterprise<A NAME = "AS25833"></A><A NAME = "AS25834"></A> against Bologna<A NAME = "BB25839"></A><A HREF = "SPP89.HTM#BB269110"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, Messer<A NAME = "AB258312"></A> Giovanni Bentivogli being still 
<P>

alive. The Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of 
<P>

Spain<A NAME = "AS25853"></A><A NAME = "BB25854"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF27013"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and he had the enterprise still under discussion with the 
<P>

King<A NAME = "AS25863"></A><A NAME = "BB25864"></A><A HREF = "SPP86.HTM#BB259018"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition 

<P>

with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and 
<P>

the Venetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, 
<P>

the former<A NAME = "AS25895"></A> from desire to recover all the kingdom of Naples<A NAME = "BB258924"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF1426"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>; on the 
<P>

other hand, he drew<A NAME = "AS25909"></A> after him the King<A NAME = "BB259018"></A><A HREF = "SPP86.HTM#BB25989"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of France, because that king, 
<P>

having observed the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend 

<P>

so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him 
<P>

soldiers without manifestly offending him. Therefore Julius with his 
<P>

impetuous<A NAME = "AO25943"></A><A NAME = "AS25944"></A><A NAME = "AS25945"></A><A NAME = "AB25946"></A> action accomplished what no other pontiff<A NAME = "AB259419"></A><A HREF = "SPP86.HTM#BB25977"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> with simple 
<P>

human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited<A NAME = "AS259521"></A> in Rome<A NAME = "BB259526"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF6254"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> until he 
<P>

could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any 
<P>

other<A NAME = "AO25973"></A><A NAME = "AS25974"></A> pontiff<A NAME = "BB25977"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF259419"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> would have done, he would never have succeeded. 
<P>

Because the King<A NAME = "AO25987"></A><A NAME = "AS25988"></A><A NAME = "BB25989"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF6914"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the 

<P>

others would have raised a thousand fears. 
<P>

I will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and 
<P>

they all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him 
<P>

experience the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which 
<P>

required him to go cautiously, his ruin would have followed, because 
<P>

he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature 
<P>

inclined him. 
<P>

I conclude therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind 
<P>

steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are 
<P>

successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I

the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the 
<P>

other will not be able to resist. The Venetians, moved, as I 
<P>

believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline 
<P>

factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed 
<P>

them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst 
<P>

them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should 
<P>

not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn 
<P>

out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once 
<P>

took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue, therefore, 
<P>

weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be permitted 

<P>

in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the more 
<P>

easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but if 
<P>

war<A NAME = "AO21713"></A> comes this policy proves fallacious. 
<P>

4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the 
<P>

difficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore 

<P>

fortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who 
<P>

has a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, 
<P>

causes enemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he 

<P>

may have the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount 
<P>

higher, as by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this 
<P>

reason many consider that a wise prince, when he has the 
<P>

opportunity, ought with craft to foster some animosity against 
<P>

himself, so that, having crushed it, his renown may rise higher. 
<P>

5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and 
<P>

assistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were 
<P>

distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. 
<P>

Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those 
<P>

who had been distrusted than by others. But on this question one 
<P>

cannot speak generally, for it varies so much with the individual; I 
<P>

will only say this, that those men who at the commencement of a

<H4><B>A NOTE FROM THE CHAIR</B></H4>

<P>The title<A NAME = "AO4783"></A><A NAME = "AS4784"></A><A NAME = "AS4785"></A> of this report is <I>Cryptography's<A NAME = "AB47817"></A> Role in Securing<A NAME = "AB47824"></A> the Information Society</I>.  The committee chose this title as one best
 describing our inquiry and report--that is, the committee has tried to focus on the role that cryptography<A NAME = "AO47885"></A><A NAME = "AS47886"></A><A NAME = "BB47887"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB56739"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, as one of a number 
of tools and technologies, can play in providing security for an information age society through, among other means, preventing 
computer-enabled crimes and enhancing national security.  At the same time, the committee is not unaware of the acronym for this report
--CRISIS--and it believes that the acronym is apt.<BR>



<P>From my own standpoint as chair of the NRC Committee to Study National Cryptography Policy, I believe that the crisis is a <I>
policy</I> crisis, rather than a technology crisis, an industry crisis, a law enforcement crisis, or an intelligence-gathering crisis. <BR>



<P>It is not a technology crisis because technologies have always been two-edged swords.  All technologies--cryptography included--
can be used for good or for ill.  They can be used to serve society or to harm it, and cryptography will no doubt be used for both 
purposes by different groups.  Public<A NAME = "AO482103"></A><A NAME = "AS482104"></A><A NAME = "AB482105"></A> policy will determine in large measure not just the net balance of benefit and loss but also how 
much benefit will be derived from constructive uses of this remarkable technology.<BR>



<P>It is not an industry<A NAME = "AO4849"></A><A NAME = "AS48410"></A><A NAME = "AS48411"></A><A NAME = "AS48412"></A><A NAME = "AS48413"></A><A NAME = "AS48414"></A><A NAME = "AS48415"></A><A NAME = "AB48416"></A> crisis, nor a law<A NAME = "AB48425"></A> enforcement crisis, nor an intelligence<A NAME = "AB48436"></A>-gathering crisis, because industry, law<A NAME = "BB48447"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490142"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
enforcement, and the intelligence<A NAME = "AB48457"></A> establishment have all had to cope with rapid technological<A NAME = "AB48476"></A> change, and for the most part the vitality of
 these enterprises within the nation is a testament to their successes in so coping.<BR>



<P>But a policy crisis is upon the nation.  In the face of an inevitably growing use of cryptography, our society, acting as it 
must through our government as informed by the manifold forums of our free private processes, has been unable to develop a consensus
 behind a coherent national cryptography policy, neither within its own ranks nor with the private stakeholders throughout 
society--the software industry, those concerned with computer security, the civil liberties community, and so on.  Indeed, the 
committee<A NAME = "AO486165"></A><A NAME = "AS486166"></A> could not even find a clear written statement of national cryptography<A NAME = "BB486189"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB488171"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy that went beyond some very general statements.<BR>



<P>To be sure, a number<A NAME = "AO4889"></A><A NAME = "AS48810"></A> of Administration<A NAME = "AB48815"></A> proposals have seen the light of day.  The best known of these proposals, the Clipper 
initiative, was an honest attempt to address some of the issues underlying national cryptography policy, but one of its primary effects 
was to polarize rather than bring together the various stakeholders, both public and private.  On the other hand, it did raise 
public awareness of the issue.  In retrospect, many Administration<A NAME = "AO488151"></A><A NAME = "AS488152"></A> officials have wished that the discourse on national cryptography<A NAME = "BB488171"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB502149"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
policy could have unfolded differently, but in fairness we recognize that the government's task is not easy in view of the deep 
cleavages of interest reviewed in this report.  In this context, we therefore saw it as our task, commanded by our statutory charge, to 
analyze the underlying reasons for this policy crisis and the interests at stake, and then to propose an intelligent, workable and 
acceptable policy.   <BR>



<P>The Committee<A NAME = "AO4903"></A><A NAME = "AS4904"></A> to Study<A NAME = "BB4909"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF555"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> National Cryptography Policy is a group of 16 individuals with very diverse backgrounds, a broad range of
 expertise, and differing perspectives on the subject.  The committee<A NAME = "AO49063"></A><A NAME = "AS49064"></A> included individuals with extensive government<A NAME = "AB49075"></A> service and 
also individuals with considerable skepticism about and suspicion of government; persons with great technical expertise in computers
, communications, and cryptography; and persons<A NAME = "AO490126"></A><A NAME = "AS490127"></A><A NAME = "AS490128"></A><A NAME = "AS490129"></A><A NAME = "AS490130"></A><A NAME = "AS490131"></A> with considerable experience in law<A NAME = "BB490142"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB54785"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement, intelligence<A NAME = "BB490147"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF19259"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, civil<A NAME = "AB490150"></A> liberties, 
national<A NAME = "BB490156"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB56927"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security, diplomacy, international<A NAME = "AB490163"></A> trade, and other fields relevant to the formation of policy in this area.  Committee<A NAME = "AO490192"></A><A NAME = "AS490193"></A><A NAME = "AS490194"></A> members
 were drawn from industry, including telecommunications<A NAME = "BB490210"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB57180"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> and computer<A NAME = "AB490215"></A> hardware and software, and from users of cryptography in the
 for-profit and not-for-profit sectors; serving as well were academics and think-tank experts.[9]  The committee was by design 
highly heterogeneous, a characteristic intended to promote discussion and synergy among its members.<BR>



<P>At first, we wondered whether these different perspectives would allow us to talk among ourselves at all, let alone come to 
agreement.  But the committee worked hard.  The full committee met for a total of 23 days in which we received briefings and argued 
various points; ad<A NAME = "AO49295"></A> hoc subcommittees attended a dozen or so additional meetings to receive even more briefings; members<A NAME = "AO492126"></A> of the 
committee and staff held a number of open sessions in which testimony from the interested public was sought and received (including a 
very well attended session at the Fifth Annual Conference on Computers, Freedom, and Privacy in San Francisco in early 1995 and an 
open session in Washington, D.C., in April 1995); and the committee<A NAME = "AO492247"></A><A NAME = "AS492248"></A><A NAME = "AS492249"></A> reviewed nearly a hundred e-<A NAME = "AB492261"></A>mail messages sent in response to

occasion for extended give-and-take discussions with government officials and private stakeholders.<BR>



<P>Out of this extended dialogue, we found that coming to a consensus among ourselves--while difficult--was not impossible.  The 
nature of a consensus position is that it is invariably somewhat different<A NAME = "AO49464"></A> from a position developed, framed, and written by any one 
committee member, particularly before our dialogue and without comments from other committee members.  Our consensus is a result of the 
extended learning and interaction process through which we lived rather than any conscious effort to compromise or to paper over 
differences.  The committee stands fully behind its analysis, findings, and recommendations.<BR>



<P>We believe that our report makes some reasonable proposals for national cryptography policy.  But a proposal is just that--a 
proposal for action.  What is needed now is a public debate, using and not sidestepping the full processes of government, leading to a 
judicious resolution of pressing cryptography policy issues and including, on some important points, legislative action.  Only in this 
manner will the policy crisis come to a satisfactory and stable resolution.<BR>

early draft of this report.  Those inputs helped the committee to sharpen its message and strengthen its presentation, but of course 
the content of the report is the responsibility of the committee.<BR>

others was necessary, as it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to 
<P>

keep down the Pope they made<A NAME = "AS111013"></A> use of the barons of Rome<A NAME = "BB111026"></A><A HREF = "SPP37.HTM#BB113319"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, who, being 
<P>

divided into two factions, Orsini and Colonna, had always a pretext 
<P>

for disorder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of 

<P>

the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and powerless. And although 
<P>

there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus [IV], 
<P>

yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these annoyances. 
<P>

And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness; for in the 
<P>

ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with difficulty 

<P>

lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one pope should almost 

<P>

destroy the Colonna, another would arise hostile to the Orsini, who 
<P>

would support their opponents, and yet would not have time to ruin the 

<P>

Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the pope were 
<P>

little esteemed in Italy. 
<P>

Alexander VI arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have 
<P>

ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to 
<P>

prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by 

<P>

reason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things 
<P>

which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And 
<P>

although his intention<A NAME = "AO11287"></A> was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke, 

<P>

nevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the 
<P>

Church, which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the 
<P>

heir to all his labours. 
<P>

Pope<A NAME = "AO11323"></A> Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, 
<P>

possessing all the Romagna, the barons<A NAME = "AO113313"></A><A NAME = "AS113314"></A> of Rome<A NAME = "BB113319"></A><A HREF = "SPP38.HTM#BB114815"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> reduced to impotence, 
<P>

and, through the chastisements Alexander, the factions wiped out; he 
<P>

also found the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had 
<P>

never been practised before Alexander's time. Such things Julius not 
<P>

only followed, but improved upon, and he intended<A NAME = "AS113717"></A> to gain Bologna<A NAME = "BB113724"></A><A HREF = "SPP62.HTM#BB187318"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 
<P>

to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of

<h3>CHAPTER XIX 
<P>

THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED</h3> 
<P>

<P>

Now, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made 
<P>

above, I have spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish 
<P>

to discuss briefly under this generality, that the prince must 
<P>

consider, as has been in part said before, how to avoid those things 
<P>

which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall 
<P>

have succeeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear 
<P>

any danger in other reproaches. 
<P>

It makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be 
<P>

rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and women of his 
<P>

subjects, from both of which he must abstain. And when neither their 
<P>

property nor honour is touched, the majority of men live content, 
<P>

and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can 
<P>

curb with ease in many ways. 
<P>

It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, 
<P>

effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince 
<P>

should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show 
<P>

in his actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in 
<P>

his private<A NAME = "AO18245"></A> dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments 

<P>

are irrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one 
<P>

can hope either to deceive him or to get round him. 
<P>

That prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of 
<P>

himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired

of bondage. It was necessary that Romulus<A NAME = "AO47915"></A> should not remain in Alba, 
<P>

and that he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he 
<P>

should become King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was 
<P>

necessary that Cyrus<A NAME = "AO4827"></A> should find the Persians discontented with the 
<P>

government of the Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through 
<P>

their long peace. Theseus could not have shown his ability had he 
<P>

not found the Athenians dispersed. These opportunities, therefore, 
<P>

made those men fortunate, and their high ability enabled them to 
<P>

recognize the opportunity whereby their country was ennobled and 
<P>

made famous. 
<P>

Those who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a 
<P>

principality with difficulty, but they it with ease. The 
<P>

difficulties they have in acquiring it arise in part from the new 
<P>

rules and methods which they are forced to introduce to establish 
<P>

their government and its security. And it ought to be remembered 
<P>

that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to 

<P>

conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in 
<P>

the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has

for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and 

<P>

lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This 
<P>

coolness<A NAME = "AO4993"></A> arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws 
<P>

on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not 
<P>

readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of 

<P>

them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the 
<P>

opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others 
<P>

defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along 
<P>

with them. 
<P>

It is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter 
<P>

thoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves 

<P>

or have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate

injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to 

<P>

his glory. 
<P>

Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the 
<P>

conclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing 
<P>

according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish 
<P>

himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others; 

<P>

he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted. 
<P>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII 
<P>

CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH</h3> 
<P>

<P>

EVERY<A NAME = "AO17203"></A><A NAME = "AS17204"></A><A NAME = "AB17205"></A> one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, 
<P>

and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our 
<P>

experience has been that those princes who have done great things have 

<P>

held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent 
<P>

the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those 
<P>

who have relied on their word. You must know there are two ways of 
<P>

contesting, the one by the law, the other by force; the first method 
<P>

is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is 
<P>

frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the 
<P>

second. Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to 
<P>

avail himself of the beast and the man. This has been figuratively 
<P>

taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and 
<P>

many other<A NAME = "AO17325"></A><A NAME = "AS17326"></A> princes of old were given to the Centaur<A NAME = "AB173223"></A> Chiron to nurse, 
<P>

who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as 
<P>

they had for a teacher<A NAME = "AO173411"></A><A NAME = "AS173412"></A><A NAME = "AB173413"></A> one who was half beast and half man, so it is 
<P>

necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and 
<P>

that one without the other is not durable. A prince, therefore, 
<P>

being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the 
<P>

fox<A NAME = "AS17383"></A> and the lion<A NAME = "AB173810"></A><A HREF = "SPP57.HTM#BB173819"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>; because the lion<A NAME = "AO173817"></A><A NAME = "AS173818"></A><A NAME = "BB173819"></A><A HREF = "SPP58.HTM#BB174028"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> cannot defend himself against

<P>


There were none<A NAME = "AO23697"></A> who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of 
<P>

Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to 

<P>

be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because 
<P>

there are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by 
<P>

itself; another which appreciates what others comprehend; and a 
<P>

third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of 
<P>

others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, the third 

<P>

is useless. Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was 
<P>

not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has 
<P>

judgment to know good or bad when it is said and done, although he 
<P>

himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and 

<P>

the bad in his servant, and the one he can praise and the other 
<P>

correct; thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept 
<P>

honest. 
<P>

But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is 
<P>

one test which never falls; when you see the servant thinking more 
<P>

of his own interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own 
<P>

profit in everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor 
<P>

will you ever be able to trust him; because he who has the state of 
<P>

another in his hands ought never to think of himself, but always of 
<P>

his prince, and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince 

<P>

is not concerned. 
<P>

On the other to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study 
<P>

him, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing 
<P>

with him the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see 
<P>

that he cannot stand alone, so that many honours not make him desire 
<P>

more, many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make 

<P>

him dread changes. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards 
<P>

servants, are thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is 

<P>

otherwise, the end will always be disastrous for either one or the 
<P>
<P>
