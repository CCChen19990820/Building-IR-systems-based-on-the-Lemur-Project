The underground flood of Chicago on Monday, April 13, 1992 is proving to be one of the worst business disasters ever. It is exactly the kind of event that disaster recovery planners prepare for, but hope they never have to experience.
<p>
When the disaster struck, I went to Chicago to report on the damage and take photos. The other articles in this special report come from members of the disaster recovery industry who experienced the flood's impacts first-hand.
<p>
Although this issue of Disaster Recovery Journal had already been printed, mailing was halted so that we could bring you this special report on this major event.
<p>
 This disaster will have a far-reaching impact on disaster recovery. Many companies in Chicago were forced to implement their disaster recovery plans. 230 buildings lost power because water threatened their underground power sources. For many disaster recovery planners, this was the first real test of their work. Hopefully we can learn from their experiences.

<font size=3><i>Report from Michael Gomoll Chi/Cor Information Management, Inc.</i>

<br>
In 1899 the city of Chicago started work on a series of interconnecting tunnels located approximately forty feet beneath street level. This series of tunnels ran below the Chicago River and underneath the Chicago business district, simply known as The Loop. The tunnels housed a series of railroad tracks that were used to haul coal  and to remove ashes from the many office buildings in the downtown area. The underground system served Chicago well through the 1940’s when other power sources replaced the coal
furnaces. These tunnels went forgotten until April 13th, 1992.
<p>
Construction workers had been working along the Chicago River for some time. One of the projects included placing support pillars into the Chicago River bottom. It is theorized that during the placement of one of these pillars, a portion of the turn-of-the-century coal delivery system was damaged. A hole the size of a large automobile formed in the bottom of the river and punctured the tunnel ceiling. Exactly when the rupture took place is unclear, but on the morning of Monday April 13th several Loop office
 buildings began to report significant amounts of water in basement and sub-basement facilities. The flooding was caused by massive amounts of river water pouring into the maze of underground tunnels. The tunnels led directly into the basements of many of the older Loop buildings.
<p>
Marshall Field’s flagship store, located on State Street in the heart of the loop, reported flooding in sub-basements two and three with water levels reaching 40 feet. With heating and electrical systems located in these basement areas, not to mention a substantial amount of valuable inventory, the threat was significant.
<p>
Most of the City and County governmental buildings are also located in the Loop. As with the Marshall Field's building,
the City/County utilities were threatened by extensive flooding. Valuable assets were also in jeopardy, but in this case the assets took the form of valuable government records. The records existed in hard copy and microfiche form and contained a wealth of historical information about the nations third largest city.
<p>
Chicago’s financial district, including the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, was also threatened by the torrent of water. The threat of the flooding came not so much from the water itself, but from the impact the flood could have on the extensive electrical and computer networks. It doesn’t require an advance degree in electrical engineering to imagine the potential safety risks to office buildings, some over 100 stories high with thousands of tenants, if the electrical system is comp
romised. By mid-day, the entire loop business district was evacuated.
<p>
CHI/COR Information Management’s corporate headquarters is located in the heart of the loop and was also affected by the flooding. Located in the southwest corner of the loop, adjacent to the Sears Tower, its offices were on the outer edge of the affected area.
<p>
The first order of business for the Executive Committee was to determine what business processes were threatened, and based upon a business impact analysis, initiate the appropriate recovery steps. The Executive committee highlighted the following recovery processes:
<p>
        <img src="cube.gif">Evaluate The Threat To Personnel <br>
        <img src="cube.gif">Activate Customer Support Network Procedures <br>
        <img src="cube.gif">Prepare Off-Site Facilities <br>
        <img src="cube.gif">Back-up And Secure Information Systems<br>
<p>
        Here is how each of these areas was addressed.
<p>
<strong>Evaluate The Threat To Personnel</strong>
<p>
 It  was determined that the threat to personal safety  was minimal at the time of disaster declaration, though it was decided that eventually complete evacuation would be a necessity.
<p>
The buildings elevator system was scheduled to be shut down by 1:30 p.m. To help avoid a bottleneck at 1:25, all “non-essential” personnel were evacuated in stages as their recovery functions were completed. All employees were kept informed of evacuation alternatives and timeframes. By following the predefined evacuation procedures and routes, all “non-essential” personnel were evacuated well before the 1:30 deadline. This orderly evacuation helped make the subsequent evacuation of the emergency staff quick
 and efficient when the time came.
<p>
<strong>Activate Customer Support Network Procedures</strong>
<p>
After all personal safety issues were addressed, the Customer Support Team went into action. Their first order of business was to re-route all customer support lines to a cellular telephone network. Once these cellular channels were in place, the Customer Support Team worked in tandem with the Off-site Facilities Team to ensure that support personnel would have continuous access to their various support tools and databases.
<p>
<strong>Prepare Off-Site Facilities</strong>
<p>
Our plan called for the availability of personal computers at several off-site locations for members of the support and development teams. Many support and development personnel have access to PCs at home. The Customer Support plan called for the staggered dispersion of personnel to off-site locations. This tiered approach to the evacuation helped to maintain continuous availability of all support functions, as no time was lost because personnel was in transit. The transportation of support personnel was co
ordinated by the Facilities Evacuation Team.
<p>
<strong>Back-up and Secure Information Systems</strong>
<p>
The Data Center Team immediately instituted the necessary back-up and protection of critical business applications and data. The back-up of the entire day's activities was initiated and that information was available should the need arise to re-locate to the hotsite facility. All systems and equipment were then secured to protect against any threat caused by the flooding and possible electrical problems.
<p>
CHI/COR President Rick Effgen commented “We were fortunate in many ways. We had sufficient warning time, sufficient evacuation time, and the availability of all of our recovery teams. These factors, combined with extensive planning, allowed us to ‘practice what we preach.’ We were able to continue all major business functions during the crisis and return to full operations the following business day”.
<p>
The ramifications of this disaster, both physical and financial, will be felt throughout Chicago for a long time to come.

<font size=5>Chicago Businesses Forced to Declare a Disaster<p>
<font size=3><i>Report from John Jackson Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services</I>
<hr size=10>
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="chiflo-4.gif" img align=left WIDTH=65% HEIGHT=45% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>
At 5:57 a.m. on Monday, April 13, 1992 a building engineer at the Chicago Merchandise Mart found water flooding the third sub-basement of the building. Little did he, or numerous Chicago Fire Department and City workers on-site by 6:10 a.m. know, that a hole the size of a car had ruptured in the restraining wall of a freight tunnel located under the Chicago River.
Fifty feet below Chicago’s streets and below the Chicago River, a 100 year old, 60 mile long freight tunnel interconnects the sub-basements of many Chicago office buildings. This tunnel, no longer actively used for freight, serves as a conduit for power, telecommunications and Cable TV cables. The rupture between the river bottom and the tunnel caused over 250 million gallons of water to traverse the tunnel into building basements, causing power to be shut off, buildings to be evacuated, and businesses to c
ease operations.
<p>
CDRS received its first declaration before 9:00 a.m. Monday. By mid-day, 12 firms had declared 18 individual disasters. The disasters included subscribers from the financial, brokerage, government and services/distribution industries. Additionally, by the day following the initial disaster, 17 alerts were pending for 13 additional customers.
<p>
Comdisco supported 8 customers at its Wood Dale, IL site, 7 in Carlstadt and North Bergen, NJ, one AS400 customer in Bridgeport, NJ, one customer in San Ramon, CA, and one in Alsip, IL.
<p>
Several subscribers utilized newly configured Workarea Recovery Centers to provide telephone, personal computer and office space solutions for displaced workers. For all vendors, this disaster called for more workarea recovery space than previous disasters, reflecting more comprehensive business planning, rather than just planning for data center recovery.
“This is the largest recovery in our history,” said Comdisco President Ray Hipp.
<p>
The disaster was essentially power related, as no actual computer centers were destroyed by the flood. Lights and air conditioning in the work areas are out, so personnel can not occupy the work space.
<p>
Once power is restored, many buildings will attempt to isolate themselves from the problems and pump out the water. Efforts to dig a connection from the freight tunnel to Chicago’s Deep Tunnel water retention system are projected at 8 days or longer.
The entire freight tunnel may be in some danger of collapsing, and a further investigation will survey the total infrastructure of the downtown area for other instability.
<p>
Unlike other disasters such as the San Francisco Earthquake and the New York power outage, this was not a brief event followed by  restoration. This disaster could drag on for weeks. Just fixing the first part of the problem--stopping the flow of water--could take a week.

<font size=5>The Worst Disaster in Recent History<p>
<font size=3><i>Report from Barney F. Pelant Barney F. Pelant & Associates</i><br>
<hr size=10>

<br>
Trends may start on the east and west coasts (i.e. Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta Earthquake of 1989) in our country, but when it comes to doing it bigger and better, don't count out the midwest. On Monday, April 13, 1992 began what has become the biggest business disaster to face us yet.
<p>
The story began last year when contractor Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company of Oak Brook, Illinois installed new pilings around the Kinzie Street Bridge along a branch of the Chicago river that wraps around downtown Chicago. Speculation is that the new pilings, which were driven down into the muddy depths of the river at an unapproved location, ruptured a turn-of-the-century tunnel system. Investigation of the causes will continue for months.
<p>
The 62 mile tunnel system was built to support rail and coal supplies to the many buildings of the city. Today the tunnel is used to distribute various cable systems, however the older buildings of Chicago have bulkheads accessing the system.
On January 14, 1992, two cable workers from Chicago Cable Television came across the visible cave-in that was occurring in the tunnel at the Kinzie Street Bridge. The concrete was breaking away and mud and silt were coming through the openings. They recorded this on video and attempted to get through the bureaucratic offices of the city to notify the Department of General Services.
<p>
The cost to repair the cracked opening was estimated by city officials at around $10,000, but actual repair bids exceeded that amount. Consequently, additional estimates were being requested, and ironically, a meeting to review what should be done was reportedly scheduled to take place a day after the tunnel ruptured.
<p>
Days after the disaster struck, the city remained crippled by the slow process of draining millions of gallons of water from the tunnel system and two to three stories of basements that support many of the high-rise buildings in the city. It is here that we find the power distribution, cooling and boiler plants essential to the functioning of the buildings. Tons of materials, including broken concrete, mattresses, gravel and "rapid set" concrete have been dumped into the river atop the opening to try to sto
p the flow of water. But all of this was of little help, as the water continued to rise in the buildings. The city was declared a federal disaster area as federal, state and local officials are working feverishly to solve the problem.
<p>
For the many businesses in the downtown area with major corporate computer centers, it brought the biggest declaration of disasters yet to hotsite recovery vendors.
<p>
This was the largest disaster ever for Sungard Recovery Services, which had its first declaration of disaster at 7:30 a.m. on Monday. Seventeen Sungard customers were affected.
<p>
The greatest financial impact was felt by the Chicago Board of Trade, which shut down completely on Monday, and resumed trading only at small volume in subsequent days. An estimated 25 billion in trading of the 36 products handled by the CBOT were lost on Tuesday, before limited trading was re-instated on Wednesday.
<p>
Although CBOT still had water cascading into its basements on Thursday, it was conducting limited trading with darkened corridors and a limited number of elevators and computers. This impact was felt world wide.
<p>
The biggest financial issue yet may be insurance, as this is not being considered an “act of God” flood, eliminating coverage for
many organizations. Estimates are ranging in the $100's of millions in losses.
<p>
Business recovery centers like MEDS in Chicago were in immediate use as emergency operations centers for key operations. On Thursday, McCormick Place, one of Chicago's largest conference centers, offered its entire conference space for one month as a free  business recovery center for affected businesses.
<P>
The Chicago Transit Authority transit system of subways that support the city have been closed down, with re-activation not expected for weeks. A parking ban was placed on the entire downtown area to allow the access needed by the many emergency vehicles being used to provide temporary power, and to pump out water into the storm drains.
<p>
Several city blocks went without power for the first couple of days, however by systematically cutting off the circuits to the flooded buildings, other buildings have been brought up. Two of Chicago's largest department stores, Carson Pirie Scott and Marshall Field's were both affected. The 3,000 hourly employees at Field's and the 2,000 at Carson's were paid for work on Monday if they were scheduled to work, but won't return to the payrolls until the stores reopen. Employees at Filene's Basement have been
laid off until the store reopens.
<P>
The recovery in Chicago will be tentative for a long time to come. Simply stopping the flow of water has been a major engineering challenge, and removing water from the tunnels and basements has stopped until the primary problem can be resolved. Complete blocking of the ruptured tunnels may take 10 days from the initial disaster, and draining the tunnels will probably take an additional two weeks.

1993 is only half over and already two major disasters have hit the United States. It's unusual that The Disaster Recovery Journal would run two Special Reports in the same year.  In our second quarter issue (Volume 6, Number 2) we covered the World Trade Center Bombing. Now, only four months later, we are reporting on The Great Flood of 1993. Many of our subscribers have been calling us to inquire if we've been flooded. But there is no need for you to worry! The flood waters are practically in our back yard, The Disaster Recovery Journal office and all its employees are high and dry!
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="flood-2a.gif" img align=left WIDTH=55% HEIGHT=35% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>
Although this issue of Disaster Recovery Journal had already been printed, mailing was halted so that we could bring you this special report on this major event. This disaster will have a far-reaching impact on disaster recovery. Many companies all along the Mississippi and other rivers were forced to implement their recovery plans, if they had one. For many disaster recovery planners, this was the first real test of their work. Hopefully we can learn from their experiences. Terrorist bombings, blizzards, drought and record floods have caused unprecedented damage. These are exactly the kind of events that disaster recovery planners prepare for, but hope they never have to experience.
<p>
When it comes to disasters, the east and west coast have their claims to fame (i. e., The World Trade Center Bombing and the L. A. Riots), but in doing it bigger and better, don't count out the Midwest.
<p>

<br><IMG SRC="flood-4.gif" img align=left WIDTH=20% HEIGHT=35% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>Residents living along the river are no strangers to floods, but this one is the worst yet. When the Mississippi River started rising, many of its tributaries rose with it. The level of the water over came some levees,  broke others, forced neighborhoods to be evacuated, and flooded millions of acres of farm land. Places that were once dry are now submerged. Houses, cars, barns, crops, streets, bridges, etc., are all under water. Barges are tied up because traffic on the rivers is at a stand still. One point eight million acres of farmland were flooded in Illinois and Missouri.
<p>
One levee brake was so large that a barge moored on the Mississippi got sucked through the opening. Two hundred-plus roads have been closed in Missouri alone.
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="flood-4a.gif" img align=left WIDTH=30% HEIGHT=30% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>
The Mississippi crested on Sunday, July 18, at a record setting 46.9 feet. This is 2.77 feet above the earlier record set in 1973.
The St. Louis area has 200 regular Coast Guard, most stationed in the district office and 170 well-trained reservists, who came from as far of as Memphis, TN, and Leavenworth, KS.
<p>

Joe Friday, head of the National Weather Service said, "The extent of flooding in the Midwest is a first in the 150 years that the federal government has been keeping weather records"
<p>
The superintendent of the Gateway Arch calls his monument "Noah's Arch." He's kidding, of course. The Arch, the city's signature landmark, remains high and dry, and is equipped with 500-gallon-a-minute pumps that surround the substructure.
<br><IMG SRC="flood-3a.gif" img align=left WIDTH=35% HEIGHT=35% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>
This great disaster has caught the attention of the President and Vice President of the United States. Vice President Al Gore came to St. Louis on Monday, July 12, to asses the damage. He came back with President Clinton, on Saturday, July 17. Armed with checks and surrounded by members of his Cabinet, President Clinton promised the governors of eight flood-damaged states that his administration would not abandon them once the water recedes.
<p>
One of the main lessons of this disaster, which is a lesson all DR planners should know, is to never underestimate Mother Nature. Most levees did not hold out, giving a sense of urgency to a disaster that had mostly unfolded in slow motion.

<font size=6><strong>THE QUAKE OF '94<br> </strong><p>
<font size=3><i> by Richard L. Arnold, CDRP Editor-In-Chief, Disaster Recovery Journal<br></i></center>
<img src="line.gif"><P>
<font size=3><blockquote>
<P>
<br><IMG SRC="calqke-1.gif" img align=left WIDTH=50% HEIGHT=40% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1><br>Monday, January 17, I woke to find that a major earthquake jolted southern California.  While watching television, CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC, the announcers explained.  "At 4:31 A.M. PST January 17, 1994, the San Fernando Valley was hit by a huge earthquake."  Memories of the San Francisco earthquake haunted my thoughts.  I was watching the aerial view of Los Angeles, and saw scenes of the fires burning out of control.  Interstate 14 near Reseda, California had buckled.  People jumped from windows at a large t
hree story apartment complex that is now two stories.
<P>
Later this month, Disaster Recovery Journal is planning a personal inspection of the Los Angeles and surrounding areas affected by the earthquake. We will be providing more in depth reporting on the Earthquake of '94 in the second quarter edition of Disaster Recovery Journal. During this personal tour of the area I will be visiting future sights to host the Disaster Recovery Journal's conferences. This year's conference in Palm Springs is sure to have an outstanding turnout. Some 428 attendees have already
registered.
<p>
QUAKE OF '94
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="calqke-2.gif" img align=left WIDTH=50% HEIGHT=40% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1><br>The Quake of '94 rocked the San  Fernando Valley and the surrounding area, leaving at least 47 people dead and billions of dollars in property damage. The earthquake was centered in the Northridge area of the San Fernando Valley, about 20 miles north of downtown Los Angeles. The quake measured 6.6 on the Richter Scale, powerful enough to be felt from San Diego, 125 miles to the south, to Las Vegas, 275 miles to the northeast.
<P>
The quake was felt for 30 seconds, and several aftershocks followed within minutes, several as strong as a magnitude of 5.0 on the Richter Scale. The quake occurred on a previously unknown fault line 20 miles south of the San Andreas Fault.
The earthquake damaged up to 1,000 buildings and knocked out power and water service for thousands of residents.
<P>
The most devastation and fatalities occurred at the Northridge Meadows Apartment Complex which housed many students of nearby California State University. The three story stucco complex was cracked in half and the top two floors collapsed onto the bottom floor. City officials claim the 14 deaths in the apartment complex was the largest number of earthquake fatalities at a single site in the city's history.
<P>
Seven interstates and three state highways were closed at several points after the quake, threatening to snarl traffic for millions of drivers for months to come.  Among the worst hit highways was Interstate 5, the state's major north-south route.
<P>
Traffic lights were knocked out in the valley as well as in downtown Los Angeles. By Monday evening, at least 680,000 customers were without power in Los Angeles County, and 200,000 were without water. City officials urged residents to boil drinking water contaminated by broken mains. Telephone service was sporadic as long-distance phone companies routed calls from the region to prevent communication gridlock.
<p>
At least 100 fires were reported, many fed by ruptured gas and oil mains. In Sylmar, a community north of Los Angeles, at least 70 homes burned.
<P>
While fire damage is covered under most homeowner policies, up to 75 percent do not have earthquake insurance.
<P>
FEDERAL AID
<P>
<br><IMG SRC="calqk-4a.gif" img align=left WIDTH=30% HEIGHT=50% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1><br>President Bill Clinton declared southern California a disaster area, making residents eligible for federal assistance. Low-income residents can qualify for up to $12,200 in disaster grants. Others would be eligible for low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration for temporary housing, rent assistance and disaster crisis counseling.
<p>
The President dispatched James Lee Witt, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to California.
Governor Pete Wilson of California and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan also declared emergencies. Wilson mobilized more than 1,500 National Guard Troops to help and promised to rush more aid to the area. Riordan instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Los Angeles "to protect life and property."
<P>
RED CROSS
<p>
Many residents, unsettled by numerous aftershocks, huddled in parking lots, on sidewalks, in area parks or in shelters set up by the American Red Cross.
<P>
The Red Cross issued an emergency appeal for blood donors, saying its blood supply had been seriously depleted even before the quake struck.
<P>
Area hospitals were inundated with injured residents.
<P>
"We've seen heart attacks, dislocated bones, and lacerations," said an emergency room admissions officer at Holy Cross Medical Center in Sylmar. In Los Angeles, Cedars Sinai Medical Center said the emergency room had received many earthquake victims.
<P>
At the Granada Hills Community Hospital, a makeshift emergency room was set up in the parking lot. Nurses treated more than 1,000 patients there on Monday.
<p>
The quake derailed a 64-car freight train, which leaked sulfuric acid from one of its tankers, between the communities of Chatsworth and Northridge. Hazardous materials crews were cleaning up the spill.
<p>
A department store at the Northridge Fashion Center collapsed. Windows were shattered throughout the center and the parking structure turned into a 20-foot high pancake. Searchers spent hours digging through the wreckage of the parking garage before pulling out a street sweeper alive.
<p>
FEMA sent 12 search-and-rescue teams and four medical teams to the quake area. The 56 member search teams use dogs, sensitive listening devices and tunneling equipment to look for survivors in collapsed buildings.
Eight hours after the quake, rescue workers held little hope that those missing in the rubble of the Northridge Apartment Complex would be found alive.
<p>

Without power, many gasoline stations remained closed, and bank teller machines were not working.
California residents also lined up to buy batteries, flashlights and bottled water from area stores, many of which were littered with debris from the earthquake.

DECLARED DISASTERS
<p>
Businesses throughout the Los Angeles and surrounding areas also suffered due to the earthquake.
As of this writing, SunGard has reported 21 alerts. Most alerts were for power outages, very few were reports of structural damages. SunGard anticipates at least five actual disaster declarations.
<p>
IBM reported that of the 100 Business Recovery Service customers in the Los Angeles area, only nine customers actually declared. These customers have a total of 15 declarations on a variety of platforms, at multiple recovery centers.
To date, Comdisco has not yet reported back to us.

<br>
January 17, 1995, western Japan was rocked by the most destructive earthquake to  hit the region.  The devastation was the worst in the port city of Kobe, where the 7.2 magnitude quake toppled roadways, wrecked docks, severed communication lines and kept the city in flames into the next day.  The quake has taken the lives of more than 5,250 people. Most died in their homes when the earthquake struck.  Almost 30,000 people are reported injured causing a massive strain on area hospitals. More than 400,000 people are homeless, filling makeshift shelters swollen to capacity.  The death toll grew steadily as rescue teams moved frantically to try and reach those who were trapped under the rubble.  Approximately 88,000 buildings have been reported destroyed.
<p>
Hardly a  block in this industrial port city of 1.4 million people had a house or building intact. Many streets were reduced to piles of rubble.  Kobe is the sixth largest port in the world and the gateway for 12% of Japan's exports.  No earthquake had struck any major Japanese urban center with such destruction since the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 which killed 140,000 people in Tokyo and Yokohama.  Officials expect more than a thousand aftershocks will hit the region in the near future.
<p>
Japan is one of the most geologically unstable places on Earth.  It has 40 active volcanoes and as many as 1,500 tremors are recorded annually, most of them being minor.  In Japan the earthquake is addressed continuously in architecture and civil defense planning.  The majority of buildings that collapsed were those with wooden walls that succumbed when the quake rocked their heavy tile roofs.  Steel-frame buildings built after 1981 remained virtually undamaged.  This was due to their "ductility," the ability to bend without collapsing.  As a result, the pre-1981 buildings were left in ruins while the post-1981 buildings held up relatively well.
<p>
Tokyo escaped unscathed.  The quake was barely felt in the capital located 280 miles to the east where people, awed by the destruction,  gathered around televisions.  The shaking lasted for 20 seconds and snapped vital lifelines to Western Japan.  The worst damage was along the Hanshin Expressway, a major artery between Osaka and Kobe, which collapsed in five places  killing 12 drivers.
<p>
Other national highways were damaged in 20 locations.  The Shinkansen, or high speed "bullet" trains rails were damaged in 36 places and will be closed for at least three months.  Local and commuter trains sustained vast damage.  The earthquake shattered Japan's belief that sophisticated engineering would enable its newer buildings and roads to withstand a major quake.
<p>
The day after the earthquake hundreds of thousands of Kobe residents packed the roads leaving the ruined city.  They traveled on foot, bicycles and packed automobiles.  Others were trying in vain to enter the city to search for relatives and friends.
The airlines were only slightly delayed after Kansai International Airport built on Osaka Bay was closed temporarily the day of the quake.
<p>
The earthquake in Japan, the USA's second largest trading partner, has so far had few aftershocks on the U.S. economy, businesses or consumers.  The impact should remain light, except for one troubling issue.  With damage estimates approaching $100 billion (several times the damage caused by the earthquake in Los Angeles last year) the Japanese government and Japanese insurers are poised to issue a large number of bonds to help pay for rebuilding.  This in turn could boost global interest rates.
<p>
While shipping containers continue to pile up on California docks, a search for an alternative port other than Kobe is underway.  Kobe is Japan's second largest port with more than 30% of all Japanese trade passing  through, with a total dollar value equal to the GNP of Canada.  Kobe was also an important relay port for China and Korea.  Incoming vessels are now being redirected to Yokohama and Tokyo to deliver their goods.  Experts think it will take at least a year to repair the damaged port.
<p>
Ironically, only three percent of the 350,000 people left homeless have earthquake insurance.  A larger portion have fire insurance, but the policy is useless if the fire was caused by an earthquake.  This is because Japanese insurance companies make earthquake insurance one of the most expensive policies to buy as well as having the most stipulations.  Many Japanese are now trying to seek policies from foreign insurance companies.
 <p>
The Japanese economy is recoiling from the earthquake in Kobe, but eventually a spurt from reconstruction should help.     This means the earthquake will have no effect on Japan's gross domestic product in 1995.  Stock investors are keeping their eyes open  for "earthquake plays," stocks of companies that might take part in the enormous rebuilding effort under way in Kobe.  However, few companies are anxious to go on record as wishing to capitalize on the devastating quake.  The most impressive stock plays
are issues of Japanese companies expected to have the largest hand in the rebuilding effort.  This includes Japanese construction companies, contracting and reinforcement companies, and companies that make temporary housing.

<font size=5>The Kobe, Japan, Earthquake<p>
<font size=3><i>By Benny D. Taylor, CDRP, Texas Instruments</i><br>
<hr size=10><br>
<br><IMG SRC="kobe-2.gif" img align=left WIDTH=35% HEIGHT=48% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>When the duty manager of Texas Instruments' Worldwide Command Center in Dallas, TX received notification that the communications to TI's joint venture manufacturing plant were down, he had no idea to what extent he would be involved in recovery operations for Japanese business operations.  This notification came within minutes of the Kobe 7.2 earthquake on Tuesday, January 17, 1995.
<p>
The Worldwide Command Center duty manager realized that he and the Dallas based Information Systems and Services (IS&S) team would be getting involved in providing disaster recovery operational support to the Kobe/TI Semiconductor, Inc. plant.
<p>
Although no TI plant was impacted by the Kobe quake, this joint venture semiconductor plant, located about 30 miles North of Kobe, was affected.  The venture, Kobe Texas Instruments (KTI) Semiconductor, Inc., employs about 400 people and is jointly owned by T.I.. and Kobe Steel Ltd.  TI owns 25 percent and Kobe Steel Ltd., 75 percent.  The plant manufactures the 4 and 16 megabyte dynamic random access memories (DRAM) for Texas Instruments.
<p>
By mid-morning on the day of the quake, the KTI plant manager reported that there were no injuries to plant employees, and that the KTI manufacturing facility had incurred no structural damage.  Some production equipment shifted during the quake, and the remote computer processing support was interrupted--no estimate as to full impact of damages at the remote computer center were known.
<p>
Once the full extent of the damages were know--Tuesday, the 17th about noon (CST), the Dallas based IS&S management team formed a Kobe TI Recovery Team.  The team established a command center and a call-me telephone bridge for daily team meetings.  From the Dallas Worldwide Command Center and the Kobe TI Recovery Team Command Center, all recovery operations were controlled--all decisions jointly discussed and fully implemented.
<p>
The Miho computer center had just completed a major technology upgrade during the Christmas holidays.  A spare IBM 3090-600 remained on the Miho computer room floor and it was prepped to host the recovery of the Kobe operating system.
<p>
The Dallas team was concurrently coordinating the activity of three individual teams:  The Miho site restoration team using the surplus IBM 3090-600 processor, the shipment of Kobe Steel Ltd. computer center tapes and DASD to Miho, and the combined IBM-U.S. and IBM-Japan teams who were sourcing strings of DASD (12 volumes) and an IBM 3725 communications controller.
<p>
By Thursday, January 19th, all of the essential components necessary for a successful recovery had been assembled at TI's Miho computer center.  As the Miho team concentrated on installing, cabling and testing the computer and communications hardware on the Miho computer room floor, the Dallas IS&S team concentrated on documenting the Kobe system recovery slips.  The recovery script was produced in less than 48 hours using the TI Universal Manufacturing computer center disaster recovery plan (DRP) script.
<p>
By the end of the third day of the KTI recovery, the Kobe operating system had been loaded on the 3090-600.  The required DASD had been received from IBM Japan,  as well as a critical IBM 3725 communications controller.
<p>
It was on Friday, January 20th, that the KTI plant manager declared that all production equipment and test equipment had been completely re-calibrated and that the plant was awaiting the recovery of the computer systems.  This semiconductor plant, like many other TI plants, is fully automated and totally dependent upon its semiconductor manufacturing system for its process control.
<p>
On day five the semiconductor manufacturing system was recovered to the point of the last tape backup.  Now that the factory was in operation, the recovery team took on the task of recovering the applications to the actual point of the interruption.  The significance of this restoration of the applications to the actual point of interruption, permitted the KTI manufacturing process to capture all data points necessary to restart the process without loss of any product in the "work in progress" status saving
 the TI plant $8million--product that otherwise woudl have been scrapped.

<font size=5> The Shock Heard "Round The World'<p>

<br>It was almost uncanny!  It was almost as if mother nature decided to say "happy birthday" to the Northridge Quake with another earth-shattering event in Kobe, Japan.  Before you point out that the Northridge Earthquake took place last January 17, 1994  and the Kobe quake took place on the sixteenth of January, 1995, keep in mind that Japan is on the other side of the international dateline and it was a day later than in the States; the seventeenth of January!   Beyond the coincidence of dates, however, these two earthquakes had little in common when viewed from the perspective of impact to life, property and to the Japanese
 and world economies.
<p>
It will be known for all time as The Great Southern Hyogo Earthquake, named for the prefecture within whose boundaries the port city of Kobe is situated.  In  just 20 seconds, this  crowded, prosperous  and bustling center of industry  was transformed into a muddle of death and debris.  According to geologists,  Northridge released the power of its energy in a vertical thrust while the Kobe event  exerted a horizontal force that shifted the fault line nearly five feet.
<p>
The city of Kobe is one of the most important centers of industry in Japan.  With 10% of the population, a full 20% of the gross domestic product flows through this modern city.  The port ( the second largest in Japan and the sixth largest in the world) handles 12% of all worldwide Japanese exports and fully 31% of all exports to the United States.  All but 4 of the 239 shipping berths were damaged in the quake and this is expected to put a huge dent in the port's transport capacity; a robust 2.7 million containers shipped each year.  Manufactured goods from   Mitsubishi, Mazda, Toyota, Hosiden (which manufactures liquid crystal screens for laptops) and many other companies with facilities in the area will have to find another means of shipment for the foreseeable future.    That is, of course, after they have recovered their businesses sufficiently enough to resume full production.  United States based companies with facilities in Kobe like Proctor & Gamble, Eli Lilly, Caterpillar,  Texas Instruments and others also suffered at the hands of this disaster but showed a remarkable resiliency in their ability to react and respond.  Why is this disaster unique among the many that have occurred in recent times?  What happened in the immediate aftermath of this quake and what lessons are to be learned?
<p>
Japan has a unique and closely guarded business tradition that is deeply rooted and widely held.  One of the mainstays of that tradition is the belief in, and the commitment to, the value of long term planning.  The acceptance of this principle is so widespread and the efforts at planning so thorough and precise that contingency plans are not usually developed.  The reliance on the effectiveness of this planning is so complete as to make spontaneous action and flexibility very difficult.
Kobe, the people were told, was built with state-of-the-art techniques and construction methods designed to withstand severe earthquakes.  They believed a disaster could never happen and they were not only wrong but ill prepared to respond to the emergency.
<p>
There was no immediate response when the quake subsided.  Four hours passed  before the governor of the Hyogo Prefecture asked for help from the Japanese Defense Forces.  It took the JDF another 5 hours to respond and a full two days before they arrived in Kobe in force.  Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama all but confessed that a lack of preparedness and bureaucratic bungling significantly delayed recovery efforts.  Teams of doctors arrived only to be held at the airport for three days because they did not have the necessary licenses to practice in Japan.  It took 2 days to get the necessary permission to have 50,000 blankets shipped in from the United States.  Tons of emergency supplies stockpiled on US bases in Japan were delayed for days and then only specific items like tents and  plastic sheets were requested.  Of the 60 nations that offered assistance to the Japanese government, only 20 offers were accepted.
<p>
The lack of a workable contingency plan played havoc with the businesses in the immediate areas, particularly for
suppliers of parts and components.  The widespread Japanese business practice of  kanban , the just-in-time inventory methodology, was particularly vulnerable to this type of disaster.  Even those plants not in the immediate vicinity of
the quake were affected if their suppliers suffered any loss of production whatsoever.  There is little if any slack in the
precisely tuned flow of component parts and the slightest disruption of even one supplier, or the transport of the component parts,  had an inordinate ripple effect up the line to the main manufacturing plant.  The tightly coupled interrelationships between suppliers and producers, intensified by inadequate contingency plans, caused disruptions in the flow
of materials and on manufacturing that were more significant than they should have been.
<p>
The concept of  business recovery planning, particularly as it relates to consulting and alternative recovery facilities
services, is not as well practiced in Japan as it is in the States.  There are no governmental regulations that govern the
ability to resume business in the event of a disaster.  Most of the companies in Japan are members of a certain keritsu, a
family of businesses with common interests that rely upon one another in times of need.   It is not unusual for members of a business family to come to depend upon one another with a reciprocal agreement for data processing recovery support.  We have come to learn how inadequate reciprocal agreements truly are and more companies in the States are migrating away from them and availing themselves of the full range of services and equipment the US  recovery industry has evolved to.  That notwithstanding, the l
ack of regulatory pressures along with closely knit corporations in a mutually protective business climate has not been entirely fertile ground for the growth of a commercial business recovery industry.  As a result, the mature and widely  accepted business recovery industry as we know it in the United States is still emerging in Japan.
<p>
There were approximately 1700 computer systems in the Kobe area that were somehow affected by the earthquake.  The majority of the efforts at recovery involved repair or replacement of  computers and peripheral equipment.  Over 650 IBM Japan Customer Service Engineers were dispatched into the Kobe area after the quake.  They came from all over the country.  They brought sleeping blankets, food and clothing with them so as to be able to stay at the customers' locations overnight.  Whatever equipment could no
t be repaired was replaced.  Many customers relocated to areas outside Kobe where replacement equipment was shipped.  There were many heroic efforts and wonderful stories of dedication and commitment to customers and some even were able to resume processing within the week.  However, there were too few stories of customers executing a previously prepared and fully tested business recovery plan and resuming business within a prescribed time-line.
<p>
There were exceptions but they came mainly from Japan based offices of US companies.  Proctor & Gamble moved quickly to resume business operations from Osaka after their 30 story office building in Kobe was damaged.   The best example, however, was that of Texas Instruments.  This US based company has been involved in business recovery planning at a corporate level for nearly 10 years.  Led by Ben D. Taylor, a recognized disaster recovery industry expert and TI's Manager of Contingency and Disaster Recovery
 Planning, the worldwide electronics manufacturer  had worked assiduously to design, develop and refine their recovery plans and scripted restoration instructions to a remarkable level of accuracy and precision.
<p>
When the Kobe center went down, they were without equipment and without  plan.  A stroke of luck provided the equipment (they had recently upgraded and the replaced equipment was still handy and available) and a stroke of genius provided the plan.  Since Dallas-based TI has worldwide responsibility for applications and systems software, the Japan based systems were virtually identical to the Dallas systems.  Ben's team went to work to fine-tune the fully tested recovery scripts and transmitted them to Japan  where they worked to perfection.  The systems were recovered and operational in about four days.  While a marvelous feat, it was not exactly planned to work this way.  What made it work, however, was the skill and expertise of a few dedicated people who had previously refined their recovery scripts on the strength of their commitment to contingency planning and testing.  Had there been no recovery scripts or had they not been so rigorously tested and precisely refined, it is highly unlikely that this recovery could have taken place anywhere near the relatively short time it took.
<p>
 As a matter of fact, many US companies with offices in Japan tried valiantly to assist in the business recovery
efforts.  All of the major recovery industry providers of service, in turn, tried to assist  their US subscribers in their exertions to assist their overseas counterparts.  Unfortunately, in too many cases,  the monumental efforts of many people were not able to achieve after the fact what a fraction of the effort could have achieved before the fact.   If there are any lessons to be learned from this disaster, they are certainly not new ones.
<p>
Firstly, the age old bugaboo, it can't happen to me,  is still as false and empty as it has always been.  Regardless of
the precautions taken and the assurances given, a disaster can strike at any place at any time.  Too many business executives, in many countries, remain in a state of denial about this unshakable truth.  It is far more responsible to plan and prepare for a disaster than to deny its possibility.  Kobe was virtually destroyed by a disaster that no one was prepared for because it was never supposed to happen!
<p>
Second,  planning for recovery from a disaster must be realistic and reflective. This requires an accurate business
impact analysis to determine what needs to be recovered and how long a period of time that recovery can consume without adversely impacting a business.  In addition, a well-drilled recovery plan is required to ensure that the recovery process can be successfully implemented.  The heroic efforts to restore services in the aftermath of the Kobe quake were, for the most part, ad hoc.  This was true for both the recoveries of the city's infrastructure as well as for the businesses that were impacted.  Without a plan, it is impossible to predict or expect a successful recovery.  Why, then, do so many companies still leave the outcome to chance?
<p>
The after effects of the Kobe Earthquake will be felt around the world.  The manufacturing and shipping delays
promises to create shortages of certain products across the globe.  The shortages will eventually be made up and the Japanese economy is healthy enough to absorb the cost of rebuilding the torn city.   Had this catastrophe befallen Tokyo, however, with 31 million inhabitants and a highly centralized and densely packed corporate leadership structure, the results would have been significantly worse.
<p>
The lessons of this catastrophe are already being absorbed by both government and business officials alike.  More stringent construction standards are being called for, particularly for the rebuilding of Kobe which remains on a major seismic fault line.  Many Japanese companies are reconsidering their business recovery plans and appear more open to considering service providers to deliver this unique and specialized service.  US companies with overseas facilities with data processing centers are making arrangements to cover those sites with backup facilities based in the States.   This disaster, as so many before it, has turned many nonbelievers into vocal proponents of thorough contingency planning.
<p>
The tremor that sent ripples across the Pacific to the far reaches of the globe has now passed into history.  But the ripples will remain visible for a long time to come.  The follow-on consequences to the world's economy, as well as that of Japan, are yet to be appreciated but will almost surely follow.  The consequences to companies will also surely spawn a new wave of consciousness in the area of business recovery planning and testing.  Perhaps even those fortunate souls not directly impacted by this event will finally wake up and take notice.  After all, in the final analysis, the most we can hope for is that the key decision-makers in government and business around the world will become more insightful from this experience.  Then again.
.... maybe they won't!

<br>Wednesday April 19, 1995 started like any other day for  the residents of Oklahoma City.  People were just beginning their daily routine when suddenly, the unimaginable happened.  At 9:04 a.m. CT a bomb was detonated in front of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City.  The sound from the blast was heard up to 15 miles away, but the repercussions of what had happened traveled around the world.  The worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil had just happened deep in America's heartland.
<p>
The bomb was a two to three ton device made of ammonium nitrate fertilizer mixed with combustible fuel oil.  It was placed inside of a rented Ryder truck, which was then parked in front of the north side of the building.  The blast destroyed one-third of the building from roof to ground, leaving a crater eight feet deep, and 30 feet wide.
<p>
 <br><IMG SRC="okbomb-2.gif" img align=left WIDTH=30% HEIGHT=70% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>The building housed several federal offices including the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Administration, Social Security Administration and several others.  There was also a day-care center located within the building.  In all, 169 people were killed and several hundred were injured, some severely.
<p>
The design aspects of the Alfred P. Murrah building were not particularly remarkable.  Its cast-poured concrete and glass structure can be seen replicated in many downtowns across the country.  To prevent overheating by the sun, architects had shielded the south half of the building Wednesday April 19, 1995 started like any other day for  the residents of Oklahoma City.  People were just beginning their daily routine when suddenly, the unimaginable happened.  At 9:04 a.m. CT a bomb was detonated in front of
the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City.
<p>
The sound from the blast was heard up to 15 miles away, but the repercussions of what had happened traveled around the world.  The worst act of terrorism on U.S. soil had just happened deep in America's heartland.
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="okbomb-3.gif" img align=left WIDTH=40% HEIGHT=35% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>Several buildings surrounding the Alfred P. Murrah building sustained damage also.  The Oklahoma Water Resources and the Journal Records Buildings directly across the street sustained heavy damage to windows and offices.  Parts of the federal building were actually blown into the face of these office buildings.  The YMCA was also badly damaged from the blast as well as the First United Methodist Church, which suffered severe structural damage.  The Federal Courthouse located directly behind the blast face of the Alfred P. Murrah building had several windows blown out.
<p>
For the first week following the blast, an entire eight-block radius was closed to the general public.   Since it was considered a crime scene, security was very tight in this area.  This made it difficult for recovery teams to try and assess the damages that awaited them.  The offices of Kerr McGee and Conoco were in this secured zone.
<p>
Soon after the bomb was detonated, around the country, city after city, people wondered if it could happen in their town.  Bomb scares ranged from Boston, New York, Washington and Nashville making residents feel jittery and vulnerable.
<br><IMG SRC="okbomb-6.gif" img align=left WIDTH=40% HEIGHT=35% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>Less than 48 hours after the blast, FBI agents, with the help of state and local authorities, had apprehended and charged the first suspect in the bombing.  Timothy James McVeigh was already in police custody when evidence pointed to his involvement with the blast.  The search for the second suspect is intensifying as the days pass since the blast.  The government is offering a $2 million reward leading to his arrest and conviction.
<p>
What was a shock to the majority of people was that these were two caucasian American's from the Midwest.
These actual suspects were very different from preliminary beliefs that there was some sort of Middle-Eastern involvement in the bombing.  The initial belief that a Middle-Eastern group was responsible was probably a response from the World Trade Center bombing on February 26, 1993, where six people were killed  and more than 1,000 were injured.   Four Middle-Eastern men were convicted in that incident and a fifth is awaiting trial.
<p>
  As the story behind Tim McVeigh's background unfolded, attention was drawn to his involvement with militant militia groups that have a great deal of animosity towards the U.S. Government.  Militia groups have existed since the Revolutionary War.  However, many Americans are unfamiliar with groups of this nature and their particular beliefs or ideals.
In response to the bombing, politicians are pushing for strict regulations of ammonium nitrate, a very common fertilizer.  In Europe, where people have suffered far more terrorist bombings than the United States; they have been better protected from easily accessible fertilizer-based bombs like the ones used in Oklahoma  City and the World Trade Center bombings.  Ammonium nitrate has been tightly regulated in Western Europe since 1980 and is sold only for use as an explosive to people with special permits.
 In the U.S., by contrast, six million tons of ammonium nitrate are produced annually for fertilizer and sold openly in major farming communities.  If it becomes highly regulated, it could drastically affect the agriculture industry in this country.

<strong>Eyewitness Account</strong>
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="okbomb-7.gif" img align=left WIDTH=40% HEIGHT=35% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>Around 9 a.m. on April 1995, I was getting ready to leave the Myriad, our convention center, when I felt a terrific blast. I thought we had experienced an earthquake except that the ground was not vibrating.
<p>
The shock wave from the blast was so powerful that many building occupants miles away thought that their building was the victim of a disaster.
<p>
I rushed up the street about six blocks to see that our nine story Murrah Federal Building had the front half completely blown off and the majority was gutted with only a shell left. It was a mass of twisted steel with dense smoke caused by car fires in the parking lot across the street. There was glass all over the streets for blocks and businesses several blocks away had some or all of their windows blown out.
<p>
<strong>The Need For Planning</strong>
<p>
The bombing is the most devastating terrorist event of recent history, the greatest on U.S. soil, and proves that no area is safe. Regardless of our location, we are all vulnerable to terrorists and should include this threat in our business and mission recovery planning.
<p>
Prior to the bombing, I had been in the destroyed building several times. Many of the businesses housed in the federal building had no total business/mission recovery plan. As frequently happens, other priorities got in the way and planning for business recovery was deferred.
<p>
One organization, a single-site operation, had most everything destroyed by the bomb. Eighteen of their 33 employees were listed as dead or missing. Fortunately their data was offsite and they were able to return to business quickly.
I have a client in a building about 150 feet from the destroyed building. They were committed to recovery planning, and we were already in the process of developing a recovery plan. After the area was sealed off because of the bombing, we were able to arrange for them to get back into their building for a short period.
<p>
The inside of the building looked like an earthquake, tornado or hurricane had struck. Doors were blown off, ceilings were down, lights and cables were either down or hanging and files and debris were all over. Shattered glass was everywhere. Computer and special office equipment
<p>
<strong>Observations and Recommendations</strong>
<p>
Most of the lessons learned are basic, but need to be reiterated.
<p>
Have a current recovery plan that will cover both personnel safety/evacuation and business or government operations. The plan should include recovery from appropriate or multiple locations. In the Oklahoma City situation, many downtown premises, including supply and service sources, were inaccessible or off limits.
<p>
Consider that your personnel may not even be able to get to alternate locations for operations or supplies. Organizations should have recovery plans with several options and a well trained staff to maximize recovery effectiveness.
<p>
Accountability of personnel has been a problem at the Oklahoma City bombing site because basic planning was not done in many cases. Have a marshaling area, some distance from your building where all employees are told to go.
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="okbomb-8.gif" img align=left WIDTH=40% HEIGHT=35% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>Develop a list for the marshaling area and have each employee give their name and sign in before they are permitted to leave. Those who assist the injured in evacuation should provide names of the injured and attempt to ascertain which medial facility will be used.
<p>
Those in glass buildings are more vulnerable to injury and damage from storms, earthquakes, and bombings.
<p>
If you are in a facility with a lot of glass, either stock plywood and tarps or get them immediately to cover open or damaged areas. Protect your facilities and equipment from further damage.
<p>
I know of one facility manager who has had all his glass pre-measured and has the measurements stored in a glass company's computer.
<p>
Also, have a way of providing effective security, especially after a disaster.
<p>
Have shut off locations for all utilities identified in your plan. Non-engineering personnel should also be trained in utility shut off procedures. I suggest a sign or instructions, posted discretely, for a few key personnel.
<p>
Fortunately, in Oklahoma City, the gas company was able to turn off the gas and prevent more explosions. There was also water problems because several pipes were severed during the explosion.
<p>
I recommend each employee keep a plastic bag in their desk drawer to facilitate removal of purses, jackets and "work in progress." Obviously one should not jeopardize safety, but, following the bombing, many employees in nearby buildings had time to take a few things with them on the way out. Remember, you may not get back into a facility for some time or ever once it is sealed off or declared off limits.
<p>
It is important to get a positive message on your incoming phones as soon as possible. I recommend you have several sample messages and the mechanism/procedures set up in advance to do this.
<p>
State that your organization has been impacted by a disaster. All essential data and information were backed up and stored offsite. Explain that you have implemented your business recovery plan and expect to restore essential operations shortly, or by a certain day. You should also take the initiative to notify major customers via phone, fax, overnight letter or newspaper ads. It is also important to assure your customers as well as those who may have outstanding financial obligations that all records are safe.
<p>
An important requirement for the contingency planner is to develop several alternatives to both voice and data communications backup.
<p>
The disaster in Oklahoma City provided an opportunity to show  that backup communications are important. Sometimes cellular worked and other times it didn't or was busy.
<p>
To improve cellular communications, one of our cellular providers was able to give priority to certain numbers that had been pre-identified through a local business and government emergency management organization. They even brought in a portable cell site on wheels to place in the high cellular traffic area. This provided additional communication routes for the cellular phones.
Regular phone service was available to some and others experienced difficulties such as dead phones, instant busy or recordings. Portable phone banks and other emergency services were provided.
<P>
Have computer equipment checked by professionals after damage from debris, dust, soot, fire or water.
<p>
Recovery planning should list all  skills of employees that could be useful in responding to or recovering from a disaster.
One organization in the Oklahoma City area found the services of an employee who is also a reserve sheriff deputy to be valuable. He was able to get past the barricades and into the damaged building to bring  items, equipment and information out and could coordinate with other law enforcement personnel for special requirements.
<p>
Further, those who were trained in first aid or had EMT and paramedical training were of great service in the initial treatment of injured employees.
<p>
There is no absolute protection against sabotage and terrorism. However, a current business/mission recovery plan is a must.
There are certain vulnerabilities that can be avoided as well as ways to make an operation less attractive to a terrorist or saboteur.
Because large scale terrorist attacks frequently cause regional disasters, even those businesses that are not a target need an effective recovery plan which can allow their operation to continue or recover.

<br>The bombing at the World Trade Center signaled a significant change in the tactics of international terrorists.  It should have provided a serious warning about the potential dangers of the calculated detonation of an explosive device in a large office building.  It is not clear, however, that the pure and simple impacts of such a demonstration of violence were fully appreciated and acted upon.  The most likely reason for this, perhaps, is that the most significant business impact of the Trade Center bombing was denial of access.  Once that problem was resolved, many companies had little difficulty in resuming normal business.  The April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, on the other hand, was a very different incident.  It was similar only in the fact that the explosion was caused by a terrorists' bomb.  Almost every other aspect of Oklahoma City differed from the World Trade Center incident.
<p>
First, the World Trade Center bombing was a true disaster, but the Oklahoma City bombing was an American tragedy.  The loss of life was appalling and the impact on the community was devastating.
<p>
The World Trade Center bombing was the work of international terrorists; Oklahoma City was a homegrown event.  Some people viewed the Oklahoma City bombing as a stab in the back from an unexpected sector of the population.
<p>
The World Trade Center bombing in New York city was intended to make a political statement in the darkest terms.  Choosing to do this in the media capital of the world was neither a accident nor a surprise.  Terrorists wage psychological warfare and frighten and intimidate by the threat of action as well as the action itself. This usually results in attacks on highly visible, high profile targets.  It is this technique that the terrorist employs to gain the most widespread publicity.  Oklahoma City changed all of that.  These fanatics chose an obscure target, perhaps deciding that its obscurity made it that much more vulnerable.  And they decided to make it a particularly savage attack; apparently to assure the notoriety that might otherwise be absent in Oklahoma City.
<p>
The message is clear; there is no place, however removed from the mainstream, that is invulnerable to a terrorist bomb.  This event has significantly raised the stakes!
<p>
Finally, there is a substantial difference to the business impact between the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City.  There was a disruption of one day, a Friday, on February 26, 1993 when the WTC was bombed.  Most of the 900 businesses were ill-prepared as they found it necessary to return to their offices to recover critical records and files.  Thankfully, in this case, most companies were able to resume normal business because they were able to locate and retrieve data and equipment.  We were even able to witness, through the miracle of live television coverage, many businesses disaster recovery contingency plans in action.  Unfortunately, some of these plans consisted of nothing more than an old coffee cart piled up with personal computers, floppy disks and peripherals as they were wheeled continuously out of the lobby of the World Trade Center throughout the weekend.  There would be no such luxury in Oklahoma City.  Destruction on this scale leaves no margin for error or forgives any omission in a disaster recovery plan. Everything in the building was destroyed and anything needed for business resumption, especially data, had better have been backed up someplace else.
<p>
 Contingency planners should be reevaluating their plans with Oklahoma City in mind, especially since the probabilities of a repeat event in the future just jumped off the scale.
<p>
What areas of contingency planning need to be reexamined in light of this increased threat?  To start with, it is essential to review the equipment replacement provisions of the plan.  Older equipment, particularly that which may be difficult if not impossible to replace must be identified. The used equipment market, leasing companies or brokers may be able to locate the required types and quantities.  The contingency planner must then evaluate the cost case and either acquire the replacement gear or recomm
end an upgrade to more modern, and therefore more readily available equipment.
<p>
Those companies that store backup tapes in that huge fireproof vault in the basement should rethink that approach in light of the nature of the Murrah Federal Building disaster.  Everything in the lower levels was covered by over 25 tons of debris and, if not completely destroyed, could not have been accessed for an extended period of time, assuming there was a vault that was not crushed.  Even the practice of keeping the latest backups on site while sending prior versions to an offsite vault should be reco
nsidered.  Recovery plans should also consider the use of an alternate site for office workers.  Buildings damaged as severely as the Murrah Federal Building will never be repaired and reoccupied.  Both temporary and permanent replacement quarters need to be considered in any plan.  Alternate site vendors do provide office and end-user office space but in a case like this, it is probably a better bet to make arrangements for another facility reasonably close to the damaged site.
<p>
Had this disaster struck a building with a large computing center, the business impacts might have been cataclysmic.  Presuming that there was an alternate site recovery plan for the data center, it was clear that many of the personnel would have been unwilling or unable to travel there for recovery purposes.  Whether an alternate site recovery plan is in place with an outside supplier or with another data center within the same enterprise, a successful recovery would have been unlikely if it depended on people from the afflicted site.  Therefore, prudent recovery planning and subsequent exercises should be designed to achieve business recovery and continuity without the on site presence of the client's recovery specialists.
<p>
Contingency planning managers are not the only corporate personnel who are compelled to rethink their plans.  Security managers are also challenged by the higher threat of the probability of bombings in the United States punctuated by the Oklahoma City occurrence.  They, more than most, realize that there were over 1900 bombings in the U.S. in 1992 (according to statistics from the ATF) compared to under 600 bombings in 1982.  They also know, based on those same statistics, that bombings have increased every year since 1981.  Compounding this bleak outlook is the considered opinion of most security experts that it is nearly impossible to prevent a bombing conducted by a determined, highly motivated and well backed radical group or individual.
<p>
It is questionable whether current structures can be made "bombproof" with retrofit building modifications.  It is also highly doubtful that the architecture and design of many future buildings will be strengthened to better withstand a bomb.  It is simply too expensive.  Weight bearing vertical columns, however, will most likely be made round in the future (instead of square) because square columns are most susceptible to the pressure of the explosion's shock wave.
<p>
One way to prevent a future bombing is through better security.  Security can be improved in most buildings by simply keeping vehicles away from near proximity to the structure.  Any bomb large enough to damage a building would necessarily have to be carried in a car or truck.  If these vehicles are kept away from buildings, damage would be minimized.  The truck that carried the explosives in the Oklahoma City incident was allowed to get within 15 feet of the building by using a pull-in lane.  This was close enough to rupture enough vertical support columns to start the "progressive collapse" of the upper floors.  Keeping vehicles away from buildings is the most significant action that security managers can take to significantly reduce the risk of a building collapse should an explosive device be detonated.
<p>
Policies like this, if strictly enforced, may discourage terrorists from even attempting to bomb buildings that exhibit a careful, firm and comprehensive security posture.

<br>On Wednesday April 19, BMS CAT dispatched their advance command team to Oklahoma City.  A BMS CAT Operations Manager and Team Leader assessed damage to four of the major buildings peripheral to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building, and met with government officials at midnight to give them a damage report and recommend emergency mitigation procedures.  The following day, BMS CAT Special Technologies Division and Senior Project Management personnel arrived to provide a technical assessment of the contaminants generated, to recommend restoration cleaning protocols for critical computer equipment, telecommunications equipment, and other critical contents of GSA buildings, and to plan the restoration projects to return the buildings to operation within the time frame dictated (four days) by the needs of the occupant agencies.
<p>
It was interesting in that, unlike the World Trade Center, here no explosion by-products were generated.  An explosion is similar to a fire in that soot composed of oxidized organics, chlorides, nitrates, sulfides, and carbon is generated and spread throughout the facility.  In Oklahoma City, the blast was external to the buildings so that was not a problem.  Construction material particulates such as pulverized concrete, mortar, gypsum, and cellulose were the major contaminants measured, and no long term corrosive mechanisms which would affect the equipment reliability were found within these buildings.
<p>
<br><IMG SRC="okbomb8a.gif" img align=left WIDTH=50% HEIGHT=45% HSPACE=.5 VSPACE=.5 BORDER=1> 
<br>The Federal Courthouse, the "Old Post Office", Federal Office Building, the Metropolitan Library Building, and the C.R. Anthony Building all had similar damage from the blast.  Windows were blown out with the glass shrapnel widely spread through various rooms.  Ceiling fixtures and suspended ceilings collapsed, plaster ceilings crumbled onto the contents of the room.  Computer equipment was propelled to the floor, and book shelves overturned.  In one case, building structural damage dictated the removal of
all office furniture and computer equipment and relocation to a temporary location.  To make matters worse, rain was imminent.  Senior project managers began the emergency mitigation procedures to stabilize the environment and to protect the contents of several major buildings which had been severely impacted by the blast.  Windows were boarded, glass and other debris were removed, and controlled demolition was done as required to allow restoration to proceed.  BMS CAT worked around the clock to finish the
restoration work, with over 90 management/supervisory staff and over 400 persons on the labor staff.  Good organization was necessary in order to carry out an efficient and orderly restoration with over 530,000 square feet of buildings restored and all four of the previously mentioned buildings ready for reoccupancy on schedule Monday April 24.
<p>
With the extremely tight FBI security measures in place, ingress and egress of this staff of workers was a challenge in itself.  During the first few days, all personnel had to report to the command center at 8th and Harvey each morning and get in line to be issued a 24 hour pass.  The FBI finally went to a permanent color coded photo badge.  Red badges were allowed inside the outer perimeter which was maintained by FBI and ATF agents.  Getting all individuals approved for entry to the work site and photo b
adged took several hours.  Workers went on standby for several hours at the Federal Court Building to allow time for the FBI evidence team to clear the building for entry.

<strong>A Message For Our Readers....</strong>
<p>
In a tragic situation such as what occurred in Oklahoma City, it is often difficult to focus on anything beyond the terrible loss of life. We sympathize thoroughly with the families of the victims and agree that loss of life is definitely the most disheartening loss of all.
<p>
However, the bombing caused other losses which need to be addressed. Numerous businesses in the downtown area were affected - by structural damage, employee trauma, and the inability to access their business site. Their stories of triumph or trouble in this disastrous situation can help others - now and during future disasters, whether natural or man-made.
<p>
We feel it necessary to report on these losses. Though they do not compare in importance to the loss of life, these losses are critical. The contingency planning lessons learned from this tragedy can help protect future  businesses - and possibly save lives.
<P>
For that reason, we have produced this special report on the Oklahoma City bombing. The articles contained in this edition focus on a variety of contingency planning issues.  The special report was made possible by the following companies, who agree that furthering disaster recovery education is necessary:

Penton Publishing, Inc.<br><br><br><br>
<font size=7>O</font size>n a frigid morning last winter, a broken water main showered the first four floors of Penton Publishing's Cleveland headquarters with a million gallons of water and large chunks of Superior Ave.  Fifteen of the company's 35 magazines were directly affected.<br>
<br>Guided by REXSYS, the business recovery planning system from Recovery Management, Inc., and working round-the-clock, the Penton recovery teams "got down to work and did exactly what they were supposed to do," says Penton vice president, Susan Grimm.<br>
<br>Within hours, Penton was up and running and within two weeks was at full strength.  "We used REXSYS to build a database of recovery plans, including the names and phone numbers of employees on recovery teams.  The REXSYS design made it easy to update the system with what we learned from this disaster.  The fact that we discussed and planned for disaster recovery gave us the confidence and knowledge to recover quickly," Grimm explained.<br>
<br>Windows-based REXSYS is easy to use and provides all the tools you'll need to quickly create a plan to protect your business.  Call Recovery Management, Inc. today at 1-800-764-8866<br>

Thumb Lock Fasteners were 100% effective in the NorthRidge earthquake of 1994.  Thumb Lock Fasteners lock down terminals, PC's, printers, copiers, laboratory apparatus-almost any office or technical equipment that can shake loose, topple or fall in an earthquake or other jarring movement.  Excellent for rack-mounted equipment, data center consoles, desk and file cabinet restraints, and a variety of applications for government and military use.  Selected by the State of California for earthquake Safety, they prevented major losses in Los Angeles installations.<P>

Dear Disaster Recovery Planner,<br>
<br>
This summer, Atlanta will be a busy place as the Olympic Games debut in that city. These games will be attended by hundreds of athletes who have devoted their life to training for this one event.<br>
This fall, Atlanta will remain a busy place when Disaster Recovery Journal's 15th conference returns to that city. This event will be attended by hundreds of business continuity planners, like you, who are devoted to the profession.
And like Olympic athletes,  continuity planners are constantly striving to improve their skills and perfect their methods.<br>
That's why we've assembled the brightest and best the disaster recovery world has to offer to conduct sessions at this symposium. They'll provide timely tips, lessons learned and technological information to which every disaster recovery planner can relate. <br>
Our conference is arranged so that both the novice and experienced planners can gain valuable new information and learn how to apply it to their own personal situations.<br>
To join us in Atlanta, sign up for the sessions of your choice on the registration form on page 16 of this brochure. Additional information about  the conference's offerings can be found below.<br>

Disaster Recovery Journal presents its 15th conference<br></center></font size>
<br>
<br>
OVERVIEW<br>
<br>
Although the Olympics in Atlanta may be over by September, there's still a good reason to travel to this southern city.
Atlanta will be the site of Disaster Recovery Journal's 15th conference .  This conference promises to provide the best information available in the contingency planning field.<br>
Everything from the latest in technology to case studies of recovery from previous disasters will be covered in our sessions and workshops.<br>
The topics are presented so that everyone, from beginners to experienced contingency planners, will benefit by attending.<br>
<br>
<br>
GENERAL SESSIONS<br>
<br>
Our general sessions cover information which should be of interest to all our attendees. The speakers are well-known in the industry and knowledgable of trends and state-of-the-art technology.
Two General Sessions are held each morning. On Wednesday, an attendance prize drawing will be held immediately following the General Session 5. <br>
<br><br>
BREAKOUT SESSIONS<br>
<br>
Breakout sessions provide an opportunity for individuals to attend sessions covering topics of their own interests.  Attendees may select two of the ten sessions offered on Monday afternoon. 
The sessions are arranged by five subjects: Managerial; Technical; Communications; Emergency Response; and Strategic. <br>
<br>
ISSUES AND ANSWERS<br>
<br>
We'll again feature our popular "Issues and Answers" session at this conference. 
The session is an open forum allowing attendees to find answers to questions or problems they're having. It will be held on Wednesday morning.
Questions for the forum need to be submitted in advance. Please include your question or concern on the registration form on page 5.<br>
<br><br>
WORKSHOPS<br>
<br>
Six workshops are held on Tuesday afternoon;  attendees select the one of greatest interest to them.
These three-hour sessions feature an opportunity for attendees to cover a subject in an in-depth manner. Hands-on attention will be provided by the workshop speaker. These workshops are available at no additional cost.<br>
<br><br>
EXHIBITION<br>
<br>
Our conferences' exhibitions always feature more than 80 booths manned by exhibitors who are the industry leaders. These  companies display the latest products and services available in the contingency planning field.
The exhibits, open on Monday and Tuesday, are housed in the same building as the conference, making it convenient to view booths during breaks and lunch.<br>
<br>
CERTIFICATION COURSES<br>
<br>
DRI International will offer their certification and special courses following the close of the conference. Classes begin on Wednesday afternoon and continue through Friday. For more information, see pages 6 and 7.<br>

D.J. Harrington<br>
Phone Logic, Inc.<br>
<br>

In today's challenging times we must don many hats to function under some extreme conditions...even when looking at global events and relating them to everyday business challenges.  In today's fast paced world, you must be prepared for anything at anytime.  Recent disasters such as bombings, terrorist attacks, and earthquakes have proven that contingency planners must be able to react in an instant.  You can't do today's business with yesterdays thinking and hope to be ahead tomorrow.  Discover new ways of looking at life, and then deliver back to your workplace a new you.  Find the one hat which is right for you and how to wear it under any condition.<br>
Mr. Harrington is president and chief executive officer of Phone Logic, Inc., an international telemarketing and training company based in Atlanta, Ga. He serves as a consultant to over 600 privately owned businesses throughout the country, training personnel at all levels of the company.

General Session 3     Tuesday 8:30 - 9:45 a.m.</b>	<br>			
Dale Stewart<br>
FieldTek Logistics<br>

<br>
	
Consider the difficulties of logistical deployment in a major disaster.  Significant difficulties have occurred during the interfacing of govenment agencies and private industry during crisis situations.  When an area wide disaster strikes, where food and water supplies are contaminated, infrastructure is heavily damaged, and support services are out of commission the interfacing of government and private sectors is very difficult.  Mr. Stewart will speak on the issues and methodologies involved in linking Government agency rescue operations with business recovery efforts in a major disaster.  Mr. Stewart will discuss WAN crisis communications linking the Government with private entities and satellite up-linking to support crisis communications.<br>
Mr. Stewart is known worldwide by many different industries as a leader in remote site logistics, services and operations. He has direct experience in Arctic, Jungle, Desert, and Mountain terrain. Mr. Stewart is a leader in using innovative approaches and proven methodologies that can be applied to discovering solutions to the most demanding situations. <br>

"Disaster Recovery Into The Next Millennium"	<br>	<IMG SRC="speakers/wesm.gif" img align=right>	
General Session 5     Wednesday 8:30 - 9:45 a.m.</b>	<br>		
Wes Melling<br>
Digital Equipment Corp.<br>
<br>
Computing can be survival - when it is not available business stops and very often does not come back. The best way for a computer system to "recover" from a disaster is for it not to stop running in the first place. Plummeting hardware prices are making multi-site configurations economical and increases in software sophistication are making them easy to install and manage. Mr. Melling will discuss pragmatic approaches to systems configurations which can survive destruction of a computer room or a building or an entire metropolitan area without interruption of on-line service.<br>
Mr. Melling is vice president of Digital Equipment Corporation's Open VMS Systems Business Group. With over 33 years in the industry, he has special consulting expertise in the areas of open systems, mission-critical transaction processing, and the development of enterprise information architectures. <br>

Ralph Borzyczkowski, CDRP<br>
Borzy Consulting Inc.<Br>
  <br>
The initial definition and development of disaster recovery teams sets the stage for a successful implementation of your disaster recovery plan. By identifying the proper roles, staffing and mobilization of recovery teams, you can help to insure that your disaster recovery plan has complete team coordination.

William Worsley, Jr., CDRP SS-2    <br>
The Dow Chemical Company<br>
Greg Therkalsen<br>
Comdisco Professional Serv.<br>
<br>
One of the obstacles in creating a continuity plan is the need for a diverse amount of specialized skills.  To develop a successful plan and execute it properly, one must have the ability to organize a WAN, LAN, data recovery, work area recovery, and hardware specifications.

TS-2     Target Audience: Intermediate/Advanced	</STRONG>	<br>		
Tom Speake<br>
Digital Equipment Corp.<br>
<br>
A corporation's data is one of its most valuable assets. If a disaster strikes, you can purchase replacement computers, disks and other computer related equipment, but you can't purchase replacement data. Choosing the correct level of replication is a business decision. However, it is a business decision that is based on understanding today's technology. In this session we will compare and contrast the different methods available for replicating data with respect to such things as safety, cost, system overhead and management overhead.<br>
Mr. Speake is a technical marketing consultant with Digital Equipment Corporation's OpenVMS Marketing organization. Mr. Speake's primary responsibility is the 24x365 computing program.<br>

<br>
The vital records of a company are not just a collection of papers. Today they include a complex mix of paper, microfilm, microfiche, computers, and different sizes of magnetic tape drives. If a disaster strikes, restoration becomes an important part of business survival. This means that the corporation must be able to respond with the appropriate actions for all of the above media and equipment.<br>
As Chief Scientist for BMS Catastrophe Special Technologies Division, Mr. McDaniel is responsible for post loss analysis, recommendations for recovery procedures, protocols and remediation.<br>

WS-1     Target Audience: Novice/Intermediate/Advanced</strong>	<br>		
Steven Goldman<br>
Tech*Plan Associates<br>
<br>

Successful crisis management and disaster recovery takes more than a plan: it requires realistic testing and validation. How do you do that properly? Are your exercises smoke and mirrors or do they provide as-close-to-real situations as possible? During this workshop, the attendee will learn how to set up and conduct a successful contingency plan exercise. Attendees will master the aspects of effective exercise preparation and execution, including the scenario team, objectives, extent of play, scheduling, coordination, resources, and props, as well as creativity and leadership. Also, exercise evaluation and critiquing methods will be discussed. The focus of this workshop is non-IS: exercise realism will be stressed and videos of exercises will be presented.<br>
Mr. Goldman has developed, conducted and evaluated scores of drills and exercises ranging from two-hour table-tops to massive three-day exercises involving hundreds of responders. He has been involved in all aspects of crisis management since 1978. Mr. Goldman has published many articles on crisis management and has lectured at several crisis management seminars, both domestic and international. He is President of TECH*PLAN Associates, a leading Crisis Management and Crisis Communications consulting firm providing quality services to corporations, industry and all levels of government.<br>

<h4>Organizations considering our service are seeking a qualified, highly experienced company to provide a solution to 
their disaster recovery requirements. We believe this should include a program consisting of facilities designed 
and used exclusively for recovery, skilled contingency planning resources, trained technical and operational 
support, supported by a comprehensive plan for testing/rehearsals that confirms the ability to satisfactorily 
recover from any disaster. When implemented, this comprehensive program will assure a successful recovery 
during any unanticipated interruption.</h4>
<h4>Weyerhaeuser Recovery Services proposes its program based on a unique recovery philosophy. This philosophy 
encompasses four major thrusts:</h4>
<ul>
<li>To quickly reach a point that, together, we will have developed, documented and proven our ability to recover the 
critical business functions in addition to data center support.</li>
<li>A dual focus that deals with the personal impact of any unanticipated interruption on the staff, along with the critical 
technology so, that we get <i>people </i>back to work as well as the computer systems.</li>
<li>Fully functional <i>remote </i>as well as <i>on-site </i>rehearsals, so that all recovery options (which will have been fully rehearsed 
and well documented) can be considered. The appropriate one can be chosen to reflect the nature of the event.</li>
<li>A well documented contingency plan, supported by a full range of rehearsal techniques; designed to simulate a broad 
spectrum of events so that each and every impacted employee understands the importance of their role in a successful 
recovery.</li>
</ul>
<h4>In conclusion, it is our commitment to plan, rehearse, and document in a manner that will assure successful 
recovery regardless of the length or type of outage suffered.</h4>

<h4>Our systems are housed in our comprehensive hot-site facilities which are dedicated to disaster recovery. These 
sites are located in Federal Way, Washington (near Seattle) and Valley Forge, Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia). 
Beyond meeting our subscribers technology requirements, we call your attention to several key business elements 
of our plan/philosophy.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Uniquely, we limit the number of participants we allow into our program, thereby assuring access to the hotsite for either 
recovery or rehearsals. This industry low contract to capability ratio policy assures our subscribers that the equipment is 
available for testing and that our subscriber's plan and personnel are well known to us. In the event of a disaster (or 
rehearsals), this close relationship means that we will be well into the recovery process before our subscriber's 
personnel even arrive.</li>
<li>Our rehearsal methods focus on business resumption and include on-site technical rehearsals, remote rehearsals and 
employee awareness reviews. We anticipate the entire spectrum of possible occurrences; from relatively short-term 
outages to major catastrophes. There is no additional cost for any of the several strategic and/or tactical rehearsals that 
we support. We encourage them, and look forward to participating in them.</li>
<li>A significant resource included in every agreement is our staff of highly skilled and experienced contingency planners. A 
recovery plan needs to be dynamic. Our planners are prepared to assist our subscribers with plan development and 
reviews reflecting each subscriber's changing environment.</li>
<li>Our planning and rehearsal techniques are designed to anticipate and support a wide variety of unscheduled 
interruptions; from those of a catastrophic nature, which would require relocation to the hot-site for a protracted period, 
to those more frequently experienced occurrences which tend to be localized to a given area, such as the data center. 
Where it is possible to recover without relocation to a hot-site, our program anticipates establishing a remote site at or 
near our subscriber's current facility.</li>
<li>Should our subscribers either need or desire to relocate to the hot-site, our service is all-inclusive. People can arrive 
without any payment capacity, our program takes their well-being into account as a fundamental part of successful 
recovery. They can eat in our dining facilities, exercise in our health clubs, all without having to concern themselves with 
payment. They are then prepared and ready to focus on getting the business back in business. They are supported by 
auxilliary services, such as our bulk mail facility, secretarial and dictation facilities, conference and meeting rooms, and 
copy and fax machines. In short, beyond getting our subscriber's systems operational, we help them get their business 
back in business!</li>
</ul>

<h4 align=center>TURNING YOUR DISASTER RECOVERY EXPENSE</h4>
<h4 align=center>INTO A CORPORATE ASSET</h4>
<p>It has often been said that we are entering an age that will have perhaps the most profound and rapid change ever in history. A 
time so unique in the breadth and depth of the changes that will occur that there are no historical models from which we can 
learn. This change has been hinted at by those who see yet in this century the possibilities of 500 channels available on our TV 
sets; TV/PCs that allow us to interactively work, play, selectively view, pay, order, etc. all from our favorite family room chair; 
cars getting 80 miles per gallon and weighing less than 1,500 pounds, while safer than today's cars; software so powerful it 
virtually imitates reality hence the name. Business will face reinvention no less pervasive and daunting.</p>
<p>Some organizations may speculate that their business won't be radically impacted, but the reality of the market dictates 
differently. We are entering an age where all organizations will be quality driven and extraordinarily cost effective. Those able 
to respond quickly and provide customized products/solutions uniquely able to meet their customer's requirements will have 
the edge over their competitors and improve their odds of winning the competition for business.</p>
<p>It has also been said that we are entering the time age, where perhaps the most precious of all commodities will be time. The 
marketplace is already responding to this by demanding hassle-free buying. The company that can provide the most 
hassle-free purchasing environment, eliminating those hurdles and organizational constraints that make it less than easy to do 
business with them will win orders, especially since high quality and low cost are the basic minimums for entry onto the playing 
field.</p>
<p>We have all seen, perhaps even participated in, the current movement to reduce middle management staff which has typically 
been driven by the desire to reduce costs. This theory of swift, hurdle-free and hassle-free response will drive corporations to 
even flatter, more empowered organizations able to respond quickly to each customer's requirements and making each 
department's ability to respond swiftly to these customer requirements a corporate mandate. Meeting these demands will 
impact our organizations, both technologically and organizationally.</p>
<p>*	Technological Impact. Hardware is becoming a commodity (or has become one!) as a result of the way vendors price it, and 
the way the market views it and buys it. At the same time, companies are realizing that they rarely, if ever, develop &quot;insanely 
great&quot; software internally. In fact, software developed internally is almost always built to a time schedule, not to a quality, 
service-level agreement based design standard. This &quot;get it done on time&quot; mentality virtually dooms the software design/build 
teams from their very first day. These two phenomena: a market based on hardware manufacturers' need to find a marketing 
strategy that allows them to add value (e.g., increase profit margins) and to differentiate themselves (e.g., increase market 
share); combined with companies realizing that they can't effectively build systems internally will change the way we buy and 
sell hardware and software. It will likely result in even more sophisticated and specialized solution selling.</p>
<p>Companies may very well have to continue to invest in their mainframe as the large centralized database is the only effective 
way to implement just-in-time inventory control, quickly assess market movements, analyze customer trends and have access 
to all of the other cross-functional data necessary to support decision processes based on sound empirical data and meeting 
corporate objectives.</p>
<p>The mainframe is also necessary to support an ever-growing, distributed processing capability supporting sophisticated LANs, 
WANs and advanced telecommunications as they become the organization's method to ensure that while employees are given 
evermore decision-making capability and authority, with ever-less management review and oversight, the decisions they make 
will not violate company policy since these decisions will be parametered and controlled by the system. This empowerment, 
with its swift and irreversible decisions can be controlled, measured and modified only by implementing rigorously deployed, 
distributed processing. It is the system that will assure that any decision any employee makes will not violate policy or result in 
a commitment that cannot be met. This system control will replace today's outmoded employee training and policy manual 
approach, allowing a freedom of response within acceptable system controlled parameters.</p>
<p>Implementing these dramatic shifts in culture and technology will require new processes, effective cross-functional 
communication, removal of much hierarchical management structure, along with elimination of those areas that tend to impede 
focus and rapid response such as extraneous reports and/or reporting.</p>
<p>It has been said that the president of Burger King, when asked what the most important lessons of Hurricane Andrew were, 
commented that among them was that the organization found out that they were doing many things that didn't need to be done, 
which weren't critical to their business success and which would never be implemented again. Most of us know of 
organizational requirements that don't seem to add value or even reflect the stated goals and objectives of the company.</p>
<p>*	Organizational Impact. Companies will increasingly move toward a culture embodying a style that allows them to be more 
flexible, more adaptive, swifter and more cost effective. To accomplish this, they will need to have organizations with each 
manager's span of control dramatically enlarged and with each employee necessarily empowered with a range of authorities 
never before anticipated, let alone granted.</p>

<h4 align=center>DISASTER RECOVERY</h4>
<h4 align=center>A Key Component in Any</h4>
<h4 align=center>Quality Program</h4>
<p>Senior management frequently categorizes disaster recovery programs as additional insurance coverage. To be sure, the 
protections anticipated by most insurance policies are inherent in any executable disaster recovery plan and yet MIS 
organizations that have fostered the concepts of disaster recovery within their companies have soon come to subscribe to the 
philosophy that disaster recovery is much more than insurance coverage. This is especially true when the project expands 
beyond data center recovery and begins to address the issues associated with business resumption or enterprise recovery.</p>
<p>The much narrower insurance categorization stems primarily from two root causes. The first is embodied in the very reason 
that the disaster recovery project was launched, while the second lies within the organization&#146;s implementation philosophy. 
Examining the first, we often find two primary organizational drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A concern for the legal implications of not having disaster recovery plans in place, or </li>
<li>An outside influence such as the external auditors who insist on implementing disaster recovery plans. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these are among the poorest arguments for implementing disaster recovery. They are only moderately buttressed by 
MIS&#146; often less than convincing arguments that the organization lacks the ability to function even minimally without computer 
support, which can be assured only by implementing an effective disaster recovery program.</p>
<p>I often see executive management as somewhat reluctant, clearly less than enthusiastic supporters of disaster recovery 
programs. Many seem resigned to the concept rather than enthusiastic supporters of it. Nothing hampers the success of a 
disaster recovery program more than resigned, unenthusiastic management support. Management, however, is not the villain! 
The real villain lies within the inaccurate perception that disaster recovery, although probably worth having, is just one more 
insurance policy. </p>
<hr width=200>
<h4 align=center>The real villain lies within the inaccurate perception that disaster recovery, although probably worth having, is just 
one more insurance policy.</h4>
<hr width=200>
<p>Disaster recovery is something much different from insurance. While a thorough disaster recovery program does offer 
protection for the company&#146;s &quot;information assets,&quot; unlike insurance, it is not something that can effectively be accomplished on 
a task basis. In other words, when fire, theft or any other insurance is procured, once the policy is placed the task is essentially 
completed, never to be revisited or worried about except at the annual premium payment time or upon having to file a claim 
after a covered event has occurred. This is not disaster recovery! To be successful, any disaster recovery program must be 
viewed as a refinement to the normal operating procedures; as an element of standard performance objectives; and as a 
fundamental part of the company&#146;s operating culture. Properly presented, it is one of the cornerstones in any <b>quality 
program</b>, a key and critical contribution the MIS function can and should contribute to the quality orientation of the company. 
It rightfully belongs within organization&#146;s &quot;concern for quality&quot; program, not under the insurance umbrella.</p>
<h4 align=center>THE QUALITY APPROACH</h4>
<p>There are many ways for an organization to effectively implement a quality approach to doing business. Nonetheless, inherent 
in all approaches are three fundamental criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>They all require a focus on the customer </li>
<li>They require a process orientation </li>
<li>They assume data driven decisions </li>
</ul>
<p>MIS has become irreplaceable in the quest for quality, especially in these three areas. To truly focus on the customer, 
companies need to have a wide variety of contacts with their customer base, an effective method of understanding each 
customer&#146;s history to give the data perspective, and a method for evaluating the data to give it relevance. These are, for the 
most part, gathered, compiled, analyzed and retained via computer applications. Key buying trends, credit limits, inventory 
availability, delivery tracking are all further examples of on-line systems that are customer focused and without which most 
companies cannot operate.</p>
<p>Equally as critical to the successful quality program is a process orientation. The processes critical to successful transactions 
largely lie within and are controlled by computer systems.</p>
<p>Finally, if decisions are to be made that are data driven, the facts and data must be available and, in today&#146;s fast paced 
environment, they must be available quickly and accurately. We have all come to rely exclusively on our computer support for 
critical data on a timely basis.</p>
<p>The nature and importance of MIS&#146; role in the company&#146;s success or failure is fully emphasized by recognition that data 
processing has subtly evolved from once being a performance enhancing tool through the key element stage and now resides 
clearly within the critical functions area. Without it, most organizations very quickly lose their ability to even be in business. It is 
no longer just nice to have, nor merely an important support tool. MIS has become the nerve center of the company. This 
evolution has occurred incrementally, for the most part, and the frequent result is that senior management is far more 
dependent on data processing than they may realize or may even be willing to accept.</p>
<p>Combined with this subtle evolution is the problem of the &quot;magic&quot; in data processing. It is understood by so few that often 
senior management would rather not deal with it directly, but find a home for it organizationally that allows them to continue to 
view it as a support organization somewhat akin to the personnel department. To them, automation is important, to be sure, 
but not a mainstream function more of a necessary evil.</p>

<h4 align=center>FACING REALITY</h4>
<h4 align=center>Successful Disaster Recovery is All About</h4>
<h4 align=center>Managing</h4>
<h4 align=center>Unexpected Situations</h4>
<p>Organizations committed to successful disaster recovery really know for the first time that their program will work when they 
actually face a crisis it&#146;s really the first and only time to see if they&#146;re truly ready! Their goal is, in almost every case, to reclaim 
the pre-event condition called &#147;normal.&#148;</p>
<p>Some organizations (thankfully fewer and fewer) have little but luck on their side, as they have yet to embrace the power of a 
sound disaster recovery program. These organizations, it has been shown over and over, face the stark reality that they will 
never recover. In these uncertain times, they have chosen the path that is perhaps the most certain of all their demise!</p>
<p>Industry statistics are now over a decade in scope and those who continue to believe that nothing will happen, or if something 
does, someone else (like their vendors!) will race to their rescue and save the day couldn&#146;t be more in error. Theirs is a lost 
cause.</p>
<p>For those committed to disaster recovery, it&#146;s also a time for a wake-up call. In spite of the statistics, which show:</p>
<h4>Disaster Recovery Declarations by Category</h4>
<p>Many still base disaster recovery on a number of misconceptions. Among them, we still have rehearsals designed with the goal 
of returning to a state of &#147;normalcy.&#148; It has been said, and rightly so, that no organization suffering a disaster will ever return to 
the pre-event state of bliss we call &#148;normal.&#148; In fact, normal becomes redefined. While we can reestablish the physical plant 
approaching a reasonable approximation of the pre-event condition, the people impacted will have a new normalcy, one which 
incorporates their emotions as a result of the event. To a large extent, they will be different people behaving differently with a 
new and different set of personal priorities, expectations and goals. Adjusting to meet this new reality is key to the phase that 
comes immediately after survival full recovery.</p>
<p>Many organizations view their disaster recovery effort as data center oriented, and to be sure, we are all evermore reliant on 
our IT capability. And yet the single points of failure that are human-response based are exponentially greater than those that 
are technology based. The fact is that if we have the necessary infrastructure available and a well rehearsed, well documented 
plan, recovering the technology will be the easiest part of the equation. The one that is most certain to be achieved 
successfully. The risks are in being able to predict our employees behavior successfully. Do they know what is expected of 
them and can/will they perform? As we said earlier, the proof unfortunately lies in experiencing the crisis. But regular, thorough, 
ambitious rehearsal exercises can and will prove to be invaluable in mitigating the impact of unpredictable behavior.</p>
<p>The experiences show that well documented, well rehearsed, organizationally inclusive plans allow businesses to focus on the 
surprises and there will be many! Those without a well rehearsed, well documented plan are often overwhelmed by the 
enormity of the surprises generated by the survival/recovery mission, and they simply fail.</p>
<p>Many organizations view the disaster recovery commitment as a key insurance policy. This emphasis reduces the value of 
disaster recovery. Disaster recovery is not simply a key insurance policy, it represents, in the truest sense, an organization&#146;s 
assurance that it has the ability to continue to meet its commitments no matter what!</p>
<p>Another common misperception is that disaster recovery is about being able to manage the impact of typhoons and tornadoes. 
More precisely, it is and should be about the ability to meet our organization&#146;s commitments it&#146;s really about reliability, 
consistency and dependability. Disaster recovery can be a differentiating factor in a highly competitive world. It is a part of any 
quality conscious organization&#146;s commitment to their stakeholders their investors, employees, customers and suppliers.</p>
<p>Disaster recovery is not as much about catastrophe as it is about being able to successfully manage unexpected situations 
across a wide spectrum of potential events, any of which may cause an organization to miss one or more of its commitments 
and lost market share is as tough to reclaim and is lost credibility. A well documented, well rehearsed company-wide plan is 
fundamental to achieving success. History has shown that every recovery is much different than the plan anticipated and this is 
how it should be. Successful plans allow organizations to focus on the unexpected, to implement modifications necessary to 
reclaim control. The primary emphasis of any potentially successful plan is that it provides a sufficiently clear roadmap so that 
everyone on the team knows when they are deviating, if and when they do. It allows for and expects flexibility, responsiveness 
and innovation. In its most fundamental form, it is a powerful document empowering employees to make the decisions 
necessary for their organization&#146;s survival and position them for eventual recovery.</p>

<h4 align=center>TURNING YOUR DISASTER RECOVERY EXPENSE</h4>
<h4 align=center>INTO A CORPORATE ASSET (continued)</h4>
<p>The question we're raising in this article is, given all this, can we use our disaster recovery program commitment to understand, 
cope with and help resolve some of the issues that will result from this necessary transformation? As often as not, an 
organization's commitment to preparing for recovery from an unanticipated interruption a disaster is a potentially powerful, yet 
severely underutilized corporate resource. This occurs for a number of reasons. Among them:</p>
<p>*	Positioning by the Sponsor. The primary sponsor who is traditionally and typically either associated with or is the head of 
Information Technology (IT) rarely positions the disaster recovery activity as anything more than a necessary insurance policy. 
To be sure, a well designed, often rehearsed, thoroughly documented recovery capability does have the attributes of an 
insurance policy inherent in it, but it is so much more than just another insurance policy. The improved skills, enhanced 
procedures, modified policies and thorough documentation that are the byproducts of a quality disaster recovery program have 
been shown to be worth the price of participation in and of themselves. If an organization chose to measure just those outputs, 
the improved disciplines gained from a sound disaster recovery program would generate an enviable ROI to be sure.</p>
<p>*	Neutral Management. Senior management is often viewed as being neutral at best toward making the required investment 
both in terms of time and money to have a well developed, proven disaster recovery program, yielding more to the argument 
of &quot;prudent management&quot; than to the threat of hurricane, tornado and earthquake scenarios that don't happen often enough for 
them to have any real personal or emotional ownership in the threat.</p>
<p>*	The Rehearsal Process. Industry statistics indicate that a significant percentage of the organizations that have a hot-site based 
disaster recovery program don't rehearse at all, let alone regularly or with enthusiasm; neither do those that have reciprocal 
agreements, cold-site agreements or, of course, no plan whatsoever. A great many of those few that do test, test the same 
technical ability time after time so that the rehearsal process becomes relegated to data center employees who repeat a 
successful test based on the same unchallenging, repetitive objectives employed time after time all supported by a disaster 
recovery vendor who is more than happy to allow no tests or simple repetitive tests that assure success. </p>
<p>Given these circumstances, it's a small wonder that management often loses some enthusiasm for disaster recovery or ignores it 
all together, letting it be an &quot;Information Technology&quot; thing.</p>
<p>*	Using the Resource. Properly positioned, given a little life, some imagination and positive exposure, any firm's disaster 
recovery commitment can and should be the perfect laboratory for experimenting with new processes, methodologies and 
even organizational structures. Well designed rehearsals can be the perfect microcosm of the organization and one of the 
easiest for the Information Technology organization to employ to offer value-added capability to the corporation, greatly 
enhancing the role of IT and exposing the broader management skills IT leadership often has, but which are also often 
under-exposed and under-appreciated.</p>
<p>One example might be the future direction of technology implementation in the firm. Most companies today are facing 
extraordinary decisions, monumental changes in technology, having unparalleled impact on their organization. It's not merely a 
matter of analog versus digital as 1996 rapidly approaches, but fundamental changes such as centralized versus decentralized; 
or to continue to own or outsource the entire data center, viewing it as another utility, important, but not necessarily 
proprietary; the impact of &quot;open&quot; systems which is all too often misunderstood and which is still really only a distant vision 
everywhere but in the sales brochures; and the architectural debates spawned from choosing from among these options. 
Changes so significant, they will result in fundamental, structural and behavioral modification. The operating principles and 
culture of many organizations will be challenged and modified, leaving those that don't and/or won't adapt in the ash pile of 
forgotten failures.</p>
<p>*	Implementing the Resource. Can this resource be effectively implemented to help answer these challenges? The answer is a 
resounding yes! Examples abound. First, and easiest, is to creatively expand the disaster recovery rehearsals beyond the 
simple realm of technical exercises to a level that increases disaster recovery awareness, assures that the plan will work and 
also ensures ownership in the disaster recovery plan by all potentially impacted employees. This can be accomplished by 
including fire drills, emergency response drills, even informative seminars on the personal impact of disasters on employees and 
their families. Employees will be far more able and prepared to resume work if their families are safe! Far too many 
companies, as we said earlier, rely on the technical recovery to satisfy their disaster recovery proof statement. Technology 
recovery is really the easiest part of any disaster scenario. The single points of failure that are human response based are 
overwhelming in their magnitude and can be addressed and resolved only through documented rehearsals. Beyond assuring 
that the plan will work through this broadening of the scope of rehearsals, there are any number of opportunities to turn the 
disaster recovery program into a value-added, critical test bed. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying, modeling and measuring the impact of events on the organization. For example, what happens to the 
organization if their sales department achieves 150 percent over quota? Too much good news can be disastrous as well! </li>
<li>How does cross-functional communication work in the company and how can it be enhanced? </li>
<li>What organizational hurdles exist that impede converting opportunities into business? </li>
<li>What is the real decision-making process in the organization? </li>
<li>Does the culture support or inhibit the authority implied in the empowerment process? </li>
<li>Are the reports that are required/generated necessary? </li>
<li>Can your company count on its critical vendors? Include them in the process to find out the points of failure from them 
that are rarely considered, but dramatic in their ability to negatively impact your business. </li>
<li>Can your organization meet its commitment to its customers? Can orders be accepted, processed and shipped no 
matter what? If the answer is unacceptable, what can be done to change the process? Once the process is proven 
reliable, provide the data to your sales staff and encourage them to share the result with key customers, as they will then 
be able to prove your reliability as a key supplier, thereby further differentiating your company and making you more 
competitive in the marketplace. </li>
<li>Does your company have and can it demonstrate an ability to provide compassionate support for disaster impacted 
employees? Employees will return to work in an enthusiastic, committed way only when their personal life is reasonably 
secure! </li>
</ul>
<p>These are merely a sampling of the issues that can be included. Issues that impact the company's fundamental ability to 
compete successfully. Most, if not all, are currently at the forefront of senior management's attention, all are a catalyst for 
major institutional change, have huge associated risks and potentially great rewards. All are in search of a laboratory to help 
guide the decision-making process and assure successful implementation as companies proceed to reinvent themselves. And a 
laboratory available to meet the need is a strong disaster recovery program including the full range of rehearsals supported by 
a qualified, enthusiastic and willing disaster recovery vendor.</p>
<p>A key method to both assure your organization's capabilities, irrespective of the events that befall it, along with exposing the 
entire IT organization to the vast skill-set attendant in the IT function is to expand the vision of disaster recovery allow and 
encourage it to be the laboratory of choice for learning, changing, measuring and testing new ideas, concepts, methods, 
procedures and policies. Do so and you will not only have positioned your company to continue business as close to normal as 
possible during a disaster, but you will have provided your company with a resource, the value of which far exceeds the cost 
of participation. And then count on the disaster recovery program, gaining senior management's emotional involvement, and 
gaining their regular and enthusiastic support deservedly so!</p>

</p>
<h4 align=center>DISASTER RECOVERY</h4>
<h4 align=center>A Key Component in Any</h4>
<h4 align=center>Quality Program (continued)</h4>
<p>MIS management must rethink their disaster recovery reasoning and position disaster recovery rightfully within the Total 
Quality program and no where else! Next is to clearly separate it from this &quot;insurance&quot; concept. It is not simply insurance. A 
well planned disaster recovery program can be tested and proven. It is not designed to merely recover losses as is insurance. 
It <i>is</i> designed to <b>avoid losses</b> by maintaining the required levels of data processing support regardless of unanticipated events. 
And beyond this, finely integrated into the normal operating culture of the organization, it results in improved performance, 
enhanced employee skills, better procedures, more reliable methods and improved operating policies. In fact, even though a 
well designed disaster recovery program takes only a very small percentage of the data processing operating budget to sustain, 
companies routinely find that the total cost can be recovered from just the savings resulting from improved performance.</p>
<p>Once disaster recovery is rightfully explained and understood to be a key part of the quality approach to business; that it is in 
fact a behavior modification, a cultural change rather than a task; that it is MIS&#146; contribution to assuring continuous, predictable 
performance; it should receive more than tacit approval. It should and will get management&#146;s enthusiastic support. With that 
support in hand, MIS can proceed to develop and implement a program that reflects the needs and nature of their organization 
and one that will assure successful recovery.</p>
<h4 align=center>THE OPTIONS</h4>
<p>Implementing an effective disaster recovery program is not a lengthy nor a particularly complicated process or at least it 
shouldn&#146;t be. Assuming the organization decides to utilize external support, which brings with it both experience and the 
capability of focusing entirely on program implementation, it can be both a relatively painless process and one that results in 
measurable performance improvements. The options are not complicated and they are fairly easy to evaluate on a cost vs. 
benefit basis.</p>
<p>Clearly, the best solution is to establish a fully redundant capability. A fully configured and staffed redundant site is, however, 
most often beyond the bounds of economic reality for most organizations.</p>
<p>So what are the remaining options? One option is to do nothing, which is at least a decision and may, in fact, be a decision that 
the organization is comfortable with. Companies that are not driven to improve the quality of their entire organization can in fact 
be comfortable with the notion of being unable to support their customer&#146;s requirements over some period of time. This, 
however, is an unfathomable position for the vast majority of companies. The next option is to implement a cold site. This is 
often the most frugal step. Yet, because it has low financial impact, it also results in a prolonged recovery; it is rarely testable 
and only a very small percentage of the day-to-day disaster recovery gains, performance, experience, policy and procedural 
gains we discussed earlier can be realized. And if realized, they tend to be realized to such a small degree that they can rarely 
be effectively measured.</p>
<p>The most cost-effective approach, when measured against quantifiable and qualifiable goals, is the hot site. It is a proactive 
concept. It is testable. And it results in demonstrable organizational improvement. It is without question the most cost effective 
and offers the most assured recovery capability over and above all of the other tangible benefits.</p>
<h4 align=center>IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
<p>How then to chose a disaster recovery vendor/partner? There are several categories of measurement and evaluation that are 
critical to making the right choice. First is a close look at the potential vendor, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program philosophy </li>
<li>Financial depth </li>
<li>Experience in the disaster recovery industry </li>
</ul>
<p>From these you can determine if they have demonstrated the will and capacity to meet their promises and your expectations. It 
is important to confirm that their approach and philosophy matches your requirements.</p>
<p>Next consider the facility(s) offered, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical location </li>
<li>Design, including ownership of the property, buildings and who actually employs the staff </li>
<li>Operational and technical support available </li>
<li>Determine the odds that you will/can work with the same people in a familiar site during rehearsals and actual recovery </li>
<li>Consider the power available including generators and fuel storage </li>
<li>Utility support including the number of telephone central offices and the number of electric company grids that support 
the facility </li>
<li>The security, both protecting your data and your employees </li>
</ul>
<p>What is not as important is the number of sites and/or systems they offer. What is important is the design of the facility and the 
capability of their people. Paramount is the ratio of customers to systems/sites, for this is a key predictor of your odds of both 
testing at a frequency that meets your requirements and of recovering successfully from any unanticipated interruption.</p>
<p>Review carefully their approach to testing/rehearsals:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types of rehearsals do they employ </li>
<li>How difficult is it to secure test time </li>
<li>How flexible are they in supporting your requirements during tests, the length of the test day, and the technical and 
operational support available </li>
</ul>
<p>From these, you can determine their commitment to the rehearsal process, their flexibility, and the resulting probability of 
successful recovery.</p>
<p>Confirm that their program and the associated costs match your needs. Check their history for their ability to meet their 
promised support, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical and operational people </li>
<li>Their ability to support both rehearsals and actual recovery </li>
<li>Their capability to help be optimally productive during both tests and actual recovery </li>
</ul>
<p>From their historical measurements, as well as an occasional reference, you can match promises to reality. Rely more on 
historical, statistical data than on references. Everyone has a few good references. The ability to prove the value of their 
program over time and over a broad variety of customers is critical and a review of their statistical data gathered from their 
customers over time will provide this for you.</p>
<p>Determine how many of their customers are in your immediate area and consider the impact of this customer concentration on 
your potential recovery. During a disaster these concentrations have the effect of creating a competition among customers for 
their disaster recovery vendors operational and technical support resources. Unlike user groups, this is one occasion when less 
is more due to the impact of increasingly frequent regional disasters such as riots, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and the 
like. Viruses are rapidly moving up the list of disaster risks and with the broad movement to more distributed processing; the 
movement toward more on-line support; more EDI between vendors and customers; and the movement towards open 
systems, this virus risk will continue to grow dramatically as well.</p>
<p>Consider their ability to help you prepare for enterprise recovery. Can they/will they assist in preparing your recovery plan, 
maintain the plan and rehearse all the critical aspects of the plan.</p>
<p>Finally, and it should be the final step, carefully look at the associated costs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The monthly participation fee </li>
<li>The length of the contractual commitment </li>
<li>Any associated cancellation fees </li>
<li>Testing/rehearsal fees </li>
<li>Declaration fees </li>
<li>Daily usage fees </li>
<li>Contingency planning fees </li>
<li>Technical and operational support fees </li>
<li>Periodic cost increases </li>
<li>Travel and lodging costs for you and your people </li>
</ul>
<p>These costs will not only give you the true measurement of the economic impact, but will serve as an additional barometer of 
the capability and desire behind their promises. Selection need not be a lengthy process and implementation need not be a 
battle of the wills yours vs. management&#146;s. Disaster recovery, when rightfully viewed as a basic part of the organization&#146;s ability 
to continue to meet their customers needs on a timely basis regardless of unanticipated events, is an easy, cost-effective, 
performance enhancing, quality-oriented decision!</p>

<h4 align=center>FACING REALITY</h4>
<h4 align=center>Successful Disaster Recovery is All About</h4>
<h4 align=center>Managing</h4>
<h4 align=center>Unexpected Situations (continued)</h4>
<p>Disaster recovery should not be confused with security. Attention to security may help avoid some unexpected events, but 
security is a small, albeit, important part of survival it does not assure survival.</p>
<p>One of the most critical aspects of survival/recovery today is to recognize when one is actually experiencing a disaster. Again, 
too many define disasters emotionally If I drive up to my building and it is a smoldering heap, I will immediately know we&#146;ve 
had a disaster. True enough, but far too limited in scope. In today&#146;s fast-paced environment, a LAN failure can be as 
catastrophic as a tornado. A critical part of successful recovery is that the organization&#146;s plan defines a disaster Disasters for 
our company are when we cannot meet the service level agreements we&#146;ve committed to for X period of time. No matter what 
the field engineer says, no matter how soon the promise of normal functionality, if you are not active within the policies 
timetable, an unanticipated event declaration should be issued and recovery according to the plan begun.</p>
<p>Too many organizations relegate their disaster recovery capability to supporting only horrific natural disasters when, in fact, it 
can, should be and is for many companies a proven resource just waiting to be tested under the glare of reality. There is little 
reason to invent new processes and procedures under the immediate threat of nonperformance when a tested capability the 
disaster recovery plan is readily at hand.</p>
<p>Viewed accordingly, disaster recovery is not an expense associated with an unlikely catastrophe. It is a prudent investment, 
offsetting the impact of the inevitable, and a significant resource.</p>

This is the experimental home page of <i>The Economist</i>. It is the on-line home for a limited selection of articles from the current issue; The Economist Review, a monthly books and multimedia supplement to <i>The Economist</i>; and several of our surveys. We plan to add more to the site as well as offer more information and products from The Economist Group. <p>


Our business editor, John Micklethwait, and our management editor, Adrian Wooldridge, have just published a critical guide to the management gurus and their effect on government, business and society around the world, <a href="http://airwolf.ivision.co.uk">The Witch Doctors</a>.

<h1 align=center>How safe is your airline?</h1>


<CleverDrop>WITH the possible exception of the nuclear bomb, no modern invention has inspired such a perverse mixture of gratitude and terror as the jet airliner. From one perspective, the modern passenger aircraft has made the world smaller: Sydney is now only a day's journey from London, Los Angeles an afternoon away from New York. And it has made long-distance travel far more secure, in terms of accidents for distance covered, than any other form of transport--15 times safer than cars in Britain. Yet there are few passengers who do not silently make a prayer every time that they enter an aeroplane, or do not glance up nervously at least once from behind their newspaper during the safety demonstration.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Airlines, aircraft manufacturers and air-safety authorities all like to blame this "irrational" fear on misinformation. Because air crashes are both big and infrequent, they always make the news headlines, whilst the steady, far greater carnage on the world's roads and railways is largely unreported. Besides, add the airlines, customers know that they are being irrational: if they were really frightened of crashes, they would give up flying. Instead, the number of passengers taking to the skies is growing rapidly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet rationality is not always on the airlines' side. If you measure the riskiness by comparing deaths with the number of trips made rather than the miles covered, aircraft score worse than cars. And, thanks to those rising passenger numbers, large air crashes could soon become weekly occurrences (see <a href="wb8532.html">page</a>). In the next decade, worries about safety could become the airline industry's biggest headache--and one of the key battlegrounds between carriers. So it should: this is a matter far better dealt with by the airlines themselves than by bureaucrats or politicians.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>You take the high road</b></b><br>
Air travel seems to have stopped becoming safer. From 1960 to the early 1980s the introduction of jet engines helped bring down the rate of fatal accidents per 1m landings from around 50 to two (excluding the Soviet Union). For the past ten years, however, the figure for scheduled flights (again excluding the former Soviet Union) has remained stuck at around 1.5 fatal accidents per 1m departures. Indeed, thanks to disasters like the ValuJet crash in Florida and the <font size=-1>TWA</font> crash off Long Island, 1996's figure will probably be considerably higher than 1995's figure of 1.3 fatal accidents per 1m departures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can this be improved upon, at an acceptable cost? Most crashes, including the many that go under the frightening acronym <font size=-1>CFIT</font> (or "controlled flight into terrain"), are the result of "pilot error". In a few cases--such as when a pilot handed over the controls to his son or when a pilot's English was too poor to communicate properly with the control tower--the error appears to be blatant. But in most cases, the term "pilot error" is more complicated: it means only that if the crew had reacted differently, then the crash would not have occurred.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, aircraft are driven by an uneven mix of computers and people. So-called "fly by wire" technology means that pilots have less to do; but the new gizmos still need some human help. There is evidence that older pilots in particular have found it difficult to adapt to the new technology: rules should be changed so that seniority counts for less than competence. Pilot training, too, needs to be tweaked. At present, training focuses on how to avoid errors in the first place: fair enough, but greater emphasis should also be placed on how to deal with errors when they are made, as they inevitably will be.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If training needs to become a little more reactive, then exactly the opposite seems to be required in terms of air-safety standards. The cause of air safety currently advances from crash to crash: each disaster ushers in a new range of checks. Rather than waiting for accidents to happen, air-safety organisations should take up the initiative themselves. One good example is promoting new global-positioning satellite technology that should give pilots much more accurate information about their exact position.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Rising on the wings of reason</b></b><br>
These changes would probably make air travel a little safer, but never perfectly safe. Indeed, in the foreseeable future, thanks to the increase in the number of flights, the number of crashes is bound to increase. This is a problem of success-- more demand, more flights--rather than failure. The solution to it must lie in information and openness. What consumers will want is not information about whether air travel is safe but about which airlines are safest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ideally, that information would be provided voluntarily by airlines; but in practice if it is to be trusted it will have to be required by and certified by regulators. This means forcing carriers not only to reveal their number of crashes but also their number of safety-fault violations, average age of planes, near misses and so on. Virtually all these statistics are already collected by air-safety authorities; they are just kept secret.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Airline league tables will be greeted with just as much horror by people in the industry as they have been by doctors. This is both naive and arrogant. The naivety comes in imagining that league tables will not evolve anyway. Consumers already have their own informal ideas of how safe airlines are (remember the character in "Rain Man" who will fly from Cincinnati to Los Angeles only via Australia because Qantas, Australia's main airline, has never had a crash).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The arrogance comes from assuming that consumers are not sensible enough to weigh statistics properly, balancing long-term safety records against particular recent crashes. Yet, from hospitals to stockmarkets, consumers have usually reacted perfectly intelligently to information. Indeed, once they were better informed, they might well feel more rational about air travel. Once again, this will not bring certainty. "How safe is your airline?" is a question that will always have an incomplete answer. But it is worth asking.<br>

<h2>Scraping in</h2>
 <p>
Despite his transgressions, <b>Newt Gingrich</b>, speaker of the House of Representatives, was re-elected by 216 votes to 205. Four Republicans voted against him, and five abstained. Mr Gingrich thus became the first Republican speaker to be re-elected in 68 years. The House must still decide later this month how to punish him for his misuse of tax-exempt funds for political purposes. <p>
The president's advisory council on <b>Social Security </b> (state pensions) reported that the system would probably go bankrupt by 2029, and recommended that a large part of the Social Security trust fund should be invested in the stockmarket rather than in government securities. <p>
The Supreme Court began to hear arguments for and against <b>euthanasia</b>. Two states are appealing against rulings by lower courts that have overturned state bans on assisted suicide.<p>
The Canadian government apologised to a former prime minister, <b>Brian Mulroney</b>, who had sued it over suggestions that he had received kickbacks from the sale of Airbus aircraft to Air Canada in 1988. <p>
<b>Nicaragua</b>'s newly elected president Arnoldo Aleman took office. The defeated Sandinists complained bitterly that the Supreme Court had annulled self-serving laws passed by their side of the outgoing legislature while the right wing boycotted it.<p>
<h2>Middle East</h2>
Tension mounted between <b>Syria, Lebanon and Israel</b>. Syria blamed Israeli agents for recent bomb attacks in Syria and Lebanon. Israeli troops and Hizbullah guerrillas clashed in south Lebanon; one Israeli soldier was killed. Katyusha rockets were fired into northern Israel. Israeli aircraft attacked guerrilla positions.<p>
Despite American mediation, and a meeting between Binyamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, a deal on Israeli redeployment in <b>Hebron</b> continued to be held up. <p>
Iraq blamed Iran for three mortar shells fired from a truck at the Baghdad headquarters of the Iranian opposition<b> mujahiddin</b>. A hospital laboratory and an Iraqi writers' building were wrecked and a dozen people injured. <p>
A <b>Rwandan</b> court swiftly sentenced two men to death for their part in the 1994 genocide. The international genocide tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, trying the bigger criminals, proceeded at a more formal pace. <p>
A member of a right-wing group called the <b>Boer Attack Troops</b> was rearrested on suspicion of planting bombs in South Africa that have killed several people.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
After the killing of two French officers who were trying to mediate between rebels and the <b>Central African Republic</b> government, French soldiers attacked a rebel-held part of the capital, Bangui, killing at least ten people.<p>
<h2>Mounting strife</h2>
 <p>
Union leaders in <b>South Korea </b>threatened to extend industrial action to the public services unless new labour laws were repealed. <p>
The People's Action Party won 81 of the 83 seats in <b>Singapore's Parliament</b>, gaining 65% of the vote, up from 61% in 1991.<p>
<b>India's Congress party</b>, defeated in last year's general election, was expected to make an early bid for power under its new leader, Sitaram Kesri.<p>
<b>Pakistan </b>created a "security council", giving the army a "non-binding" say in government affairs.<p>
<h2>Partial climbdown</h2>
Serbia's government recognised opposition parties' electoral victory in Nis, the second-biggest city. The opposition staged the <b>biggest demonstration</b> yet in Belgrade on the eve of the Orthodox Christmas. The head of the army told students that his troops would not crush the protests. A bomb was thrown at the headquarters of a party allied to the government.<p>
Russia's president, <b>Boris Yeltsin</b>, was admitted to hospital with signs of pneumonia. <p>
Russia said it has withdrawn its last 18,000 troops from <b>Chechnya</b>, paving the way for elections in the separatist region this month.<p>
The <b>Irish Republican Army</b> carried out bomb and rocket attacks in Northern Ireland, raising fears that loyalist groups will end their ceasefire in retaliation. In Spain, an army officer was killed, apparently by <font size=-1>ETA</font>, a <b>Basque separatist</b> group. A French paramilitary policeman was shot, apparently by a separatist, in <b>Corsica</b>.<p>
Bulgaria's ruling Socialist Party nominated <b>Nikolai Dobrev</b>, the tough-on-crime interior minister, as the new prime minister.<p>
The <b>Greek-Cypriot government </b>ordered a ground-to-air missile system from Russia, raising tensions with the Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.<p>
The Swiss government said it might set up a fund to compensate <b>Holocaust victims</b> who may have lost money in Swiss banks. The outgoing president had earlier described demands for such a fund as "blackmail", prompting Jewish groups to threaten a boycott of Swiss banks.<p>
Europe's <b>unusually cold weather </b>has killed over 200 people and may depress economic growth.<p>
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in <b>Germany </b>rose to 10.9% of the workforce in December, a post-war record.<p>

<h2>Defence tactics</h2>
 <p>
Another huge round of consolidation is under way in <b>America's defence industry</b>. Raytheon made an agreed $2.95 billion offer for the missile and defence-electronics operations of Texas Instruments, beating a rival offer from Northrop Grumman. Bidding also closed for the defence unit of Hughes Electronics (whose parent is General Motors), which could be worth up to $9 billion. Again, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are thought to be the main contenders.<p>
With the impending merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas concentrating their minds, the four European partners of <b>Airbus Industrie</b>, whose lumbering structure at present means each controls its own manufacturing facilities, agreed to pool most of those assets when the consortium goes corporate in 1999.<p>
After a rush of deals at the end of last month, <b>Boeing </b> announced orders in 1996 (net of cancellations) for 559 aircraft, worth $42.8 billion. <b>Airbus</b>, on a comparable basis, had 473 net orders, worth $36.4 billion<i>.</i><p>
<b>Philips Electronics</b> is withdrawing its support from Grundig, a troubled German consumer-electronics firm in which the Dutch giant has a controlling 31.6% stake. Philips, which has taken charges of $955m because of Grundig, will now become a "passive minority shareholder".<p>
A venture by India's Tata group and Singapore Airlines to set up <b>a domestic airline in India </b>cleared one big regulatory hurdle: the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. But the civil-aviation minister was uncivil about the prospect: foreign airlines would be barred from investing-- and that includes any existing holdings, he said.<p>
Two car makers, Germany's <b>BMW</b>, in its first foray into South America, and America's <b>Chrysler</b>, formed a $500m joint venture to build 400,000 engines a year in Brazil from 1999. <font size=-1>BMW</font> will also build a factory to make 5,000 Land Rovers annually.<p>
<h2>Building a bank</h2>
<b>Woolwich Building Society</b>, Britain's third-largest, said it will have a market capitalisation of up to &#163;3.4 billion ($5.8 billion), a bit higher than expected, when it floats on the London Stock Exchange in July, and hopes to be one of Britain's top ten banks in terms of assets.<p>
Gil Amelio, head of <b>Apple</b>, said the computer maker would still make a comeback despite a warning that the first quarter would show an operating loss of $100m-150m. Apple's takeover of <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font> Software, he said, would result in a new operating system for its troubled Macintosh within 18 months. Nevertheless, Apple's share price fell by nearly 20%.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Two American investment banks hit record profits in 1996. Net income at <b>Morgan Stanley</b>, though weaker than expected, rose to $1.03 billion in the year to November, up from $720m in 1995. Strong results from <b>Lehman Brothers</b> produced income of $416m, after an after-tax charge of $50m, well up from $242m in 1995.<p>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Central banks, particularly European ones, sold off huge quantities of <b>gold</b> in the second half of last year. At $335 per ounce, the price of gold now stands at its lowest level in more than three years.<p>
<h2>Chinese puzzle</h2>
Li Ka-shing announced sweeping changes to his Hong Kong business empire. His main company, <b>Cheung Kong Holdings</b>, will raise its stake in Hutchison Whampoa, whose interests run from ports to telecoms. Hutchison Whampoa is also making a general offer for Hongkong Electric. Mr Li then intends to hive off part of the utility into Cheung Kong Infrastructure, whose interests lie on the mainland.<p>
German prosecutors charged <b>J&uuml;rgen Schneider</b>, whose property empire crashed three years ago in one of Germany's biggest corporate scandals, with credit fraud, fraudulent bankruptcy and forgery. They found no criminal evidence against the creditor banks he had tried to implicate in his downfall.<p>
Shares in Italy's <b>Olivetti</b> jumped on talk that the beleaguered information-technology group may at last shed its loss-making personal-computer operations for upward of 200 billion lire ($130m). The buyer may well be Centenary Group, a private investment company backed by a number of industrialists.<p>
An arrest warrant was issued for <b>Giancarlo Parretti</b>, who left America a few days before he was due to be sentenced for perjury and tampering with evidence in a 1991 case that cost him control of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Mr Parretti claims he has returned to Italy because of an unrelated tax investigation.<p>
France began charging 20.6% valued-added tax on <b>telephone services </b>offered from outside the European Union to customers within it, anticipating a change in <font size=-1>EU</font> legislation that will end the tax advantage gained by companies outside the <font size=-1>EU</font> that offer call-back and other services.<p>
As part of its internal investigation into racial discrimination, <b>Texaco </b>dismissed one manager, suspended another and withdrew benefits from two retirees.<p>
<h2>Nippon blues</h2>
 <p>
(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Japanese investors </b>returned from the new-year break nervous about their government's tax plans. The Nikkei average fell and fell, to a 13-month low.<p>

<h1 align=left>Arguing about the monarchy</h1>


<p><b>It makes little sense to discuss monarchs and republics in isolation from other constitutional issues</b></p><br>
BRITAIN has had what would once have been unthinkable: a full-scale debate about whether its monarchy should stay or go, conducted on prime-time television, followed by a phone-in poll, supposedly of 2.5m viewers. That, at least, is the grandiose way to describe it. In truth, it was little more than a shouting match with theatrical trappings. And the poll should not be taken seriously by anyone, either by republicans crowing that Scotland voted against the monarchy and that "record numbers" of English and Welsh did too, or by monarchists crowing that two-thirds of Britons voted to keep the crown. Such self-selecting polls have been known to be appallingly misleading ever since 1936 when an American magazine's postal ballot of 2.2m votes predicted that Alf Landon would beat Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency (Roosevelt won by a landslide).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All that said, the television debate may have had two uses, apart from mere entertainment. The first is that ventilating the arguments, albeit messily, does serve some purpose; even from the monarchy's point of view it is better to encourage people to think about the institution and its function than to leave them chatting merely about the latest piece of royal tittle-tattle in the tabloids. The second is that the debate ought to have left thoughtful republicans with the following conclusion: that if there is ever to be any change in Britain's method of choosing its head of state, the burden of proof in justifying such a change lies with them, not with the monarchists.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too many republicans think it is enough to cry "anachronism!" or "indefensible hereditary privilege!", and that the argument will then be won. That might be the case if the monarchy were being set up today from scratch. But it is not. The emotional case for keeping such a long-established institution is a strong one: it is a link to tradition and to history, and is a powerful trademark for Britain. Some love it deeply, whatever the foibles of the present royal family. Others, perhaps the largest group of all, feel less strongly, but think of it rather as they might an old building: it may not be very practical, but they like the look of it just the same. And in the end, even if people resent royal behaviour and the cost of the monarchy, their contempt for those with royal blood is mild compared with their view of ordinary, elected politicians.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The real villains</b></b><br>
As if to prove that point, a <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll conducted in December offered a choice between 13 candidates for an elected president. The clear winner, ahead of politicians and businessmen, was the queen's own daughter, Princess Anne. And therein lies a lesson for any budding constitutional reformer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is that the basic problem in Britain's constitution lies with the politicians, not the royals. The government, formed by the majority party in Parliament and elected by a minority vote of the country, is simply too powerful. Most of the time, it can whip its party into voting through any measure that it cares to. Since 1911 the House of Lords has been able to offer only the scantest of checks on the government and the Commons. Local government has been emasculated. The judiciary has no written constitution against which to hold the government accountable. In most democratic systems there would still be an ultimate check: the head of state. And that is where the monarchy comes in. Its shortcoming is not that it is too powerful, or too privileged. It is that it is too weak to serve its purpose: that of acting as a check on the politicians.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On principle, <i>The Economist</i> is republican: it prefers promotion through merit and achievement to a system of deference based on inheritance. In practice, however, the priority should lie elsewhere, in reforming Britain's constitution in order to restore the checks on governmental action that were originally supposed to be there. That can be done in a number of ways: through the second chamber, a bill of rights, or indeed through the head of state. Over-mighty politicians are the real problem. Reforming the monarchy should be thought of, and argued over, as part of the solution.<br>

<p><b>Telemedicine </b></p> <h1>Big Sister is watching you</h1>

<font size=1>HAYS, KANSAS </font><p> <p>

<p>WEARING a telephonist's
headset, Kathy Rupp sits in a small office at Hays Medical Centre, a computer keyboard at her
fingertips, a television screen in front of her. Mrs Rupp is not a telephonist but a nurse, and
appearing on her screen is one of her patients, Idonna, an elderly lady sitting at home. Mrs Rupp asks
Idonna how she's been feeling, and taps the answers to a series of questions into Idonna's computer
records. Using simple electronic gadgets, Idonna takes her own blood pressure, measures her pulse rate
and holds up a thermometer to the camera so that the nurse can read her temperature. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It takes a
bit of getting used to because you're not there and you don't have the hands-on contact," says Mrs
Rupp. "But you learn to use your other senses." Administrators at Hays Medical Centre reckon that
these televisits are as good as the traditional, hands-on version, and much more efficient. Patients,
reassured by the link-up, may make fewer visits to the hospital. Mrs Rupp can see some 15 patients in
four hours, whereas a nurse physically travelling from house to house may see only five or six
patients in a day. Each televisit costs $36, compared with $135 for a home visit by a registered nurse
such as Mrs Rupp or $60 for a visit by a certified nursing assistant. Under a managed-care system,
with a fixed fee paid per person insured, telemedicine offers huge potential savings. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is such
calculations that make many people in rural America see telemedicine as a miracle cure. At the click
of a button, distances disappear and the most advanced health care can be delivered, promptly and
affordably, to the most remote areas. Hays Medical Centre, which serves a vast area of the western
Kansas plains, has become a telemedicine pioneer. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At Hays, teleconferencing is used for
teaching, for administration, for observing the behaviour of patients, and even--with the help of
close-up cameras that can focus sharply on an area the size of a dime--for detailed clinical
diagnosis. The doctors at Hays teleconsult with colleagues at distant primary-care hospitals, as well
as with specialists at Kansas University. A team of radiologists examine <font size=1>X</font>-rays
transmitted to them, either at home or at the medical centre, from 12 sites in Kansas and neighbouring
Colorado; they are thus instantly available to communities that could not afford a radiologist of
their own. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Standing in the way of these new-fangled possibilities is an old-fashioned problem:
money. The trouble is the rules governing payment for services performed under Medicare, the
health-care system for the elderly. With the notable exceptions of teleradiology and telepathology,
only services performed the traditional way--that is, in person, face-to-face--currently qualify for
Medicare reimbursement. State governments, which provide health services to the poor through Medicaid,
and private insurers could in theory be bolder. But for the most part they are cautiously waiting to
take the lead from the federal government and Medicare. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It could be a long wait. The Health Care
Financing Administration (<font size=1>HCFA</font>) has only just begun a three-year trial of Medicare
reimbursement for teleconsultations involving "hub" hospitals and distant "spokes". The project is
confined to four states (Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina and West Virginia). It will take five years or
so before the recommendations are assessed and turned into law. The <font size=1>HCFA</font> has no
plans--and no money--for similar trials in telenursing such as Mrs Rupp is practising, under a
Department of Commerce grant, in Hays. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Officials in Washington want to have an idea of how much
telemedicine, once sanctioned under Medicare, is likely to cost. They have not forgotten their mistake
in drastically underestimating the bill for reimbursing dialysis for end-stage renal disease. If
getting an expert consultation becomes as easy as picking up a telephone, the volume of services seems
bound to rise. There are also worries about the scope for fraud and abuse. 
<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the potential
benefits in rural areas are so great that pressure for faster action in Washington is bound to grow.
In the final days of the previous Congress, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota introduced a bill that
would provide reimbursement for telemedical services by January 1998. Mr Conrad says telehealth holds
"incredible promise" for rural America. So it does--provided someone will pay for it.

<p><b>Hong Kong</b></p>
<h1>Facing facts</h1>

<font size=1>HONG KONG</font><p>
<p><b>There is plenty of unfinished business to settle before Hong Kong is handed back to China on July 1st. We look at the dispute over China's plans for the territory's government and the problem of the Vietnamese boat people</b></p><br>
QIAN QICHEN, China's foreign minister, recently said that Britain should have the courage to face facts in Hong Kong. Despite opposition from Britain and Hong Kong's liberals, China has approved a "provisional legislature" for Hong Kong, to replace the body elected last year under the political reforms sponsored by Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor. Since the provisional legislature is now in place, Mr Qian reasoned, further opposition has become pointless.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British, Hong Kong's Democratic Party and other liberals do not agree. They continue to challenge the body's legality. Is such opposition futile, as Mr Qian suggests? Not necessarily. Hong Kong's liberals think they may get somewhere with their legal challenges. In any event, their determination to press ahead with their protests, combined with Britain's refusal to accept the provisional body, guarantees that the run-up to the handover to China on July 1st will be difficult.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain argues that there is no legal basis for the provisional legislature either in the Chinese-British Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong, or in China's post-1997 constitution for Hong Kong, the Basic Law. It has challenged China to seek an opinion from the International Court of Justice. However, Tung Chee-hwa, who will be Hong Kong's first chief executive in the new era, has stated that the new body is both essential and legal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Tung, who was selected by the same group of Beijing appointees who "voted" in the provisional legislature three weeks ago, went to Beijing recently to seek ways to bolster the legitimacy of the body. His flying visit was hailed by China's critics as an admission of the provisional legislature's legal defects. Mr Tung rejects the idea that his journey cast doubts on the assertion that the interim body is already legal. But both he and sympathetic lawyers in Hong Kong admit something should be done to "consolidate" its legal basis. Elsie Leung, a lawyer, says China's National People's Congress, to which she is a local delegate, should take action by issuing a statement clarifying the legality of the body.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The shadow legislature is to hold its meetings across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen until it takes over from the present Legislative Council on July 1st. But, even then, Mr Tung's legal headaches may not go away. Hong Kong's liberals are preparing to launch a host of legal challenges against any legislation passed before or after the transfer of sovereignty. A senior official in the Hong Kong government warns of a "legal crisis" caused by the expected avalanche of lawsuits. In effect, Hong Kong courts will be asked to pass judgment on the legality of the provisional legislature. Martin Lee, the leader of the Democratic Party, understands that the initial feedback from expert opinion in London has given him grounds for believing that the legal challenges will be successful.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The legality of the interim body is not the only problem facing Mr Tung; there is also the question of paying for the government-in-waiting. China has promised to finance it until the handover--and then to get the money back from Hong Kong's taxpayers. In theory, budgetary demands are meant to require the legislature's approval. But Mr Tung obviously expects few difficulties on that score.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both Mr Tung and Mr Patten have pledged to co-operate for the final six months of the transition but, with the governor's refusal to have anything to do with the interim legislature, such co-operation may not extend very far. The pre-and post-handover leaders have met only once since Mr Tung's position was confirmed last month, when the pair agreed to disagree.<br>

<h1>Staying on?</h1>

<font size=1>HANOI</font><p>
IF THERE is one thing that China does not want to see when it takes over Hong Kong on July 1st, it is former Vietnamese boat-people roaming the streets of its gleaming new possession. This week Shen Guofang, the spokesman for China's foreign ministry, once again said that the asylum-seekers left in the territory's camps should be sent home by the time Hong Kong is handed back to the motherland.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British, keen to tidy up before making a dignified exit from their last major colony, are doing all they can to rush the repatriation of all the Vietnamese left in Hong Kong. Efforts to send them back have gone fairly smoothly in the past eight months. Numbers in the camps have dwindled to about 5,500 from 18,000 a year ago. They have gone home either voluntarily or under a forced programme. This month Hong Kong closed one of its last big detention camps, Whitehead. Only last year, it was the scene of ugly riots as Vietnamese protested at their return to the communist country they had fled.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet, even as the numbers fall, the realisation grows that the hard part is yet to come. Mr Shen's comments were prompted by a legal action being taken on behalf of the Vietnamese in the camps. The case brought against the Hong Kong government alleges that many of the remaining refugees are held illegally. At issue is a particular group of about 2,600 refugees, who are still in Hong Kong because they have not yet been "cleared" for return: the Vietnamese authorities are finding it hard to check their last known addresses in Vietnam. Nor are their identities clear, because many refugees disguised who they were in the hope of avoiding repatriation. If the case is successful--it is being heard at the moment--hundreds of Vietnamese will be allowed to walk free and melt into Hong Kong society, a prospect that appals China.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another issue is even thornier. About 250 of the refugees are ethnic Chinese with Taiwanese identity papers issued in the early 1970s, when Taiwan had a mission in what was then South Vietnam. Vietnam refuses to take them on the ground that they are "non-nationals". The reason goes back to China's war with Vietnam in 1979.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the nastier side-effects of that war was that Vietnam booted out thousands of ethnic Chinese from (mostly) northern Vietnam. About 280,000 of them still live in south-western China. Although the majority have found jobs and settled into Chinese society, none have Chinese identity papers. China still regards them as "Indochinese refugees" and would prefer them to go home. About 6,000 have said they would like to, because they still have families in Vietnam. But Vietnam says they are Chinese and must stay in China.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Vietnamese say they cannot take back the 250 non-nationals in Hong Kong, as this would hand the Chinese the precedent they may be looking for to force the 6,000 "Indochinese refugees" back home too. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has tried to mediate but has been fended off.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the clock ticks, the British may be hoping that the Vietnamese will blink first. Insisting that leaving the 250 "non-nationals" in Hong Kong is not an option, Britain argues that Vietnam should take them back at once. Aid workers mutter that a deal may still be possible, but no one can say what form it might take. It looks more and more likely that, come July, China will have to accept some Vietnamese on the streets of its repossessed territory.<br>

<p><b>Prisons</b></p>
<h1>Cell-shocked</h1>

IN LATE February or early March, the Prison Service will reach--and exceed-- its current maximum capacity of nearly 60,000 prisoners. In its desperation to come up with extra accommodation the agency is trying everything from inserting prefabricated cell-blocks into existing prisons to converting a former Pontins holiday camp into a new jail. It has even applied for planning permission to moor an American prison ship off Portland in Dorset. With the prison population continuing to rise rapidly and no new jails scheduled to open before the end of this year, no emergency measure seems too far-fetched.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not that the Prison Service will ever turn people away. If the worst comes to the worst, it can always cram more inmates into the existing cells. Cells in police stations could also be pressed into service, although this practice attracted endless criticism before its abolition in the early 1990s. Working from optimistically low projections of the prison population over the next few months, planning officials expect to get by somehow. But the government's policy of tougher sentences and tighter budgets will ensure a continuous struggle to squeeze in new prisoners.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crush for places dates from 1993 when Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on crime under the slogan "Prison Works". Soon afterwards, the Home Office predicted that the prison population would rise from 49,000 in 1994 to 58,000 in 2002. But the zeal with which judges enforced the new policy had raised it to 58,000 by the end of 1996. The Prison Service, which had been concentrating on reducing overcrowding after the Strangeways riot in 1990, suddenly found itself with neither time nor money for anything except housing more inmates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But creating extra capacity is difficult. It takes at least three years from the planning stage to opening a new prison. Moreover, local authorities are reluctant to grant planning permission: Doncaster council blocked one application last year; another in Shropshire had to be withdrawn, and more were delayed by local protests. In existing prisons the installation of flushing toilets in all cells has made it impossible to squeeze in extra beds. The need to house prisoners as close to their homes as possible and at varying levels of security creates further problems: Category B prisons in the north-west, for example, are already full.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the prisons' current straits, politicians plan to increase the pressure. The government has introduced mandatory-sentencing proposals which by its own account will eventually raise the prison population by 11,000. That assumes, with extraordinary optimism, a 20% fall in crime due to the deterrent effect of stiffer sentences. Even if the government's figures prove correct, it has budgeted for a mere 4% increase in spending by the Prison Service over the next two years, even though the growth of almost 15% in the prison population over the past two years shows no signs of slowing. Nor has Labour promised any relief, since it wants to look tough on crime in the run-up to the general election.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Liberal-minded pressure groups, such as the Howard League and the Prison Reform Trust, claim that overcrowding combined with likely staff reductions and sharp cutbacks in education will inevitably make prison life increasingly difficult. Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, warned against such pressures in his most recent report. As it is, 1996 saw 64 suicides in prisons in England and Wales-- the highest number ever recorded.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reformers point out that the number of inmates could be cut by eliminating custodial sentences for non-threatening offenders. People who do not pay their fines account for over 20% of all prison sentences each year. 800 illegal immigrants are now in detention while their status is being decided. About 60% of the 12,000 people in jail awaiting trial or sentencing will not ultimately receive custodial sentences. And thousands more prisoners are serving short sentences for non-violent crimes. To house the big criminals, the government could do worse than set the small fry free.<br>

<h1>Big spenders</h1>

THE Treasury's decision to consider privatising its economic forecasts, announced on January 7th, officially stems from a desire to cut
costs rather than concerns about quality. But the Treasury's forecasts are always controversial. Its most recent forecast, for
example, in last November's budget, was upbeat about consumer spending in 1997, which it expected to rise by 4.25% (see <a
href="br1.gif">chart</a>). This prompted some commentators to accuse the Treasury of talking up the feel-good factor in the run-up to
the general election. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, recent data suggest that consumer spending may well be even
higher than the Treasury then thought. Eyebrows are now being raised at its prediction that this rapidly growing demand will not mean
higher inflation.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The final estimate of <font size=-1>GDP</font> in the third quarter of
1996 showed that consumer spending was 1% higher than in the second quarter. Consumer credit rose by &#163;1.1 billion in
November, compared with an expected &#163;900m. Average new borrowing for September to November was 46% higher than during
the same three months in 1995. Data published on January 6th showed an unexpectedly large increase in the volume of cash circulating
in the economy in December. And the Confederation of British Industry's survey of retailers, published on January 10th, reported that
retail sales, although below some of the most bullish forecasts, were extremely strong in December.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such upbeat numbers are making the financial markets nervous about inflation. They want
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, to raise interest rates to restrain demand, perhaps as soon as January 15th, the date
of his next monetary-policy meeting with Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, reckons that the sort of
increase that Mr Clarke might be willing to contemplate--a quarter of one percentage point, say--may be too little, too late. Real
after-tax income, employment and house prices are all rising. The ratio of total personal wealth (including property, pension rights and
insurance policies) to annual disposable income is likely to reach 5.2 this year. This is up from 4.7 in 1992, and near the all-time peak
of 5.4 in 1989. Consumers are likely to spend some of this wealth as well as their higher incomes. Indeed, the ratio of savings to
personal disposable income has already started to fall.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In particular, the spending power of
those consumers who borrowed most heavily during the 1980s--and so were most hurt by the 1990s recession--has increased
dramatically. Between 1988 and 1994, someone with earnings of &#163;15,000 and a mortgage of &#163;50,000 would have seen
his disposable income after tax and mortgage payments fall by 30% in real terms. In 1997, such disposable income will be double its
level in 1994. Either interest rates will go up sharply, or inflation will--hardly a comfortable prospect for a chancellor with a general
election ahead.<br>

<p><b>Food safety</b></p>
<h1>Don't panic</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font><p>
MAD-COW disease was bad. But the food poisoning epidemic which struck in Lanarkshire last November and has so far killed 16 of its 270 victims has arguably been even more damaging for the government in Scotland. And more deaths are possible; six people are still seriously ill in hospital. On January 7th, government ministers considered the report of an inquiry they set up soon after the outbreak began, by Hugh Pennington, a professor of microbiology at Aberdeen University. They did not like what it had to say.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Scottish deaths have certainly challenged old assumptions about food safety. The bug which caused the Lanarkshire outbreak, the 0157 variant of<i> Escherichia coli</i> (<font size=-1>E</font> coli), is much nastier than other bugs which existing rules were designed to control. In people, it produces a poison which can kill old people and damage the kidneys of children. Other side-effects, some scientists think, may appear years later. It is also extremely virulent--just ten organisms are enough to cause infection, whereas around 100,000 salmonella bugs are needed to cause illness. It can appear to be dead, and then, under certain conditions, it can recover. Unlike most bugs, it seems to like stomach acid. Normal precautions against infection are not necessarily enough: barrier nursing of the Lanarkshire victims did not prevent a nurse from falling victim.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Raw meat which is not properly cooked is the usual source of infection. The Lanarkshire epidemic was traced to a butcher's shop. But the virulence of <font size=-1>E</font> coli 0157 means that minor hygiene slip-ups can contaminate other foods. In 1995, an outbreak affecting 62 people (one of whom died) in America was traced to apple juice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Pennington's report argued that tough new regulations are needed to prevent further mass poisonings. Licensing food retailers, so that environmental-health officers can close firms not following strict hygiene rules, should boost existing powers to close suspect premises, which are subject to so many legal complexities that officials are reluctant to use them. New rules requiring food to be labelled with its origins would also allow health officials to act; a big problem in Lanarkshire was discovering whom the butcher had supplied.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But ministers reckon that this would be too Draconian. Britain's food industry is already heavily regulated, and is not necessarily to blame for the upsurge in <font size=-1>E</font> coli 0157 cases. The worst epidemic so far was in Japan last year, where 8,000 people were infected and 11 died. Ministers also think that the government over-reacted when it introduced the tough Food Safety Act in 1990 after scares about salmonella in eggs. They are not keen to add a lot of new rules now. And there may be better ways to tackle the problem. Most British food-poisoning cases are not mass affairs, but isolated incidents caused by poor hygiene, often at home. To bring down significantly the thousand or so <font size=-1>E</font>-coli 0157 poisonings which occurred in Britain in 1995, and the 80,000 other food poisoning cases, the British need only to be persuaded to cook food properly, and to wash their hands.<br>

<h1>Local calls</h1>

THE Tories continue their recovery in local by-elections which began a year ago--but are still doing much worse than they did in the
run-up to the past three general elections. They gained 16 local-authority seats in October-December 1996, according to <i>The
Economist</i>'s regular survey, and 31% of the 121,756 votes cast in three-cornered contests. However, they remain six percentage
points behind Labour. In the corresponding quarter before their general-election victories in 1983, 1987 and 1992, they were an
average of seven points ahead of Labour (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The worst
losers in the quarter were the Liberal Democrats, who lost 17 seats and held only 12. This may be bad news for Labour, too, which in
the past has relied on the Lib Dems to attract disaffected Tory voters who do not want to back Labour. These results suggest that some
of those voters are returning to the Tories, which may make it harder for Labour to win its target seats.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Scotland, there are too few by-elections to yield quarterly trends. But in 1996 as a whole
there was a 6.6% swing from Labour to the Scottish National Party (<font size=-1>SNP</font>) compared with May 1995, when the
seats were last fought. This is less than the 10.3% swing which occurred in by-elections before the 1992 general election. That swing
hit Labour hard in seats they hoped to win from the Tories. The Tories saw off their challenge in two marginal seats, Ayr and Stirling
(which is held by Michael Forsyth, a possible post-election Tory leadership candidate). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time, Mr Forsyth is already in deep trouble because the Tories are doing particularly
badly in Scotland. Although their vote was 1% higher in 1996 than in 1995, the Tory share of the vote in Scottish local by-elections is
still 6% below what it was in the year running up to the 1992 general election. If the swing from <font size=-1>SNP</font> to Labour at
the general election is lower this time, too, Mr Forsyth can bid farewell to his seat and, with it, to his leadership ambitions.<br>

<p><b>Mortality</b></p> <h1>Years of living dangerously</h1>

DEAD men do tell tales--or at least the statistics about them do. And the news that British men aged between 25 and 40 are more likely
to die than they were a decade ago is a particularly sorry tale.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Male mortality as a whole
has continued to decline, thanks mostly to the better health of infants and of the over-40s. Indeed, life expectancy for men, currently
74 years, is now increasing faster than it is for women--although the allegedly weaker sex can still expect to last five years
longer.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is getting to 40 that is the problem for men. According to new figures from the
Office for National Statistics, in 1992 there were over two more deaths per 100,000 men aged 25-29 than a decade earlier, one more
death amongst those aged 29-34, and a chilling six more deaths per 100,000 in the 34-39-year-old group (see <a
href="br3.gif">chart</a>). This is not cause for panic, but it is a rude surprise: other than during war, says Michaela Benzeval, an
analyst at the King's Fund, a health-policy research body, age-group mortality has fallen across the board for a century. This kind of
reversal is unprecedented. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why has it happened? A bit less than half of the increase in the
death-rate is due to <font size=-1>AIDS</font>, which disproportionately affects young men: since the first British <font
size=-1>AIDS</font> death was recorded in 1982, 9,447 Britons have died of it, about 90% of them men. Being murdered is a young
man's game, too; the increase in total British homicides, from less than 400 in 1972 to around 700 in 1992, took its toll. The rest of
the increase in mortality is due to suicide. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which brings us to wealth. The least-skilled
men (whose death rates have been rising since the early 1970s) are more than three times as likely to commit suicide as professional
men. The incidence of suicide among the least skilled has doubled since 1972; indeed, among the four lowest occupational categories
ranked by skill, which account for two-thirds of British men, suicide rates have increased markedly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One possible reason is that male suicide is closely linked to unemployment (curiously, this is
much less true of women); as joblessness has increased since the late 1970s, so has the number of men taking their own lives. And
because a disproportionate number of the less skilled are unemployed, suicide rates are higher at the lower end of the occupational
ladder. A second factor could be marriage--or lack of it. Divorced and single men are known to be less mentally healthy than married
ones; rising divorce rates could be contributing to the increase in male suicide. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The good
news is that the proportion of men categorised as low skilled is falling steadily (from 22.9% in 1971 to 18.9% in 1991), and the
number in the highest grades is increasing (from 22.9% to 32.9%). The moral of the story, then, is to stay in school, find a good job and
get married (or at least be sexually responsible). Otherwise the consequences may be deadly.<br> <br>

<h1>Fasten your safety belts</h1>

<p><b>Last year saw a big rise in the number of jet-airliner crashes. Worse lies ahead. That is spurring a new approach to air safety
</b></p><br> WHEN the company that makes two out of every three jet airliners says baldly that there could be a big air crash once a
week by 2010, it is time to start worrying: Boeing has no commercial interest in exaggerating the threat that hangs over aviation. But
Boeing's bleak forecast has been echoed by others, including the head of America's Federal Aviation Administration. The steady
improvement in airline safety is about to come to an end. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year was a particularly bad
one for air disasters (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart 1</a>). It saw the ValuJet crash in a Florida swamp (killing 110), the
explosion that blew flight <font size=-1>TWA 800</font> out of the sky off Long Island (killing 230) and a disastrous mid-air collision
near New Delhi in India (killing 349). On average, a jet was written off every 9.8 days. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to statistics collated by Airclaims, an aviation-insurance consultancy, there were
75 accidents that totally wrecked commercial aircraft (jets and small turboprops) in 1996, compared with an average of 66.2 during
the 1980s. These figures include the former Soviet Union. Crashes of big jet airliners--the kind nervous flyers have nightmares
about--have risen from an average of 20.6 a year in the 1980s to 25 last year in the West, and from six a year in the 1980s to 12 in
1996 in the former Soviet Union.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That pushes up the fatality figures. The total number of
deaths rose by 73% to 1,597 last year, compared with 924 in 1995 and an average of 1,136 through the 1980s. Airclaims suggests
that "we may now be seeing the early stages of a gradual increase in the annual number of total losses, with the average for the 1990s
being generally some 10% up on the late 1970s and the 1980s." <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Before cancelling their
next trip, nervous passengers ought to bear in mind that a rise in the absolute number of fatal crashes is not surprising, given that air
travel has risen eightfold since the 1960s. Moreover, last year's big crashes have to be seen in the context of 12,000 jet airliners in
the sky, making over 15m flights and carrying about 1.3 billion passengers every year. The overall accident rate per trip has fallen,
from 50 in a million in the 1960s to just over one in a million today; the accident rate per kilometre flown is also lower than it was 20
years ago (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart 2</a> and <a href="wb3.gif">chart 3</a>). <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there
is still a worry. These accident rates, which fell dramatically in the 1960s and early 1970s, have barely budged in the past ten years.
Since air travel is growing by around 6% a year, simple arithmetic suggests that the absolute number of crashes is bound to rise. That
will certainly frighten travellers, and may check the growth in air travel. "There is no point in telling the people how remarkably safe
air transport is if they see television film or read of a major crash somewhere in the world at the rate of one a week," says Pierre
Jeanniot, director of the International Air Transport Association (<font size=-1>IATA</font>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Travellers already react to what little information they are given on air safety: witness the
way that American passengers deserted cheap no-frills airlines in the wake of the ValuJet disaster. They have gradually returned
(thanks partly to reassuring changes in procedures by the airlines). But ValuJet's planes are barely half full--against an industry
average of around 70%. As the number of crashes increases, travellers may look harder at the statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Airlines and aircraft companies like to claim that commercial aviation is one of the safest ways
to travel. That is absolutely right, if safety is measured in terms of deaths per distance travelled (see <a href="wb4.gif"> table 4</a>). By this measure, one British study shows that flying is 176 times safer than walking, almost 15 times
safer than travelling by car and about 300 times safer than riding a motorbike. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However,
the figures are skewed by the huge distances covered safely by air travel. Thanks to the reliability of airframes and of modern jet
engines (which have fewer moving parts to go wrong than did the old piston engines), accidents rarely happen during cruising. But 68%
of accidents happen on take-off or landing, even though these operations occupy only about 6% of flight time. Recalculate the figures per
number of trips, and cars look 12 times safer than aeroplanes, and only motorbikes look more dangerous (see <a href="wb4.gif"> table 4</a> again). Even the more neutral measure of the fatality rate per man-hour of exposure puts cars and aircraft
on a par.<br> </p><p><b><b>How not to crash</b></b><br> Different aircraft have different safety records (see <a href="wb5.gif"> chart 5</a>). All the same, the awful prospect of one big crash a week is galvanising air-safety regulators and
the aviation industry into action. There are three main ways to make the numbers look better: find new and safer technologies; raise
safety standards in the airlines of developing countries and the former Soviet Union; and improve the training of pilots.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The steep fall in the airline accident rate since the 1960s has been due mainly to the
development of the jet engine. No such dramatic technical fixes are now on the horizon, although there are a few advances that will help.
For instance, satellite mapping of the earth's surface (mostly for military purposes) means that all new aircraft may soon be fitted with
software that will tell a pilot if he is heading for a high mountain, and perhaps even be programmed to make the plane climb over the
obstacle automatically. Satellite positioning systems will also improve air-traffic control.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Improving the safety of the world's most unsafe airlines is harder. American and European
regulators moan about the low standards that tend to prevail in South America, Africa, the former Soviet Union and China. Indeed, the
British Foreign Office recently advised Her Majesty's subjects not to take internal flights in Russia. Germany has been considering
banning some foreign airlines from picking up passengers in Germany since a Turkish airliner, leased to a Dominican company, crashed
last year in the Dominican Republic, killing 189 mainly German holidaymakers.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble
is that the standards agreed under the international air safety regime established by the 1944 Chicago Convention are too vague and
feeble for today's crowded skies. For instance, they stipulate that airlines should limit the number of hours pilots can fly--but not
whether the limit should be ten or 23 hours out of every 24. Most western countries have local standards much higher than those set by
the Chicago rules. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those rules allow countries to interfere in another country's
airline-safety standards only when they have evident reasons to be anxious. That allows intervention when dangerous airlines fly into
relatively safe countries. America's Federal Aviation Administration robustly bans foreign airlines from flying into the United States
unless they let the <font size=-1>FAA</font> supervise them.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third route to safety is
to improve pilot training. Airlines now realise that they must give more intensive training to pilots who switch to automated cockpits.
Indeed, for a time in the late 1980s it looked as though technology was causing more accidents than it prevented because of muddles
over whether the pilot or the computerised flight-management system ("fly-by-wire") was in control. An international study, led by
the <font size=-1>FAA</font>, concluded last autumn that there had been 24 accidents or serious incidents caused by such
problems.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since pilot error is reckoned to play a part in about 70% of accidents, more
attention is being paid to training. "The best pilots are no longer the traditional macho guys with the best bodily motor skills," says
Michael Willett, safety director at the Civil Aviation Authority in Britain. "They are now those with the best information-management
skills to work with digital cockpits." At present, pilot training and testing rightly concentrates on reducing errors: pilots are tested on
their ability to fly with no mistakes, following correct procedures. But to achieve a further reduction in accidents pilots also need to be
tested on their ability to overcome the consequences of the inevitable human errors. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until
now, the emphasis of air safety has been reactive. If an aircraft crashes, a painstaking investigation attempts to pinpoint the cause and
the regulators then order changes to the design of an aircraft or to the way it is flown or maintained. Now there is an attempt to apply
"quality management" techniques, as used in other industries, in air safety. International data on safety problems, near-misses and
accidents are being pooled. <font size=-1>IATA</font>'s Mr Jeanniot wants his member airlines to aim to halve the accident rate over
the next ten years by, for instance, bringing in outsiders to audit their safety-management procedures. Perhaps when such steps are
taken, aviation will get closer to its goal of zero accidents. <br> <br>

<h1>After TWA 800</h1>

AT PRESENT the cause of air safety lurches from crash to crash. Each disaster in turn produces a minor panic throughout the whole air industry. One recent example was the angst caused by <font size=-1>TWA 800</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the 24-year-old Boeing <font size=-1>747</font> exploded in mid-air off Long Island, most people at first suspected a terrorist bomb of causing the explosion; others thought it could be a missile test gone wrong. But the air industry was haunted by another (to it, more frightening) explanation: that the investigators would find some horrible technical fault associated with the aircraft's age. That might have grounded at least the older half of the world's fleet of about 1,000 jumbos, which are on average 18.8 years old. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the event this did not happen. In late December the American investigators of the National Transportation Safety Board (<font size=-1>NTSB</font>) gave a much more muted verdict. They concluded that the explosion which wrecked the aircraft was probably caused by the ignition of fuel vapour in a nearly empty fuel tank attached to the centre of a wing. The source of the ignition could have been a small bomb or a missile, but was more probably the result of some malfunction such as a spark caused by faulty wiring.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Normally the only electric current to come near such a tank is for instrumentation and is too feeble to produce sparks. But flight <font size=-1>TWA 800</font> had been standing on the tarmac at Kennedy airport for several hours in hot weather, with the aircraft's cabin air-conditioning unit running at full blast. The central wing fuel tank, situated next to the air-conditioning machinery, was empty because the flight to Paris would use only the main wing tanks. But the tanks did contain fuel vapour. The exhaust heat generated by the air-conditioning unit would have raised the temperature of the vapours to the point of maximum volatility, so the slightest spark could cause an explosion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NTSB</font> has proposed a series of measures which it wants the Federal Aviation Administration, the regulator, to introduce. The <font size=-1>FAA</font>, which normally follows such recommendations, has until the middle of March to announce what it will do. But the changes are relatively minor and unlikely to ground many of these workhorses of the world's airways. The recommendations range from compelling airlines to keep the tanks full of fuel, or put in nitrogen gas, to fitting gauges to tell the pilots on the flight deck if a tank is overheating. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has brought great relief to Boeing and to the world's airlines. But an industry that ships people around in machines half of which are on average almost two decades old may not be so lucky next time.<br>

<p><b>Apple Computer</b></p>
<h1>Keep polishing</h1>

<font size=1>SAN FRANCISCO</font><p>
THE world loves an underdog, which is what Apple Computer is in the computer industry. Whether facing <font size=-1>IBM</font> in bygone days or Microsoft of late, Apple has always been far more visible than its small share of the crowded computer market would justify. But affection goes only so far--and not, these days, all the way to the average consumer's buying decisions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On January 3rd Apple announced that it will declare a quarterly loss of as much as $150m at the end of the month, which will bring its cumulative losses since the end of 1995 to about $1 billion. That alone is something of a distinction: no other American company has lost so much in the same period. Consumers are fleeing the troubled Macintosh in favour of <font size=-1>PC</font>s, and Apple's share of the world market has shrunk to about 5%--two-thirds of what it was just a year ago.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of Apple's problem is that the Betamax/<font size=-1>VHS</font>-style battle for the computer industry is over, and the <font size=-1>PC</font>, rather than the Mac, has won. But Apple is even having trouble retaining its customers in normally loyal niches such as media and education. Its one claim to superiority--advanced technology and ease of use--is wearing thin. After pulling off the fiendishly difficult trick of switching to an entirely different microprocessor in 1994, Apple now finds itself stuck with the equally difficult problem of replacing an aged operating system. Its new software chief, Ellen Hancock, has ditched the company's efforts to develop a new operating system internally. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather than start again from scratch, Apple in December agreed to buy <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>, a software company founded by Steve Jobs, Apple's charismatic co-founder, for $400m. Mr Jobs himself comes back just as a part-time consultant, but his reappearance, a reminder of former glories, has at least cheered the troops. The technical object of the deal is less obviously cheering, but far more important. Apple wants to use <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>'s software technology, called OpenStep, to regain a technological lead for the Mac operating system. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On January 7th Gil Amelio, Apple's boss, explained to a packed house of the remaining faithful at the annual Macworld conference how he wants this to work. In mid-1998, Apple plans to release a mass-market version of its next operating system, code-named Rhapsody. It will be based on OpenStep and, Apple promises, will be able to run today's Macintosh software on today's Macintosh computers. That will allow current owners--not to mention prospective buyers--to keep using their hardware and software.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such "backward compatibility" is essential: without it, Apple would be launching a completely new kind of computer, and trying to build from scratch a network of independent companies writing and selling compatible software. That would be unimaginably difficult in a market already settled on the <font size=-1>PC</font> standard.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But ensuring that the new operating system is compatibile only avoids making a ruinous mistake. To regain ground that Apple has already lost, the new operating system will have to do more--in particular, more than its competition, Microsoft's Windows <font size=-1>NT</font>. OpenStep, despite being based on a design more than a decade old, seems to be modern enough. And with the Mac's beloved desktop interface, rubbish bin and all, grafted on to it, current Apple owners will feel at home.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pairing with <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font> will also have some appeal for independent software developers--a group that Apple cannot afford to continue losing. It needs these people to produce enough good--and preferably unique--software for the Mac. The new operating system is based on a building-block technology that makes writing software easier than for Windows, and that will also be useful to corporate buyers, a market where Apple has not found much support in the past. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apple's demise in the near future is unlikely. Although its recent quarterly projections drove its shares down by nearly 20%, the company will still have more than $1 billion in the bank after buying <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>. But, although the new operating system may keep Apple in business, it is not enough to win back some of its lost glory.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What should Mr Amelio do? To revive Apple's reputation, the company will have to consider more radical steps. At the moment its products are a weird mix: at one end it still produces innovative gizmos, such as its much-improved Newton personal digital assistants, that recall Apple's inspired launch of the Mac in 1984; at the other it churns out run-of-the-mill stuff such as laser printers and scanners. Some make money; some do not. Like other companies in a mess, Apple needs to focus on what it does best.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At least three parts of Apple might be better on their own or in another company's hands. Apple's low-end computer division (the main source of the latest losses) is a natural candidate: this is in head-to-head competition with nimble upstarts such as Power Computing, which have none of Apple's massive research-and-development overheads. Spun off, it might concentrate on improving its manufacturing efficiencies and market forecasting.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The firm is loth to lose its profitable printer, scanner and digital-camera division. But if the company must shrink to survive, now--when such a rich division can still command a generous selling price--is not a bad time to shed it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Third, Apple's consumer-electronics products, such as the Newton and Pippin, might well fare better on their own. The company's greatest talent has arguably been the ability of its designers to come up with beautiful gadgets that stir the souls of nerds and artists alike. But the result is that Apple cannot decide whether its core business is computers, operating systems, research or consumer electronics. Its elegant toys would do better in the hands of companies such as Sony, which know these markets better. In a similar position, Netscape, the leading Internet software firm, spun off a subsidiary to work with a consumer-electronics firm rather than try to serve two quite different markets simultaneously.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Keeping its research and development, software, and high-end Mac hardware in-house would allow Apple to be a well-rounded company without overextending itself. Apple's new management has shown a willingness to make hard decisions. The question is whether it will go far enough to keep both the company and its flagship, the Macintosh, alive into the next century.<br>

<h1>Lost toys</h1>

APPLE'S purchase of <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font> will give Steve Jobs, founder of both firms, work probably for no more than a day a week. That will leave him more time to spend with his third--and now main-- company, Pixar, creator of "Toy Story", a computer-animated film. This is no bad thing: much as Apple needs him, Pixar needs him more. Despite the film's massive success, the firm is barely profitable, with several lean years ahead. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is strange: "Toy Story" brought in $350m--including $100m in profit-- at the box office alone. Yet Pixar made only $16m in the nine months after the film's release. Add in video and merchandise sales, including the Christmas rush to buy the film's star, Buzz Lightyear, and total profits may reach $400m. Of that, Pixar may get around $40m. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where does the rest go? To Disney, which marketed the film and the products. Pixar, which wrote, animated and produced the film, gets only about 10% of the profits; Disney gets the other 90%. Worse, this deal is for three films, the next of which, "Bugs", will not be out until late 1998 at best. No wonder Pixar's share price has fallen by two-thirds since the firm went public a year ago.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lawrence Levy, the firm's chief financial officer, acknowledges that Pixar has what looks like a raw deal. But when the firm started, he says, the animated-film business was essentially a Disney monopoly; upstart Pixar had little negotiating clout. Now it has proved itself, it hopes for something more like 30-40% in its next deal, although that may not be for years. Meanwhile, Pixar has the comfort of knowing that Disney is better at wringing money out of a character than any other firm on earth: Buzz is already hugging kids at Disneyland.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The agreement between Pixar and Disney looks curiously like a throwback to the 1940s, where actors were contractually bonded to a single studio. For, although Pixar created the characters in "Toy Story", Disney owns them. Today, actors are usually free agents, yet cartoon characters remain indentured servants. Computer animation brings one bit of relief, however; Pixar still owns the data files and computer-rendering technology. If Disney wants to create another Buzz cartoon without Pixar, it will have to draw the helmeted one by hand.<br>

<p><b>Virgin</b></p>
<h1>What's in a name?</h1>

<p><b>Is Virgin, Britain's best-known company, anything more than a conglomerate? If so, thank its daredevil boss</b></p><br>
NO OTHER company chairman has quite the taste for adventure or the genius for publicity of Richard Branson, boss of the sprawling Virgin group. His latest escapade, a brush with death on January 8th in an attempt to float around the world suspended from a helium balloon, exemplified both qualities. Since 1984, when a goggled and helmeted Mr Branson announced the first Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York, his exuberant personality has defined Virgin far better than a bare description of what it sells. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From a boisterous infancy fuelled by Virgin Cola to retirement on a Virgin pension--via trips to Virgin cinemas and Virgin Megastores to buy records heard on Virgin Radio, Virgin Holidays reached on Virgin Atlantic flights, and perhaps even a wedding planned by Virgin Brides--a consumer today can look forward to a life of perpetual Virginity. Indeed, the ubiquitous Virgin name often appears to be the only glue, apart from Mr Branson, that holds the group together. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does that matter? After all, other companies have ranged widely before now. Hanson, a British-American conglomerate, made bricks, cigarettes, industrial chemicals and food. Procter & Gamble covers fewer industries, but still makes products as diverse as toothpaste, peanut butter and paper towels. But these are different from Virgin: most consumers neither know nor care about the name of the parent company. Investors may know that Procter & Gamble makes shampoo; customers buy Head & Shoulders or Pantene.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The name Virgin, by contrast, appears on a huge range of disparate products. So is Virgin simply a conglomerate unafraid to speak its name? No, because most "Virgin" businesses are less than 100% Virginal. Contrary to appearances, no single umbrella group owns them. Virgin Retail <font size=-1>UK</font>, for instance, which runs a chain of vast urban music shops known as Virgin Megastores, is only 25% owned by Virgin. The other 75% is owned by WH Smith, a British newsagent and bookshop chain. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only one widely known Virgin business is in fact wholly owned by the group. That is Virgin Atlantic Airways, the largest subsidiary of the Virgin Travel Group. Virgin also owns 100% of <font size=-1>V2</font>, a record company started in November 1996 that has just released its first record. But Virgin Records, which is well known, is no longer a Virgin business at all; it was sold to Thorn <font size=-1>EMI</font>, a (recently demerged) British record and electrical-goods company, for &#163;560m in 1992. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, not every business in which Virgin has a stake carries the magic name. Rodney Fitch and Company, 50% owned by Virgin and 50% by Mr Fitch, its founder, is a design consultancy which advises companies on developing brand image. Although Virgin has excelled in building its own brand, clients might not want to feel they were getting a Virgin makeover. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The structure of the Virgin empire is complex. Eager to cut costs, Mr Branson has established a network of holding companies and offshore trusts which help the group to minimise its tax liability. More than 20 companies operate the main businesses, which can be broadly grouped into eight divisions (see <a href="wb5.gif">box</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So what is Virgin if not a conglomerate or a single company? In terms of turnover, multiplied by Virgin's share of the business, the airline is dominant. Its turnover is considerably bigger than the Virgin share of all the other businesses combined. But Virgin is not an airline with sidelines in cola and music either. Mr Branson's answer is that Virgin's structure is more like an Asian business empire, in which divisions making different products operate as separately traded companies, owning stakes in each other and sharing a name and an ethos. In "The World in 1997", an <i>Economist</i> publication, he cites the example of Mitsubishi, a family of companies making cars, textiles, electrical goods and including a bank. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jeff Rayport of Harvard Business School suggests another analogy. The only brands that can match Virgin for scope are entertainment and celebrity brands. Disney can tap hamburger boxes and toys with its wand and help them to sell, or construct an entire village in Florida--besides making films and running theme parks. Michael Jordan plays lucrative basketball but also exudes endorsements for shoes, sports equipment, cosmetics and a host of other products. Brands of this sort are tied not to the characteristics of a set of products, but to emotional associations. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence the importance of Mr Branson to Virgin's fortunes. Apart from owning much of the company, he embodies several appealing and, in Britain, rare qualities: the upstart who takes on big bullies and wins; the daredevil whose risks sometimes land him in trouble; and the innovator who finds a better way to do something than stodgy established businesses. Whenever the British are asked by opinion pollsters to suggest ideal prime ministers, replacements for the queen, or even authors for a modern ten commandments, Mr Branson's name is often first on their lips. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This gives Virgin tremendous suppleness as a company, but there are risks. The most serious is of starting a business that fails to embody Virgin values. A Virgin operation that served customers badly would poison the magic potion. The group's recent rapid growth enlarges this risk, since Virgin has started to buy existing businesses rather than to build them from scratch. Virgin Express, for example, was operating as Euro Belgian Airlines when Virgin bought it in April 1996, and the staff have not been steeped in Virgin culture. Maintaining Virgin's commitment to quality and friendliness in an operation whose mission was to provide bargain-basement travel will be particularly tricky. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other sort of risk that Virgin faces is that something will happen to its celebrity chairman. The dangerous descent into the North African desert of the <i>Virgin Global Challenger</i> balloon is not the first time Mr Branson's life has been in jeopardy. During an early skydiving lesson Mr Branson had to be rescued by his instructor, James Bond-style, in mid-air after he accidentally unhooked his parachute. Hair's-breadth escapes enrich the Branson image, but a less happy ending would leave Virgin hollow. Hence recent talk by Mr Branson and his colleagues of Virgin's "brand values"-- quality, innovation, value for money, and fun--in an attempt to distinguish the company's strength from the vigour of its boss. For Virgin's sake, and that of its well entertained customers, the hope must be that they are being overcautious. <br>

<h1>Eight little Virgins</h1>

VIRGIN, with an overall turnover of about &#163;1.8 billion ($3 billion), has eight main divisions, which operate autonomously:<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Travel Group, which owns Virgin Atlantic Airways, flying 2m passengers a year to America, Japan, Hong Kong, South Africa and Athens; Virgin Holidays, a tour operator; Virgin Aviation Services, a cargo service; and Virgin Express, a budget airline connecting Brussels and other European cities. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Retail, which is joint owner of the Our Price record-shop chain in Britain and operates Megastores, large music and entertainment media shops, in several parts of the world. Other subsidiaries include Virgin Trading Company, which owns Virgin Cola.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Communications has a book business, and several television and software production companies in America, Britain and Mexico. Virgin Net, an Internet service, was started in Britain at the end of 1996.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Hotels Group owns, manages or markets more than 30 hotels and clubs in Britain, most of them, such as Heaven, a London night club, or Le Manoir Aux Quat' Saisons, a smart restaurant in Oxfordshire of which Virgin owns 50%, operating under names other than Virgin. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Radio owns 75% of a British pop music radio station.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Cinema is a joint venture with several investment companies, 45% owned by Virgin, which includes the remains of <font size=-1>MGM</font> Cinemas, bought in 1995. It runs multiplex cinemas in Britain with an estimated 1996 turnover of &#163;66.9m. It is gradually restyling the cinemas and labelling them Virgin.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Virgin Direct is a 50:50 joint venture with <font size=-1>AMP</font>, a financial-services firm, set up in March 1995 to sell personal financial services, including pension schemes and tax-exempt savings plans known as Personal Equity Plans. Its turnover to the end of 1995 was &#163;28.9m.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> &nbsp; Voyager Investments is the development arm of the group. It has a stake in the Eurostar London-Paris train service. It also houses smaller oddities, such as Virgin Airship and Balloon (of which it owns 75%), a &#163;2.2m-turnover business (1996 estimate) that gives hot-air balloon rides.<br>

<h1>Darkness at noon</h1>

<p><b>The Gulf war against Iraq in 1991 was swift, and allied casualties were few. But since then, some veterans of the war have suffered from a mysterious illness known as "Gulf-war syndrome". Although theories--and conspiracy theories--abound, it may be impossible ever to know for sure what caused it</b></p><br>
ON MARCH 1st 1991, the day after fighting ended in the Gulf war against Iraq, the noon skies in parts of the theatre of war were black with the smoke from burning oil wells. Three days later, American soldiers destroyed an Iraqi munitions depot at Khamisiyah in the south of the country. This site is now thought to have contained chemical weapons--in particular, sarin nerve gas. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout the conflict, and in the months before it began, fear of chemical weapons had led large numbers of allied troops to take a drug called pyridostigmine bromide (<font size=-1>PB</font>). Fear of biological weapons and infectious diseases had led to the large-scale vaccination of troops against many different organisms and biological toxins. In order to control insects--both for sanitation and for the prevention of insect-borne diseases--pesticides were used frequently and heavily in some army camps. And blazing sun, blowing sand and biting sandflies further increased the discomfort and stress of military life in the desert.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So although the fighting on the ground lasted for only 100 hours and inflicted fewer casualties on the victors' side than any other modern war, the living and fighting conditions were harsh and unpleasant. But did they make people sick?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Answering this question is a little like an enormous game of Cluedo (or Clue as Americans know it) with half the cards missing. There are too many suspects, not enough alibis, and much of the necessary information has vanished. Even the simplest problems--how, for instance, did the French mysteriously avoid illnesses that British and American troops complain of?--are hard to answer. The fundamental ones--Who? Where? And with what?--will probably never be solved--even assuming there was a crime in the first place.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Malingering doubts</b></b><br>
The maladies claimed by veterans of the conflict are many and various. They include skin rashes, nausea, digestive problems, muscle spasms, fatigue, joint pain, lethargy, headaches, memory loss, concentration problems, sleep disorders, mood changes and birth defects--an unpleasant but amorphous group. Each of the environmental hazards described above has been suspected as a cause. And, both in America and in Britain, the way in which the military establishments have tried to explain what happened has been sufficiently incompetent that they are now suspected by many of hiding something.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This means that the latest (though by no means the last) word on the matter--the lengthy final report by the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf-war veterans' illnesses, presented to President Clinton on January 7th--is likely to be controversial. The report, by far the most extensive to date, has been assembled from a review of all the available epidemiological and medical data--and testimony from the defence department, the Veterans' Administration, American Gulf-war veterans and scientists.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The report concludes that although many Gulf-war veterans are indeed unwell, there is no single, clinically recognisable disease that can be called "Gulf-war syndrome". It goes on to argue that none of the symptoms can be attributed to any of the putative risk factors (although it emphasises that more information on troops' exposure to chemical weapons does need to be collected), and that the most likely cause of health problems is stress.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, the pet theory of many groups of servicemen and women (and the general public) has been that those troops who are suffering are sick because of exposure to chemical weapons. On the face of it, the argument looks pretty good. Nerve gas was noticed by Czech military teams (which are among the best in the world at detecting biological and chemical weapons) on January 19th 1991--two days after the beginning of the war on the ground. Five days later, the same teams detected mustard gas. Moreover, chemical-weapons alarms went off frequently during combat--and were as frequently ignored (the detectors often reacted to such things as petrol fumes).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But since the war, <font size=-1>UNSCOM</font>, the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq, which is charged with the unenviable job of eliciting information from the Iraqis on their weapons programmes, has found that while Iraq did possess chemical weapons, there is no evidence that they were used during the Gulf war. The most likely explanation for any low-level exposure to mustard gas or nerve gas is that these poisons were accidentally released by allied destruction of Iraqi weapons stores.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the defence department has been slow to admit that this could have been the case. It was not until last summer that it was conceded that American troops could have been exposed to sarin during and after the demolition of the Khamisiyah munitions depot. And, at first, the Pentagon's estimates of exposure were low-- around 400 troops. It was then forced to revise them upwards to around 20,000. All this has led to allegations of a conspiracy and cover-up. Members of the Presidential Advisory Committee did not find any evidence that there has been such a cover-up, although they have strongly condemned the Pentagon's behaviour. However, there are a number of scientific arguments against the chemical-weapons hypothesis for Gulf-war illnesses.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Nasty stuff</b></b><br>
At the start of the Gulf war, the Iraqis were suspected of having at least four different chemical weapons. Besides mustard gas and sarin, they were believed to have stockpiled soman and tabun, two other nerve gases. The risk that these weapons might have been used was real: Saddam Hussein had already dropped mustard gas, at least, on Iranians during the Iran-Iraq war, and on Iraqi Kurds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mustard gas made its debut during the first world war. It burns tissues it comes into contact with, and in large doses, it can reach the bone marrow--where many cells of the immune system are made--and may cause severe depression of the immune system one to two weeks after exposure.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nerve gases belong to a class of compounds called organophosphates. They work by blocking the action of an enzyme known as acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme is crucial for the proper action of nerves and the muscles they control. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter--one of the chemical messengers that carry signals from one nerve to another. The job of the enzyme is to mop up surplus acetylcholine. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the mopping up is prevented, the nerve does not know when to stop firing-- and muscles go into spasms. At low concentrations, symptoms of nerve-gas poisoning include loss of vision, salivation, breathlessness and headaches. At high concentrations, people may stop breathing altogether. It was to combat this that many American and British troops were issued with <font size=-1>PB</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The drug works against nerve gases in a counter-intuitive way: it also blocks the action of acetylcholinesterase. The difference between <font size=-1>PB</font> and a nerve gas is that <font size=-1>PB</font> is reversible. Whereas a nerve gas takes acetylcholinesterase out of commission forever, <font size=-1>PB</font> slowly lets it loose again. So the idea was that if <font size=-1>PB</font> was already interrupting the action of say 20-40% of the enzyme, then that 20-40% would not be available to be blocked by nerve gases. Instead, as troops came into contact with nerve gases, they would not suffer as much because <font size=-1>PB</font> would slowly render more of the crucial enzyme available again.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem with this idea is that <font size=-1>PB</font> does have the potential to make people feel sick at the time, and an overdose could be quite severe. This has led to suggestions that even if troops were not exposed to nerve gases, some of their current problems could be due to <font size=-1>PB</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there was another class of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor present in the Gulf: pesticides. The pesticides used by many troops involved in the conflict were also organophosphates--in effect, they were nerve gases for bugs. In order to be fatal in people, such substances need to be taken in much higher doses than an anti-human nerve gas. Nonetheless, they are nasty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the autumn of 1996, Nicholas Soames, Britain's armed forces minister, was forced to admit that the House of Commons had been misled about the use of pesticides in the Gulf, and that such use had been far more extensive than anyone had said. Whether this concealment was deliberate or just a result of bungling is not clear--but again, it did not look good, and it damaged public confidence.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each of these possibilities--low level exposures to nerve gases, the use of <font size=-1>PB</font> and the deployment of pesticides--has fallen under suspicion as a possible cause of Gulf-war illnesses. But so far, the data (which are still incomplete) are inconsistent with what is known about these substances.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For one thing, the symptoms should have been apparent from the start. However, according to members of the Presidential Advisory Committee, there are no records of health complaints during the war that are consistent with mild nerve-gas exposure. And although some sheep farmers who have used organophosphates in sheep dips have complained of ill health that is similar to that experienced by veterans of the Gulf war, sheep farmers, according to Alastair Hay, a chemical pathologist at the University of Leeds, usually report feeling bad at the time, as well as going on to have subtle neurological problems later.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After reviewing the available data--including what little there is on neurological damage among Gulf-war veterans--the Presidential Advisory Committee failed to find credible evidence that any of these substances could have caused the problems seen among American forces in the Gulf. This result is likely to be hotly disputed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Goran Jamal, a neurologist at the University of Glasgow, for instance, argues that his results show clear neurological damage among Gulf-war veterans. In a report to be published in the January 15th issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medi cal Association</i>, Robert Haley, of the University of Texas South Western Medical Centre, in Dallas, reports similar data--and claims that he has found evidence for three distinct Gulf-war illnesses. However, the sample sizes for all the neurological work done so far are tiny, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Moreover, it is possible that in combination, the effects of organophosphates could be more dangerous-- something on which the committee recommends further study. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What of the other alleged risk factors? Despite claims of a number of unusual diseases--for example, Garth Nicolson, a doctor at the University of California, Irvine, says he has found a strange organism called <i>Mycoplamsa fermentans</i> in the bodies of some veterans of the Gulf war--infection, whether naturally occurring or deliberately triggered as an act of war, does not seem to be implicated in the unexplained illnesses of veterans.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Iraqis have now confessed to <font size=-1>UNSCOM</font> that they had indeed developed a frightening array of biological weapons (although the claims have proved extremely difficult to verify). But there is no evidence that biological weapons were used in the war; nor is there evidence that biological agents were accidentally released as a result of allied bombing. Indeed, as one British general has observed, the war in the Gulf led to fewer deaths from disease than any previous conflict involving the British army. During the Crimean war, for instance, far more British troops died of cholera than died in battle.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Actual disease is not the only suspect, however. Many British servicemen reckon that their ill health was caused by preventative measures against disease: vaccinations. Both British and American troops were vaccinated against an enormous array of diseases--including possible biological weapons. But again, although some people did report feeling unwell after vaccination, there is no evidence other than anecdote that suggests that the vaccines were at fault.<br>
</p><p><b><b>What about the data?</b></b><br>
Out of any large group of people, as time goes by, some will get sick. So in order to establish whether or not service in the Gulf has caused an illness, or a number of illnesses, it is important to compare different groups of people, to see what the differences are. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For example, the rate of birth defects in the population at large is quite high. According to the Presidential Advisory Committee's final report, from any sample of 200,000 American children, you would expect to see about 6,000 born with defects. So in order to address the emotive question of whether service in the Gulf causes birth defects, it is important to determine that there are more birth defects than expected. So far, the data suggest that this is not the case (although the British are just about to start a large study to investigate it in their forces).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is there any evidence so far that service in the Gulf was more likely to kill mysteriously than service elsewhere at the same time--or than life as an American civilian. A study published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> in November 1995 compared the death rates of 695,516 American troops who had served in the Gulf with 746,291 troops on active duty elsewhere. It found that although Gulf-war veterans were significantly more likely to have died between the end of the war and September 30th 1993 (the date the study ended), the extra deaths were caused by accidents, not disease. In addition, members of both groups of servicemen were less likely to have died than the average American--reflecting the fact that in order to be in the armed forces at all, physical fitness must be high. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, although it is clear that some people are sick with diseases that cannot easily be explained, except by service in the Gulf, it is not certain how many of them there are. Among American troops, estimates have ranged from 1,000 to 80,000.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best guesses come from the numbers of people who have presented themselves for physical examinations, either on their own initiative, or at the behest of veterans' groups. In America, according to the advisory committee, roughly 62,000 individuals have had physical examinations in the Veterans' Administration Persian Gulf Health Registry, and more than 34,000 people have requested examination by the defence department's Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Programme. However, of these, roughly 10% have no detectable health problems, and the complaints of many others are just run-of-the-mill. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Britain, where alleged cases of Gulf-war illness have generally been reported more slowly, roughly 1,100 (out of around 51,000) troops have come forward with complaints. According to a spokesman at Britain's Ministry of Defence, of the roughly 900 who have been examined so far, 20% have health problems that are hard to explain. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But meanwhile, in France, which also sent troops to the Gulf, no one has complained of Gulf-war illnesses, despite extensive publicity about the syndrome as described in Britain and America, and despite apparent efforts by the French armed forces to conduct random studies and health tests of their troops. This is curious--and is so far unexplained.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To account for it, three hypotheses can be imagined. First, members of the French forces might be less likely to complain of feeling sick--perhaps because of cultural differences within the army. Second, British and American troops might be more likely to over-report illnesses--perhaps because of differences in benefits that could be claimed in compensation. Third--and most tantalising--there may have been real differences between what happened to different groups of soldiers in the Gulf.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The French contingent was smaller than the British one--in all, 13,500 French troops served in the Gulf. Moreover, as the French were not part of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s joint military command at the time, they could not be integrated into British or American units. This meant that the French were not in the same places as the other allied forces. However, French units did serve in the front line--and according to French military sources, were sometimes far in advance of other troops at the front. Also, French liaison officers worked alongside Anglo-American liaison officers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there are some potentially interesting differences. According to Fran&ccedil;oise Rota, who served in the Gulf as a medical officer and is now a senior doctor in the French army, her fellow citizens did two things differently.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Firstly, they did not use many of the vaccines that the British and the Americans used. In particular, they did not vaccinate against anthrax, a common component of biological weapons, and a disease endemic to the Gulf anyway. Nor did they take preventative measures against botulinum toxin--another component of biological weapons, and one of the most poisonous substances known. Indeed, according to Colonel Rota, they did not even administer <font size=-1>PB</font> to their troops.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Secondly, the French camps were not sprayed with insecticides as a preventative measure--rather, spraying was done only when it was needed to control pest populations. And, according to some reports, when they did spray, the French did not use organophosphates.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Also, in addition to these differences, the French troops were nowhere near the munitions depot at Khamisiyah when the destruction took place.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, no studies have compared the experiences of different groups of servicemen who were in the Gulf. Doing so will be difficult. In order to tell whether people with headaches, say, had one set of vaccinations while people with joint pain had another, it is necessary to have extensive information on who took what and was exposed to what when. This information does not exist. Both the Americans and the British have lost vaccination records. In any case, though records were kept as to which units were where in the Gulf, more often than not individuals did not stay with their units, rendering accurate assessment of risks impossible.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is unfortunate, and unsatisfactory (especially to those who are seriously sick). But perhaps it is not unexpected. The primary job of an army is to fight battles, not to collect medical data. But after every major war this century, ex-soldiers have complained of mysterious diseases. And as the nature of war changes, so that death and disease at the time become less likely, it is right that greater attention should be paid to the future health of troops.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Devising ways to collect data reliably without interfering with military operations, and pursuing research into the effects of the toxic and debilitating compounds used in modern war, and into the effects of prolonged stress on the body, should have a higher priority. That way, problems after the next conflict may be resolved more quickly. For despite the latest report, the arguments over Gulf-war illnesses will not go away for many years to come.<br>

That is because businesses have at last learnt how to use it</I><p ><br>CONSIDER this vision of finance. Artificially intelligent agents plan their clients' investment and transaction needs, constantly finding the best prices on 24-hour electronic financial markets and managing their assets to meet defined risk-reward targets. Businesses send and settle their bills instantly (or, as the jargon has it, in real time), and raise any working or other capital they need by advertising to investors on global computer bulletin boards. And, operating under the auspices of a global sales-tax authority, digital money systems make electronic commerce indistinguishable from physical trade.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How realistic is that vision&#063; On the face of it, not very. Some of the technologies, notably artificial intelligence, are only nascent today. Other details, such as a global tax authority, seem pretty unlikely. And, according to some observers, digital money is riddled with hopeless security flaws.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet a deeper look at today's financial-services industry makes the vision seem suddenly more plausible. Automated financial planning is appearing rapidly in retail finance. Electronic marketplaces are developing for insurance and mutual funds, as well as for low-cost share trading. Some small firms already raise money by appealing direct to investors, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries (though not yet lawyers and accountants). Companies everywhere are racing to offer consumers electronic access to their products, usually by setting up a Web site on the Internet. "Virtual" banks are touting cyber-payment systems. Investment banks are using mind-boggling mathematics to run complex portfolios of financial instruments, borrowing liberally from quantum physics. Financial firms are pouring money into information technology, and are expected to go on doing so (see <a href="tf1.gif">chart</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So even radical forecasts should, it seems, be taken seriously. If they are not, today's insurers, banks and brokers could turn out to be dinosaurs, with new technologies playing the role of the destructive meteor, and only a few surviving in unpredictable new forms. More technologically adept creatures may take over, remaking the industry along entirely different lines.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps. Yet rapid technological change is confusing--and radical forecasts are easily hyped. Past waves of innovation produced forecasts that proved wildly inaccurate. Remember electronic home banking, which was accorded revolutionary status in the early 1980s, but failed to take off&#063; Embarrassed bankers do, and their experience is a good reason for financial firms' careful attitude towards such novel phenomena as the Internet.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, many banks have learnt that revolutions are not made by new machines alone. Changing the way people behave is often more important. As Martin Taylor, chief executive of Britain's Barclays Bank, says: "The industry taught people to associate banking with visiting marble halls that were almost like cathedrals. Now we're telling them it's all right to pray at home. But we have to understand that money, our product, has a lot of sociological encrustations which we can't remove simply by changing the way we view our business."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As this survey explores technology and its impact on finance and financial services (mainly in America, which is the furthest ahead in this field), it will therefore pay close attention to two groups of people. One is the managers of financial firms. After several decades of wrestling with technology, the best have recently begun to harness and use it more intelligently. Their recognition that firms can do things in new ways lies behind this survey's central proposition: that, thanks to technology, financial services are on the cusp of dramatic change.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second group is composed of people who buy and use financial services. Their increasing familiarity with technology is a powerful force for change. But they can be recalcitrant, resisting innovations in favour of tried and tested procedures. Metal coins, paper money and cheques are still ubiquitous (see <a href="tf2.gif">chart</a>) compared with electronics. Consumer preferences are often at odds with the innovative impulses of service providers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence this survey's crucial caveat. In so far as technology is changing finance, it is not because of a particular invention or insight. Rather, it is doing so when the new techniques are broadly in sympathy with how people and firms wish to conduct their financial affairs. For almost the first time, leading financial-services firms are trying to understand their customers' desires and to shape their businesses to meet them--at a suitable profit.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may mean moving into areas far removed from the traditional terrain of finance. Or it may mean breaking from traditional process-driven ways of doing things and re-examining what a financial firm actually does. This is the financial-services equivalent of "business-process re-engineering", the management fad of the early 1990s. It has the potential to change an entire commercial model. And that, after decades of false dawns, is what technology may at last be delivering.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf2.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<html><head><title>A survey of technology in finance</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><table width=100%><tr><td align=left valign=top><h3>A survey of technology in finance</h><td align=right valign=top><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></td></tr></table><H1>The machine age</H1><P><I>Past technologies merely automated the processes of finance</I><p ><br>"THE system is used in factories of all sorts, in steel mills, by insurance companies&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;by textile mills, automobile companies, numerous railroads, municipalities and state governments. It is used for compiling labour costs, efficiency records, distribution of sales, internal requisitions for supplies and materials, production statistics, day and piece work&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;for analysing risks in life, fire and casualty insurance&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;for distributing sales and cost figures as to salesmen, department, customer, location, commodity, method of sale."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The odd archaism aside, this quote&#042; reads uncannily like a description of a 1960s mainframe computer system. In fact it dates from half a century earlier. An enthusiastic American journalist is describing the impact of the electro-mechanical punch-card machines that preceded digital computers. By 1911 Herman Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company had around 100 customers. That year Hollerith sold the firm for $2.3m and watched it merge with two other companies to become the Computer Tabulating-Recording Company. In 1924 it became International Business Machines.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Punch cards certainly had a huge influence on businesses of all sorts, including financial ones. Indeed, they did not become obsolete until the 1960s, when digital computers took over. The long-time prevalence of cards had a profound effect on how financial firms used technology. In part thanks to their technical limitations, computing machines were seen almost entirely as a means of automating manual processes. There was little concept of data storage (memory was primitive and expensive until the digital era), and only limited ability to compile data in forms that could be analysed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early computing systems were usually designed to be more efficient "analogues" of existing physical business systems that relied on hand-written ledgers and paper chains. Punch cards also led to an approach which took it for granted that processing would be done in batch cycles: literally the batches of cards that could be fed into machines running a single program. So the computing infrastructure of financial services mirrored its physical infrastructure. Cheque-processing systems, credit-accounting systems, even banks' general ledgers, were reproduced first in card and then in digital form. This analogue tendency persisted in the 1960s and 1970s when big firms installed mainframes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The race was now for efficiencies in processing. A new generation of managers, exemplified by John Reed of America's Citibank, extolled the virtues of process engineering and tried to import technologies from manufacturing into finance. Paper was anathema. Machines replaced clerks. But the nature of the underlying jobs was unchanged. As one senior banker explains, the first mistake that everybody made was to suppose that their existing model was the right one and that computers could be used in some way to make it more efficient.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In retrospect this is somewhat ironic. Managers knew that information was the essence of finance. Yet they built huge, expensive systems that simply dealt with processes and transactions, with no effect on how their firms captured and monitored information. Although this meant greater speed and fewer errors, it profoundly limited the impact of technology on the managers' business.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is largely because they were concentrating on aspects of finance which could confer few if any competitive advantages. Activities such as cheque processing are now rather like utilities. Reflecting that, they are fertile ground for "outsourcing" to low-cost specialist firms. Another consequence was that competitors that were slow to adopt technology were not fundamentally disadvantaged. If they stuck with manual processes, their competitive handicap was marginal rather than profound.<br><b><p>The competitive advantage of banks<br></b>Where, then, does competitive advantage in financial services lie&#063; Not in the transaction itself, perhaps; but certainly in the information typically embedded within it. What is a customer doing; how might this be different from his normal behaviour; does it expose either customer or financier to any risks which could or should be hedged&#063; These are questions that hint at where value resides. And, as we shall see, they are precisely the kinds of questions that financial managers are now, thanks to information technology, better able to answer.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Information of this type has, to be sure, always existed in finance. Firms created repositories for it intuitively and trusted that they could be used to make decisions. The repositories were not big central databases; they were people. Think of a broker's intimate knowledge of customers' investment goals and trading preferences. Or of insurance agents' grasp of the lifetime coverage needs of families. Perhaps most obvious of all, remember the local bank branch manager, whose social standing reflected his implicit lending power as well as his explicit knowledge of local connections.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By scattering these human repositories as widely as they could, banks and other financial firms built what were in effect information networks. In some cases, however, regulation forbade far-flung networks--American banks were until recently banned from branching across state lines. That made the banks more vulnerable to cyclical swings in profitability. In any case, there was seldom much of an attempt at useful aggregation of information. True, insurers built detailed models of mortality rates or theft claims. But they had little sense of whether their relationship with particular customers were profitable, or of whether the customers had bought an appropriate array of policies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lack of specific knowledge about customers combined with high distribution costs to shape financial services in another way. Financial products tended to be uniform, regardless of who bought them. Only the super-rich could afford, say, insurance that was tailored to their needs. Most people bought standard products, often paying for elements they did not need or, perhaps worse, forgoing elements they might have found useful.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Extracting specific customer information from firms' process-driven systems was technically difficult and financially prohibitive--at least until recently. A big technological breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when faster and cheaper computer chips made possible the development of "middleware", or sophisticated systems that sit between mainframes and desk-top terminals and facilitate both data extraction and analysis.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The development of big relational databases also conferred an advantage on firms dealing with huge amounts of data. Falling communication costs removed another barrier to the creation of sophisticated computer networks, permitting the linking of previously disparate systems. These systems are now central to financial firms' ability to derive useful knowledge from their otherwise dumb data. Indeed, it has become <i>de rigueur </i>in some financial circles to have a "data warehouse": a somewhat misleading term for large systems for data storage and analysis.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peter Carroll, a consultant with Oliver, Wyman & Company, observes that in the past banks often purged data that had been temporarily entered into their processing systems. These days they seek to "mine" it for useful nuggets. Instead of rejecting a credit-card applicant because he has no credit history, a bank might now note that he has $250,000 on deposit and issue a card after all. Rather than lose the account of a prominent local entrepreneur, a bank might choose to waive charges on his son's bouncing cheques.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In some ways, this is merely an effort to replace human repositories of knowledge by machines. At another level, however, it is a huge shift in how financial firms go about their business. They are seeking to turn data into information; and then to use that information to make more profitable business decisions. These decisions could be big strategic steps, such as disposing of a business line or agreeing to a merger; or they might be tactical decisions, to re-price a product or close a branch, say.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Yet, as Mr Carroll argues, the really profound impact of the shift from dumb data to usable information comes in the unglamorous area of daily operational decisions. There are three main types of operational decision (see <a href="tf3.gif">table</a>). In the past these were dictated by firm rules--people who lack a credit history make bad credit-card customers, say. But now such decisions can be informed by a richer array of knowledge. A bank can differentiate its decisions: instead of applying one iron rule to all similar customers, it can say "yes" to one customer, "no" to another, and "yes but only if" to a third.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not easy to appreciate the  For each individual decision, the financial effect may be small or even trivial. But extended to an entire customer base, the impact of such techniques could be enormous. Even without gaining a single new customer, a bank could transform its revenues by becoming better at evaluating its existing relationships. And if it could also ensure that new customers would be more likely to be profitable, the bank could cement its advantage.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such techniques are not pipedreams. Several banks and insurers have experienced such improvements in limited areas of their business and are now trying broader applications. Other financial firms are also making the transition from dumb data to useful information. All of this, note, with no mention of the Internet or other high-tech frontiers. The bigger impact often comes from people using existing technology to run their businesses better--so long as their customers are prepared to go along.<br><p><Footnote>&#042;From "Computer: a History of the Information Machine".

But this quiet town was chosen for a trial launched on August 26th by one of the region's leading banks. First Union, America's sixth-largest bank with $140 billion in assets, was once a typical process-driven user of technology, according to Ed Crutchfield, the bank's boss. "But about five years ago," he says, "we switched from an inward-looking perspective to asking how all this technology was affecting our customers, and what we could do to make them like it." Now the bank is trying to change its customers' behaviour. If it succeeds, it will extend the trial to all its 2,000 branches.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Customers entering the branch in Arden, a blue collar suburb of Asheville, are greeted by a new look. The space has been redesigned, walls knocked out to create open areas and desks repositioned to seem less intimidating. Telephones link to First Union's service centre outside Charlotte, the bank's base. The branch's automated teller machines (<font size=-1>ATM</font>s) have been enhanced to offer such services as instant cheque-cashing, mini-statements of recent transactions, split deposits (the ability to send, say, $100 to one account and $50 to another while making a single deposit) and coin facilities. Customers get another dose of novelty when they are approached by a "customer relationship manager" (<font size=-1>CRM</font>), who asks what they want to do. If the transaction can be done electronically or remotely, the <font size=-1>CRM</font> politely shows the customer a faster alternative to standing in a queue for a human teller.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The results are impressive. One man is waiting to deposit a cheque for $200, $50 of which he wants to transfer into his money-market account. Although he has an <font size=-1>ATM</font> card, he queues up to see a teller. Step forward the <font size=-1>CRM</font>, who telephones the First Union service centre and remotely adds the money-market account to the customer's <font size=-1>ATM</font> card. He can then do what he wants with a single visit to an <font size=-1>ATM</font>, avoiding the human teller. At one test branch, <font size=-1>ATM</font> deposits have quickly doubled their previous rates. Queues have dwindled. As Don Harrison, First Union's area manager in Asheville, jokes, he will need more <font size=-1>ATM</font>s if customers are not to be frustrated by a new kind of wait. Old ladies who had never before used an <font size=-1>ATM</font> card are suddenly enthusiastic about their technical prowess.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It may sound trivial; but that is because First Union is seeking merely to improve its use of technology that it already has. Most banks, having built their <font size=-1>ATM</font> networks, made little effort to ensure that customers actually use the machines. First Union is among a few that are trying to undo such negligence. Customers are surprised to find that they can do things faster and more conveniently. The benefit to the banks is obvious. Electronic transactions are much cheaper than people or paper-based ones; allowing for systems and personnel costs, an <font size=-1>ATM</font> transaction costs 25-30 cents, compared with $1.75 for a teller transaction.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  It is not that straightforward, however. Banks have learnt that what ultimately drives their costs is how customers behave. Instead of making a single teller withdrawal of $200, <font size=-1>ATM</font>-happy customers might make five visits to the machine, withdrawing smaller amounts each time and, oh, checking their balance for good measure. Thus, the correct cost comparison may be $1.40 against $1.75; still a saving to the bank, but a far less dramatic one.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Predicting how customers will use enhanced <font size=-1>ATM</font>s is no easy matter, either. The machines are expensive, at around $30,000 each; and their extra functions are seductive. In the Asheville trial, for instance, cheque-cashing has already proved popular, particularly among workers who are paid weekly and who formerly had to wait for their pay cheques to clear into their accounts.<p><b>Root and branch</b><br></b>First Union's Asheville trial is unusual in its scope and potential. Its encouragement to customers is part of an ambitious plan to shift 280m transactions that would have been branch-based to electronic channels by the end of the decade. That represents one-fifth of all transactions forecast by First Union over that period for the southern states of its retail-banking franchise. The bank's aim is simple: if a transaction can be done by <font size=-1>ATM</font> or telephone, that is how it should be done.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, First Union is treading cautiously. Staff in Asheville have been told that their jobs are safe, even as dwindling customer queues reduce the need for them. Yet a big chunk of the bank's assumed long-term cost savings must presumably come from lower personnel costs&#063; Not so, asserts Mr Crutchfield. "This isn't about eliminating jobs through automation; it's about using technology to generate revenue." At worst that means some branch workers being retrained as investment advisers or mortgage specialists, or as telephonists in the bank's fast-growing call service centre. "We need marketing skills far more than we need operations skills," says Mr Crutchfield.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Note that, a few enhancements aside, there is little new technology at work in Asheville. A video kiosk that provides links with specialists for complicated queries is a rare exception. The biggest benefits to the bank will accrue from getting customers to use already existing electronic channels rather than people.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other banks have gone beyond First Union's policy of gentle encouragement, by resorting to the price mechanism. KeyCorp, a Florida bank,  pays 25 cents to customers who make deposits at <font size=-1>ATM</font>s rather than use a teller. Last year First Chicago pioneered an alternative approach when it began to charge for some types of teller transactions. Earlier this year Citibank introduced a bank account that is free provided the customer does not use a teller. There is more to First Union's technology efforts than mere tinkering in branches. Mr Crutchfield has committed the bank to investing in any technology that can be expected to help customers to contact the bank without using a branch. Whether that is a home computer, a smart telephone, an <font size=-1>ATM</font> or a merchant's debit terminal, he wants First Union to have a presence. To that end Mr Crutchfield engineered a huge merger last year with First Fidelity, a New Jersey bank, arguing that First Union needed a bigger capital base if it were to afford the growing bill for technology investment. (See <a href="tf4.gif">chart</a>)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The business logic is persuasive. If banks that use technology more widely and intelligently than their rivals can both realise more value from existing customers and make them happier, they will worry less about losing them--and they may even attract new ones. To take an example, First Union has used the power of new technology to develop what seems a peculiar line of business for a bank: relocation services. (See <a href="tf5.gif">chart</a>)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Around 15% of America's households move house each year, routinely closing bank accounts and laboriously opening new ones at a different bank in their new town. First Union used to lose the business of more than 80% of customers who were moving. Then, in 1991, the bank started a small business which had two main goals: to keep the business of more customers who were moving, and to win a large share of the business of people moving into the bank's own region. Using government statistics, First Union creates computer models of patterns of migration. It has also built a network of information suppliers who provide leads on households that might be about to move.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Retention efforts were concentrated on trying to predict which customers are about to move, and offering help with their relocation. Many can be directed towards a First Union branch in their new area or to its own telephone banking service. The bank now loses many fewer customers than it did. Its pitch to newcomers to its area is even more striking. As well as opening a bank account and preprinting cheques for them, the bank liaises with local utility companies to ensure that services are connected before the new customers arrive in their homes. Last year, First Union helped to relocate 40,000 households. This year, by the end of September it had already helped another 70,000 to move. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The financial impact of such techniques is significant. In addition to its relocation business, the bank now has a direct sales force that uses information about customers to predict their likely needs. Letters (1.2m of them last year) are generated from individual sales agents offering customers a product or service. First Union estimates that in 1995 it acquired new business worth $1.2 billion this way.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These efforts are part of a broader trend to tailor products and services to individuals rather than to mass markets. Smart banks (and insurers) no longer roll out a new product and try to sell it to every customer. Rather, they assess each customer and ask what he or she might need. Over time, they create a picture of each customer that allows them to market their services more effectively.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In early September, for instance, Hurricane Edouard veered ominously towards some of First Union's biggest markets in the Carolinas. If the winds hit home, there would be massive disruption, followed by the chaos of insurance claims. First Union knew that many customers might face temporary financial difficulties. Thanks to its data system, the bank was able to send every account holder living in the hurricane's path a letter reassuring them that it would be understanding. "The only limits to this technology are our imaginations," says one enthusiastic First Union manager. It is a message that is also beginning to affect banks' biggest business of all: lending money.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf4.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

It was a humiliating experience, brought about by years of ill-disciplined lending. "There were three things wrong with our corporate-loan portfolio," says Martin Taylor, who joined the bank in 1993 as its chief executive. "We grew it too fast, so we lost quality; we priced our lending wrongly; and we allowed huge industry concentrations."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even before its nadir, Barclays was taking steps to improve its lending methods. In 1991 it started to build a computer system to support its lending staff by providing them with information and analytics. The project was motivated less by awareness of the gaping holes in the bank's portfolio (that was to dawn only a year or so later) than by frustration that some lenders were obviously much better at the job than others. Barclays had tried extensive training programmes, but wanted to capture more of the best practice of its loan officers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "We wanted a system which would allow us to do a structured financial analysis of our customers," says Brian Fowler, head of credit in Barclays' business-banking operation. The result was Lending Adviser, a software system which the bank had purchased and then extensively customised. It was tested in two branches before being installed throughout Barclays' business banking network during 1994. The system became fully operational in June 1995. Mr Fowler, who was the senior project manager for Lending Adviser, admits that he had initial doubts. "There was a real danger that we did not fully understand the technology we were implementing," he says. "At the very least I felt that it would require cultural changes in the bank if it were to succeed."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the old Barclays lending paradigm, individual lenders acted at local level, triggering referrals up the hierarchy only if they wanted to make loans that would exceed their pre-set limits. So-called "exceptions" were passed first to regional offices and then to head office, where they were dealt with by specialist credit staff. By the time a proposal reached the specialists, it had implicitly been approved further down the hierarchy, encouraging the credit specialists to look for reasons not to make the loan. The bank had no uniform view of a potential loan's riskiness. Indeed, because lenders were trying to "sell" proposals to the institution, that riskiness was greater than anyone realised.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This had several effects. First, individual lenders assumed what Mr Taylor calls a "binary" mindset. Each decision was formulated along the hard lines of whether a given individual would repay or not. "That's fine if you make only one loan in your life," says Mr Taylor. "But if you are a bank and you are making hundreds and thousands of loans, then the right question to ask is 'what is the chance that this loan will be repaid&#063;'--a crucial difference."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nowadays, every potential loan is, with the help of Lending Adviser, marked with a grade that assigns the proposal to one of ten categories separated by perceived riskiness and the likelihood of default. Adding lots of those chances together (that is, making a portfolio) gives the bank a statistical basis for evaluating both individual lending decisions and its overall loan book.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another effect of the old lending system was to make it hugely vulnerable to the attitudes of its central credit specialists. Barclays hit trouble partly because in the late 1980s its lending was growing at an annual compound rate of 25-30%, whereas Britain's <font size=-1>GDP</font> in money terms was not even growing half as fast. This happened largely because the bank's board had signalled an era of growth in an effort to reclaim Barclays' position as Britain's biggest bank. The credit specialists got the message--and switched off their risk antennae. The furious lending that followed, much of it to property companies, led directly to the bank's subsequent write-offs.<br><b><p>Co-operation, not conflict<br></b>Lending Adviser was a conscious break with established procedures. Significantly, it did away with the laborious paper process by which loan proposals reached head office. Moreover, it was incompatible with the bank's old command-and-control management hierarchy. Exceptions are now sent electronically from their point of origin to the bank's credit managers. So-called loan sanctioners at the centre now view the same information as the would-be lender in the field, co-operating with the lender to come to a decision about a proposal.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The system was not an instant hit with all of Barclays' lenders. Despite some fancy software, Lending Adviser remains somewhat clunky. It takes time to load a business's details on to the system so that its financial prospects can be analysed. At the outset, staff complained about the long wait before they could achieve anything useful. But this complaint proved short-lived, says Mr Fowler. Once information has been entered into Lending Adviser, it can be manipulated with remarkable speed. Financial ratios are calculated in an instant; "what if" scenarios model a firm's financial condition under varying assumptions, so as to probe for possible weaknesses. "The system", says Mr Fowler, "highlights the risks of each business, which is helpful to our customers as well as to us."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each time a customer is visited, the new information goes into a central file, so Barclays as an institution has a much clearer idea of the state of its loan portfolio than it did in the past. For instance, the bank can monitor how many of its borrowers might slip to a riskier grade. That knowledge can help it to plan its provisions against bad debts with greater accuracy. It can also price its lending to reflect its view of borrowers' riskiness. And the bank can use the information consciously to direct its lending away from particular risk grades. Because Barclays' loan book represents some 90,000 companies, it is a reasonable proxy for the state of the British economy. If its borrowers' finances are slipping, the chances are that the economy is slowing-- which would certainly shape lending policies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for the industry concentrations that so bedevilled the bank, these too can be avoided with Lending Adviser. Each borrower is classified by industry type, so it is a simple matter to calculate the bank's exposure in particular sectors. The bank can also be more selective and responsive in its lending. In time it might even be able to identify some of the things that distinguish its best lenders from the rest. It could then tweak its culture yet again to reinforce what it thinks are sound habits.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of this would have been impossible a few years ago. The bank had massive amounts of credit information, but only primitive mechanisms for pooling and collating it. True, Lending Adviser cannot do everything: it does not tell a lender that a particular loan should be sanctioned, nor does it tell managers precisely where the British economy stands in the economic cycle. But it does offer a tool for making better judgments based upon information the bank already has.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Barclays is not the only, or even the first, bank to have tried to codify the best elements of its lending culture by using information technology. But it is a striking example of how the introduction of technology into a previously established system can lead to significant, and often unexpected, cultural and operational changes. Whether the technology has also laid the ground for sounder lending policies will become clearer over the coming years.<p><b>Automatic pilot</B><br></b>One important change can already be noted. Aided by Lending Adviser, Barclays has fundamentally changed its business model for lending. Its central aim is no longer to lend as much as possible on the basis of its capital; but rather to lend only as it should according to its risk-pricing disciplines-- and to let that determine how much capital the bank needs. This new approach explains, for instance, the recent trend of share buy-backs among banks who realise they need less capital to make loans. Its significance, to banking and to the financing of industry, can hardly be overstated.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another example of how technology has penetrated to the heart of banks' lending business can be found in America. In recent years there has been much talk of disintermediation, under which competitive and technological changes do away with the need for established intermediaries. Banks have seen much of their business slip away, whether lending to companies that now tap capital markets direct, or gathering retail deposits that now pour into mutual and money-market funds.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet there was one area of banking that was supposed to be immune from such change: lending to small businesses. The reason was that the information required to make a success of such lending could be gathered only locally. Banks' branch networks apparently gave them an unassailable advantage over distant would-be lenders, while the customers were intrinsically too small to have direct access to the capital markets.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But now a new surge of small-business banking is changing this. With banks such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America in the vanguard, new techniques are breaking down barriers erected by geography. They are based upon lessons learnt from running huge portfolios of consumer loans, whether in credit-card operations or in more straightforward financings. The trick is to focus on volume and canny pricing rather than specific information. A small-business bank has a portfolio of loans, some of which can be expected to default. Instead of gathering detailed local information and hoping to exclude a good proportion of likely defaulters, why not use new technology to price a portfolio of national loans so that the bank can be indifferent to which particular borrowers will default&#063;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea is powerfully seductive to customers. Rather than go through lengthy and detailed loan applications locally, they can respond to solicitations for pre-approved lines of credit and have the finance in a matter of hours. They may pay a bit more in interest charges. But they gain a precious commodity for any harried small employer: time.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for the lenders, they incur none of the costs of a national presence--direct mail is a fine way to reach potential borrowers--and only a fraction of the costs of processing more detailed loan applications. Last year, for instance, Wells Fargo mailed some 5m loan solicitations in America. The forms asked only a few key questions designed to elicit relevant facts about the borrower: for example, a history of poor personal credit usually signals an undesirable business customer. The simplicity cuts processing costs to a minimum. So long as the bank gets its credit assessment and pricing right, then it should make money. In 1995 Wells Fargo earned a 32% return on equity on its small-business lending.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf5.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

The eponymous stockbroking firm he founded in 1974 was intended to take advantage of America's scrapping of fixed commissions in securities trading. He believed that consumers would be enticed by cut-price dealing. And he embraced technology and remote service-delivery as the means to a lower cost base. "We were a pure transaction company," he recalls.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For more than two decades Mr Schwab has had the satisfaction of watching his firm grow at an annual compound rate of more than 20%. It now has more than 3.8m active investor accounts. Yet Mr Schwab is not complacent. He declares recent technological developments to be miraculous. Innovations such as the Internet, voice recognition and faster communications have transformed what his and other firms can do for their customers. "For every call we get to do a transaction, we now get ten wanting some other service," says Mr Schwab.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rush of new services has been remarkable. An individual armed with a personal computer and modem can gain access to an astonishing array of price information and analytical software, often by tapping into a single Internet site. Much of the information that is now given away free of charge was only recently the privileged domain of giant financial firms and markets. This year has seen a race among brokers to offer on-line electronic share dealing services: e.Schwab now vies with, among others, e.trade and Lombard, two "virtual" discount-broking firms. Nowhere, it seems, is the shape of the future of finance more obvious.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pause for a moment, however. Charles Schwab was among the first of a new class of stockbrokers in the mid-1970s, the so-called discounters, which undercut the high charges imposed by established full service firms with their networks of brokers and their expensive research base. Not surprisingly, given their low prices, they quickly found a dedicated following. Nearly two decades later, however, discounters have a share of the retail market of only around 25% (big institutions still deal predominantly with full-service firms, though they often get discounted prices from them).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason for the discounters' failure to take over the retail market completely is nothing to do with technological shortcomings. Mr Schwab first offered an on-line trade order service more than a decade ago: "It was a horse and buggy compared to today's Internet services," he concedes, "but it worked." Yet it was not widely taken up. Many retail customers did not own a computer until recently, so were unimpressed by such a high-tech service: a case, perhaps, of cart before modem.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather, discounters have had limited success because they have focused on a commodity service, executing trades, that appealed strongly only to a minority of self-confident investors. Most retail customers wanted some advice as well as execution; that is why many remained with their traditional, more expensive, brokers, including Wall Street giants such as Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney.<p><b>A tidy bundle</b><br>These firms justify higher charges by offering such products as investment research and a personal relationship with a broker alongside order execution. That business model has proved just as resilient as that of bank branches. Mr Schwab, for one, does not expect it suddenly to dwindle. He is moving his firm up-market, away from straight execution and towards more valuable services such as investment planning and performance analytics.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because plenty of investors prefer traditional methods for making their trades, just as plenty of bank customers still wander into branches to write paper cheques, firms such as Schwab and Quick & Reilly themselves envisage keeping a blend of access points, mixing branches, 24-hour telephone centres and direct computer links. On-line accounts represent only around 1% of the total American brokerage market, reckons Diogo Teixeira of The Tower Group, a consulting firm. But, like many brokers, he thinks that the computer will take an increasing share.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Therein lies an important clue about how the business of stockbroking may develop. Accept that execution is akin to cheque-processing in banking: a necessary utility function that adds little value. How, then, can brokers make money&#063; One answer might be to control access to a vital ingredient such as price information. Organised financial exchanges and brokers have long known this. As Jay Smith, founder of Leading Market Technologies, a financial software firm, comments, "Many exchanges have in effect taxed access to price information rather than trading activity or volume."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But computer networks such as the Internet defy any institution's ability to monopolise information. In America upstart firms such as Quote.com already provide a bewildering array of information in return for a minuscule monthly subscription fee. Even the crusty London Stock Exchange has discovered the power of networking. Earlier this year it lost a court battle to prohibit real time electronic dissemination of its prices by Tradepoint, a rival share-trading organisation with little more than a few computers to its name (and which still has few trades to its credit). The whole point of network computing is that it costs almost nothing to distribute information.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That means that intermediaries such as stockbrokers must add value in some other way if they are to be useful to their customers. Logic points to those areas into which Mr Schwab and his sort are moving: financial planning, research and analysis.<br><b><p>Spot the difference<br></b>Discounters such as Quick & Reilly already offer investment software of astonishing power and flexibility. These days, offering customers analytics and access via a computer is seen as a standard service for brokers in America. As Peter Quick, president of Quick & Reilly, says, "The point is to make life easier for our customers." There is little to choose between their products and those of their more expensive rivals.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, in recent months those rivals have reluctantly felt bound to follow their competitors into cyberspace. In April Prudential Securities launched an on-line service allowing customers to review their accounts, check prices and exchange e mail with their stockbroker. Merrill Lynch launched a similar service last month. Neither allows investors to enter trading instructions remotely, however; orders must still be keyed in by a stockbroker.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, this jockeying is helping to erode any meaningful distinction between discount and full-service broking, reckons Ken Landes, a consultant with Coopers & Lybrand. If execution and price information are increasingly low-value commodity businesses, and if most brokers can offer snazzy software, what else might justify high brokers' fees&#063; Only two things spring to mind: research (that is, investment ideas) and better products (that is, proprietary funds or software analytics).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Plenty of investors might then ask an obvious question. What is, say, excellent research worth in itself&#063; That could be the key to unbundling traditional full-service broking. And if it is unbundled for retail customers, why not for institutional ones too&#063; There has already been pressure for more transparency, for instance over "soft" commissions which involve brokers giving computers and so forth to favoured clients.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Traditional firms with their heavy fixed costs will no doubt fight to keep customers in their traditional relationships. They may even use the same technologies that their competitors see as the key to their undoing. A traditional stockbroker often neglected some of his clients simply because he lacked the ability to keep track of more than, say, 40 people. Something as simple as e-mail can change that, according to Doug Alexander, president of Reality Online, a software firm: "Technology helps brokers to communicate faster and more easily with personalised e-mail for, say, a research idea on a share in which the customer has previously expressed interest." Add some modern portfolio tracking systems, and a diligent stockbroker might be able to manage the affairs of 300 people, not 40.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, as discount brokers have already discovered, investors change their habits only slowly, even when they are offered what appears to be a compelling deal. That is why, in the end, Mr Schwab is among those who are wary of predicting the speedy demise of traditional broking: "Change won't happen overnight, mostly because many more people have to understand that they now have new choices." Coopers' Mr Landes, however, thinks that the arrival of mature networking technology has fundamentally altered the economics of broking. He predicts traumatic competitive convulsions in the next few years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both men could be correct. Thanks to the impact of technology, stockbroking seems sure to change in major ways. Thanks to people and their persistent habits, it is hard to predict the timing of technology's impact. Thus, the idea of fully automated agents running people's portfolios in linked electronic financial markets may not be far-fetched; it is merely far off. How far off is hard to gauge. But judging by the speed with which the Internet is growing, it may be nearer than you might think.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf6.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

But the rapid evolution of cyberspace is recognised by most people as a change of great significance. In the space of a few weeks, firms have gone from obscurity to worldwide fame and riches. Spin-offs, start-ups, alliances, takeovers: all have been seen of late in the muddled and colliding worlds of virtual and terrestrial financial services.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the importance of cyberspace for finance cannot be assessed in isolation from the physical world. Is Security First, a pioneering virtual bank, a threat to Citibank, an established global consumer franchise&#063; Is Microsoft a potential rival or a necessary ally of today's banks&#063; Should Merrill Lynch and its sort fear Wit Capital, a cyberspace investment bank that is helping small companies to raise capital without paying fat fees to a Wall Street underwriter&#063; Does InsWeb, a virtual insurance marketplace, signal the end of the human insurance agent&#063; Will Mondex, a digital cash system, lose out to Visa's smart cards&#063;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such questions are among many raised by the obvious potential of electronic networks to upset the economics of today's sales and distribution mechanisms in finance. Secure information distribution is the key to cost-cutting. Smarter use of information is the key that will unlock new revenues. Firms that can successfully combine the two have a good future. Pure intermediaries will have a much more difficult time.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One problem is that nobody knows how the economics of cyberspace will develop. How will people behave&#063; Cyber-stores have discovered that consumers are happier buying some things than others. Wine and books sell; general household goods do not. Houses are scarcely in the picture, although cars have found a niche. Financial products are now making their appearance, with bank accounts and insurance policies at the forefront.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until people in large numbers exhibit preferences, what should would-be electronic salesmen do&#063; Usage of the Internet is growing fast, and its users are better-off, better-educated and younger than the average American (see <a href="tf6.gif">chart</a>), with all that promises for new business opportunities. But it will probably be a decade before the Net really counts. Security First, America's first federally insured virtual financial institution, is a case in point. From a standing start in October 1995 its deposits have shot up to around $14m this year. One analyst predicts that even a gradual slowdown to a merely opulent rather than explosive growth rate would still take its deposits to $400m by the beginning of 1999. But even then, the bank will scarcely dent America's existing banking market.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So those who would serve customers in cyberspace--whether as payment processors, credit-card brands or digital-money providers--all face a horrid dilemma. They know that if they race too fast to build infrastructures they might simply repeat past investment mistakes in technology. But they also know that cyberspace will eventually be like the real world, in that it will have room only for a few widely accepted and fungible systems. Most of today's names will surely lose out.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Financial-services firms are not good at coping with rapid change--or an uncertain future. Lewis Levin, who runs Microsoft's desk-top finance business, reckons that change so far has rattled many financial firms and caused them to look in the wrong direction for their competitors. "There has been plenty of sniping by financial institutions about technology companies trying to come into their business. But the real battle is between financial firms, some of which are already netting big gains from being better at deploying technology."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Levin is sceptical about the ability and desire of technology firms to compete with, say, banks: "Is Microsoft going to lend money&#063; Not likely. Will it try to gather assets&#063; I don't think so. Or manage assets&#063; Ditto. These are other firms' core skills." Scott Cook, chairman of Intuit, a leading financial software firm, echoes this view, noting that "lower distribution costs will have a dramatic effect on economics and on how and where people buy financial services. But the effect on whom you buy from will be less radical."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The banks are moving in. Already some 300 American banks have Internet sites; that number is expected to triple by next year and to double again by 1999. But, partly thanks to concerns about security on the Internet, only a few are offering more than information and simple inquiry facilities. Solutions to the security problem may continue to hold up Internet banking, though only for a short time. Within five years, a few hundred firms will be offering full banking services on the Internet.<br><b><p>Phoning home<br></b>One much-touted vision is that the Internet offers a chance to solve a long-standing problem: paying bills electronically. A pure electronic medium is technically and financially attractive for both billers and payers. However, as Bill Gorog, chairman of <font size=-1>US</font> Order, a specialist technology firm, points out, "There are already 30m people in America who use touch-tone telephones to check their account balances. If you want to encourage use of electronic channels for bill payments, then the telephone is already in most people's homes."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A new generation of smart telephones is appearing, pushed by telephone companies hoping that customers will buy additional services such as caller identification. These telephones contain a keyboard and enough computing power to ensure that a decade ago they would have passed for home computers. They can be used for everything from telephony to checking the weather forecast, trading shares and paying bills. And it is simple to equip them with a slot for reading and writing information on to a credit card equipped with a computer chip of its own. That information might be no more than a credit-card balance. But there is no reason why it should not be digital money. (See <a href="tf7.gif">chart</a>)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a natural combination of devices and explains why many observers think that the telephone will probably become an increasingly important channel for financial services. Some 40m telephones are sold annually in America. A range of super-smart telephones will reach shops later this year, selling for a fraction of the price of a home computer. The Internet must thus be set in some context. As Diogo Teixeira, of The Tower Group, comments, "Major event though it is, the Internet is only a small proportion of overall electronic channels in financial services."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider Britain, where Direct Line, a telephone-based insurer, grew from nothing to dominate the car-insurance market in the space of a few years; and First Direct, a telephone bank, served customers so much better than traditional banks that it changed the whole industry. Sharelink, a telephone stockbroker that fell on hard times and has since been acquired by Charles Schwab, also had a big initial impact on its industry. Internet firms might have similar effects in years to come. But until computers are in every home, they will fight against other mass electronic channels.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is indeed plenty of room for those other channels to increase their impact on financial services. Mr Gorog says that electronic bill-payment is at a similar stage to electronic credit-card authorisations in the early 1980s. The technical solution was available as early as 1981; it brought down the cost of an authorisation to 15 cents, compared with 55 cents for the manual process. Yet, reluctant to invest in equipment, banks and merchants took years to embrace the electronic channel, delaying its ubiquity until the late 1980s.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly today, there are few technological barriers to electronic payments. But there are quirky hurdles of the kind that often slow down progress. For instance, behind many supposed "electronic" bill-payment services stand armies of cheque-writers who generate the paper payments that must reach billers. The reason&#063; Many billers are reluctant to accept electronic payments because their systems are built around capturing customer information from the magnetic ink printed on cheques. Firms such as <font size=-1>US</font> Order are finding a ready market for computers designed to stand between billers and such payment networks as those owned by Visa and MasterCard, translating instructions into forms acceptable to both sides. Meanwhile the postal system remains clogged with bills moving back and forth.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet, then, is likely to be only one of several channels through which customers do electronic business with financial-service providers. Its existence has certainly accelerated the development of electronic payments systems, although these are being designed to work across several channels rather than solely in cyberspace. As Intuit's Mr Cook concludes, "We're probably talking about a decade or two before we will see significantly new ways of doing things."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In one crucial respect, however, the Internet remains different from what has gone before. It is the medium which is helping to make information available in previously opaque industries. It allows people (including those who run financial firms) to compare prices and providers, to scrutinise what once they would have meekly accepted. In time it will probably develop into a formidable marketplace in which digital money, paperless transactions and instant flows of information combine in compelling simplicity.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One possibility raised by the sudden ubiquity of cheap and immediate price information is that exchanges will increasingly find themselves out of a job. Some firms, such as Merrill Lynch and Fidelity, are so large that they almost constitute exchanges themselves. In America, electronic systems such as Instinet (a subsidiary of Reuters) that automatically match buy and sell orders have found ready acceptance by large institutional investors. The tiny Arizona Stock Exchange is an electronic securities market which fails to match 95% of the orders placed there, but which has minimal operating costs and recently opened a window on to the Internet. It is a small leap to imagine financial markets that directly connect buyers and sellers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, exchanges offer one vital advantage over existing electronic markets: liquidity. The ability to deal in rough market conditions is a crucial one to investors and is the one feature guaranteed by the professionals who trade on exchanges. With reduced liquidity, investors face far greater uncertainty. In itself, the ability to see prices is a welcome innovation. But it does not outweigh the reassurance of the ability to deal in bad times.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, in time, exchanges themselves have the option of dismantling their physical infrastructure and moving the liquidity they represent into cyberspace. If new electronic competitors appear which, by attracting sufficient business, threaten entire physical markets, then this may well be what happens. But this is likely to be a gradual process.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just exchanges that are challenged by the rise of the Internet and other electronic ways of doing business. So are their regulators. Indeed, regulatory interference is easily the greatest threat to the potential of electronic commerce and finance. Cyberspace will need regulation in some form, if only in its legal codes and transaction protocols that will require trusted referees. It would be a shame, however, if today's regulators hindered tomorrow's markets by jumping in before they understand what they are doing.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf7.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

For the fancy stuff, visit one of Wall Street's trading rooms. Amid the din and bustle it is striking that machines are omnipresent: telephones for barking orders, screens for watching data, televisions for absorbing news.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only a few years ago, trading rooms were still relatively primitive. Many consisted of little more than banks of desks with telephones, each with a screen hired expensively from a data provider such as Reuters or Telerate. Traders scribbled orders on paper slips that were passed to back office for confirmation and settlement. Because market data was costly, only big firms could afford to buy it. They competed with gusto, buying mainframe computers and manipulating masses of data to try to create a trading advantage.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These days, high finance has gone high-tech. Data is much cheaper. Vendors such as Reuters, Knight-Ridder and Bloomberg allow firms to feed all their information into open computer systems. There it can be analysed at will. Mathematicians and quantum physicists have taken seats once occupied by seat-of-the-pants barrow boys. Head traders talk fondly of their "black boxes", proprietary engines that run trading portfolios of great complexity. Some trading rooms have gone so far as to automate order flows; J.P. Morgan's equity trading works in a seamless electronic environment.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Over the past decade trading instruments have multiplied too. Derivatives have gone from obscurity to ubiquity (with occasional infamy along the way). Swaps, already a big business by the mid 1980s, have since exploded into an enormous one and are now indispensable to corporate finance. Financial firms are using improved telecommunications to run their operations continuously, passing trading positions from one time-zone to another.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These changes have sent powerful shocks into other financial businesses. Fund management, for instance, has been turned upside down by derivatives, for these allow managers to do such unprecedented things as hedging specific bets, investing internationally or tying their fortunes to a stockmarket index. Funds can invest in a much wider variety of liquid assets than a few years ago using a technique known as "securitisation" that pools assets such as credit-card receivables into securities that can be sold to investors.On the face of it, it might seem that technology has already had its biggest impact on Wall Street. Not so, says Jay Smith, whose firm, Leading Market Technologies, supplies analytical software for traders. As the advantage of simply owning data has shrunk, firms have embraced a "smart weapons" strategy in search of the best applications. Hence the huge demand for people skilled at analysing data sets. "There is an arms race among a financial elite," says Mr Smith. "The weapons range from hiring the best quantitative brains to building the most flexible and helpful software platforms."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One effect has been that big financial firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have acquired huge appetites for both historical and real time data. Increasingly, they are building high speed databanks on their own premises and asking vendors to supply them with entire databases.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What they do with all this data provides another reason for thinking that technology has far from run its course in Wall Street. By analysing price series, firms hope to find relationships that link one asset's future performance to another's. They also test statistical properties such as price volatility-- not hard for a single fixed-rate bond, but tricky for a 30-year mortgage bond, and devilish for an entire portfolio of such instruments. These efforts may be part of a complex attempt to model how a financial market works, or how a portfolio might respond to changes in interest rates. That takes a phenomenal amount of computing power.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The detail of what big trading firms do may be daunting, but the principle is less so. Financial models represent the intellectual software of finance. The model-builders are trying to write programs that confer a competitive advantage over other firms. Advantage was once derived by getting data faster than rivals. These days, the advantage lies in the brainpower and associated computing power that firms can mobilise. It is no longer the receipt of data that determines which firm uses it most profitably; instead it might be how quickly a firm spots a pricing anomaly hiding in a data series. Wall Street firms vie with military defence laboratories not just for the brightest <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font>s, but also for the lead in technologies that make possible the easy visualisation of large amounts of data.<br><b><p>The risk factor<br></b>The spread of ever more sophisticated high technology across Wall Street offers one big reason for concluding that intellectual progress in finance is far from slowing down. Indeed, there are signs of the opposite. Modern finance is based upon a body of theory invented largely since the second world war.  But most of the theory's neat equations make assumptions that are impossible in the real world, so there is a constant tension between the theoretical underpinnings and the daily practice of finance.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One area where this tension has been fruitful is that of risk management. As firms have built huge trading operations, they have assumed complex interlocking exposures. Some financial instruments, particularly options, are notoriously difficult to price, simple formulae notwithstanding. Yet a firm might hold a trading book made up of thousands of different options. Assuming that it can aggregate its positions across possibly dozens of different trading books, what is its overall risk&#063; The answer clearly calls for both technical and computational skills. But it also requires a judgmental sense of risk that can differ from one institution to another. This has proved a catalyst for a new revolution in finance.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ron Dembo, who runs Algorithmics, a specialist risk-management software firm based in Toronto, is among those bridging the divide between financial theory and practice. He questions some established risk-management techniques, particularly a common approach known as Value at Risk (<font size=-1>VAR</font>). <font size=-1>VAR</font> was embraced by bankers and their regulators because it offers a measure of a firm's overall exposure to market risk. And it is indeed useful for understanding how much a given instrument or portfolio might lose or gain over a period of time.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But according to Mr Dembo, <font size=-1>VAR</font> has several serious drawbacks. One is that it relies heavily on past volatility as a guide to future volatility. Yet this has been shown to be a poor predictor of a portfolio's actual behaviour. A second objection is that the technique is of limited use at a strategic level, for it does not allow meaningful comparisons across financial markets and is therefore no help for the allocation of capital.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To understand this, consider two trading desks, each with a standard measured <font size=-1>VAR</font> of $10m. One desk deals in New Zealand equities, the other in American Treasuries. Are these operations equally risky&#063; Certainly not, says Mr Dembo. Each market is different, not least in liquidity. The future behaviour of risk factors (yields, correlations) and their volatility also differs in each market. In other words, risk depends on more than just historic correlations: it depends on the period over which it is measured and the trader's corresponding assessment of, say, a market's liquidity.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This problem is familiar to fund managers. To measure performance across markets they long ago invented benchmarks, typically an index, which reflect the peculiarities of each market. Mr Dembo argues that traders should be measured similarly; it so happens that Algorithmics has built software to do just this. In every market there is an almost riskless trade that will yield a small but positive return. That trade should be a natural benchmark against which a trader's actual transactions can be measured. Obviously if a firm chooses a benchmark trade with a high expected return, then a trader must assume more risk if he is to perform in line. Thus this approach recognises different appetites for risk. And it captures otherwise elusive factors such as liquidity risk and how this varies over time.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Algorithmics' conceptual breakthrough was to realise that many of the benchmarks adopted by businesses (including financial ones) are too inflexible to be good measures of either risk or performance. For instance, many firms adopt a fixed target for annual return on equity. Yet an appropriate measure should recognise that changing market conditions can mean that what was a fine return at one moment might be poor at another. A useful benchmark should reflect that.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best way to measure traders' performance across different markets is to measure them against the different benchmarks appropriate to those markets. The consequences of doing this with <font size=-1>VAR</font> are profound. For one thing, a trading operation can construct performance measures and comparisons that make it easier to assess individuals as well as to run the business with the right amount of capital. That is a crucial step in risk management, for firms today still have little clear idea of whether they are allocating too little capital (perhaps exposing themselves to ruin) or too much (wasting resources).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, it redefines risk, for risk now becomes the risk of underperforming the benchmark. Mr Dembo calls this Benchmark Value at Risk (<font size=-1>B-VAR</font>). Because it is based on guessing and then formalising sensible likely future courses for each benchmark, it is a mixture of the judgmental and the quantitative that mirrors the real world far better than approaches that do little more than extrapolate the past into the future.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a strange twist, Mr Dembo's use of 'regret' has a striking and supportive parallel in mainstream economic theory. Economists have long wrestled with the distinction between risk based upon known probabilities and uncertainty where the future is unknowable. How should people make decisions in the latter condition&#063;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Decision theorists have introduced the notion of a regret matrix. In simple terms, this involves organising a set of possible outcomes and then analysing how you will feel if a particular outcome were to come to pass. For that set of outcomes which seem likely and would make you particularly uncomfortable, you might choose to reduce your uncertainty by buying more or less insurance. Of course, decision theory does not create certainty out of uncertainty. But it is a powerful way of organising information and informing choices.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It should be obvious that an economist's regret matrix is a neat analogue of Mr Dembo's suggestion that financial firms should measure how bad they would feel if they were to underperform a chosen benchmark. In his case, however, scarce economic capital replaces hurt feelings.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Drzik, a consultant with Oliver, Wyman, endorses such an approach. He argues that there has been an intellectual shift in the market away from simple approaches to risk questions. "Attempts to aggregate risk in ways that capture the subtleties in positions and portfolios are more expensive," he says, "but they give a much more accurate reflection of reality than formula-based linear methods."<p><b>Less of the same</b><br>If regret is one example of how finance is proving to be a dynamic discipline, it is far from isolated. Another fundamental issue at the heart of modern finance is replication. "All pricing is based on something else you know how to price," says Mr Dembo. For example, a bank might price an option by constructing a group of simpler instruments which, when combined, behave in the same way.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, apply this idea to the question of whether a bank is operating a trading book efficiently. What if the bank could find an equivalent but mu It is insights such as Mr Dembo's which support this survey's claim that finance's intellectual revolution is still in its early phases. Some will argue that this "software" is not technology at all, but simple evidence of human ingenuity. However, none of it would be possible without the broader infrastructure of modern technology. And in so far as it relies upon fast and reliable computation as its practical foundation, intellectual software is inseparable from the microchips which give it life.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="tf8.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

As well as a talking shop, it is a laboratory, devised by Andersen Consulting, that offers an evolving display of new financial technologies. Visiting managers can thrill at a futuristic Internet shopping mall, gawp at a smart phone on the back of an airline seat, watch a high tech call-centre being put through its paces. Gathered in one place, the technology is impressive. So is the message it conveys. Where once each new box of financial technology tricks was a stand-alone marvel, the emphasis now is on how things fit together. Customers are a constant presence. How will this instrument be used&#063; By how many&#063; How can this tool improve what our business offers&#063;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As this survey has shown, the scope of technology in finance is immense. And looking beyond its extensive and fast-growing use by finance, technology is now fundamentally changing the way that business is run. Suddenly and at different rates, geographies are breaking down, business models are eroding, and customers are acquiring new power. Firms that have embraced technology are seeing their businesses shift in unpredicted directions as benefits accrue in unexpected ways. How machines are used is generally far more important than the technical niceties of this model or manufacturer versus that one.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some common themes stand out. The ability to store and manipulate data has become a key competitive weapon, putting dumb data-processing in the shade. Capital, which used to define banks' ability to lend, now limits only their ability to invest in ways to lend more intelligently. Firms such as Citibank fret more about whether their credit-card data systems are up to scratch than about the size of their balance sheets. Physical networks, which used to define insurers' and brokers' reach, have been thrown into turmoil by virtual alternatives that can be delivered down telephone and modem lines. Established financial brands are under threat from unlikely rivals, such as supermarkets and consumer goods firms, as well as from technologically savvier newcomers. Mathematics has moved from being an eccentric companion to being an essential helpmate of modern finance.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the implications of oMoreover, the implications of one industry's changes go far beyond its boundaries. As financial firms discover and improve new ways of conducting commerce, their efforts will spread across entire economies. Money in all its forms is capitalism's essential lubricant. More efficient uses and transmissions of money are not ends in themselves. Banks that can lend better may alter the behaviour of customers who can borrow better. Clamour from small investors who want venture-capital returns will alter how companies fund themselves, and perhaps alter the nature of ownership. Better risk management will strengthen firms' defences, but might also allow them to use capital more efficiently, producing inflation-free economic benefits. Developing countries that can buy off-the-shelf electronic stock exchanges might unleash social changes far faster than anyone predicts. Cheap electronic channels and the automation of benefit and health-care systems may allow poor people a chance to bank and The convergence of powerful information and communications technologies is the enabling force for all of this. But it is how people behave that will ultimately be the decisive force shaping how the finance industry changes. As finance is digitised, each and every one of its products will be expressed in binary code, including money itself. Customers should benefit from that change. The business battle for the future will then be how to turn all those digits into dollars.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?846288000,sur">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<H1>All Tories now </H1>

<P><I>Labour and the Tories have much in common these days. For one thing,
neither party offers Britain the ideas it needs </I><p >

MUCH should be at stake in Britain's forthcoming general election. The
Conservative Party has been in power for the past 17 years, first under
Margaret Thatcher, then under John Major, and the country has changed profoundly
as a result. Now the long Tory reign seems about to end. A revitalised
Labour Party, led by Tony Blair, offers a new vision, and has a commanding
lead in the opinion polls. Politics is uncertain, of course--in 1992 the
polls confidently predicted a Labour victory--but such is Labour's lead
this time, such the Tories' unpopularity, that it would be remarkable rather
than merely surprising if Mr Major were returned to Downing Street.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, therefore, the next election will indeed mark a turning-point
in British politics, no less than the election that first brought Margaret
Thatcher to power? Until recently, Labour was unelectable; now it seems
unstoppable. But whichever party wins, voters are about to choose for the
first time in nearly 20 years between electorally viable yet strongly contrasting
ideas about how the country should be governed. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is how it ought to be. If you take the parties strictly at their
word, however, it isn't so. Judged by what the Tories have done and by
what Labour promises to do, surprisingly little appears to be at stake.
Voters, it seems, will soon be asked to choose between five more years
of conservatism under John Major and five more years of conservatism under
Tony Blair. What makes New Labour unstoppable is that it has turned Tory.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Blair's admirers would say that this is nonsense. New Labour, they
point out, repudiates the Tories' record. Mr Blair says that the Conservatives
have spent their time in power not merely governing badly but &quot;tearing
apart the fabric of the nation&quot;. Tory policies have favoured the lucky
few. The less fortunate, those least able to take care of themselves, have
paid the price. Public services have been starved of resources; the welfare
state has come under withering attack. The Tories stand for ruthless individualism;
man's better instincts, his need for community and for social cohesion,
have been denied or denigrated. Slavish regard for market forces has replaced
industrial policy. The rights of workers have been trampled. Britain's
manufacturing industries have shrivelled. Privatisation was a fraud on
taxpayers and consumers. The rich have prospered: the poor, the hopeless,
the insecure and the unemployed have multiplied. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain, says Labour, has become a coarser and crueller place. The Tories
have diminished the country economically and morally. What will New Labour
do? It will start to put all this right. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Labour's description of the Tory legacy were true, and if Labour
really meant to do something about it, drastic measures would indeed be
required. The distance between the Tories' policies and Labour's radical
new alternative would be great. The fate of the country really would hinge
on the next election. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But consider Mr Blair's most definitive statement of policy to date:
&quot;New Labour, New Life for Britain&quot;, the party's provisional manifesto.
Acknowledging--no, emphasising--that Labour used to make promises that
neither the party nor the electorate expected it to keep, Mr Blair takes
care to promise less, while challenging voters to hold him to his word.
These little promises, &quot;New Labour's early pledges&quot;, have been
printed on little cards, which sceptics are being urged to keep by them,
the better to check up on New Labour in power. The cards promise that Labour
will:&nbsp;</P>

<LI>cut class sizes for five-, six and seven-year-olds to 30 or less, using
money saved from phasing out the assisted-places scheme (subsidies for
children attending private schools);&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>halve the time between arrest and punishment for persistent young offenders;&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>treat an extra 100,000 patients in the National Health Service by saving
&pound;100m on red tape;&nbsp;provide jobs or training for 250,000 people
under 25, paid for by a &quot;windfall tax&quot; on the utilities;&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>set tough rules for public spending, to keep inflation and interest
rates low. </LI>

<P>For the moment, do not ask whether these promises make sense. Never
mind whether the savings from the assisted-places scheme would pay for
smaller class sizes; whether faster punishment for some offenders would
mean slower punishment for others; how, exactly, the <FONT SIZE=-1>NHS</FONT>
money is to be saved; how a once-and-for-all tax can finance an ongoing
expense, or whether the utilities will raise prices (a tax on consumers)
in order to recoup it. Never mind, for the moment, whether Labour can keep
its most important promise, to curb public spending. Instead merely weigh
the five promises against, as Labour would have it, those pitiless years
of fabric-tearing. The analysis and the prescriptions are orders of magnitude
apart. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as though Boris Yeltsin, promising
to dismantle Soviet central planning, had announced a small cut in the
staff of Gosplan, to be phased in over five years; or as if Nelson Mandela,
promising to erase the legacy of apartheid, had said that efficiency savings
in school administration would be used to buy books (really quite a lot
of books) for black children. Mr Blair's modest pledges are what you would
expect of an incumbent government fighting on a steady-as-she-goes platform.
Not only that, the policies are Tory-hued: with the possible exception
of the first (phasing out assisted places) none would be out of place in
the next Conservative manifesto. The fifth, and much the most important,
pledge--the promise to contain public spending-- will certainly be in it.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Labour says, or implies, that
it will do many other things too. There is no British problem, real or
imagined, that Mr Blair does not promise to address. But firm-sounding
commitments (already less than &quot;pledges&quot;, you understand) are
becoming less firm. The promise to introduce a minimum wage, for instance,
has been hedged by a plan to refer practical questions (including whether
the minimum would be high enough to raise anybody's pay) to an inquiry.
Even on constitutional reform--the only significant exception to the view
that New Labour offers a Tory programme--the promise to create a Scottish
parliament with tax raising powers in the first year of a new government
has been softened by a promise to have a referendum on the subject. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these vaguer goals, aims, challenges,
commitments and assorted non-pledges, so far as they mean anything, actually
out-Tory the Tories. The proto-manifesto calls for quicker ways to sack
teachers who are not up to the job; for benefits to be withdrawn from unemployed
people who refuse training or a job; for new controls on noisy neighbours,
truants and children out at night. There are plenty of leftist-sounding
half-promises too, suitably dressed up in anti-Tory rhetoric, but these
are consistently the vaguest non-pledges of all. Labour says it will develop
a &quot;successful and modern industrial policy&quot;. So it should, you
might think, if the supposed devastation of British industry is to be repaired.
But what this policy would actually do (apart from introducing &quot;tough
rules on the non payment of small-business debt&quot;) remains unclear.
</P>

<P><B>Let every rule be a tough rule<BR>
</B>Occasionally, and cautiously, New Labour still applies the word &quot;socialism&quot;
to its ideas. Judged by his pledges and non-pledges, suitably discounted,
Mr Blair is certainly no socialist. Were it not for constitutional reform,
the question would be: is he anything more than a one-nation Tory in denial?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Blair were indeed only a remodelled
Edward Heath, that might not be such a bad thing. Nor, for that matter,
would it subtract very much from his achievement in changing the Labour
Party. Judged on policy, Bleathism would undoubtedly be preferable to the
backward and in places absurd Labour programme it has replaced. In electoral
terms, moreover, it may be exactly what the country wants. A great deal
of evidence--starting with the margin that pollsters add to the Conservatives'
count to reflect the shame people feel at supporting them-- suggests that
the median British voter is indeed a Tory who dares not speak his name.
Give us low taxes, he pleads, but save us from our guilt. New Labour is
listening. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let nobody say that this transformation
of Labour was a small or timid thing. If Mr Blair has done nothing but
shift his party to the ground occupied by the Tories before 1979, that
is a remarkable achievement, albeit one he is unwilling to boast about.
Three years ago, who could have imagined Labour's old socialist soldiers--the
David Blunketts, Clare Shorts and John Prescotts--preaching enterprise
and incentives? Never mind their embarrassment: they are doing it. This
was a feat that required of Mr Blair all the authoritarian brutality and
tactical guile of a Margaret Thatcher. No wonder she admires him. This
extraordinary politician might even be able to prevent Labour in power
drifting back to the space it has vacated in opposition. </P>

<P><B>Breaking the mould, etc<BR>
</B>As you would expect, Mr Blair has anticipated this line of attack (if
that is what it is). New Labour says, and Mr Blair may well believe, that
it is much more than old Tory. The reformers dismiss any effort to locate
New Labour on the traditional left-right spectrum: such thinking is simply
pass&eacute;. &quot;New Labour is neither old left nor new right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
We offer a new way ahead, that leads from the centre, but is profoundly
radical in the changes it promises&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The individual
does best within a strong and unified society, where we acknowledge that
success depends not just on the striving of the individual but on working
together. seeks to apply that principle entirely afresh to a different
and changing world.&quot; <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this appeal to the role of &quot;society&quot;
(contrasting with Margaret Thatcher's memorable claim that there is no
such thing) and in the emphasis he places on notions such as &quot;community&quot;
and &quot;stakeholder&quot;, Mr Blair appears to believe he has a big new
idea, one that transcends old political categories. So he asks to be judged
not just on his pledges and non-pledges, which are only work in progress
after all, but by this larger organising vision and where it might lead.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tories have failed on their own terms,
argue New Labour's radical centrists: they have failed to create a dynamic
economy. But, unlike the Tories, New Labour understands why they have failed.
The conditions of success, even success defined as narrowly as the Tories
have defined it, include a sympathetic understanding of the social roots
of prosperity, and the state's role in tending them. This is where constitutional
reform comes in. Only by aiming for a broader idea of success, one that
gives communities a voice and makes social cohesion a top priority, can
Britain hope to succeed in material terms. Community and enterprise are
not pulling in opposite directions, as both the Tories and old Labour believed:
the truth is that neither can succeed without the other. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such wispy, consoling talk really isn't new,
although enough time has passed since 1979 to make it seem so. But put
the question of provenance to one side. What matters is whether Labour's
new (to them) vision makes better sense than the Tory alternative, such
as it is--or whether different ideas altogether are the best way forward.
Have the Tories failed to create a more dynamic economy? If so, was it
because of their narrow-minded concentration on the individual and neglect
of society at large? Perhaps New Labour is half-right: perhaps a more dynamic
economy has been achieved, but at too high a social cost. What are the
policies that Britain needs now to address the Tories' failures? <BR>

<H1>The state we're really in </H1>

<P><I>The past 17 years have done the British economy a power of good</I>
</P>

<P>CRITICS of the government's economic record have plenty of material
to work with. Since 1979 Britain has suffered two severe recessions. When
Margaret Thatcher took office, 1.2m (just 4% of the labour force) were
out of work; now the total stands at 2.1m (nearly 8%). The rise in long-term
unemployment, especially damaging both socially and economically, has been
far greater. On average, the economy has grown by about 1.9% a year since
1979. That is faster than the growth of 1.5% a year between 1973 and 1979,
but not much so, particularly when you recall that during the earlier period
the economy was hit by two oil-price shocks. Between 1960 and 1973, the
economy grew at a little over 3% a year. So much for the Thatcher miracle.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain's overall economic performance has been poor not only in relation
to its own past, Labour argues, but also in relation to the record of other
countries. Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, never tire
of pointing out that since 1979 the economy has fallen from 13th to 18th
in &quot;the global prosperity league&quot; (see <A HREF="chart1.gif">chart
1</A>). This, they say, is the price that Britain has paid under the Tories
for bad macroeconomic management, persistently low investment and a chronically
underskilled workforce. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at a detailed balance-sheet of economic success and failure
is a complicated business: there will always be plenty of room for disagreement.
However, even allowing for that, Labour's broad assessment of the Tory
years is grossly misleading. The crucial point is that the trend of economic
growth has slowed in almost all industrial countries since the mid-1970s--but
the slowdown in Britain has been very much milder than almost anywhere
else. That may sound like a puny achievement. It is anything but. Until
about 1979, Britain's economic decline relative to other countries was
precipitous; since then, the decline has been arrested, and there are now
signs that Britain is improving its position. If so, no other British government
in modern times can claim as much. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the view that Britain's relative decline has stopped be reconciled
with the further slippage down Labour's &quot;prosperity league&quot;? There
are several difficulties with that measure. One is that the top of the
table now includes Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, countries that were
all below Britain in 1979. It is a pity that Britain has done badly relative
to those three stars--but the same is true of most other industrial countries
and all other European ones (ie, those which may best be compared with
Britain). <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem is that the measure ignores demography: a country with
a fast-growing population of people over 60, such as Britain, is bound
to suffer in a comparison based on an aggregate measure of output. Third,
the table is sensitive to the estimated &quot;purchasing-power&quot; exchange
rates which are used to convert prices. Where countries are closely clustered
together, as they are at Britain's rank, changes in position mean little.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A far better measure of economic performance is growth in labour productivity--that
is, in output per worker. The ability of any economy to deliver long-term
improvements in pay and living standards boils down to this. Faster growth
in output per worker is the ultimate standard by which any economy should
be judged<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 30 years to 1979, <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT> per worker grew much
more slowly in Britain than in most other industrial countries. Over the
period as a whole, Britain's productivity growth was only two-thirds the
average achieved by 12 comparable industrial countries, and in the 1970s
the gap widened appreciably. (Between 1973 and 1979, average productivity
growth in the 12 countries was 2.2% a year; in Britain, it was barely half
that, at 1.3% a year.) For three decades, in other words, Britain suffered
relative--and accelerating--economic decline. In the ten years after 1979,
in contrast, its productivity growth was slightly better than average (1.7%
against 1.6%). Instead of lagging behind almost everybody, Britain was
at last keeping pace. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="chart2.gif">Chart 2</A> on the next page shows this improvement
in <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT> per worker alongside two other measures: growth
in <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT> per person and growth in &quot;total factor
productivity&quot; (which measures how well the economy is using both labour
and capital). They tell a similar story of arrested decline--and, just
possibly, renaissance. Even more striking than these whole-economy measures
are the figures for productivity in manufacturing (see <A HREF="chart1.gif">chart
3</A>). Manufacturing output per worker grew more slowly in Britain between
1960 and 1973, and between 1973 and 1979, than in almost every comparable
country. In 1979-94, it went up faster than in all but one: Japan. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures accord with the voluminous, albeit unsystematic, testimony
of factory-floor anecdote. Almost anybody who works in one will say that
Britain's factories and offices are much better run and very much more
productive than they were in the late 1970s<B>--</B>and many will say that
the change since then has been revolutionary rather than evolutionary.
Nonetheless, when the improvement in productivity first began to register
statistically in the mid-1980s, many dismissed the numbers as a mirage.
In particular, it was argued that just as a cricket team can raise its
batting average by fielding only its best few batsmen, so an economy can
increase its output per worker by forcing its least productive workers
on to the dole. And just as a cricket team scores fewer runs in total with
this strategy, so an economy is worse off if it does the same. It is obviously
better that relatively unproductive workers do something, however little
(and even if their small output drags down output per worker), than nothing
at all. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument is still advanced to belittle the Tories' success on productivity.
Though quite correct in principle, it is no longer at all plausible in
practice. Britain's improvement in productivity was sustained during the
fall in unemployment of the late 1980s, and beyond. Moreover, compared
with other European countries, Britain has since continued to combine good
growth in output per worker with relatively low unemployment. All this
implies that the anecdotes are right, and the improvement in productivity
of the Thatcher-Major years is real.</P>

<P><B>Causes and symptoms <BR>
</B>This is not to say it will continue indefinitely. How lasting an improvement
it proves to be, and what it will come to mean for future living standards,
will depend on exactly why productivity has increased. A first possibility
to consider is taxes. Tories, the &quot;party of low taxation&quot;, would
love to claim that steady progress in cutting public spending and taxes
had spurred enterprise and worked a supply side miracle, as they long argued
it would. Unfortunately, the numbers make this awkward. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, the government has reformed taxes in
a variety of ways that, it would argue, have improved incentives and promoted
effort: the cut in top rates of income tax from 83% to 60%, and then to
40%; the shift from direct taxes (notably income tax) to indirect ones
(notably value-added tax); and so on. These changes, especially the cut
in top rates, presumably helped. But the fact remains that the aggregate
burden of taxation, which is what matters most, has hardly changed. In
1979, the government collected 35.5% of national income in taxes; in 1995,
the proportion was actually 36%. (Public borrowing was also about the same
in both years.) <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with productivity, this sort of comparison
understates the Tories' achievement somewhat. Until 1979, the trend of
taxation was relentlessly upward; if the trend estimated over the period
1965-79 had continued for the past 17 years, taxation would now stand at
41% of <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT>. Merely curbing this rise in taxes took
some doing--which is why complaints about the spending &quot;cuts&quot;
that made it possible have some substance. Nonetheless, the fact that taxes
failed to decline as the government had hoped means that the improvement
in productivity has to be accounted for in some other way. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else might explain? it Does it, for instance,
reflect a once-and-for-all improvement in working practices, or a persisting
change in the ability of businesses to adapt to new conditions? Perhaps
both, but the more it is the latter the more optimistic one is entitled
to be about the economy's prospects. It is too soon to say for certain,
but there are grounds for thinking that the second kind of change is a
good part of the story. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odd as it will seem to those subscribing
to the orthodox account of Tory depredations, one of these grounds for
optimism is the progress that has been made in the quantity, if not the
quality, of education. For all the failings of British schools, especially
primary schools, education has improved in at least one measurable way
since the Conservatives took office--indeed, it has been transformed. In
1979 13% of recent school-leavers (that is, people aged 16-19, not in full-time
education) had no educational or vocational qualifications whatever. By
1995 that proportion had fallen to 8%. The proportion of people with a
first or higher degree more than doubled, from 4% to 10%. So did the proportion
of young people with some form of intermediate qualification, which went
up from 33% in 1984 to 52% last year. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly, again, this reflects demography.
Mainly, though, it reflects a big increase in the rate at which school-leavers
have enrolled in further education. The proportion of 16-year-olds in full-time
education has increased from less than half to more than three-quarters
in the past 17 years--a huge expansion. If you believe that a more educated
workforce is a more productive workforce (as New Labour certainly does),
you would certainly expect such an increase to be yielding an economic
benefit. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the expansion of further education
is unlikely to be the main cause of better productivity. That is because,
of all the difficulties that have beset the British economy since 1945,
one towers above the rest, even above the question of skills: industrial
relations. In meeting this challenge, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher
were at their most radical. </P>

<H1>The Thatcher revolution </H1>

<P><I>The Tories' greatest achievements were to crush the unions and sell
the nationalised industries</I> <BR>
</P>

<P>BRITAIN'S greatest post-war economic problem, to which many other failures
can be traced, was its system of organised labour. The results of this
system were the symptoms of what by 1979 was known worldwide as the &quot;British
disease&quot;: industrial disruption on an epic scale, a persistent tendency
to wage inflation, chronic backwardness in production and management, low
investment, arthritic rigidity in the face of economic change, demarcation
disputes raised to an art form, stone-clad resistance to new ideas, managers
who did not manage and workers who, it seemed, seldom worked. You might
argue that against this background Britain's productivity record between
1950 and 1979 was actually quite impressive. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Nicholas Oulton of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research points out, the defects in Britain's system of labour relations
were both entrenched and unusual--a compound of three distinct elements.
First, union membership was high: in 1979, more than half of all employees
were in a union. Second, Britain's unions had developed a dual system of
bargaining, with negotiations over pay and conditions conducted not only
at plant level by local shop stewards but also nationally by the union's
central officers. Third, unions were organised not by company or industry,
but by &quot;craft&quot; (ie, occupation). Often, any given negotiation
in any given company would therefore involve many different unions. In
1980 nearly 40% of large firms (that is, firms with more than 2,000 workers)
had to deal with six or more manual workers' unions. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this complicated and strife-prone structure was added a range of
legal immunities that were extremely generous by international standards
(and which, by the way, seriously infringed individual liberties). For
instance, secondary picketing-- when a union disrupts work at firms not
directly connected with its dispute in order to put further pressure, sometimes
through political channels, on employers--is subject to civil and even
criminal penalties in many countries. Britain's law protected it, and the
unions resorted to it routinely. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 1979 no British government had dared to face down the unions,
though most (old Labour and Tory alike) had known it needed to be done.
Margaret Thatcher's government took up the challenge, and how. With the
brutal clarity Mrs Thatcher brought to such matters, the unions were no
longer seen as a partner to be coaxed or even arm-twisted into greater
co-operation, but as an enemy to be smashed. And smashed they were, to
an extent that would have seemed incredible in the 1970s. <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successive rounds of industrial-relations laws severely restricted the
unions' immunities. Their right to recognition was curbed, the closed shop
and secondary picketing were outlawed, the freedom of unions to call strikes
was narrowed (for instance, by a requirement that a secret ballot of the
members be called first). In all cases, infringement exposed the unions
to severe civil penalties. In 1984, in an event of enormous symbolic importance,
the government took on the union that had paralysed the country and broken
Edward Heath's administration in 1974--the National Union of Mineworkers--and,
thanks partly to the incompetence of the union's leadership, crushed it. <BR>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Union membership fell from more than half of the workforce in 1979 to
less than a third in 1995. The number of firms recognising unions fell
sharply too, from about two-thirds to less than half. More important, the
relationship between employers and those unions that continued to be recognised
changed radically. By and large the unions became more co-operative, and
began to regard strikes as a last rather than first resort..

<P><B>Back to work <BR>
</B>Other factors, of course, aside from the Tories' new laws, also helped
to change the industrial-relations climate. Some were inadvertent and in
themselves extremely undesirable--such as the sharp rise in unemployment
and the unintentionally rapid contraction of the economy during the disinflation
of the early 1980s. Others were the deliberate consequence of policy, and
in themselves a good thing. For instance, the adoption of competitive tendering
(&quot;contracting out&quot;) in much of the public sector greatly weakened
the power of many public-sector unions. Privatisation is another example:
it was probably as important for helping to change the overall character
of industrial relations as for directly improving the performance of the
privatised companies. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By pushing &quot;lame ducks&quot; such as
British Leyland (now Rover) and overmanned public enterprises such as British
Telecom into private ownership, the Thatcher government lent new credibility
to its promise to let failing companies fail--a vow that many previous
governments had made and then broken. Privatisation sent a clear message:
taxpayers would no longer give refuge to firms that were unable to make
their way in the world. This set an example to the rest of the economy,
encouraging managers, among other things, to adopt a less indulgent attitude
towards dealing with their own unionised workforces. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that privatisation helped to change
Britain's culture of labour relations, however, is not to deny that the
direct results of the policy mattered in their own right. They did. When
the Tories came to power, the nationalised industries were making heavy
losses. The cost in state support was equivalent to &pound;300 a year for
every taxpayer. The privatised companies now make profits of roughly &pound;2.5
billion a year--and pay taxes on those profits which amount to a rebate
of &pound;100 a year for every taxpayer. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the nationalised or formerly nationalised
industries raised their productivity a lot faster in the 1980s than in
the 1970s (see <a href="chart4.gif">chart 4</a>). Some, such as British Telecom and British Steel,
became global standard-setters for their respective industries, another
achievement that few would have bet on before 1979. British Steel succeeded
in becoming much more efficient after 1979 while still in the public sector
(it was privatised in 1988); this has led some to question whether privatisation
was really necessary for better management. It may not have been strictly
necessary: better management under public control was evidently possible.
But privatisation was most likely very helpful. Even where efficiency improved
a lot before the firm was sold, as it did at British Steel, the prospect
of private ownership almost certainly acted as a spur. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sceptics also point out, again rightly, that
the government did too little to promote competition in the privatised
industries. Maximising proceeds from the sales mattered to the Treasury,
and monopolies (albeit heavily regulated ones) fetch a better price than
companies that must compete to survive. But this is only to say that the
benefits of privatisation might have been even greater than they were--not,
on the face of it, a good argument against privatisation. Disappointing
or otherwise, the improvement in performance (the result of a too-small
increase in competition and a big increase in profit-seeking) cannot be
denied. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who has benefited from this better performance?
What of the view, the sceptics' last resort, that the industries' new shareholders
(and overpaid bosses) have gained at the expense of citizens at large? Opponents
of privatisation tend to complain when shareholders have done very well
(grasping investors were sold the companies too cheaply) and when they
have not (poor, unsuspecting shareholders, including many old-age pensioners,
were deliberately misled). <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all very silly. Investors in privatisation
shares have done well, but not outrageously so. Taxpayers have gained a
lot, as already noted. And consumers have profited as well. Thanks to better
productivity and a regulatory framework that, for all its faults, divides
the gains of greater efficiency between shareholders and customers, prices
charged by the privatised utilities have mostly risen far less rapidly
than prices in general. For one reason or another, privatisation may have
been unpopular with voters--but in every other way the policy was an unambiguous
success. </P>

<P><B>It ain't broke <BR>
</B>New Labour is at its weakest when it tries to deny that the underlying
performance of the British economy has improved since 1979. Even though
it has no plans to reverse the main policies that have brought this about--the
Tories' anti-union laws and privatisation--it accepts these measures grudgingly.
It says, in effect, that it would not have done these ill-advised things,
but it is too late now to undo them. You can't turn back the clock. New
Labour must make the best of the wreckage the Tories will leave behind.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this position were entirely a matter of
political spin, one might have few grounds for complaint or anxiety. Judging
Labour by what it firmly promises to do (almost nothing), you would conclude
that the Tories' structural repairs of Britain's economy are secure. Why
not then allow New Labour its ritual denunciations of the government? But
the question is whether, and how, this grudging acceptance of the Tory
revolutions in industrial relations and the state-owned enterprises will
express itself in government. It is false reassurance to suppose that the
reforms cannot now be undone. Some could be explicitly reversed, others
implicitly rendered null. Clocks can, in fact, be turned back. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Labour is keen, for instance, on the
idea of a &quot;stakeholder economy&quot;. Again, measured by what Labour
promises to do in office, the idea appears to have virtually no content--which
is fine. But what does it mean to the voters whose support it is intended
to attract?  What might it come to mean? </P>

<P><B>Partners in progress <BR>
</B>At a minimum, it implies a bigger role for workers (organised or otherwise)
in the running of companies. The very term &quot;stakeholder&quot; is intended
to be contrasted with &quot;shareholder&quot;--meaning that companies should
be run with interests other than the &quot;short-termist&quot; demands
of shareholders in mind. The principal stakeholders in any company, after
its owners, are its employees. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, Britain's unions hope to recapture
ground they have lost under the Tories if Labour wins the election; undoubtedly,
on the key things, Mr Blair is determined to disappoint them. But &quot;stakeholding&quot;
gives them grounds for hope. It is a commodious term, intended to bring
coherence to Labour's various non-pledges on corporate governance, the
minimum wage and the European social chapter (of which more later). That
makes it a big stick with which to beat the new prime minister after the
election. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advocates of stakeholding and scourges of
City short-termism are in a paradoxical position. Under the Tories, these
critics of the government would agree, shareholder capitalism has made
great strides. Companies are no longer anything like as constrained as
they used to be by powerful unions; enterprises once owned and run by the
government are now owned by shareholders and run by their agents. Yet,
as the productivity figures make plain, these changes have gone hand in
hand with a marked improvement in the performance of British companies.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, productivity is only one way
to judge industrial efficiency. Critics of British post Thatcher capitalism
emphasise, as you would expect, other measures. Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor, often draws attention to Britain's relatively poor record on
investment, calling this the &quot;root cause&quot; of Britain's relative
economic decline. Put to one side the point that Britain has not, in fact,
been in relative economic decline since 1979. Wouldn't its performance
(good, bad or indifferent) have been be a lot better if investment had
been higher? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain does invest less than similarly prosperous
countries. Since 1960, Britain has spent a smaller share of its national
income on investment than almost any other rich economy: its rate of roughly
18% of <FONT SIZE=-1>GDP</FONT> over the past 35 years was fractionally
less than America's, substantially less than that of France and Germany
(about 22%) and barely three fifths that of Japan (roughly 30%). In this
respect, the record since 1979 shows no improvement. The government, sensitive
to this line of criticism, challenges the numbers and the usual interpretation
of them. It points out that Britain has invested less in housing than similar
countries; its rate of business investment (which excludes housing) has
been second only to Japan's since 1979. Other studies have served mainly
to deepen the confusion: much depends on exactly how business investment
is defined, and the definition varies in large and small ways from country
to country. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost by definition, more of the right sort
of investment would improve Britain's economic performance. It would be
fairly easy for the government to arrange a mere increase in capital spending:
that would require only generous subsidies and/or tax allowances of the
kind that Labour often appears to favour (but has not yet spelled out).
The cost would be higher taxes and, at least for a time, lower living standards,
for what is spent on investment cannot also be spent on consumption; but
a mere expansion of investment is certainly achievable. More investment
of the right sort, however, is another thing. No government is competent
to judge which industries, or which firms, or which activities within firms,
deserve to be subsidised. If a greater quantity of investment is achieved
at the expense of quality, nothing has been gained. If New Labour believes
anything, it surely ought to believe that investment decisions should be
made in the marketplace, not in Whitehall. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of New Labour's intellectual allies
would deny that. In attacking Britain's short-termist corporate culture,
they call frankly for the government to override the pull of market forces
on investment (and other things), and not merely with a bit of subsidy
here or there. The &quot;stakeholder economy&quot;, that splendidly elastic
term, encompasses demands not only for greater participation by workers
in the running of their firms but also for a tempering of shareholders'
power to demand high short-term profits of their managers. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here too Mr Blair has adopted the label but
flinches at the substance. Unlike its forebears and very many of its supporters,
when New Labour speaks on the record it proposes no grand new &quot;industrial
strategy&quot;. That is just as well. Britain doesn't need one. More investment,
especially if it resulted from greater confidence among Britain's businessmen
in the prospects for the economy, would be welcome; better macroeconomic
policy, of which more in a moment, would be the best and simplest way to
foster such confidence. In the meantime, however, talk of Britain's continuing
economic crisis does not deserve to be taken seriously. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even some proponents of &quot;stakeholding&quot;
would go along with that. John Kay, a professor at the London Business
School, is one. In &quot;The Foundations of Corporate Success&quot;, published
in 1993, he explains how best to judge the success of a company. He favours
a measure based on &quot;value added&quot; by the business; mere profit,
beloved of shareholders, can be a misleading gauge. Then he examines a
database of all big European companies to discover which were the most
successful in the 1980s according to this definition. Of Europe's ten most
successful firms, seven were British (see <a href="chart5.gif">chart 5</a>). Not bad for a basket-case.

<h1> The outsiders </h1>

<i>Surging unemployment has been the Tories' greatest failure. What can be done about it?</i><p>

NEW LABOUR'S attack on the Conservatives' record at last hits the target when it comes to unemployment. Mr Blair cannot plausibly deny that British companies are better run than they used to be or that, for the majority, this has put higher living standards within reach. What he can plausibly deny, however, is that the fruits of this achievement have been spread to all parts of society. A substantial minority, Labour argues, have been excluded from the broader trend of growing prosperity. The most conspicuous mark of exclusion is joblessness. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;High unemployment has lots of different consequences, all of them bad. Those directly affected, the unemployed and their families, obviously suffer most, not just because their income disappears but also through loss of self-respect and ever-diminishing employability as time spent without work extends. The costs also extend far beyond the principal victims. High unemployment promotes crime; it increases the burden of the welfare state on taxpayers; the greater threat of joblessness spreads anxiety far and wide. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the economy at large, high unemployment represents an outrageous waste of resources. Although a certain amount of unemployment is unavoidable in any economy, high rates can become self-perpetuating. Unemployment is subject to a kind of inertia that economists call "hysteresis": there is a tendency for the long-term unemployed to increase as a proportion of the total. Not only does this concentrate the misery, it also inhibits the dampening effect on inflation that unemployment would otherwise have. The result is that the unavoidable minimum rate of unemployment--the rate consistent with a low and stable rate of inflation-- drifts higher. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Joblessness also lies behind most of the deterioration in the various socio-economic indicators that Labour cites so effectively against the Tories: growing poverty, rising inequality, the number of households receiving means-tested benefits, and so on. It accounts for much of the rise in public borrowing witnessed in the early 1990s, which New Labour is also at pains to deplore. (The public-sector borrowing requirement reached &pound;45 billion, or 7% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, in 1993-94; it has since fallen to &pound;32 billion.) Ordinarily, the government might find this close connection between unemployment and other economic ills consoling: as unemployment continues to fall (by the end of next year, it should be about 1.75m), those other measures of economic failure are bound to improve as well. Given the electoral timing, however, such progress is likely to be too little and too late. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Causing a needlessly high rate of unemployment is one of the worst mistakes a government can make. Why did unemployment rise so quickly in the early 1980s and early 1990s? What if anything can be done now to reduce it faster?<p>
<b>If it's Tuesday, it must be £M3</b >
<br>Often during the 1980s, the government's critics accused it of using high unemployment as an instrument of economic policy. Millions were shunted on to the dole, it was said, in a cynical effort to curb inflation and quell the unions. Actually, the government was dismayed at the rise in unemployment of the early 1980s. The prevailing orthodoxy had been that a programme to cut inflation, announced in advance and described in detail, could succeed without much, if any, rise in unemployment. The trick was to make sure that everybody believed the government's promise that inflation would fall. If they did, wage demands would moderate and fewer workers would find themselves priced out of work. Accordingly, the government devoted much effort to developing and defending its "medium term financial strategy", a multi-year framework that set the context for each year's budget.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a variety of reasons, the policy went wrong. The Tories succeeded in lowering inflation only at an enormous cost in unemployment. Evidently, however, little was learned from the experience. Unemployment soared again in the recession of the early 1990s. And the cause of that recession was essentially the same as before: inflation had risen sharply, so the government was obliged to contract the economy. This time, though, fewer people argued that so patent and embarrassing a failure had been a deliberate act of policy. (Sterling's ejection from the European exchange-rate mechanism made it far harder than before to put a brave face on defeat.) Henceforth, in macroeconomic policy, it was more plausible to mock the Tories for their incompetence than to deplore them for their wickedness.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lesson of the past two recessions is that--in a limited sense, and unpalatable as it seems--unemployment is after all an instrument of economic policy. But the lesson would apply as much to a socialist or New Labour government as to a Tory one. Once inflation is rising, curbing it requires higher unemployment, at least for a time. The choices surrounding this short-term trade-off are essentially second-order decisions: should the government curb inflation quickly (implying a more rapid, but perhaps more short-lived, rise in unemployment) or more slowly (implying a gentler, but perhaps longer-lived, recession)? When Margaret Thatcher justified the first Tory recession by saying "There is no alternative", she was almost right: once inflation is up, there are no likeable alternatives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It follows that the best anti-unemployment policy is a successful anti-inflation policy. This is well worth remembering at times like now. Inflation is low; wages are increasing at a relatively modest pace; unemployment is falling; the economy is growing at a steady if unspectacular pace. For some commentators, this is not enough: the government should cut interest rates further and "allow" the economy to grow faster. These are the commentators (from both left and right) who have applauded Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for cutting interest rates against the advice of the Bank of England in recent months, and who regret only that he has not gone further to stimulate the economy. It is safe to predict that they will be the very commentators who will criticise Mr Clarke most bitterly when inflation rises in due course, making higher interest rates (and rising unemployment) necessary once more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments everywhere find it difficult to keep inflation securely in check. No particular technique of monetary policy holds the secret--if it did, Britain, which has tried almost every regime you can think of, would have found it by now. What seems to matter most is not the nuts and bolts of monetary management but a popular demand for, or at least acceptance of, stable prices. This is why a successful anti-inflation policy is especially difficult in Britain, and helps to explain why the record of every British government since the 1960s in this respect has been so dismal. To put it mildly, Britain has a high tolerance of inflation. Recent signs of brisker business in the housing market--often a precursor of a more general rise in prices--were widely regarded as good news.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In several ways, in fact, Britain's inflation problem is linked to housing. Most people in Britain finance their homes with (subsidised) floating-rate debt. This makes them unusually sensitive to changes in interest rates. Fraction-of-a-point rises that would pass almost unnoticed elsewhere are front-page news in Britain, and hailed as a great political setback. Even more than in other countries, therefore, British governments love to cut interest rates and hate to put them up. Tolerance of inflation (to put it at its mildest) together with this great resistance to "safety-first" adjustments in interest rates have given Britain a persistent tendency to high inflation--a persistent tendency, in other words, to spells of high unemployment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Changing this settled pro-inflation culture would be a job of many years. The best hope is to keep inflation down for so long that the economy's institutions begin to adapt to, and then demand, stable prices. The catch of course is that, until then, keeping inflation down is going to be difficult. A step in the right direction would be to make the Bank of England responsible for monetary policy, and to let it discharge its duties independently of the Treasury. This is no cure-all, as some appear to think. Monetary policy would not become apolitical merely because the government said so--as the Bank would quickly discover. The most that can be said is that, with luck, the distance between politics and anti-inflation policy would be somewhat increased. It would be a start.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government had appeared to be adopting this approach. Over the past few years the Bank has been given a bigger say in the operational aspects of monetary policy (eg, in deciding precisely when to change interest rates in the amount and direction chosen by the chancellor), and it has been allowed to say more in public about what it thinks (notably through its own independently produced <i>Inflation Report</i>, and through publication of the minutes of its monthly monetary-policy meeting with the chancellor). As these changes were announced, it was speculated that they might constitute de facto independence for the Bank. Hardly. Mr Clarke has shown his followers how to operate the system: hear the Bank's views, ignore them, and collect extra credit on that account when interest rates are cut.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a time it also seemed that New Labour might embrace the idea of an independent Bank of England. But its proto-manifesto is careful to stop short of that. It says only that "We will reform the Bank of England to ensure that decision-making on monetary policy is more effective, open, accountable and free from short-term political manipulation." In other words, "We will make things better but we aren't saying how." Perhaps it was naive to suppose that if Labour gained office, having been denied power for nearly 20 years, it would promptly surrender the most powerful tool of economic policy into another's hands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In most other respects, New Labour spares no effort to reassure voters and the City that its macroeconomic policy will be non-inflationary. Indeed, to most of its supporters, the party's position is cautious to a fault. No talk of the traditional "dash for growth" (the idea is explicitly repudiated). And, as already noted, virtually no firm promises on new public spending. Judged by what Labour's leaders have said, rather than by what their supporters wish they would say, there is little to choose between the two main parties on macroeconomic policy. Both promise to do the right thing: curb the budget deficit, keep inflation low. Neither offers any new reasons for supposing its promise will be kept. 
<p><b>Skills and standards</b >
<br>Though it is true that the best way to keep unemployment low is to keep inflation low, thereby avoiding the need to throttle the economy every few years, curbing unemployment is not just a matter of macroeconomic policy. Much of Britain's unemployment is "structural", meaning that it will take more than a business-cycle recovery to eliminate it. In principle, any of a number of factors may cause this kind of unemployment. For instance, the unemployed may lack the skills that an expanding economy will need; the welfare system may be designed in such a way that some people are better off collecting the dole than they would be going out to work; there may be regulatory barriers of one sort or another preventing would-be workers from finding jobs; and so on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since 1979 the government's assorted interventions in the labour market have avowedly been designed to promote "flexibility"--that is, to improve skills and incentives, and to clear away the barriers that keep the unemployed out of work. It is difficult to judge the success of these measures, overshadowed as they have been by two severe recessions. But the government's various initiatives have undeniably increased the proportion of 16-18-year-olds in formal training. They have substantially reduced the number of people caught in the worst forms of the unemployment-benefit trap. (This was achieved partly by reducing benefits for some recipients and partly by tightening the rules on eligibility; the result is that fewer people are now better off on the dole than in work.) They have weakened the power of trade unions, and ended the power of Wages Councils, to set pay at levels that reduce the demand for labour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this, it seems, has improved the ability of the labour market to match willing employers with would-be workers. The evidence for this is that in the recovery from the second recession, unemployment started falling sooner than in the recovery from the first (see <a href="chart7.gif">chart 7</a>). In other words, employment now seems to respond more sensitively to the state of the economy than before. Many other things changed between the 1980s and the 1990s, of course, but it seems likely that a more flexible market for labour is one of the reasons for that faster growth of jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Labour's proposals on employment are a peculiar mixture. As in other areas, they reflect the party's ambivalence over the respective roles of state and market. The goal of "flexibility" is embraced, as you would expect. Old Labour would have denounced the term, with some justice, as a euphemism for screwing the workers; to New Labour, flexibility in all things is both modern and necessary. Needless to say, however, flexibility must be combined with certain "minimum standards".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour therefore intends to introduce a national minimum wage (its level to be determined by a new Low Pay Commission). It also says it will adopt the European social chapter, which would extend workers' entitlements in matters such as consultation by managers and unpaid parental leave. Less contentiously, the party proposes to expand the existing provision of vocational training, both to increase the proportion of 16-18-year-olds receiving a good standard of formal training and to ensure that the long-term unemployed are given a variety of training choices as a route back to work.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On benefits, Labour's policy appears to be more niggardly than the government's. That is, any young unemployed people turning down these improved options for work or training (which include, presumably as a last resort, a job on Labour's "environment taskforce") will have their benefit cut: "There will be no option of remaining permanently on full benefit." Though it bemoans the rise in poverty of the past two decades, New Labour does not propose to restore the real value of benefits. To judge by its proto manifesto, it is more concerned to curb fraudulent claims.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour, haunted by the memory of its election campaign of 1992, is nearly as vague on taxes. The interaction of benefits and taxes for those on low incomes continues, despite the Tories' changes, to be an important obstacle to higher employment. Radical solutions to the tax-and-benefits trap--especially an integrated system in the form of a negative income tax--have a lot to be said for them and should commend themselves to a left-of-centre party. But schemes of this sort would be very expensive. Rather than proposing any such reform, Labour talks blithely about reducing the starting-rate of income tax from 20% to 10% when conditions allow.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the meantime, its purported remedies for Britain's most pressing economic and social problem are a mixture of good and bad. Labour's ideas on training are promising. It is a pity they do not go further. One of the most outrageous anomalies in British public policy is that university education for bright 18-21-year-olds is hugely subsidised by the taxpayer, whereas vocational training for academically unsuccessful 16-19-year-olds is often undertaken at private expense. There is a very strong case on the grounds of equity and efficiency for correcting, and indeed reversing, this bias.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;University students, who will be the most prosperous members of society, and who will themselves capture almost all of the benefit of their higher education, should receive much less subsidy. In contrast, society has a large interest in helping its least gifted people into gainful employment, as opposed to idleness or crime. Many of these rejects are failing to receive training under the government's expanded schemes; Labour's plans would be an improvement, but are still not intended to reach everyone. Here is an opportunity for a left-of-centre party to be both radical and intelligent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No such luck. Labour's proposals on welfare-to work are limited in scope. This is partly, one imagines, so that financing them can be said to require not a fundamental change of priorities, still less an ongoing rise in general taxation, but merely a "windfall levy" on the privatised utilities. This daft way of presenting the policy mars an otherwise worthwhile idea. A "windfall" tax cannot finance a recurring expense; it will probably fail to raise enough money to pay for even one year of Labour's new regime; and it pretends that a tax on the privatised utilities is not somehow a tax on the public at large (which, ultimately, it is). What this stratagem shows is that Labour is unwilling to present even its best ideas as plans that voters might actually be willing to pay for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's other main ideas on employment are not flawed so much as plain awful. The minimum wage, unless set cynically at so low a rate that it would not raise anybody's wages, is a job destroyer. The <font size=-1>EU</font>'s social chapter is constitutionally objectionable (subsidiarity should apply here if anywhere) and threatens to become another heavy tax on jobs. Anything that raises the cost of hiring an extra worker makes it less likely that a worker will be taken on. If reducing unemployment were Labour's top priority, as it should be, it would have no truck with nonsense of this sort. Labour's feeble reply is: "Everybody else in Europe does it." It only remains to add that Britain's unemployment rate, however dire, is one of the lowest in the Union.

<h1>Cradle to grave </h1>

<i>What should become of the welfare state?</i><P>

REPORTS of the death of Britain's welfare state have been exaggerated. Since 1979, welfare spending--broadly defined to include pensions, social security, education, the National Health Service and public housing--has increased by half in real terms. Even as a proportion of <font size=-1>GDP</font> it has increased, from 23% to 26% (see <a href="chart9.gif">chart 9</a>). 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On unchanged policies, it is true, the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s would have driven welfare spending a good deal higher under the Tories. And until 1979 the share of welfare spending in national income had been on a steadily rising trend. In merely halting that growth, at a time when demands on the system were rising for both business cycle and demographic reasons, the Tories had to squeeze hard in some areas. They did it by cutting capital spending and extending means-testing where they could. Housing and education came to receive smaller shares of the total, health care and social-security benefits bigger ones. But the broad goals of the system, and the resulting cost to taxpayers, have changed much less than most of the governments' critics allow--and less than some of its critics would have wished. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the various exceptions to that, one is important. It caused surprisingly little fuss, perhaps because its effects will take years to become conspicuous. This was the decision to link future increases in pensions and some other benefits to inflation rather than to average earnings (which rise faster than prices). The implication is that the basic state pension will provide an ever-diminishing standard of living, measured relative to the incomes of those in work. To avoid poverty in old age, people will increasingly need to provide for themselves, by saving more during their working years. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This decision, in other words, announced the beginning of what could become a long, slow retreat in a central component of the welfare state as it was once envisaged. Whether tomorrow's pensioners fully understand the difference this will make to them is doubtful. Labour opposed the change, as you would expect; as you would expect, it has no plans to reverse it. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That aside, Tory efforts to reform the welfare state have mainly concentrated not on the scale of provision, but on the method of delivery. Here, their thinking has been radical by any standards. A turning-point came in 1988. Up to then, most of the Tories' changes to the welfare state had been mere tinkering, forced upon them by the need to contain costs. But then came the Education Reform Act, which introduced the national curriculum, open school enrolment and provision for schools to opt out of local-authority control. State schools would still be free to their users, but the reforms would begin to change the system from one that allocated resources according to the plans of central and (especially) local authorities into one that worked more like a market--a "quasi-market"--for educational services. The idea was simple enough: schools would compete with each other, and standards would rise. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1988 the government also set up a review into the future of the National Health Service. This yielded a shake-up that was even more radical than the one that had just begun in education. Again, the principle of free provision was not questioned. Instead, another "internal market" was to be established. Hospitals could opt out of health-authority control, and many general-practitioner practices would be given their own budgets to buy services from hospitals or health authorities as they chose. Again, competition was intended to raise standards, by exposing inefficiency, weighing the costs of treatment more explicitly and causing resources to be better employed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The quasi-market idea was also extended to other areas. In public housing, for instance, landlords were allowed to bid for control of local-authority housing, with rents shifted closer to market levels (and housing benefits raised to reflect that). The government's policy on "community care" also intended that public providers would play a smaller role and private providers a bigger one, all at taxpayers' expense. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taken together, these different initiatives suggested the beginning of a deep transformation of the welfare state. Henceforth, even though public services could continue to be paid for out of general taxation, they might be almost entirely provided by a variety of competing private suppliers. According to the purest form of the quasi-market model, most (if not all) schools, hospitals, residential homes, providers of "social housing", and so on would one day be private, as opposed to state-owned and state-run, institutions. The role of government would be confined to injecting money, regulating, promoting competition and monitoring the results. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The model could be extended even further, into the saving-for-retirement and insurance functions of the benefits system. For instance, the government might develop a funded replacement for the state pension system, paying a minimum contribution for each taxpayer into an individual pension account held at any of a multitude of competing providers. The delinking of pensions from earnings might then be seen as a first step in this direction. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, then, there are two questions to ask about the future of the welfare state. The first, and more familiar, is: how big should it be? The other is: should it be organised along traditional public-service lines, or as a series of quasi-markets? It is a politically important fact, however, that these questions are by no means independent. The Tories' reforms of the welfare state are easy to portray as a strategy of dismantling by stealth. This has been Labour's charge throughout.
<p><b>Outsourcing the welfare state</b>
<br>The charge has substance. Once quasi-markets are in place, and the government no longer acts as a monopoly supplier of the service in question, it is natural to ask how far its role as provider of cash should be supplemented, or replaced, by the private sector. Suppose the government pursued the logic of its reforms in education, for instance, and issued parents with vouchers enabling them to buy a place at the school of their choice. It would be in the spirit of such a scheme, some would argue, to let "state schools" (as they once were) invite parents to top up their vouchers with cash. With time, the state's contribution could be allowed to fall, leading by degrees to the privatisation of education.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Higher spending notwithstanding, the Tories' reforms of the supply-side of the welfare state have always been bedevilled by the popular suspicion that this is where they are really heading. New Labour, if it chose, could explore the quasi-market method of delivery with less political difficulty: its assurances that the aim was merely to improve the quality of services would be more readily believed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But does the quasi-market approach, judged solely as a method of delivery, actually give better value for money? It is too early to expect clear answers. Such dramatic changes involve heavy starting costs and great initial disruption; the gains, if any, will take time to come through. Accordingly, the evidence so far is mixed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Audit Commission recently published a report on the economics of <font size=-1>GP</font><b> </b>fundholding. It estimated that up to the end of 1994, practices had received &pound;232m to cover the costs of the extra staff, equipment and computers they needed to make the new regime work. Against that, they had achieved only &pound;206m in efficiency savings within their budgets. The question is whether improvements in the service provided to patients were sufficient to offset that financial deficit of &pound;26m. The commission found many improvements (such as better communication with hospitals, shorter waiting times, greater use of day surgery); but it found also that only the best-managed practices had succeeded in making a big difference in these respects. The best practices showed that the new system offered great potential for improvement, but few as yet were realising that potential.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, competition ought to make sense: in most fields of endeavour, it works miracles. But in its application to the welfare state, there are difficulties. For a start, no doubt recognising the political obstacles, the government has stopped well short of the maximum dose of market forces. The Tories' quasi-markets are even further removed from proper markets than they might be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In primary and secondary education, for instance, the government has not adopted the voucher model. One result is that parents do not act as purchasers within the system, exerting all the pressure they might on schools to raise standards. Similarly, in health care, the power to shop around rests not with patients but with fundholding <font size=-1>GP</font>s. Any health system offering free services needs a "gatekeeper" of some kind if it is not to be overwhelmed. Even so, in a system which continues to discourage patients from switching among <font size=-1>GP</font>s, the question arises whether the reforms have really improved matters for the people the <font size=-1>NHS</font> is intended to serve.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A problem that seems pervasive in quasi-market systems is "cream-skimming". Any scheme that pays a standard fee for each user or group of users gives providers an incentive to search for customers who will be cheap to service. <font size=-1>GP</font>s would prefer to have the young and fit on their rolls; the old and infirm are financially less appealing. Schools would prefer to recruit the brightest pupils, because that improves their record in examination results; if possible, they will avoid accepting backward pupils, or those with particular learning difficulties, because such children do badly in exams and require a bigger investment of teaching effort.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Formulas can be devised to reward doctors and schools for taking on more needy or troublesome users, but unless this is seen to, the quasi-market approach is dangerously flawed. Competition among providers may be counted on, in the end, to raise average performance; but the quality of service provided to those at the bottom (which will often mean those in greatest need) may well decline.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if "weighted vouchers" were introduced to correct the bias in quasi-market systems against demanding users, there is a broader point here of some political moment. Even in its present half hearted applications, it is clear that the quasi-market method both decentralises and depoliticises. More decisions are taken by <font size=-1>GP</font>s, fewer by health authority planners; more by parents and school governors, fewer by local-authority bureaucrats.<b>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</b> Put that way, perhaps, it all seems fine. But decentralisation also means diversity. That is something that the welfare state's beneficiaries are unused to. People are accustomed to thinking of their rights within the system as uniform entitlements, measured not by the cost of providing the service (which has been no concern of theirs) but by the outcome. Suppose a patient with a good <font size=-1>GP</font> gets a hip replacement within weeks whereas a patient with a bad one must wait months. In the traditional regime, that is an anomaly: you either hush it up or call for action from the centre. The quasi-market system works in the first place by making such differences more obvious, which is awkward enough. Then it proposes no external remedy: within limits, the market is intended to heal itself. From a politician's point of view, this is to go from bad to worse. His role has shrunk. There is little or no place, if the model is fully developed, for a grand, politically accountable, harmoniser of services.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A welfare state that relied more on markets would probably deliver better standards and better value for money. But one wonders whether that would be a welfare state that Britain will ever want.
<p><bold>Alternative futures</bold>
<br>For now, it appears that nobody is about to offer Britain the choice; not in those terms, at any rate. The first big question about the future of the welfare state was, how much should it cost? New Labour's answer seems to be: about the same, measured as a share of national income, as now. That is the only answer consistent with the party's professed reluctance to raise taxes in the aggregate. Labour's provisional manifesto rightly says that as unemployment falls (which it is likely to, initially, under either sort of government), there will be room within the total for more spending on health and education. One supposes that the Tories, in contrast, would prefer to translate any such fiscal benefits into lower taxes. In the short-term, at least, the difference between these competing visions of the welfare state is puny.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More important, arguably, are the views the parties take on the second question about welfare: how are the services to be delivered? Again, however, the differences are slender. The Tories seem stuck half way between the traditional welfare state and a properly market-driven system. They lack the conviction to proceed, as though the radicalism that seized them in the late 1980s took them by surprise. New Labour seems equally confused. It denounces the <font size=-1>NHS</font> internal market in sternly moralising tones: "the corrosive ethics of the marketplace", and all that. It explicitly opposes vouchers in education, again as though competition taints what it touches. "We favour greater devolution for schools--but within a local, accountable service that ensures fairness and partnership between all schools 
<br>c." Make of that what you will.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What a pity that New Labour cannot seize its opportunity to marry a willingness to maintain spending on welfare with a vigorous commitment to use market systems of delivery. That would be a genuinely intriguing prospect. Labour would find it far easier to present the policy in the proper light--not an attempt to shave pennies, but an effort to improve services. Labour, one supposes, would also take greater care to weight the system in such as way as to limit cream-skimming, and preferably to go further, providing additional incentives to improve services to those most in need. There would be a real possibility of better services not merely for most people, but from top to bottom. Unfortunately, all the signs are that Labour's instinctive revulsion at market forces, though pretty well controlled when discussing the economy, is unquellable when it comes to the welfare state.

<h1> Power and the people </h1>

<i>The most contentious issues for the next government will be constitutional ones </i>

<p>NEW LABOUR is avowedly the party of constitutional reform. Its proposals include referendums on devolution for Scotland and Wales, and on electoral reform; procedural changes for the House of Commons and more radical reform of the Lords; a freedom of information act; and a bill of rights (to be achieved by embodying the European Convention on Human Rights into British law). The Tories, keen for once to emphasise their conservatism, are happy to agree that Labour is radical on the constitution--recklessly so, in fact. The British constitution, in their view, has worked well for centuries&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;envy of the world&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;mother of parliaments. Labour's tampering threatens to disturb its delicate equilibrium. Leave well alone. 

<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One can only admire the Tories' nerve in adopting this position. It is no exaggeration to say that since 1979 they have radically recast Britain's constitution. The adoption of quasi-markets within the welfare state is, properly understood, a constitutional change: in the provision of essential public services, the line of accountability between state and citizen has been redrawn, and in some cases deleted. Privatising the utilities was a constitutional change: what was once a matter of public policy (miners' pay, the price of a phone call) no longer is-- or is no longer supposed to be. Reforms in the civil service, notably the delegation of executive power to quasi-independent "agencies", are another profound constitutional change. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories have emasculated the local tier of government, through rate-capping, through the introduction of the uniform business rate, through their reforms in health and education, through the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering for local services, and in other ways. Altogether, it is hardly going too far to say that the Tories have abolished local government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And then, at the other extreme, there is Europe. The Tories signed the Single European Act and the Maastricht treaty, both of which fundamentally altered the constitution. In many areas of policy, the executive powers of European institutions now hold sway in Britain. The role of the British Parliament and executive in framing many of the new laws that affect British citizens is limited, obscure and, even within its narrow purview, ineffective. In 1979 Britain was ruled from London--to be precise, from Whitehall. Today, for good or ill, it is ruled from Brussels as well. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories, then, have been zealots for constitutional change. But they have evinced a marked reluctance to discuss or defend these reforms in constitutional terms. Instead they have justified them, by and large, as aspects of their pursuit of efficiency--meaning economic efficiency. That was the rationale for quasi-markets, for privatisation, for civil-service and local-government reform, even for European integration (on this view, the mere handmaiden of regional free trade). They have failed to address the constitutional issues. These are, first, the question of subsidiarity--how much power should there be at different levels of government? And second, the question of accountability--how should the people who come to exercise that power be made answerable to citizens<b>
<p>The centre holds and holds?
<br></b>Almost all of those who criticise the Tories for their constitutional changes complain of the reforms' relentless tendency towards centralisation, towards increasing the power of ministers at the expense of other seats of power. The charge is true, but only up to a point. A constitutional (as opposed to economic) defence of the Tory reforms could run as follows. In most cases the underlying goal was not to centralise political power but to disperse it so widely that it ceased to be political power at all. The goal, in other words, was to shrink the realm of politics. The principle of subsidiarity holds that decisions are best taken as near as possible to the people they will affect. But once you take this seriously, you see that many decisions can be pushed so far down that they fall outside the scope of politics altogether.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If parents have no choice but to send their child to the neighbourhood school run by the local authority, then how the children are taught, and many other aspects of what is correctly termed education "policy", are plainly political matters. If parents are free to send their child to any of a range of schools, each with control over staffing, resources and teaching methods, what is left for politics, local or otherwise, to do? Devise the national curriculum, perhaps; monitor and certify, no doubt. But the realm of politics has been diminished. Recourse to the market mechanism does not, in principle, centralise political power; in cases such as this, it begins to make it redundant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most political commentators, unsurprisingly, are keen on politics. In their view, the more you have, the better. In the same way, accountability is something you can never have too much of. A healthy civil society is one that is perpetually engaged in collective debate to settle every question that matters--and this is obviously a political endeavour. Seen this way, the market mechanisms favoured by the Tories are at a great disadvantage: judged in constitutional terms, they have the lethal defect of being undemocratic. But people also need to ask how much politics they want.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a liberal society, it is surely a step forward in constitutional as well as in economic terms that a miner's pay, or the price of electricity, should be settled in a market, undemocratically. Might the same not also be true of nurses' pay, or teaching methods, or how often your dustbins are emptied? A society in which these are political questions, as opposed to matters of private contract, is not necessarily a healthier society. In at least some of the areas where the Tories have reduced the political accountability of decision-makers to citizens, therefore, might it not be a good thing? Perhaps, in politics as elsewhere, less can mean better.
<br><b>
<p>Fine in theory
<br></b>Unfortunately, the Tories are inhibited in mounting any such line of defence. This is partly because, in some areas, their desire to concentrate political power at the centre was so obvious that it would be futile to deny it. Margaret Thatcher put local authorities (which are mostly Labour-controlled) as second only to trade unions on her list of enemies. They were most definitely not "one of us"--and were dealt with accordingly. More generally, the Tories' trouble is that so few of their reforms, economic virtues notwithstanding, separated the respective realms of politics and the market in an appealing or credible way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is apparent wherever you look. The privatised utilities were sold, by and large, as monopolies rather than as unbundled competing firms. As a result, they had to be regulated--and the regulator's task has been at least as politically sensitive as that of the departmental planners who previously oversaw the industries. In education and in health, the government's half-hearted recourse to quasi-markets has left ministers up to their elbows in decisions affecting the quality of service, the allocation of resources, levels of pay and all the rest. The work of the new "agencies" is regarded by nobody as lying outside politics--least of all by ministers. The separation of policy (ministers' responsibility) and operations (somebody else's) is hopelessly opaque. A businessman is made head of the prison service and then sacked for presuming to run it. The fiasco of the Child Support Agency is an embarrassment first and foremost to ministers: they are briefed in depth to answer questions on it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partly, this inability to separate the spheres of state and market, of policy and operations, is due to ministers' own insistence on retaining power--for with power, contrary to rumour, comes responsibility. It is also due to the undoubted technical difficulty of creating quasi-markets and/or delegated agencies, reforms that go against the grain of British experience. If you believe that competition in the provision of public services is a good thing, you owe ministers some sympathy on that account. But it is lastly due--and here is the government's greatest difficulty--to the fact that Britain is, by inclination, an intensely political country with a strongly centralised political culture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;People want to blame the government for everything: mad-cow disease, child-killing maniacs, dirty beaches, dwindling fish stocks, escaped prisoners (and false convictions), the death of the novel (only 4,639 new titles published in Britain last year), crowded roads, declining theatre attendances, our disappointing performance in Atlanta and the crisis in Burundi. The "Today" programme's first choice of interviewee on any of those topics (and a million others) would be a minister, who will be called to account for the government's mistakes and who will, in all likelihood, turn up and say something. Even if the government wanted to stand aside, desirable as it is in many cases that it should, people wouldn't let it. Far from being accountable for less, as critics usually charge, the government is held answerable, much as it ever was, for everything.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Proposals for further constitutional reform need to keep in mind, as the Tories' inadvertently revolutionary plans failed to, that national politics is Britain's favourite spectator sport. Labour's assurances on restoring the powers of local government (or, as for some reason Mr Blair prefers to call it, "local civic government") do indeed reflect this reality. For a start, Labour's leader appears to share the authoritarian tendencies of Margaret Thatcher: as far as possible, one imagines, he will want local government to do what he wants, not what local councillors want. Moreover, Mr Blair appears to understand that central government will be blamed for anything that goes wrong in local government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is presumably why the provisional manifesto promises to end "crude" council-tax capping (but not council-tax capping that isn't crude). It explains why local authorities would be allowed to spend their capital receipts for council-house sales, but only under strict supervision as to timing and use. Compulsory tendering will go (a boon to public-sector unions), but councils will be watched to see that they achieve value for money. "It is not for central government to dictate every detail of local service provision," Labour says, "but it must establish the framework." Labour seems hardly more likely than another Tory administration to restore the role of local government.
<br><b>
<p>The realm of the impossible
<br></b>Britain's most pressing, and intractable, constitutional problem is Northern Ireland. Here, Labour and the Tories have come to an even closer meeting of minds. Labour's proto-manifesto says nothing on the subject except to reaffirm its commitment to the bipartisan approach of recent months. To those unfamiliar with Ulster's perpetual enmities, this detente may seem surprising--because the policy has hardly been a great success. And however much the government might deny it, one of the reasons why the policy has faltered is that the prime minister has had to rely on one of Ulster's contending sectarian factions for Parliamentary support. Even if that has not swayed his decisions, it has made it impossible for the government to play its chosen role of honest broker.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government, or its successor, needs to rethink its policy. The "peace process" was founded on the premise that the province's political parties (including Sinn Fein) could be gently guided to agree among themselves to a settlement--that way it would be, as it were, their own settlement. This was worth a try, but it now seems doubtful that such an approach can succeed. Ulster's political parties are too extremist and uncompromising--more so (one hopes) than most of the people they represent. At some point, the government will have to offer a constitutional settlement (of the kind anticipated in the agreement on the Anglo-Irish framework) directly to Northern Ireland's people, for their approval in a referendum, without the poisonous intermediation of the province's politicians.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On Scotland, in contrast, Labour and the Tories part company in the most dramatic way. Mr Blair's plans for Scottish devolution are much more radical than anything he proposes for local-government reform. And yet they betray a similar hesitation over the question of subsidiarity. The party proposes an elected assembly with severely limited tax-raising powers. The case for an elected body of some kind is very strong: opinion polls say that most Scots want it, and many areas of policy are already dealt with on an exclusively regional basis through the Scottish Office. But why limit the assembly's tax-raising powers? The answer is that Labour fears it will be blamed if Scotland's parliament votes to put taxes up sharply--and it is probably right. Yet the logic of devolution surely requires that Scotland's representatives vote the taxes that will pay for their spending. To separate the two threatens to make the Scottish parliament a mere pressure group for more spending at others' expense--call it the English-local-government model.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That in itself would increase friction within the union. To make matters worse, Labour has no answer to the West Lothian question: why should Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s be able to vote at Westminster on English domestic matters when English <font size=-1>MP</font>s cannot vote on Scottish ones? It is wrong to dismiss this as a constitutional nicety of no wider significance. Circumstances are easy to envisage in which Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s hold the balance of power in Westminster, and vote through controversial legislation which affects England and Wales, but not Scotland. This would be not so much a nicety as an outrage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Scottish devolution, much demanded by Scots, is to succeed, Labour will have to think harder about questions of constitutional justice. Any assembly should have matching powers to tax and spend; and the role of Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s at Westminster will have to be correspondingly curtailed. Finding a fair way to do that is easier said than done. Merely denying Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s the right to speak or vote on "English" matters could well cause deadlock, with the government secure in its overall majority yet unable to pass laws for England. A better solution, arguably, would simply be to reduce the number of Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s. At any rate, Labour must spell all this out before its ideas on devolution can be judged.
<p><b>Making the best of a unitary state</b>
<br>The principle of subsidiarity has much to commend it, within the United Kingdom as well as within Europe (of which more in a moment). Britain's polity would be a healthier one if decisions on collective spending and the means to pay for them were pushed to lower levels--provided that popular discussion and deliberation moved down at the same time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the case of Scottish devolution, this further requirement poses no great difficulty: Scotland is already a distinct political and cultural entity within the United Kingdom. In the case of local government in the rest of the country, it is doubtful that this necessary supporting culture exists, or whether it ever will. It might be worth the effort to attempt to create it. One possibility, mooted by Labour but not examined in any detail, would be to let cities elect mayors with executive powers. Innovations of that kind might be more promising than attempting to restore, partially and grudgingly, the pre-Thatcher functions of local authorities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Applying the principle of subsidiarity within Britain may be difficult. Applying the principle of accountability is both easier and more urgent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, Britain's constitution guarantees accountability through the concept of the sovereignty of Parliament. The government, meaning Parliament, faces few formal checks on its power. Unlike in most countries with written constitutions, for instance, the legislature and the judiciary are both joined to the executive: none provides a truly independent scrutiny of the others. No such scrutiny is needed, the theory goes, because political power in Britain is vested in the House of Commons--a directly elected, and hence directly accountable, body.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arguably, this view once made sense. Today, it certainly does not. Over the years, the sovereignty of Parliament has been corrupted; it has become instead the sovereignty of cabinet, a profoundly undemocratic idea. Exercising immense powers of patronage and intimidation, ministers rule the House of Commons, and hence the country. Parliament no longer even makes a plausible pretence of curbing the executive. Partly thanks to party discipline, its debates are a pitiful charade, and its committees are for the most part ineffective. The Tories' reluctance to countenance reform is hard to understand: the case for change seems unanswerable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crucial things are to strengthen the judiciary and the House of Commons at the expense of the prime minister and cabinet. Two of Labour's ideas, worthy of enthusiastic support, would do this. Incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into British law would give judges a clearer role as scrutineers of the executive. And a freedom of information act would make it easier for the Commons, not to mention ordinary citizens, to keep an eye on the government. Labour also talks (vaguely, as yet) of further steps to reform the Commons. Such steps would be welcome.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If <font size=-1>MP</font>s are to be constitutionally effective rather than merely ornamental, their job must be made interesting and useful, not just something that the able and ambitious must endure until a ministerial post turns up. Serving as an <font size=-1>MP</font> should no longer be regarded as a part-time job. Reflecting that, <font size=-1>MP</font>s should be given more responsibility and more pay--and be forbidden to accept other employment. Every <font size=-1>MP</font> should have an office and adequate access to research staff. It should be possible for somebody to spend his or her entire political career as an <font size=-1>MP</font>, and yet be regarded as a great success. If Parliament could offer that, it would greatly reduce the power of prime-ministerial patronage. And there is plenty of useful work for a more professional cadre of <font size=-1>MP</font>s to do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In enlarging the duties of Parliament, the role of committees is crucial. Their powers to scrutinise the executive should be broadened. Ministerial appointments to agencies and other quangos could be subject to confirmation by the relevant committee, for instance; and, once appointed, heads of such bodies could be required to present themselves regularly for questioning. Chairmen of committees should be paid extra. They and their fellow members should have their own lawyers to help them draft amendments to laws under scrutiny. Committees should be appointed by the whole house, and not by party whips. Reform of the Lords is less urgent, perhaps, than reform of the Commons, but there can be no serious objection to Labour's proposal to deny hereditary peers their right to sit and vote there: that right has no place in a liberal democracy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's other big idea on the constitution is electoral reform. But the provisional manifesto is terse to the point of invisibility on the subject--"We will provide a referendum on voting reform" is its discussion of the matter in full. Mr Blair has said he is doubtful about the merits of proportional representation; expect him, and many of his Parliamentary colleagues, to become a lot more doubtful if they win a big majority in the general election. Certain forms of proportional representation do seem extremely attractive. But it would be churlish to criticise Labour too harshly for its equivocation on the subject. Their ideas about Scottish devolution need to be repaired, but otherwise their thinking on constitutional reform far surpasses that of the Tories, who show little sign of having thought about the matter at all.

<h1> The reluctant European </h1>

<i>No less than its partners, Britain needs a clearer view of what the European Union is for </i>

<p>IN ONE way, the charge that the Tories bring nothing but a dull complacency to the debate on constitutional reform is unfair (quite apart from the fact that their record as constitutional revolutionaries belies their soothing words). Europe, after all, is a constitutional matter. You might argue, in fact, that the constitutional issues it raises are more important and more difficult than any others currently facing Britain. It would be too kind to say that the Tories are thinking hard about this subject; they are too busy shouting at each other to be giving the matter much thought. But you can hardly accuse them of ignoring it. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's next government will have to confront two big questions about the country's future within the European Union. The first and more immediate is what part, if any, Britain should play in the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s plans to create a single European currency. The other, less urgent but in the end more important, concerns integration in the broader political sense: how far, if at all, should Britain join others in pursuing the idea, enshrined in the Treaty of Rome, of an "ever closer union"?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The questions are obviously connected--but not so inextricably as is generally supposed. With no significant exceptions, people who want closer political integration in the <font size=-1>EU</font> also favour the euro (which is what the single currency will be called). Indeed, they want the euro less for its economic benefits, such as they may be, than because it would be in their view a big step towards that grander political goal. In the same way, again with no large exceptions, those who oppose the euro do so less for its supposed economic costs than because it would, they say, advance the cause of political integration. Nearly everyone with a strong view about the euro, for or against, agrees that the issue is inseparable from the question of political union. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a pity. There is a respectable economic case for creating a single currency in Europe. Respectable, and unexciting. Judged in economic terms, no plausible estimate of the balance of costs and benefits could be big enough, one way or the other, to arouse passions like those excited by political union. This may explain why the question is rarely examined except in that larger context. The fact remains, it would be entirely possible to have the euro without further political integration. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The classical (ie, pre-1914) gold standard was just such a system. It worked well for decades, without it even occurring to anyone that irretrievably fixed exchange rates might require the pooling of political sovereignty, harmonised fiscal policy or harmonised anything else. All that was required was the shared conviction that the value of money was not something which governments were free to manipulate. Plainly, that conviction has vanished, a fact that certainly alters the prospects for any new monetary union. For this and other reasons, the classical gold standard does not make a compelling case for the single currency--but it should at least disturb the certainty of those who say that political and monetary union are inseparable.
<p><b>A close-run thing</b>
<br>The single currency has two main economic advantages. The first is the range of gains that may be grouped under the heading of "transactions costs". This is not just a matter of avoiding the traveller's commission costs of switching from one money to another at the border: in the bigger scheme of things, these are trivial. Far more important are the risks that fluctuations in exchange rates add to the cost of doing business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is true that some kinds of currency-risk can be hedged in the financial markets, at a cost. But a long-term investment in Germany, say, remains riskier for a British or Italian company than it is for a German one. The single currency would remove this impediment to the operation of the single market. Those who say that costs of this kind are small enough to ignore are saying, in effect, that the American economy would lose little if each of its states had its own currency--an improbable claim.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The euro's other main benefit would be conditional: as long as the new monetary institutions were well designed and did their job properly, the benefits of low inflation would be spread more widely in Europe than before. The blueprint for the institutions is still vague on some important matters; in any case, it will be impossible to judge the competence of the central bank until it has been tested in practice. Nonetheless, the potential to improve on the record of domestic, politically driven monetary policy is there, and should commend the euro particularly to countries with a proven record of incompetence in the field. If that category has any members, Britain (the leading euro-sceptic) is certainly one. By the same token, Germany (a leading euro-enthusiast) has less to gain than most of its partners. That goes to show how much political factors have driven what could and should have been a mainly economic debate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against these substantial advantages must be weighed one big cost: the single currency would deny its members the independent use of monetary policy. Clearly, even a country that has been bad at monetary policy loses something valuable when it gives up the right to set its own interest rates. If a recession struck that country but not the rest of the <font size=-1>EU</font>, its interest rates (set by the single central bank) would be too high, and its slowdown would be worse than it needed to be. This is an important point, but against it note that most recessions (the Tories' two are examples) are caused by earlier mistakes in domestic monetary policy. You need to ask whether national monetary policy would be better for Britain than the euro over the whole course of the economic cycle, rather than saying "Assume a recession: what happens then?" It is a poor case for national monetary policy that you need it to mitigate the recession it created in the first place.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many other arguments often made against the euro are simply wrong. The most common fallacy is that a single currency would "lock in" differences in living standards across the community. By condemning the poorer countries to stay poor, it is further argued, the euro would add to demands for centralised fiscal policy aimed at narrowing the differences. Here lies the main supposed link between monetary union and political union. But the economic premise of this argument--that devaluing your currency shifts real resources into your country, thereby helping you to grow faster--is patently false. Devaluation does no such thing. At its theoretical best, it is a way to ease adjustment pains through the course of the economic cycle, not a way to raise long-term living standards. In practice, it would be harder to think of an idea that has been more conclusively refuted by the facts than the claim that devaluation makes you richer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, one other argument, which for some reason euro-sceptics mention much less often than the devaluationist fallacy, does call for greater caution in Britain's case than in most other countries. As noted earlier, Britain's economy responds far more sensitively to changes in interest rates than most others do. More than elsewhere, people in Britain own the houses they live in and finance the purchase by borrowing at floating rates. This is the legacy of chronic inflation. In the past, buying a house was the best hedge against inflation that most people could find (after tax, no other form of saving preserved its value so well); lenders, for their part, demanded floating rates because the monetary future was so uncertain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the causes, the result is that even a modest change in interest rates in Britain is a big political event with a perceptible financial effect (for good or ill) on very many households. As a result, the political context for monetary policy is different from that in Germany or France. The Maastricht treaty's criteria for membership of the euro system require "convergence" in various ways: some of these criteria are beside the point, others harmful. The one thing above all on which convergence is advisable is sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The treaty doesn't mention it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Britain, then, the economic pros and cons of the single currency are finely balanced. But the decisive point, for now, is that the idea is widely unpopular: no such undertaking should go ahead (anywhere in Europe, not just in Britain) without strong popular support based on an understanding of the risks and why they may be worth taking. But since that test could one day be met, and since the euro has the potential to be a good thing, Britain should not oppose it on principle, still less rule out membership for all time and under any circumstances-- the hysterical demand of the Tory sceptics. Britain has its opt-out; it can wait and see what happens. That is John Major's policy and Tony Blair's as well. There can be no sensible objection to it.
<p><b>Wider still and deeper</b>
<br>The trouble is, a policy of "watchful waiting" can be difficult to distinguish from one of "we don't know what we think, and never will." However sensible it may be for Britain to bide its time on the euro, the country and its politicians ought surely by now to have worked out what Britain's broader place in Europe should be. The bitterness of the Tory party's split over Europe, and the signs that similar (if less intense) divisions are latent in the Labour Party, show how far that is from being true.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Collectively, Britain remains emotionally at arm's length from Europe: the very word still means "them" more often than it means "us". The comic aspects of this posture--as when the Tory government sought to blame "Europe" for Britain's mad cow scare--should not disguise the harm it may do. A discussion about Europe's future is going on. Britain should be fully engaged in that discussion, not jeering uselessly from the sidelines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scepticism about the course set for Europe by the Maastricht treaty is fully warranted. History may judge that the European Community (as it then was) took a wrong turn when, in response to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, it sought to integrate more deeply rather than, as a higher priority, prepare itself to accept new members. Moreover, this decision came not in response to the demands of citizens, but was the expression of a grand political strategy. Public opinion was expected to catch up in due course.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficulties that many governments encountered in ratifying the Maastricht treaty--not least, the wafer-thin support for it in the French referendum--showed how ill-advised this top-down approach had been. The lesson from that period for leaders intent on deeper integration ought to have been: go slower, build support first. Judging by the renewed promises in France and Germany to secure monetary union within the Maastricht timetable, despite lukewarm backing at best from their electorates, the lesson has not yet been learned.
<p><b>A place for Britain</b>
<br>So in the debate about the future of the <font size=-1>EU</font>, it is well that Britain's voice should be heard. Its traditional pragmatism, its scepticism about grand designs, and (post-Thatcher) its more liberal instincts on economic policy have much to commend them. Britain should be arguing vigorously, in others' interests as well as its own, for several things.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most urgently, the <font size=-1>EU</font> needs to produce a working definition of "subsidiarity". Following the Maastricht-ratification trauma, various attempts were made to lend substance to the idea, to appease those who feared that the treaty moved too much power to Europe's centre. But the thinking remains vague, albeit much wordier than before, and it continues to emphasise the "effectiveness" of policy as a criterion for deciding where power should reside. A better formula would define subsidiarity in terms that would take powers to the centre only when that was absolutely necessary, not merely when it was "more effective".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A definition along these lines, once developed, should be written into a simple new constitution for the <font size=-1>EU</font>. That would have other merits. The doctrine of "ever closer union" for all the members served its purpose during the years when the European Community was under construction. But a point must come, and probably now has, when such an idea costs more in destabilising existing arrangements than it gains in improving them. In other words, a point must come when Europe's union is close enough. A constitution would be obliged to define that point, and would require governments to build a consensus around it. As part of that exercise, defects of the present regime could be addressed--in particular, the widening of the "democratic deficit", as powers have moved to the centre without adequate accountability to citizens. Beyond that, the implications of "variable geometry"--the idea that in future some countries will integrate more closely than others--also need to be thought through.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On constitutional matters like these, Britain should be arguing its corner. Similarly on matters of policy--the future of the common agricultural policy (<font size=-1>CAP</font>), the Union's external trade relations, co-operation on defence, enlargement, you name it--Britain's voice should be heard. But Britain cannot expect its sceptical-liberal instincts or the merits of its particular arguments to be warmly recognised by its partners unless the country regards itself as a settled member of the club. After all these years, it still isn't. Britain's prevailing attitude often seems one of sneering contempt for all things continental. Lately, national politics has stirred such ideas even more to the surface. Much of the commentary on Europe offered by Tory Euro-sceptics and their supporters in the media is outright xenophobia. In the country's discussion of Europe since the government's humiliation in the <font size=-1>EMS</font> crisis of 1992, a puerile and insufferable smugness about Britain has once again become not merely respectable but fashionable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such sentiments are damaging as well as ugly. Warranted scepticism about further ambitions for European integration needs to be balanced by an understanding of the gains Britain has had from the European project. The greatest of these--long neglected only because the European Community allowed one to take it for granted--is security. A region riven this century by two appalling wars is now one of the safest parts of the world. Beside that immense prize the economic achievements of European integration are bound to seem small, but by any other yardstick they too are impressive. Trade in Europe has grown enormously since the 1970s, expanding opportunities for businesses and consumers alike. Britain has fared especially well lately, because its position within the <font size=-1>EU</font>, together with its friendly business climate, has attracted a lot of inward investment (see <a href="chart10.gif">chart 10</a>).
<p><b>By jingo</b>
<br>That many in Britain welcome these achievements so grudgingly, if at all, doubtless says more about post-imperial chagrin than it does about the defects of the <font size=-1>EU</font>. As a medium-sized economic and military power, Britain still has some growing up to do. But what a dilemma this poses at the next election. A substantial minority of Tories is intellectually paralysed by its hatred of "Europe". It is hard to imagine a Tory government advancing with any success a sensible agenda for reform of Europe's policies and institutions--simply because the good faith of any Tory government is bound to be questioned, and rightly, by other Europeans.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, New Labour seems a much better bet. Its proto-manifesto says: "If we can build alliances with those in Europe who share our views we can achieve a Europe that is open, outward-looking and anti-protectionist." Gosh, marvellous. Labour also wants reform of the <font size=-1>CAP</font>, greater openness in Europe's institutions and "a far more vigorous approach to the single market". Better and better. But then it goes and spoils everything. At the top of Europe's agenda for reform, says New Labour, should be "action on unemployment".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What? This is not a reference to the need for a Europe-wide monetary policy (reasonably enough, Labour reserves its position on the single currency). So it can only mean that Labour seeks Europe-wide initiatives on labour-market measures aimed to promote employment. This is arrant nonsense. Such measures as may be advisable are either national initiatives (changes in taxes, benefits, education and training) or local (subsidies or other forms of special assistance, say, tailored to meet the needs of a particular area). Europe-wide policy is singularly ill-fitted to play any useful role. Indeed, in so far as the <font size=-1>EU</font> has a Europe-wide policy on labour markets--the social chapter--it is actually a destroyer of jobs; and Labour has said that Britain should surrender its opt-out from it. This implies not merely that Labour fails to understand unemployment but also that it regards a wider range of action for European policy as a good thing in itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A fine choice, then. The Tories have, for the most part, sound anti-statist prejudices and broadly the right economic ideas, but they carry an intellectually and diplomatically debilitating strain of jingoism. Labour seems to have a clearer view of Britain's place in the modern world, but favours damaging interventionist remedies in areas of policy where the <font size=-1>EU</font> has no useful role.

<h1> An <i>Economist</i> manifesto </h1>

<i>A few ideas </i>

<p>FOR the moment, <i>The Economist</i> has no plans to run for office. But you never know. If we were to seek a mandate for government, what might our manifesto say? To begin with, of course, it would deplore the intellectual incoherence and weak leadership of the present government. Tradition demands as much and, on this occasion, the charges are fair. No doubt we would also deplore the intellectual incoherence and dishonest leadership of the main opposition party. Again, one could do no less. As to our own policies, the highlights of our programme would be as follows. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On macroeconomic policy, we would emphasise the folly of risking a rise in inflation for a temporary surge in growth: that way lies higher unemployment. Recognising the bias for inflation that is built into Britain's political culture, we would grant the Bank of England independence to determine interest rates, and give it a statutory duty to keep inflation below 3% a year. (A vote in Parliament could change that target in extraordinary circumstances.) The tradition of levying taxes sufficient to cover spending over the medium term would be revived, not as an end in itself but because it is the best way to keep interest rates down and investment up at any given level of economic activity. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On industrial policy, we could be brief: there wouldn't be one. Our view is that companies themselves are better equipped to make decisions on investment, staffing, location, working practices and the rest than the government. The goal of industrial policy, such as it is, should be to get out of their way. There would be but two small exceptions. We would aim to promote competition more vigorously than the Tories have done. (This would mean, among other things, changing the remit of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission so that its task was defined more narrowly in terms of promoting competition rather than, as at present, balancing that goal against the "public interest".) And we would take further steps to increase (not reduce, as Labour seems to favour) the accountability of managers to shareholders. Beyond that, we would privatise the postal service, the <font size=-1>BBC</font>, and any other enterprises we found remaining in public ownership and/or control. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our priorities in employment policy would be to lower taxes on the working poor, and to institute a marked shift in education spending away from universities (where students would be obliged to pay their own way) and towards vocational training for 16-18-year-olds. No minimum wage, no social chapter, no other initiatives calculated to put people out of work. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We would aim to increase public spending on primary and secondary education. Here, and across the welfare state, "internal markets" would be developed with greater determination, using vouchers and other methods to improve providers' accountability to users. The Tories' policy of squeezing the state pension (which Labour is not pledged to change) would be explicitly embraced as a long term policy of abolition. Personal taxes would be reformed to encourage people to save for their own retirement. In due course, we would introduce a mandatory, state-subsidised, saving-for-retirement scheme, using competing private pension funds. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, and in the long term, we would aim to keep the taxpayer-cost of the welfare state on a gently falling trend as a proportion of national income--an extremely demanding goal that allows for very little growth of spending in real terms. Except in the priority areas of education and training, therefore, pressures of the sort applied since 1979 would need to be maintained or increased. Even then, the scope for lower taxes would be limited. We would concentrate the savings on tax cuts for the low paid, aiming to take gradually increasing numbers out of income tax altogether. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are constitutional reformers. Unlike Labour, and supposing the Scots vote for it in a referendum, we would give Scotland a parliament with matching control over taxes and domestic spending; the rights of Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s to sit and vote at Westminster would be correspondingly curtailed. (Wales would be offered the same arrangement, in the confident expectation that it would not want it.) On Northern Ireland, the constitutional settlement indicated in the government's framework document would be more resolutely pursued. The strategy of allowing the province's political parties to reach such an accord in their own good time would be abandoned: a settlement would be put directly to the people of Northern Ireland in a referendum. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We are sceptical about a bigger role for local government in Britain: many of the traditional tasks of this tier (notably education) can be brought more closely under users', rather than local bureaucrats', control. Elsewhere, it is doubtful that local communities have strong enough identities to support a healthy local politics. But we recognise that it is desirable to foster stronger local communities and would support local initiatives aimed at developing them, provided they were locally financed. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We would introduce a bill of rights and a freedom of information act. We would reform the Commons to increase the power of <font size=-1>MP</font>s, and especially committees of <font size=-1>MP</font>s, in relation to ministers. We regard other proposals for constitutional reform as much less important than measures such as these. Nonetheless, we favour denying hereditary peers the right to sit or vote in the House of Lords; further reform of the Lords would be considered. We will reveal our plans on electoral reform when we see how big our majority is. Labour says: "We have no plans to replace the monarchy." We do. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On Europe, our policy would be one of constructive engagement. We are in the European Union, glad to be there, and have strong views about how it should develop from now on. We regard the single market as a remarkable and valuable achievement, and we wish to see its benefits spread more widely (by including new members in Eastern Europe). Scrapping the common agricultural policy is a top priority. So is liberalising the union's external trade policy. Further political integration is undesirable. Subject to that, we have an open mind on <font size=-1>EMU</font>: even if Britain chooses not to join soon, or ever, we recognise the potential of the project to do good and want it to succeed.
<p><b>Send your contributions to&#160;. &#160;. &#160;.</b>
<br>How such a manifesto might fare in a general election must remain (fortunately) a matter for speculation. With apologies to Liberal Democrats, Scottish Nationalists, Plaid Cymru, Greens and what have you, the big choice that Britain will shortly make will be between another term for the Tories and a new start with New Labour. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>The Economist</i> doesn't have a vote either, but if it did how would we cast it? We disagree with the Tories about many things, but our biggest quarrel with them is over constitutional reform. Their complacency on the subject is deplorable. We also disagree with many of Labour's plans, but especially over industry and employment. In these areas, Labour's policies are much less dangerous than they used to be, but the desire to meddle harmfully (the minimum wage, the social chapter, managers' responsibilities to "stakeholders") has not entirely gone away. For different reasons, we regard both parties as hopelessly unsound on Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that is to speak only of the parties' expressed goals. The choice between the Tories and New Labour is a confusing one because, although the parties affect to despise each other, their policies sound pretty similar. If New Labour's conversion is to be believed, the forthcoming election does not matter much after all. But is it to be believed? By and large, this survey has judged the Tories according to what they have done up to now, and Labour by what they say they will do. Yet ballots are cast on the basis not of what the parties say, but of what people expect them actually to do. In Labour's case, this credibility gap is already large, and may well grow larger.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of those who believe that Mr Blair will yield to the left in office, at least as many will vote Labour on that account as will vote Tory. Labour's traditional supporters, the millions who voted for the party when its policies were crazy, will support it next time in the hope that, once in power, it will drop the modish new talk about enterprise and initiative and get down to its rightful business of soaking the rich. If Labour wins, it will be because those voters act in concert with others, courted so assiduously by Mr Blair, who believe that the party will not relapse. To hold such a curious coalition together until polling-day would be a political masterstroke: to maintain it much beyond then would require a political genius.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But perhaps Mr Blair <i>is</i> a political genius. Without a doubt, what appeals most about New Labour is that the party is superbly led. Mr Blair is forceful and passionate. His manner, if not his manifesto, radiates purpose and conviction. John Major may have broadly the right policies (as New Labour seems to agree), but as a leader he is a sorry sight. The harder he tries to project a big idea--and he has had so many--the more ridiculous he becomes. The country is sick of him and so, frankly, are we. Who gets our vote? We're still thinking about it, but we will be sure to let you know in good time.

<h1>The birth of a new species</h1>


<i>Software is a booming industry controlled by giants. But the Internet is changing the rules to favour the small and nimble, argues Christopher Anderson</i>

<p>ABOUT 570m years ago, in the ancient oceans of the early earth, something odd happened. In the space of just a few million years, the seas, which had previously held only microscopic organisms, exploded with a huge variety of life, from a metre-long armoured slab of a fish with a mouth like a rubbish disposal chute to a bizarre beast that walked on 14 stilts and had seven mouths on stalks. For the next few hundred million years, evolution progressed at its usual stately pace. Then, 225m years ago, something else odd happened. Perhaps an asteroid hit the planet; scientists cannot agree. Whatever it was, it caused 96% of marine species to disappear and dinosaurs to appear. There followed another uneventful interval, until 65m years ago it was suddenly out with the dinosaurs and in with the large mammals, including, eventually, man.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sort of progression, described beautifully in Stephen Jay Gould's "Wonderful Life", is called "punctuated equilibrium". Over millions of years species adapt to fill every imaginable niche. Then along comes some external force--a volcano, an asteroid, an ice age--that changes all the niches and launches a mad scramble for survival. Evolution favours new forms of life that, through a sort of biological lateral thinking, can find a whole new way to thrive. Wings, legs, lungs: all were revolutionary mutations once. Life down the ages has tended to evolve in sudden great leaps, separated by long periods of slow change.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same is true for technology, though the time scale is a little more compressed. In the past half-century, computer technology has evolved in three large jumps, each one followed by an explosion of new companies, a period of rapid change, and then the gradual emergence of a few dominant species that rule until the next digital disturbance. Jos&eacute; Ortega y Gasset, a Spanish philosopher, once said that "a revolution lasts only 15 years, a period that coincides with the effectiveness of a generation." As it happens, computer revolutions have taken place at roughly the same intervals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Start around 1950, with the <font size=-1>IBM</font> mainframe, when the term "data processing" entered the language. The next big upheaval came in the mid-1960s, when the minicomputer arrived to open the computing market to a host of upstarts such as Digital Equipment, and programmers--the spiritual fathers of today's code geeks--started to abandon their ties. Then, in 1981, <font size=-1>IBM</font> introduced the personal computer, causing a market explosion from which emerged some of today's strongest companies: Intel, Microsoft, Compaq.
</p><p><b>Tomorrow's dinosaurs</b>
<br>Now the time has come round for another shock, duly delivered in the shape of the Internet, which has emerged practically overnight from 25 years of boffin obscurity into the light of mass-media ubiquity. It was made possible by the serendipitous convergence of three technological developments: the spread of <font size=-1>PC</font>s and computer networks in offices; a rapid drop in communications costs; and the appearance of the World Wide Web, a brilliantly simple way of linking multimedia documents around the world over the Internet. But there was nothing planned about it: it grew, organically, simply because people used it, each adding to its reach and depth by virtue of the parts of their world they brought to it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet will shake up plenty of established industries, from telecoms to travel. It is everywhere, it is cheap, and it is, above all, open. For the price of a dinner for two a month, any company can now reach the world through a virtual shopfront on the Internet that will look just as impressive as the one used by General Motors. Cheap, global data communications will shape the 21st century as much as the telephone did the 20th.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Doerr, one of Silicon Valley's leading venture capitalists, has calculated that the introduction of the <font size=-1>PC</font> caused the largest creation of wealth in the history of the planet; just Microsoft, Intel and Compaq between them have a market valuation of $130 billion, more than all the film studios in Hollywood, or all of America's television and cable companies. Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, one of the computer industry's most respected analysts, reckons that the Internet has the potential to become even bigger.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The starting point for realising that potential is the software industry. The Internet is mostly software. The big advantage of today's digital world is that machines--from <font size=-1>PC</font>s to telecoms networks--can assume radically different shapes when they are colonised by new code. The Internet consists largely of the existing telephone and office data networks linked up by Internet software, which runs over their lines and equipment. Just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> was little more than an exotic novelty before the appearance of Lotus <font size=-1>1-2-3</font>, a spreadsheet that helped to change companies, so the Internet lay in the shadows until the arrival of software that could give it wings, from Web browsers to Internet telephones, payment schemes and search services.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But just as software has transformed the Internet, so the Internet will transform software. This is not just because software is the ultimate information industry, tailor-made for distribution through the digital ether. Software has also reached its dinosaur age, ripe for transformation. The success of Microsoft, Oracle, <font size=-1>IBM</font>/Lotus, Computer Associates and other giants marks out a relatively mature industry, as rooted in the past as in the future (see <a href="tsu442.gif">table</a>). For example, to maintain compatibility with older programs, Windows 95 must include millions of lines of code carrying the ghost of Windows past, and of the <font size=-1>DOS</font> operating system before it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With revenues of more than $200 billion and a growth rate of some 13% a year, software is one of the world's largest and fastest-growing industries. Even so, it has recently been in danger of becoming a rather dull and closed club. In the early 1980s, when the <font size=-1>PC</font> was still new, the niches it opened up seemed innumerable. In 1983 Philippe Kahn, then a recent arrival in America from France, started Borland, a programming-tools company, by convincing a computer magazine to run his ad on credit. A month later, he had 100,000 orders and the beginnings of a company that would at its peak be worth $2.1 billion. Making software did not require a factory, just an idea and a computer. It was an exciting time when many software fortunes were started up. Today the tally includes half a dozen dollar billionaires and several thousand millionaires.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But for most of the 1990s, software has increasingly been dominated by big companies making big, complicated programs. At a time when the operating system that comes with each <font size=-1>PC</font> already includes a word processor, e-mail, all the disk utilities you might ever need, and even a few games, it has become hard to imagine much of a role for a handful of enthusiasts in the proverbial garage.

</p><p><b>Glamour stock</b>
<br>Now, suddenly, the fun is back. Last August Netscape Communications, a software firm then 14 months old, went public, triggering a stockmarket frenzy that at its height valued the firm at $6.7 billion--before it had made a single dime. Software firms that had not even existed two years earlier, such as CyberCash, Yahoo, Spyglass, Spry and Ubique, commanded huge sums as they went public or were bought by established firms. Broadview Associates, a consultancy, in 1995 recorded mergers and acquisitions worth $28 billion in the software and related services industry, a rise of more than 60% on the year before. Venture capital investments in software firms hit $1.2 billion, up 57% (see <a href="csu343.gif">chart</a>). Nobody knows just how many software firms have been founded in the past year, but everybody is sure it must be more than 1,000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Put it down to the Internet. It will change the software industry even more, this survey will argue, than the <font size=-1>PC</font> did a decade and a half ago. Just like the <font size=-1>PC</font> then, the Internet is a new "platform"--a fundamental technology on which a new market can be built. Platforms are not unique to the computer world: in the entertainment industry, for example, they include television and music <font size=-1>CD</font>s. All these are technological standards for products that will work everywhere the medium extends.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A new platform by itself will not necessarily cause a revolution. Attics are full of odd computers that did not take off, along with digital audio tape, laser discs and other failures. New platforms are often troubled early on by a nasty chicken-and-egg problem: consumers will not buy them until lots of compatible products are available, and companies will not develop compatible products until they see a market. But the platforms that succeed can change the way most of us live. Once <font size=-1>VHS</font> had conquered Betamax in the videotape-standards war, sales skyrocketed. Within 15 years, more than three-quarters of American households had a video recorder. <font size=-1>CD</font> players took off even faster.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>PC</font> won acceptance because it was backed by a then-mighty <font size=-1>IBM</font>. Mostly by accident, the Internet has taken a stealthier tack. It achieved near-ubiquity on the back of existing computer and communications networks in part because it offered a uniform way to connect otherwise incompatible computers. Just as a modem turns a regular telephone line into a data link, the Internet turned the world's telephone networks into an information highway, without much extra effort or expense. Only now, with critical mass already attained, is this network revealed as a platform, too.

<h1>Back to the garage</h1>


<i>The best software revolutions start small</i>

<p>THE boffins in Switzerland who invented the World Wide Web in 1991 did not see fit to include such frivolities as clickable pictures or sound. It was a tool for scientists, who after all could read. Text was quite good enough, and would avoid wasting the Internet's scarce transmission capacity with graphics files simply for decoration.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took a 23-year-old programmer at the University of Illinois called Marc Andreessen to cast a vote for the common man. In 1993 he developed Mosaic, a multimedia Web "browser" that made it easy to view documents on the Web and jump between them. It was the first piece of Internet software to recognise that the network's future lay not with scientists but with ordinary people, who liked their information dressed up in multimedia frills. A year later Mr Andreessen joined up with Jim Clark, a wealthy computer industry entrepreneur, to launch Netscape and jump-start the Internet software market. Netscape's sophisticated browser quickly came to dominate the market (it has a share of more than 80% today), and is now a de-facto standard.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As more and more companies, from banks to airlines, began to offer their products and services on the Web, the technology grew with the demand: documents began to look as good as paper, and then better, with animation and interactivity. Users began to realise that the Web could be a place to work, not just a way to distribute information. Already some investment firms let their customers manage their portfolios remotely via Web pages. Companies allow their employees to monitor their pensions the same way. In "intranets" within firms, Web browsers are being used to retrieve information from databases of all sorts, from customer records to inventories.

</p><p><b>Happy browsing</b>
<br>The attraction is simplicity. The language of the Web, known as <font size=-1>HTML</font>, is a "cross-platform" standard, a universal tongue, understood just as readily in the Windows and Macintosh worlds as by Unix workstations. The same is true of the Internet as a whole. Together, the network and its multimedia face have opened up a new way of computing, where the type of computer on your desk matters less than your connection to the Internet. In this world most information is stored and generated on powerful machines known as "servers" somewhere in the network. Your <font size=-1>PC</font>, running a browser, is simply a window on that world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape's browsers already run on most desktop computers. But similar browsers from other companies run on all sorts of other devices, from Philips video-games machines and Nokia's newest cellular telephones, to a "Network Computer" being developed by Oracle to sell at less than $500, and interactive television "set-top boxes". You might not want to run a spreadsheet on most of them, but people who need to run spreadsheets tend to have <font size=-1>PC</font>s already. These other machines have advantages the <font size=-1>PC</font> lacks. Some are cheap, some fit in a jacket pocket, and some play great games. No wonder computer visionaries such as George Gilder are prophesying the advent of a new computing world, less dominated by the <font size=-1>PC</font> or by a desktop computer of any kind: the Internet is not fussy about machinery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few years ago, when Federal Express wanted to give its customers the tools to track packages in real time, it had to develop software for their computers (in separate Windows and Macintosh versions), promote it, distribute disks, and arrange a network of dial-in numbers for customers to call. But when the Web came along, FedEx simply hitched the same database to a Web site, with nothing like the sort of effort it took to develop its own software. Now customers use whatever browser they have on whatever computer they are using to reach the Web site by whatever means they usually gain access to the Internet. No matter how they get there, the site looks and works the same: there is no new software to learn.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By moving to a cross-platform, open computing standard, FedEx was able to get out of the desktop software development business, the telecommunications business and the software distribution business, none of which it wanted to be in, to concentrate on what it does best: shipping packages (although it still has to offer the old proprietary software for customers who are not on the Internet). Customers now track more than 13,000 packages a day on the Web site.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Netscape, this and similar stories from other companies looked like the emergence of a new platform. The further computing moved away from the <font size=-1>PC</font> and to the Web, the more Netscape's browser, not Microsoft's operating system, became the key link. Netscape claimed that Windows would eventually be reduced to an obscure bit of necessary plumbing in a <font size=-1>PC</font>, just as Windows subsumed <font size=-1>DOS</font>. Or, as Mr Andreessen once tauntingly predicted, the rise of the browser will turn Windows into "a partially debugged device driver", by implication downgrading Microsoft's beloved <font size=-1>PC</font> to the status of a printer or monitor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This tapped into a discontent already brewing in the software world. Over the past decade or so, many companies have switched from mainframes and minicomputers to <font size=-1>PC</font>s, in the hope that putting computing power directly into the hands of users would somehow unleash their creativity and make them more productive. It probably helped, even though the gains are hard to measure. What is showing up very clearly, however, is an unexpected side-effect: <font size=-1>PC</font>s have made life a lot tougher for corporate systems managers.

</p><p><b>Control freaks</b>
<br>In the days of the mainframe, programs ran from a central computer in some glass-enclosed room. Users simply had "dumb terminals" on their desks. The centralised control this implied may now be out of fashion with the management gurus, but for the systems managers it was bliss. There was just one copy of each program and just one configuration, safely locked out of reach of meddlesome users. Technicians did not have to spend their weekends moving from desk to desk upgrading software or fixing problems. And the software was often simpler, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, entire consulting industries have grown up to tackle the complexities of huge "client-server" systems. Some managers reckon that moving from a mainframe system to <font size=-1>PC</font>s can require a doubling of the support staff; the costs can add up to $6,000-8,000 a year for each <font size=-1>PC</font>. "While decentralised client-server computing was supposed to lower <font size=-1>IT</font> costs, the opposite has happened," argues the International Centre for Information Technologies in Stockholm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, <font size=-1>PC</font> users seem caught in a pincer movement of rising costs and falling rewards. Software companies make a good part of their money by coaxing users into buying new versions of their programs every other year or so, promising new features to those who upgrade and implicitly holding out the threat of incompatibility to those who do not. It is hard to say no. Yet each new version is bigger and uses up more computing power, eventually forcing the user to buy a new <font size=-1>PC</font> just to maintain performance at the same level.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the mid-1980s, Intel has released five processing chips, each more powerful than its predecessor. Over the same period, Microsoft has released four progressively bigger upgrades to its operating system. Yet the average user, having invested, say, $10,000 in new hardware and software over the past decade, may wonder what he has to show for it. True, his word processor is easier to use, and the screen looks better, but it works no faster than it did at the start. The cost of replacing a "delete" key with a picture of a rubbish bin has been high.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the saying goes in the industry, "Intel giveth, and Microsoft taketh away." This unholy alliance certainly helps the sales of those two companies, along with those of the rest of the computer industry; but with many users beginning to wonder whether <font size=-1>PC</font>s were really such a good investment after all, enthusiasm is growing for a move away from the desktop. That does not mean a return to the mainframe. What users have in mind instead is a half-way house in which information is held and often processed on large, shared machines, but viewed and used on personal ones, and accessed via an open network that encourages all the collaboration, communication and information-sharing that management theorists hold so dear. In a word, the Internet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is splendid in theory, but somewhat less magnificent in practice, for two reasons. The first is that, as anyone who has used the Internet can attest, tasks involving travel along a network tend to take longer than on your own desktop; that is the cost of a shared resource. Secondly, it is worth recalling why the <font size=-1>PC</font> became so popular in the first place: it allowed users to work out their own ways of doing things, rather than just choosing between options predetermined by someone else.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conventional Web pages, convenient as they are, are essentially no more flexible than the old mainframe terminal screens. In the spring of 1995, however, Sun Microsystems, a workstation maker, came up with the missing link: a computer language called Java that was designed explicitly for networks. It is a way of writing small programs, each designed to do a single task, that reside in the network until needed. When you click on a Java-enabled Web page, one or many of these "applets" is downloaded to your machine, where it runs. It could be something as simple as an animation or as complicated as a mini-spreadsheet.

</p><p><b>Less palaver with Java</b>
<br>Whereas Web pages are static documents, Java applets are real programs that you can control like any other software. Once they are downloaded, they run locally on your <font size=-1>PC</font>, largely free of the network's delays. You request only the applets you need, which will be no bigger than they need to be to do their one job. When you are done with them, they can be disposed of, or your <font size=-1>PC</font> can store them to save the downloading next time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Best of all, you may not even notice they are there: content and software can be seamlessly merged. When you click on an analyst's company report, it seems only natural that the company's share price and latest financial results should pop up in a chart that can be manipulated, or that news headlines on the firm should scroll underneath. These are Java applets, working automatically in the background. They point the way to the future of computing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Computer languages come and go without sparking revolutions. Java is different, because it is more than a language. It is also, in a strange way, itself a computer. The applets that zip down the line when you click on a Java-enabled page are not written in the usual sort of code that processor chips can understand. They have to be decoded by a special program on your computer, known as a "Java virtual machine" that translates them into instructions the computer can understand. To the Java applet, the sort of physical hardware it has landed in does not matter; it need talk only to the virtual machine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This method has two main advantages. The first is protection from computer viruses: Java applets have no access to the computer itself, but can do only what the virtual machine lets them do. The second is that Java is an agnostic in the holy wars of the operating systems. Like the Web's <font size=-1>HTML</font>, Java is a cross-platform language; the same applet will work on any computer running a Java virtual machine. These programs are already part of the Netscape browser for the <font size=-1>PC</font>, Unix machines and the Macintosh, and are now being written for Oracle's Network Computer and other similar machines.
</p><p><b>All you need is an idea</b>
<br>For the software industry, the arrival of the Internet was the blinding flash of an <font size=-1>H</font>-bomb. Java is the shock wave that follows, toppling buildings and flattening trees. The language has suddenly opened the industry wide for start-up software companies again (see <a href="csu341.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a market dominated by Microsoft, small firms found the barriers had been raised too high. They could not afford the huge teams needed to write massive programs. They did not have the marketing clout to compete with Microsoft's brand, nor the distribution clout to win scarce shelf-space in the shops. If they chose to develop software for any computer other than the <font size=-1>PC</font>, perhaps to avoid competing head-on with Microsoft, they were stuck with a small and probably shrinking market. And even if they did find a market, they quickly had to move into the cycle of perpetual upgrades to keep making money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Java, and Internet software like it, promises to lower the barriers again. Because it is designed for small programs meant for specific tasks, a single person can develop a useful applet in a few weeks. Since Java applets typically live in the network, to be downloaded on demand, distribution or shelf-space is no problem. And the emerging technologies for Internet commerce suggest a whole new set of ways of selling software, from pay-per-use to pass-along revenues from information services firms which might, for example, include Java portfolio-management software with share prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;James Breyer, a venture capitalist with Silicon Valley's Accel Partners, reckons that 90% of the business plans that cross his desk these days are Internet-related; 90% of those are focused on Java. With Java-enabled Netscape browsers already sitting on millions of desktops, the market for Java software is huge, and not just for new companies. Micromuse, a British software firm, is developing its next-generation network-management tools in Java. Applix and MarketVision, two firms that make financial software for the zoo of workstations that populate trading floors, are switching to Java: it is the easiest way for them to make their offerings accessible to the greatest range of computers without the cost of multiple teams of programmers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the enthusiasm, Java is no instant panacea. For a start, some technical hitches remain to be resolved. Before most software is shipped, it is compiled into a code that a processor chip can understand. Java, however, is translated line-by-line by the virtual machine as it arrives. That means it can be as much as ten times slower than conventional software. Several companies are developing "just-in-time compilers" that can shrink the difference to a factor of two or less, but Java will never be the fastest language around.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Java is also still incomplete. To put together a Java application that has all the bells and whistles of a full-featured Windows program, you would have to cheat by using part of Microsoft's operating system. This would not work on other computers, wiping out much of Java's advantage. Plenty of companies are working on Java versions of these gadgets on various computers, but Java's cross-platform strength may become a liability if the software is reduced to the capabilities of the least powerful device it might run on (a cellular telephone?).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, the enthusiasm for the language suggests that, one way or another, most of these problems will be solved. Java has the hearts and minds of thousands of developers, just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> did 15 years ago. Even Microsoft cannot resist this tide. It has announced that it will build a Java virtual machine into the next versions of Windows, and is subsuming its own prize languages and software technology into a package, called ActiveX, that is built around a Java core. Apple and its partners are doing the same with the Mac operating system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Silicon Valley and software hotspots around the world, the Internet, the Web and Java have lit a fire that is burning on pure geek energy. "We've never seen anything like this," marvels Mr Breyer. Everyone, it seems, has an idea, and starting a company these days requires little more than that. Bill Gross, a software entrepreneur, set up the Idealab early this year when he realised that he and his friends had some 20 ideas between them, each of them good enough to support a stand-alone firm. He has spun out three of them so far. Charles Cohn gave up a high-powered job as a partner at McKinsey, a consultancy, to head CitySearch, one of the new companies. He is sleeping on the floor of a shared house and has not been paid in seven months. He could not be happier. "It's really exciting. All the big franchises and fortunes are up for grabs again," he says.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These adrenaline-fired young entrepreneurs are the foundation of a new industry, just as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and their friends were in the late 1970s. But first they must work out how to make it pay.

<h1>Teatime</h1>

<p><p>FOR a glimpse of the new software industry, turn to a rosy-cheeked 28-year-old in a rented San Francisco office, wearing a Toy Story <font size=-1>T</font>-shirt. This is Karl Jacob, the chief executive of Dimension <font size=-1>X</font>, a thoroughly modern software company, right down to its <i>Zeitgeist</i>-friendly name.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dimension <font size=-1>X</font> is an archetypal Java start-up. Just 15 months old, it has already grown from the original seven people to 28 (average age: about 25), and is now looking for bigger office space, perhaps a few dozen blocks across San Francisco to SoMa, where dozens of similar young software and "new-media" firms have colonised the lofts of an old industrial district. The firm makes Java animation tools for companies designing Web sites and entertainment software. Like others in the Java league, Dimension <font size=-1>X</font>'s first order of business was to find a caffeine beverage to name its products after. Symantec had taken "Caf&eacute;", Borland "Latte", Applix "Espresso", Natural Intelligence "Roaster", and Microsoft and Cadis had played the even more recondite island-near-Java card with "Jakarta" and "Krakatoa", respectively. Dimension <font size=-1>X</font> was left with "Tea", which it reverse-engineered to stand for The Easy Animator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like many young software firms, Dimension <font size=-1>X</font> started off by consulting for other companies to help pay the bills. While it designed custom-made Java Web sites for its clients, it was also building its own, stand-alone, tools. Mr Jacob funded the early days by tracking down old friends from college, of the sort that had once said over a beer, "If you ever do anything interesting, give me a call." They did not know much about computers, much less the Internet, but they knew Mr Jacob, and that was enough.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the time came for a second round of financing, Mr Jacob wanted more than money. He looked for people who had invested in similar Internet ventures before, and could also bring contacts and advice. Since the next step for this sort of firm is a public offering, which in the current Internet frenzy might value the firm at hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr Jacob knew he needed to bolster his business team too. He thought he was a pretty well-qualified chief executive, having started his management career in the hardest of all jobs, running his fraternity house at university. And the finance director, he notes with pride, "is in his 30s". But he is now adding more grown-ups, including a marketing person who has actually worked in a big computer company.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a crowded space with more computers than windows, Mr Jacob counts the reasons why this is such a good time to be a young software company. The first advantage, not to put too fine a point on it, is "the hype". Java is the hottest thing in the software industry right now, and a sure way for a start-up to get money and attention. Second, software houses are happily riding the wave of innovation that the Internet has set off. Every day brings new Java tools and opportunities, making Dimension <font size=-1>X</font>'s job easier and the company's potential market bigger.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The final advantage is generational: a feeling for what tomorrow's media consumers are going to want. Today's software is mostly worthy, useful stuff: spreadsheets and the like. But tomorrow's software will increasingly be an integral part of the media stream: less balance book, more "Beavis and Butthead". The point is not to replicate television on a computer, but to add a computer's responsiveness to media of all sorts. "People can't stand being in a room with a 15-year-old and a <font size=-1>TV</font>," says Mr Jacob. "It's click, click, click. But they don't want to click faster, they want to control the flow." What those 15-year-olds want is interactivity--just what the Web and Java do best.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dimension <font size=-1>X</font>'s twentysomethings do not watch much <font size=-1>TV</font> these days, Mr Jacob says. Instead, they have "bookmarks"--pointers to dozens of favourite Web sites. If short attention spans and an insatiable desire to click on things are the lasting cultural imprint of the 1990s, Dimension <font size=-1>X</font> and the hundreds of software start-ups like it will be on to a very good thing.

<h1>The tyranny of success&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</h1>


<i>.&#160;.&#160;. and the success of tyranny.
Microsoft knows both


</i><p>THE <font size=-1>PC</font> Forum, an annual conference that attracts some of the biggest names in the computer industry, is a hard place to get noticed, especially if you are a relatively obscure economist. It is a place for networking and deal-making, where the industry's big wheels get together to schmooze. Yet when Brian Arthur reached the podium to give his speech last year he had to utter only one word to freeze a hundred conversations in mid-sentence: "Microsoft". Bill Gates and his empire command fear, respect and curiosity in the world he helped create. Microsoft dominates the software world like no other company in a major consumer industry. More than three-quarters of <font size=-1>PC</font> "productivity applications"--the largest packaged-software category, including word processors, spreadsheets and databases--sold today comes from its campus in Redmond, Washington. Even Coca-Cola only has half-of the soft-drinks market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Microsoft announces that it is entering a new software category, it causes panic among the incumbents. WordPerfect and Lotus once had seemingly unassailable domination of word processing and spreadsheets, their respective categories. But when Microsoft released its own Windows products, it cleverly bundled them into Office, a "suite" that cost less than half as much together as its stand-alone competitors apart. Today Microsoft has 90% of that market, and both Lotus and WordPerfect have been bought by other firms. Over the years Microsoft has expanded the definition of an operating system to include dozens of functions, from back-up utilities to e-mail software, that were once the profitable domain of independent companies, some of which have now gone bust.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No wonder some of Microsoft's competitors look on it as a force of evil in the industry. They claim that it unfairly exploits its ownership of the <font size=-1>PC</font> operating system in a hundred little ways (for example, by including secret parts of Windows that help its own applications). Never mind that these charges usually evaporate under scrutiny: much of the software world is convinced that Microsoft simply does not play fair. For most of the 1990s, companies have been badgering America's antitrust authorities with complaints about Microsoft's alleged monopolistic abuses. Yet a series of investigations by the Justice Department (and later the competition authorities of the European Union) have turned up little of substance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the complaints are sour grapes from lesser companies. But Microsoft does play rough, and some of its technology decisions do look suspicious (installing Windows 95 and The Microsoft Network, for example, can disable rival on-line services). The battles have left a cloud over Redmond. Much of the enthusiasm for Netscape, network computers and Java is generated by the fact that they are simply Not Microsoft.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even Microsoft's customers, who have seen their computing headaches diminish with the company's ascendancy, think of Microsoft as the firm they "hate to love, not love to hate", in the words of Forrester Research, a consultancy. A <font size=-1>PC</font> that runs nothing but Office, Windows 95 and other Microsoft software is easy to set up and will probably work well. But if such convenience comes at the cost of squeezing competitors out of business, thus stifling innovation, only Microsoft wins in the long run. Customers know that choice, even if it comes with complexity, is worth preserving.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may explain why so many industry pundits claim, perhaps wishfully, that the day in August 1995 when Windows 95 was released marked Microsoft's peak: not, perhaps, in absolute terms (the firm continues to grow at an extraordinary rate) but in sheer industry dominance. The arguments to support the claim come in two parts. First, the pundits say, Microsoft has conquered all the easy ground already: as its traditional markets become saturated, growth will become slower and less profitable. Second, they continue, the Internet changes everything. It will turn Microsoft's operating-system advantages into so much surplus baggage, slowing it as nimble newcomers sprint ahead.
</p><p><b>Thinking the unthinkable</b>
<br>To consider the decline of Microsoft today seems almost perverse. After all, the company has never done better: it is on track for net profits of over $2 billion, a rise of more than 40%, on sales of over $8 billion this year. It has some of the cleverest programmers in the industry, and still seems able to attract the best talent. Its products, although in most categories not the best, come a very close second. Some of its smaller bets have failed, such as its backing for interactive <font size=-1>TV</font> software, a version of Windows for telephones and fax machines, and a cartoon-like interface called "Bob". But the big bets usually pay off. Windows 95 may not have matched its hype, but it is undeniably a success.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet <font size=-1>IBM</font> also looked good when the <font size=-1>PC</font> was born in 1981. The Internet amounts to another such revolution, which Microsoft must face at the same time as its traditional businesses are starting to slow. Just as <font size=-1>IBM</font> is still a huge and profitable company today, so Microsoft is likely to continue to prosper. But over the next decade its domination of the industry will become increasingly hard to maintain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For most of Microsoft's history it has grown between 30% and 40% a year, almost always faster than the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry as a whole, itself one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Wall Street is counting on more of the same. Were Microsoft to slow to, say, the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry's expected growth rate of 18% this year (great for most companies, but half Microsoft's usual rate), the share price might slide. Yet stock options are one of the carrots that Microsoft uses to attract the brightest software engineers and get them to give up all semblance of a life. More than 2,000 Microsoft employees have become millionaires that way. If the share price were to stop rising, let alone fall, the 14-hour days might seem a lot less bearable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a sense, the company has been too successful. It is approaching saturation in its core markets, and no new markets as lucrative as the Office suite (which now generates more than a third of the company's revenues) have emerged (see <a href="csu396.gif">chart</a>). Virtually all new <font size=-1>PC</font>s are already sold with Microsoft's operating systems. There is no market in suites left to take from other firms, and most of the biggest corporate customers already have all the word processors and spreadsheets they need (more than half of new <font size=-1>PC</font>s sold to companies are now replacements).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the past few years, Microsoft's main growth plan has been to encroach further on the "client-server" turf: the industrial-strength software (such as large databases and internal communications software) that runs big companies. When earlier this year Microsoft put the finishing touches to its "BackOffice" package of database and communications software, there was none of the Windows 95 razzmatazz; the corporate world is a conservative place. But Windows <font size=-1>NT</font>, Microsoft's operating system for servers--computers that hold data and programs to be shared across a company--is starting to take off; sales have doubled over the past year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, rich though the client-server market may be, it is harder going than the <font size=-1>PC</font> productivity applications were. The competition in this big-business market is tougher (from <font size=-1>IBM</font> to Oracle), the buyers more cautious and demanding, and the growth slower. Microsoft is already winning market share, but not without a large investment of time and effort, at a time when it can least afford to take its eyes off the Internet.
</p><p><b>The beam in Microsoft's eye</b></b>
<br>As Microsoft marshalled its troops for this assault on the corporate ramparts, it almost missed what was happening on the public networks under its nose. Not until the winter of 1993, when a Microsoft employee sent back a memo from Cornell University reporting that ordinary students there were more wired than Microsoft's own engineers, did Mr Gates consider the possibility that the Internet, though not invented on his own campus, might have to be taken seriously. Even so, it took Microsoft another two years to grasp what the Internet might do to its business unless it embraced radical change.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For example, the company introduced the Microsoft Network with great fanfare in August last year, even though both the network and its content were based on proprietary standards, closed to others on the Internet. It was a curious mistake, especially since established on-line services had already acknowledged that such proprietary networks had no future in a world opened up by the Web.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last December, Microsoft admitted defeat by moving the Microsoft Network and its much-touted publishing tools for developers to the Web, infuriating those companies that had invested their time and money developing content for the network. It licensed Java, and announced that it would be adapting all of its main products, from its word processors to the Windows <font size=-1>NT</font> operating system, to work on the Internet. It has largely delivered on its promise, releasing dozens of new Internet products in an extraordinarily rapid turnaround for such a large firm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft seems at last to have become serious ("hardcore", as Mr Gates puts it) about the Internet. Cynics say this is not so much because of the clarity of its vision but because it is terrified that Netscape and Sun might be right: the Internet really could be a new platform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The very combination of the words "platform" and "Internet" is a red flag to the Microsoft faithful. From Mr Gates downwards, they rubbish the idea that a simple ("trivial", in Mr Gates's language) browser and yet another programming language (and a slow one at that) can seriously be considered a platform. It is easy to see why they find it threatening: Microsoft rose with the <font size=-1>PC</font>, and might fall with it. If the Internet were to become the dominant computing platform, then the <font size=-1>PC</font> would be just one of many machines that can access the Internet. Its relative importance--and sales--would decline, and so would Microsoft's operating-system revenues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it makes sense for Microsoft to preserve the <font size=-1>PC</font>'s--and hence its own--dominance at all costs. It sees little Netscape as one of its most serious threats. When Netscape won the browser market by initially giving away its software, Microsoft developed its own browser and promised to give it away indefinitely. In response to Netscape's success in selling Web server software, Microsoft gave away a Web server with its Windows <font size=-1>NT</font> operating system. And after Netscape licensed Java and built it into its browser, Microsoft went one better by announcing that it would not only build Java into its own browser but that it would integrate it with its own Java-like programming standard for Windows, a package of technologies known collectively as ActiveX. This April it went the full way, agreeing to incorporate Java into Windows itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Microsoft is successful, it will preserve the <font size=-1>PC</font> as the favoured Internet access device, and therefore protect its place on the desktop. But that will not stop the software market from increasingly shifting to the Internet itself. The battle for this market is very different from that in the early days of the <font size=-1>PC</font>. Then, it was winner take all. On the Internet, there may be no single winner at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Mr Andreessen puts it, the <font size=-1>PC</font> had two "control points"--the microprocessor and the operating system. The companies that took the lead there--Intel and Microsoft--have been able to control the pace and direction of the machine's development, usually to their own benefit. Depending on how you look at it, the Internet has either infinitely more such points or none at all. Dozens of companies are trying to set their own standards for everything from telephony to security and electronic commerce. Yet so far the only true standards, from the underlying technology of the network to the basic language of the Web, have been open--developed by committees or academics or otherwise in the public domain. This may not last: the financial rewards for standard-setters are as great on the Internet as anywhere else. But seeing how far the Internet has come without such ownership, it will be hard for anyone, even Bill Gates, to gain as much control of the Internet as Microsoft has of the <font size=-1>PC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft, as it happens, agrees. But it does not think it needs such an advantage to extend its success to the Internet. It rejects the idea that its gains in word processors or spreadsheets had anything to do with its domination of the operating system: it simply sold better products at a better price than its competitors. This is a bit of revisionist history--it discounts, among other things, the cross-subsidies possible when you are assured $50 from the price of virtually every new <font size=-1>PC</font>--but it is more true than the operating-system-as-manifest-destiny version that is painted by its competitors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year, the betting in Silicon Valley was that Netscape was too far ahead and too nimble for Microsoft to catch. Now the geeks have recovered their respect for Mr Gates. Microsoft could still lose: although it has come a long way, it is still about six months behind Netscape. That is a big lead on the Internet, said to move in "dog years" (one for seven). But at least nobody could accuse Microsoft of failing to understand how these markets work.

<h1>Microsoft's media mania</h1>


<p>ON MICROSOFT's sprawling campus, one of the many glass-and-chrome buildings yields an unexpected sight: a big room that looks to all the world like a television newsroom on full alert. It is the morning of April 3rd, and the aeroplane carrying the American secretary of commerce has just crashed. A news director shouts out instructions as reporters hang on the phones and producers hunch over banks of computers to get the story on the air. As it unfolds, a wall full of television monitors shows a live press conference, news channels and satellite feeds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the newsroom of the Microsoft Network (<font size=-1>MSN</font>), and it offers a hint of how serious Microsoft is about moving beyond the software business. Bill Gates may have started his career as a programmer, but he seems to want to end it as a media mogul. If money can buy that, he is well on his way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beyond <font size=-1>MSN</font>, Microsoft has a $400m partnership with <font size=-1>NBC</font>, the television network, to produce <font size=-1>MSNBC</font>, which will include a cable <font size=-1>TV</font> news channel and an Internet news service. It has invested $30m in Dreamworks, Hollywood's newest studio, and is collaborating with Tele-Communications Inc, a cable <font size=-1>TV</font> giant. Last year it hired Michael Kinsley, a former editor of the <i>New Republic</i> (who has also worked on <i>The Economist</i>) to start a political magazine on the Internet. It is planning on-line magazines in several big cities, covering arts and entertainment, and setting up a host of other Internet services, from a car<i>-</i>shopping bazaar to a childcare information centre.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gates exchanges deal-making gossip with such entertainment industry giants as David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, and greatly admires Disney's brand. "Content is king," he writes in his syndicated newspaper column<i>. </i>He studies the economics of the newspaper business and watches the rise of on-line advertising dollars. "We are in essence trying to figure out how to be an interactive media company," explains Peter Neupert, who negotiates Microsoft's content deals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gates's media obsession goes deep, from his voracious reading habits to his admiration for the broadcasting industry. But his confidence in Microsoft's potential in this market comes straight from "Encarta". Microsoft's foray into multimedia encyclopedias has been indisputably successful. Within two years of its release in 1993, Encarta had become the best-selling encyclopedia of any sort, whether on paper or <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, its success seemed almost effortless. Microsoft licensed most of the content from a second-tier encyclopedia maker, then wrote the software to make it easy and fun to use. As sales took off, the lesson seemed clear: traditional firms in this business did not have the understanding or the technical skills to succeed in the computer world. Microsoft did, and beat the experts at their own game. Perhaps the rest of the media world would succumb to the same strategy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or perhaps not. Encarta may simply have been a fluke. Microsoft makes dozens of other education and entertainment <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s, from Microsoft "Dogs" to a wine guide, and none of them is anywhere near as successful. Analysts reckon that, but for Encarta, the division would be losing money. Indeed, the shine even on Encarta may be wearing off: most copies are included free with new <font size=-1>PC</font>s, not bought in stores, and the rest of the encyclopedia industry, jolted by Microsoft's success, has taken a crash course in going digital. Encyclopaedia Britannica, which was hurt most, is now on the Internet. The site may have none of Encarta's multimedia fun, but it does have deep and rich information on any subject--something Microsoft had to scrimp on to make room for the videos on the <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>. In the end, consumers may remember why they wanted an encyclopedia in the first place.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft acknowledges that it knows little about the news business or, for that matter, any other media business. But it does know about software, and it reckons that in tomorrow's interactive world the successful media companies will be those who master both content and technology. And it is betting that it can buy and nurture talent and creativity more easily than traditional media giants can master interactivity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the medium really is the message. But it is early days yet in the Internet revolution, and the media giants have plenty of time to catch on. Meanwhile, in the <font size=-1>MSN</font> newsroom, Mark Pawlowsky, a harried ex-newspaperman, is trying to teach youngsters wearing baseball caps the wrong way round how to be reporters. "We're not a racehorse yet," he says. Microsoft has a lot of money to bet on this experiment, but the odds do not look enticing.

<h1>Doomonomics</h1>


<i>Software is stretching traditional economics

</i><p>WHAT does a chainsaw-toting marine with a taste for blood have to do with the economics of business? Perhaps more than you think. The tale of how "Doom", a drippingly gory computer game, took its creators from obscurity to riches in just four years holds a lesson of striking relevance to tomorrow's information economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In early 1991, three computer-game designers left their jobs at a middle-tier games company and set up shop as id Software in a small office next to a freeway exit in Mesquite, Texas. They had just released a game, "Commander Keen: Invasion of the Vorticons", into the so-called "shareware" market, and wanted to develop other games on their own. Shareware games operate on the free-sample principle. The first few levels of the game can be downloaded from the Internet and played without charge, as a taster. But once hooked, users have to pay extra to get the more difficult levels so they can have even more fun.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Id did modestly well until 1992, when it wrote Wolfenstein 3-<font size=-1>D</font>, a fairly standard blow-away-the-Nazis game souped up with a three-dimensional interface. Millions downloaded the free version, and 250,000 paid for the fancier edition. In late 1993 came Doom, with more gore, lots of demons to kill, and an even better 3-<font size=-1>D</font> interface. It became a global phenomenon, with an estimated 15m people downloading the free game. By now id had become famous, and Doom a recognised addiction. In late 1994 the company released Doom II through regular stores. It has already sold 1.6m copies. Id's founders now drive Ferraris.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Id is not the first company to make a fortune by giving away free samples of its products. But, by harnessing the economics of the software world, it was able to spend less and make more than any company in a traditional industry could hope to. The advantage derives from a basic characteristic of software (and indeed any sort of digital information): making perfect copies and distributing them costs virtually nothing. When it released Doom on the Internet and other computer networks, id let the marketplace do its distribution, marketing, even advertising for it. Its only costs were to write the program in the first place, and to man the telephones to take credit-card numbers when people called to pay for the full version.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape, the leading Internet software company, was sufficiently impressed to adopt the same model to make its mark. It put its browser on the Internet, free to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged others to distribute it widely. Once it dominated the market, it started to charge for the browser and related software. Revenues in its first full year of operation ran to over $80m. Most other Internet companies are following in its path, giving away software to build market share and brand, and then finding some way to make money later.
</p><p><b>The industrial age ends here</b></b>
<br>Id's strange business plan encapsulates the real software revolution: its stretching of a central principle of traditional economics, the law of diminishing returns. This says that, as production expands, every individual producer will eventually find that his costs per unit start to rise. This may happen for a variety of reasons: what matters is that, beyond a certain point, size breeds inefficiency. The result is profound: firms stop growing, and competition can flourish.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Production of software does not appear to obey this rule--or, at any rate, not in a straightforward way. Once a program has been written, it costs next to nothing to manufacture and market. That is why software companies can choose to sell their products very cheaply or indeed give them away. As Doom proved, once market share has been gained, it becomes easier to sell follow-on products at higher prices. Microsoft and others recognised this years ago by offering "competitive upgrades": owners of competing software can buy the Microsoft version at a huge discount. Since each copy costs Microsoft only a tiny fraction of even the discounted price, each sale generates revenue it would not otherwise have had, and produces a new customer who might be persuaded to buy the next upgrade at the full price.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This stretching of the law of diminishing returns has other implications too. In the mid-1980s, Brian Arthur, a Stanford economist, noticed three common factors in the booming computer industry of Silicon Valley. First, software, in common with other high-technology products such as pharmaceuticals, has very high development costs, but very low production costs. Second, networks of users want compatible software. And third, customers, once they have chosen a program, tend to "groove in"; learning to use software takes time, and information is often saved in proprietary file formats, so switching programs is painful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this seemed to Mr Arthur to add up to a different economic model: one of increasing returns. Simply stated, this describes the tendency of market leaders to get even further ahead. The cost of developing a program is the same whether a company sells one copy or 10m. Thus, while the market leader and the followers have the same costs, the leader makes more money. The winning firm can invest that money in developing new products, lengthening its lead. Network effects and customer groove-in further strengthen its hold on the market.

</p><p><b>Winner takes all</b>
<br>Increasing returns is not a new idea. However, Mr Arthur argues that the development of high-technology industry lends it an altogether new significance. This is a controversial position, and for good reasons: an economy ruled by increasing returns is a scary thing to contemplate. Free markets work well because they tend to reach equilibrium, with many companies competing and no one firm dominating for too long. In the world of increasing returns, this equilibrium would seem to break down: the big tend to get bigger without limit. Monopoly power becomes pervasive, and the need for vigorous regulation by government correspondingly great. Indeed, Mr Arthur himself argued in a brief submitted by a group of software companies to America's Justice Department that the effects of increasing returns gave Microsoft unfair monopoly powers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Justice Department--wisely--chose not to prosecute. Software economics is not as threatening as it seems. To understand why, consider it in the traditional two parts: supply and demand. Increasing returns primarily influence the supply side: more market share leads to more profit, which leads to more new products, and so on. Network effects influence demand: the more customers you have, the more you get.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But both have their limitations. On the supply side, the Internet's new economics of production and distribution lower the cost for everyone, and languages like Java will lead to a proliferation of small programs that will be relatively cheap to develop. This will reduce the cost of entering the software market; technological ingenuity and a spirit of innovation will matter more than marketing clout, manpower and other expensive resources. The smaller the initial cost, the smaller the financial advantages of increasing returns.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Increasing returns eventually run out of steam, too. As the previous article argued, Microsoft is reaching saturation in its biggest markets. Climbing from a market share of 98% to 99%--converting the most tenacious hold-outs--costs more than simply riding the rising tide between, say, a share of 60% and 70%. All software products will eventually reach such limits. Diminishing returns still kick in, just later than they might in other industries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the demand side, network effects also have limits--most obviously because not all software is used by people on networks. Games and personal organisers, for example, are generally a matter of personal choice. Where networks are involved, they may be mostly local rather than global ones. One company may settle on Microsoft's Excel as its spreadsheet throughout the firm, but another will choose Lotus <font size=-1>1-2-3</font>. Since spreadsheet files are rarely exchanged between firms, global standards are not an issue. Indeed, Lotus <font size=-1>1-2-3</font> once did have a dominant market share, and lost it to Excel, despite having the force of increasing returns on its side. The same happened to WordPerfect's word processor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Furthermore, network effects hold only until a new technology takes over, changing the entire market. In a world of e-mail and fax, it no longer matters much who controls the telex market. Likewise, American Express's travellers'-cheque network does not count for much when tourists discover that their regular bank cards work around the world. Because the Internet allows technology to proliferate so quickly, these shifts will occur more frequently, knocking incumbents off their network-effect perches.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These factors limit the effect of increasing returns, but do not render them illusory. Costs are lower on the Internet, but not zero; and the Internet, which is nothing but a big computer network, tends to amplify network effects. The more computers are connected, the more their software must work together, and the more software works together, the greater the need for a single standard. In the real world, a telephone need only connect to a standard outlet: any of them will do. On the Internet, "telephones" are intelligent programs that will work only with compatible software; communication is possible only among those that obey the same protocols. Hence the tendency for a market leader to emerge and dominate, at least until the next technology--videophones, say--takes over.
</p><p><b>The software economy</b></b>
<br>The economic implications of the digital revolution extend far beyond the software industry. Any information-based industry will be subject to the same forces as it automates and moves on-line. Banking, for example, has traditionally been a diminishing-returns business. But as banking moves on-line, the work of processing customers' business is done by cheap computers, not expensive staff. The bank that has the greatest reach and can spread its fixed costs over the largest number of customers will be able to offer the best rates and deals, thereby attracting even more customers. Enter increasing returns.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same can be said for all sorts of service industries, from processing insurance-claims forms to managing inventories. Whenever computers and networks can greatly diminish variable costs, volume suddenly becomes all-important: the more the better. What worked for Doom can work for Deutsche Telekom. "Everything's going software," says Mr Arthur, with a gleam in his eye.

<h1>The importance of being American</h1>


<i>Can the rest of the world catch up?

</i><p>IF EVERYTHING is going software, most of the world is in trouble and America is laughing. It makes an estimated three-quarters of the packaged software sold worldwide, worth $100 billion now and growing as the <font size=-1>PC</font> becomes a global standard. The next largest, Britain and Germany, have less than 10% of the market between them. Most of the world's rich countries, and now increasingly some of the poor ones too, have domestic software industries, often with hundreds of companies (see <a href="csu342.gif">chart</a>). But none has even come close to challenging America on the world market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first reason for this imbalance is that software simply follows hardware: America is where computing started and where it has grown fastest. Nearly half the world's computing power is in America, seven times more than in Japan, its closest competitor. America offers software companies a single market of more than 60m <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Germany's <font size=-1>PC</font> market, the second biggest, is no more than a quarter of that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same factors that spawned Silicon Valley's hardware industry are at work in software. America has the largest venture-capital market in the world. It has a stockmarket, Nasdaq, made for small, fast-growing firms. Its various technology meccas have attracted a critical mass of other firms in the computer industry that serve both as suppliers and customers, and provide a source of inspiration and ideas for each other. And on both coasts it has world-class university computer departments and research centres.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's software strength has created its own positive feedback cycle. The international language of computing is English. Non-American software companies with international ambitions have tended to incorporate themselves as American firms simply to be taken seriously (a habit that makes it difficult to get accurate figures of other countries' software strength). Bill Gates has become an American hero. Geeks are cool.
</p><p><b>The new internationalists</b></b>
<br>The Internet, too, is largely an American phenomenon, but it has helped software firms everywhere. By creating a single global market for software, the Internet cuts through many of the distribution and marketing barriers that have kept foreign software firms from making headway in America. And since a company's Web presence often provides no clue to its physical location, firms that market and sell their software on-line no longer have to set up shop in America to be taken seriously.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;VocalTec, <font size=-1>VDO</font>net and CheckPoint are three of the hotter Internet companies, making, respectively, an Internet telephone, video software and security software. Many of their customers may not know that all three of them are Israeli firms. NeuronData, a French programming tools company, and Micromuse, a British network software firm, are able to keep quiet about their national origins in the same way. On the Web, companies appear to reside in the here and now, open for business round the clock somewhere on your screen. It may be the middle of the night in Herzlia, Israel, but VocalTec's Web site gets busiest when America takes a lunch break.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet cannot eliminate all of the disadvantages non-American firms face. There are still the problems of financing, language and such intangibles as the number of people at the local coffee bar whose idea of a gripping conversation is an analysis of the latest Java compilers. But it does help their prospects. Here are a few of the countries that are already a force in software, and stand to benefit most from the Internet's global market:
<ul>

<font size=-1><li></font>Germany owes its relative software strength mostly to the meteoric rise of a newcomer, <font size=-1>SAP</font>, and the continued growth of a giant from the mainframe days, Software <font size=-1>AG</font>. Both now specialise in client-server software, having developed their skills by writing custom accounting and database software for large German companies. With a sophisticated package of products already in hand when it entered the American market, <font size=-1>SAP</font> became one of the fastest-growing software firms in the industry, and now ranks fifth in the world. But popular though its software is, it is also big, complicated and expensive to install. Analysts reckon this will soon slow <font size=-1>SAP</font>'s climb; so far no other German software rocket has emerged to take its place.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>Britain, it seems, has always been just on the verge of a software boom. It has most of the right ingredients: world-class computer research institutions, hundreds of small software companies, and proportionately more <font size=-1>PC</font>s and Internet connections than most other European countries. It even speaks the right language. Until Germany's <font size=-1>SAP</font> took off, Britain had the strongest software industry outside America, with three companies--Misys, <font size=-1>JBA</font> International and the Micro Focus Group--in the world's top 50. But none of its software firms has become a billion-dollar world-beater. Why not? The answer seems familiar: the big firms are mostly in slow-growth mainframe markets, and the newer <font size=-1>PC</font> software firms have been hampered by the lack, until recently, of a small-company stockmarket and enough venture capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too often promising British firms have put technology ahead of marketing, and have been beaten by louder American competitors. And most of the consumer-software companies that sprouted up in the 1980s developed programs for the Acorn computer, a proprietary design that has been largely buried under the <font size=-1>PC</font> avalanche. Britain's software future may lie in its cottage industry of small computer-games makers, which have developed some of the best 3-D graphics technologies.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>France loves technology, and its computer researchers are some of the best in the world. Perhaps they are just too good: French firms are best known for state-of-the-art programming tools; they are less successful at using those tools to create mass-market applications software. Business Objects, NeuronData, <font size=-1>ILOG</font>--all have grown quickly with the industry's move to "object-oriented" programming, a French speciality. But making software for other programmers is by definition a niche market, something Philippe Kahn, often described as France's most successful software export, learned to his cost when Borland, his programming-tools company in Boston, imploded after trying to challenge Microsoft.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>Israel has long had a stronger technology industry than the country's size would suggest, and is doing especially well in Internet software. Like most of the country's technology industries, this one has been helped by military funding. Like the Internet itself (which was designed to resist atomic attack), many of the technologies of warfare--such as signal processing and encryption--have found new applications on-line. Signal processing lies at the core of video and audio compression, and encryption is the key to the tough problem of Internet security. Israel's traditionally close ties with American business and financial markets are likely to ensure that its software firms will prosper over the next few years.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>India is pushing hard to become a force in the software industry, with some success. It reckons its domestic firms will sell $1 billion-worth of software and services next year. But most of this is work being done for others: India biggest software firms are contractors who offer cheap programming services, mostly for American firms. With an average Indian programmer's salary less than a third of his American counterpart's, Indian firms reckon they can undercut American firms by 40% or more, even after allowing for telecoms and other costs of such long-distance work. The Indian government, having failed in the 1970s to coax a domestic computer industry into life by imposing high tariffs on American computer technology, is investing in satellite links to bypass the country's appalling telecoms networks, and most software firms have power generators to weather the frequent brown-outs. But although India has become the world's favourite software jobshop, it has yet prove that it can come up with software products of its own.

<p><font size=-1><li></font>Japan is a software cipher. Even though it has the second-largest number of programmers in the world, it cannot claim a single success abroad in packaged software (other than in video games). The explanations for this baffling failure include language, the dominance in Japan until recently of various proprietary and incompatible <font size=-1>PC</font> standards, and the preference of Japanese firms for commissioning software unique to their company. In a 1994 study on Japan's software problems, Edward Feigenbaum, a Stanford computer scientist, calculated that such custom software accounts for about 90% of the Japanese industry's output. In the past year, sales of standard <font size=-1>PC</font>s have rocketed in Japan, as have Internet connections. But with software engineering still considered a less respectable occupation than hardware engineering, where the country has traditionally been strong, a Japanese Bill Gates seems a long way off.

<h1>The new world&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</h1>


<i>.&#160;.&#160;. &#160;looks a bit like the old world, but with a difference: software every where, but never a program in sight.

</i><p>SOFTWARE is so abstract and ephemeral--just ones and zeros, recorded in tiny magnetic fluctuations or microscopic pockmarks--that its true economic significance is not always recognised. Computer hardware is much easier to quantify by the usual measures of the industrial age: chips, boxes, lorryloads. To use the language of Nicholas Negroponte, the <font size=-1>MIT</font> Media Lab's digital guru, computers are atoms. Software is bits. Atoms can be weighed, seen and felt. Bits, like genetic code, are inanimate--until they are placed into the right vessel. Then they use that vessel's machinery to create life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The beauty of the computer--indeed, the basis of its world-changing success--is that it is totally unspecialised. A toaster has just one job: it toasts. A <font size=-1>PC</font>, on the other hand, is more like a blank sheet of paper: it is a generic device that serves as a carrier and a repository for ideas of any sort, from "Rebel Assault II" to "Richard III". Partly for this reason, the hardware and software worlds have grown up very differently. Hardware exists to do the bidding of software, not the other way around. Both can be good businesses to be in, but on balance software has the economic edge. Microsoft enjoys gross margins of 85% while Compaq, the leading <font size=-1>PC</font>-hardware maker, makes do with 23%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the early 1980s, all the fun and games in the computer industry was in the battle between hardware companies. Would <font size=-1>IBM</font> lose its lead to clone makers? Would Apple's Macintosh beat the <font size=-1>PC</font>? Would the <font size=-1>PC</font> beat the mainframe? Today all those questions have been answered; the <font size=-1>PC</font> won, but unlike in software, no single company won with it. The <font size=-1>PC</font> industry is now becoming a rather dull and conventional consumer-electronics market, with most of the competition focused on brand, price and quality. The excitement in the industry has shifted to the bits, and those bits are now starting to move away from the <font size=-1>PC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This move from the desktop to the network has become a kind of Rorschach test for the giant software companies. Each of them sees in the Internet only what it wants to see. Every one of them believes that, either by good luck or good management, the network plays right to their strengths.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>IBM</font> points out that the shift away from desktop computers and back towards servers is a vindication of its dogged loyalty to the mainframe, which it now calls a "superserver". Oracle argues that servers are really only machines running big, specialised databases, of just the sort it has been making all these years. Computer Associates thinks that the gaping security holes exposed by the Internet-driven boom in servers of all sorts will open up a great market for security specialists--such as itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sun never tires of reminding punters that it coined the then-baffling slogan, "The Network is the Computer", back in 1988. Microsoft notes that the Internet is in large part an expansion of the client-server strategy it has been building up for years. <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s Lotus subsidiary explains that the Internet is all about collaboration and communications, just like its Notes groupware. Novell claims that the Internet is built on a foundation of office networks, where it happens to dominate, and believes that the Internet will extend Novell's software all the way to appliances in the home. When Adobe looks at the Web, it sees a booming publishing industry, much like the paper-based desktop publishing market it has already claimed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They could all be right: the Internet is a broad church. But history suggests that when industries shift direction, most existing companies are left behind. "Some companies will make the transition," says James Breyer, a venture capitalist, "but the vast majority of the software leaders today will lose their leadership over the next two years."
</p><p><b>Changing places</b></b>
<br>This is a clash of the old world and the new. But they are not mutually exclusive. Just as the <font size=-1>PC</font> did not replace the mainframe, the Internet will not somehow replace the <font size=-1>PC</font> (nor will Java, nor the $500 Network Computer, nor even the mainframe reinvented as a server). It is worth noting that today, 15 years after the <font size=-1>PC</font> revolution began, <font size=-1>IBM</font> is by far the largest software company in the world, with software revenues of nearly $13 billion last year--getting on for twice those of Microsoft.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the roles have been switched, in a strange sort of way. Microsoft is now in the position formerly occupied by <font size=-1>IBM</font>, deeply committed to the status quo and in danger of missing the new opportunities if it tries too hard to protect its existing business. <font size=-1>IBM</font> is in the curious position of oversized underdog. Having fumbled the <font size=-1>PC</font>, it talks about leapfrogging straight from the mainframe to the Internet. With its share price near a five-year high, it runs taunting advertisements insisting that its stubborn vision was right all along. "Correction," reads one full-page <font size=-1>IBM</font> display. "Over the past few years, several publications have predicted the demise of the mainframe. This was a typographical error. What they meant was the 'rise' of the mainframe, not the 'demise'..."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Irving Wladawsky-Berger, who heads <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s Internet division, argues that once companies move from internal networks supporting a few hundred people to sophisticated Web sites supporting thousands, they will rediscover the charms of Big Iron's security and reliability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet seems to have a magical ability to make the old new again. One of the hottest services on the Web is a search site at Digital Equipment, a minicomputers-to-workstations maker that almost went under a few years ago. Larry Ellison at Oracle has a vision of a cheap Network Computer (<font size=-1>NC</font>) that sounds a lot like an <font size=-1>X</font>-terminal, a technology that has been struggling for acceptance for nearly a decade. The <font size=-1>NC</font> itself goes back to a design by Britain's Acorn, one of the many proprietary home-computer makers to fall under the wheels of the <font size=-1>PC</font> train in the mid-1980s. And even Java is based on a language originally designed for interactive television "set-top boxes" before that market imploded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For software, the Internet requires an entirely new model. Today most packaged software is sold in a big and mostly empty box for somewhere between $50 and $300. Tomorrow it will be sold on-line for much less, perhaps a few pennies per use. It may take the form of Java applets, downloaded on demand, or run remotely as a paid-for service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape's Mr Andreessen thinks software, as a stand-alone product, will simply fade away. "Software application, content and services used to be three separate things. They just merged." After all, he argues, most users do not want to run a program, they want to do their work, find information, or be entertained. Software will be hidden in content, like closed-captioned information in a television signal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of today's software will probably remain largely as it is. There is no need to reinvent the word processors and spreadsheets we use now. But the overall software pie will grow immeasurably, as specially tailored software finds its way into everything from the morning on-line newspaper to a downloaded tax form.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It may also open the industry to a multitude of newcomers who have not been able to surmount the barriers to entry of today's <font size=-1>PC</font> software distribution channels and monolithic applications. "Software will look more like publishing," says Paul Cubbage, a former analyst with Dataquest, a consultancy. "There's a huge well-spring of people who are willing to develop software--they just don't want to get into marketing and starting a company. The Internet will be like cable <font size=-1>TV</font>: a huge monster that eats up interactive content."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an Internet computing world, prices will drop but (remember Doomonomics) volume will rise spectacularly (see <a href="csu340.gif">chart</a>). "What's been propping up the price of software is the perceived value of the big box and the manuals," says Mr Cubbage. "Would you pay $299 for a bare <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> or an Internet download?" Sun, having released Java into the world without an obvious way of cashing in on it, now hopes to make its money as a broker, keeping track of the micro-payments each time a user downloads a Java applet. In a volume business, a few cents here and a few cents there can add up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These network programs, then, are the new species of software's next epoch. They will populate the thousands of new niches that will open as the Internet's combination of global reach, infinite capacity and near-zero marginal costs infiltrates the traditional economy. At first some of them will seem as strange as the armoured tankfish or the mammoth when they first appeared on earth, but they will be better suited to their new wired world than their predecessors were. Software, like life itself, adapts wonderfully to change.

<h1>Coping with the ups and downs</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Fears about systemic risk in banking have led to calls for ever more rules and regulations. But, asks Martin Giles, would they be part of the solution or part of the problem?</i>

<p>"IF YOU see a banker jump out of the window, jump after him--there's sure to be profit in it," said Voltaire. In recent years, anybody rash enough to follow that piece of advice from the 18th-century French philosopher and satirist would probably have ended up in intensive care, along with the bankers. The list of financial institutions hospitalised after more or less spectacular defenestrations grows longer by the day. Big chunks of banking systems in some rich countries, as well as in many emerging markets, have had to be put on taxpayer-financed drip-feeds. This is not the first time that banks have proved to be remarkably accident-prone, nor is it likely to be the last.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was abandoned in the early 1970s, the banking industry seems to have jumped from one drama to another, including the Latin American debt crisis, the $150 billion American savings-and-loan (<font size=-1>S&L</font>) fiasco and, more recently, a property-related lending binge that forced several Scandinavian governments to bail out large chunks of their banking systems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On top of this there have been some breathtaking individual problems, such as the collapse in February 1995 of Britain's Barings Bank after a rogue trader managed to blow an &#163;860m ($1.4 billion) hole in its balance sheet, and Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais, a state-owned French bank that earned itself a place in banking's house of horrors by running up losses amounting to some FFr21 billion ($4.2 billion) in 1992-94. The list grows longer by the day. In March the Italian government announced an emergency rescue plan for Banco di Napoli after the bank owned up to having lost over 3 trillion lire ($2 billion) last year.
</p><p><b>Bubble trouble</b>
<br>Until 1990, Japan seemed to be immune from banking headaches, but now its system--which includes many of the world's biggest banks (see <a href="images/tsu112.gif">table</a>)--looks thoroughly sick too. At the end of March, the country's 21 largest banks announced &#165;9.3 trillion ($86 billion) of provisions against their bad debts. Many of these are the legacy of the country's economic bubble, which burst in the early 1990s. In view of the important role bank finance plays in Japan's economy, the myriad links between its banks and its industrial companies, and Japanese banks' large investments abroad, the country's banking crisis is undoubtedly one of the most worrying in recent financial history.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thanks to stories of reckless lending and, in some cases, corruption, bankers in Japan are now widely seen as sharp-suited gamblers rather than sober-suited financiers. This explains public opposition to a government plan to spend &#165;685 billion of taxpayers' money on paying the creditors of Japan's troubled housing-loan companies, or <i>jusen</i>, whose bosses had lent vast sums for speculative property development in the days of the bubble economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan's taxpayers are not the only ones that face a huge bill for banks' financial follies. The French are still waiting to see whether they will have to pay even more for the rescue of Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais, which last year spun off FFr135 billion-worth of its dud assets into a new company whose losses will be covered by the state. And in Scandinavia, bailing out troubled banks has cost anywhere between 2.8% and 4% of their home countries' <font size=-1>GDP</font>, according to the International Monetary Fund.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just the bankers who made the bad loans that are under fire. Banking regulators, for their part, are being blamed for complacency. In Britain, one Bank of England official resigned after the Bank was criticised for failing to see the Barings disaster coming. In France, a parliamentary report on the Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais affair scolded watchdogs for allowing the bank's problems to grow. And in Japan, the country's finance ministry, which oversees banks, has also been castigated for letting them get out of control. In December Kyosuke Shinozawa, Japan's top finance official, stepped down to atone for past mistakes. There has even been talk of stripping Japan's most powerful ministry of some of its regulatory responsibilities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What caused so many banks to crash in such a relatively short space of time? Part of the answer is that in the mid- to late 1980s, interest rates in the economies that subsequently suffered banking crises stayed relatively low, while their economies grew strongly. At the same time, deregulation swept away many of the rules that had previously limited competition within the banking industry. The result was a breathtaking, credit-driven boom in property and share prices (see <a href="images/csu116.gif">chart</a>) that encouraged bankers to lend to all comers. When interest rates rose sharply in 1989, puncturing the bubble, borrowers began to default in droves and banks in many countries were quickly submerged by bad debts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, bankers in Britain and America had lent enthusiastically to the property sector in the hope that the fat margins on such risky loans would offset declining profits in their more traditional corporate-lending business. These were being squeezed in two ways. On the one hand, mutual funds (unit trusts), which offer higher returns by investing people's cash directly in the money market, stocks and bonds, had broken the banks' monopoly over cheap deposits (or liabilities, in banking parlance). On the other hand, many banks' best corporate customers were deserting them, preferring to raise money directly from the capital markets by issuing bonds and shares.
</p><p><b>Why banks are special</b>
<br>Banking is not the only industry that has been transformed by the dual forces of deregulation and stiffer competition. Many other kinds of firm are having to cope with the same trends. Inevitably, some companies go bust as a result. Usually, they promptly disappear--unless a government decides for some reason or other that a firm such as an airline or a car maker is "strategic", and bails it out. When it comes to banking, however, politicians everywhere seem especially reluctant to let the industry's flagships fail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why? One reason is that governments fear the political backlash that the failure of a big bank would cause. Most of these financial giants have thousands of small depositors, many of whom keep a substantial portion of their wealth in their accounts. Ensuring that Aunt Agatha, Anna and Akiko-san have somewhere safe to invest their savings is widely considered to be the government's responsibility. Hence the strong political will to keep large banks afloat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there is another, even more serious threat associated with bank failures that strikes fear into the hearts of politicians and central bankers everywhere. Dubbed "systemic risk", this is the danger that the sudden and unexpected demise of one or several banks could trigger a domino-like collapse throughout an entire banking system. The prospect of a financial meltdown is such a serious worry because its impact is likely to be felt on Main Street as well as Wall Street.
</p><p><b>On the run</b>
<br>It is the side-effects (or externalities, in economists' jargon) associated with bank failures that make them such a special case. When, say, a steel producer collapses, its disappearance is unlikely to cause trouble for other steelmakers; indeed, they should benefit by picking up some of the failed firm's clients. But when a bank suddenly goes bust, its rivals may experience problems too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To see why, consider a typical, profitable bank that takes in deposits and uses the money to make long-term loans. Just in case some depositors want their cash back quickly, it also keeps a small amount of liquid assets handy, a practice known as "fractional reserve banking". Now suppose that some unforeseen event--a sharp rise in interest rates, the collapse of an important borrower, a stockmarket crash--raises doubts about whether the value of a bank's assets (mainly loans) is enough to cover its liabilities (mainly deposits). Because loans are hard for outsiders to value, some depositors may assume the worst and withdraw their cash. As banks work on a "first come, first served" basis, others will follow suit, leading to a "run". This will force the bank into a fire-sale of its less liquid assets to raise cash, further weakening its finances and prolonging the run.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A systemic risk arises if the first bank's failure causes depositors who have doubts about other banks' financial solidity to run on them too. This can happen either because they think that their banks have the same problems as the one that has just failed, or because the failed bank's fire-sale has depressed the market price of other banks' assets. Whatever the cause, once a system-wide panic has begun, it is devilishly difficult to stop.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It can also have a potentially devastating effect on the real economy. As banks struggle to stay afloat, they will call in their outstanding loans and refuse to make new ones, creating a credit crunch that can aggravate an economic downturn. This was precisely what happened in the 1930s. Between 1930 and 1933, some 9,000 American banks fell like ninepins; in Europe, the collapse in 1931 of Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank, also led to a series of other failures. These created the mother of all credit crunches, which made the Depression "Great". No wonder governments are anxious to ensure that history does not repeat itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Runs by small depositors still pose a threat to banks, as demonstrated by television pictures of people lining up to withdraw money from financial institutions in Japan, Taiwan and the Baltic states within the past year. An even bigger, though less televisual, threat comes from the wholesale markets. These include the interbank loan market, through which banks lend to one another, and payments systems, through which they make and receive payments on their own and customers' behalf. Such systems make problems more contagious among banks than among other types of firm. One example is Continental Illinois, a bad-debt-laden American bank that ran into trouble in 1984 after several Asian and European banks cut their lending to it. When rumours began to fly that other American banks might suffer the same fate, the Federal Reserve stepped in to rescue Continental.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To tackle systemic risk, governments have developed a three-legged approach. The first leg is to establish a lender of last resort, usually a country's central bank, which will provide liquidity during a financial crisis, either to individual banks or to the system as a whole. The second leg is to offer deposit insurance. Typically, this involves the government insuring small deposits, either in total or in part, so that a bank's customers are less likely to run if they suspect that it is in trouble. The snag with a safety net is that it tempts banks to take big risks in the knowledge that taxpayers will foot the bill if they fail. This danger, known as "moral hazard", creates a dilemma for governments. Without a net, bank failures could devastate an economy; with it, the number of banks that take excessive risks could rise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To resolve the dilemma, governments rely on the third leg of their strategy: regulation and supervision. Yet in spite of volumes of rulebooks and armies of regulators, the cost of bank bail-outs continues to rise. In response, politicians, pundits and the public are apt to call for ever more regulation and more regulators. But a few central bankers are now beginning to admit what some academic experts have been telling them for some time: that this traditional approach to banking regulation is ineffective and needs to be rethought.
<p><b>A route map</b>
<br>This survey looks at what has been learned about bank regulation over the past decade or so, and asks whether there is a better way to ensure the safety and soundness of the system in future. It begins by considering the nature of the threat posed by systemic risk today, the flaws in the current approach to tackling it, and attempts by regulators to correct them. On the way, it looks at the role of banks in the derivatives business and some of the lessons from Japan's recent banking crisis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then it examines several of the proposals for improving financial stability floated by academics and practitioners, such as scrapping the safety net and banking regulation altogether, privatising deposit insurance, and limiting public support to only a narrow range of banks' activities. It goes on to explain why national bank regulators are bound to have a tough time tackling an increasingly international problem: systemic risk ignores borders. And it concludes by examining the links between sound banking and macroeconomic policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the main emphasis will be on rich countries, the issues raised are important for emerging markets too. Some South-East Asian countries that eased interest-rate and other restrictions on banks in the early 1980s, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, have already experienced banking booms and busts. In Latin America, banks in four countries--Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina--are struggling with crises of varying severity. And in Russia, the government is trying to restructure or close hundreds of its ailing banks. As they reshape their financial systems, all these nations have a chance to decide what they want a bank to be. A good way to start answering that question is to look at what has gone wrong in the rich countries.

<h1>System failure</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Collapse is less likely than it used to be, but the possibility is no less frightening</i>


<p>IN THE City of London and on Wall Street, this may seem an odd time to talk about financial problems. After all, for the past three years many banks on both sides of the Atlantic have been enjoying an unusually long run of record profits and soaring share prices. Yet this is no cause for complacency, if only because experience shows that banks' bad-debt problems tend to surface only once an economy begins to slow. Besides, it is not so long ago that British and American banks were also in trouble. During the dark days of the early 1990s, even some of the biggest looked decidedly shaky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On balance, however, banking is probably a sounder business today than it was in the past. For a start, banks now have fatter capital cushions than they used to, which should help them to cope with unexpected shocks. As part of the Basle capital-adequacy agreement, which came into effect fully in 1992 and set minimum standards for international banks' capital levels, these banks are supposed to hold capital equal to at least 8% of their risk-weighted assets. In addition, they must also have "tier-one" capital (mostly equity) equal to at least 4% of their risk-weighted assets. Most countries' big international banks are now comfortably above that minimum figure (see <a href="images/csu254.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As another form of self-defence, banks have also developed their own sophisticated risk-management systems. These have enabled them to identify more clearly the risks that they are running in both their lending and trading business, and to hedge, or insure themselves, against those that do not offset one another; and they have made senior managers focus more sharply on the profitability (or lack of it) of different businesses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some big banks, such as America's J.P. Morgan, have even touted part of their risk-management packages to rivals. They have several motives. One is that there is money to be made from advising statistically-challenged bankers, who have not developed sophisticated systems of their own. Another, more public-spirited one, is that the more sophisticated the banking system's component parts can be made, the safer it will be as a whole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Deregulation has also strengthened banks in several ways. In America, it has allowed them to begin diversifying geographically. This should reduce some banks' dependence on the economies of single states and, with luck, make a re-run of the Texas and New England banking collapses of the 1980s less likely. At the same time, banks have continued to diversify beyond their bread-and-butter lending business. This makes sense because their role as middlemen is being undermined by the securities markets, which match borrowers and lenders directly. That is why many American and Japanese institutions have set up their own underwriting and trading operations in legally distinct subsidiaries, thus partially getting round the legal restrictions that separate commercial and investment banking in both countries.

</p><p><b>Fatter ratios, fitter banks</b>
<br>In Europe, where banks have long had a foot in both camps, the trading one is getting bigger: witness the unseemly rush by Swiss and German bankers to lay their hands on medium-sized British merchant banks with large trading outfits. Another form of diversification, <i>bancassurance</i>--tie-ups between banks and insurance companies--is still all the rage in Europe too. American bankers would love to sell more insurance, but have met stiff resistance from the country's insurance agents. They have, however, built up their fund-management operations and other fee-earning activities. Income from these and from trading has helped to offset what they have lost in their traditional lending business. According to a recent study* for New York's Federal Reserve Bank by two economists, Franklin Edwards and Frederic Mishkin, non-interest income from fees and trading as a proportion of American commercial banks' total income rose from an average of 19% in 1960-80 to 35% in 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fatter capital ratios, fancy risk-management systems and faster diversification: all of these things are undoubtedly creating a fitter banking system. At the same time, they are probably reducing the threat of a systemic crisis. To see why, consider what makes a banking system vulnerable to disruption if a bank fails. Although in some way every case is unique, there are some common themes. According to Philip Bartholomew and Gary Whalen, two economists at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees America's nationally chartered banks, these can be summed up in a few words: concentration, homogeneity, information and connections.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The greater the <b>concentration</b> of a bank's loan portfolio in a single company, industry or country, the greater the chance that it will collapse if a single borrower, or group of borrowers, defaults. The same principle holds true for its trading business. Concentration is not necessarily a bad thing: it may simply reflect the bank's competitive advantage in a particular area. Moreover, by focusing on a narrow set of borrowers or counterparties, a bank may get to know them well and therefore become a better judge of their creditworthiness. But, in general, the less diversified its relationships, the more vulnerable it is to a shock.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If it does fail, others are likely to follow only if depositors at these banks think that there is a great deal of <b>homogeneity</b> between the casualty and the rest. If they conclude that there is, the result may be a bank panic. They may of course have got it wrong. But they can tell only if plenty of good <b>information</b> about banks' finances is widely available. The more there is, the easier it will be for depositors, creditors and counterparties to distinguish between good and bad banks. Sometimes word of mouth will suffice. For example, many institutions knew at an early stage that the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (<font size=-1>BCCI</font>) was crooked, and therefore avoided dealing with it, which explains why its closure in 1991 had no knock-on effect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other factor that determines the gravity of a systemic threat is the extent of the <b>connections</b> between different financial institutions. If a bank that collapses is a lone wolf that has had little to do with other banks (as in <font size=-1>BCCI</font>'s case), regulators can wash their hands of it. But if it is a big player in a particular market, a sizeable lender to other banks or an important link in payments and settlements systems, then they may think twice before allowing it to fail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In two respects, matters have improved somewhat. First, lenders claim to have become savvier about assessing credit risk, or the chance that a borrower will default. Some banks, such as Britain's Barclays and Australia's Westpac, are trying to measure this risk more accurately and put a price on it. Barclays even sets aside a specific provision for credit risk when it makes loans. Such calculations rely on the risk-reducing benefits of diversification.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, more information is now available about banks' finances. Much of this is provided by private credit-rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and <font size=-1>IBCA</font>, which rate various types of debt issued by banks. Their job has been made easier because banks have been securitising more of their loans--packaging them into bundles that can be traded in a marketplace. Among the most common debts that have been sold in this way are banks' mortgage repayments, credit-card receivables and sovereign loans. By establishing a market price for these and other debts, such as loans to small businesses, securitisation allows outsiders to estimate the value of some of a bank's assets with greater accuracy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Welcome though these trends are, they have not banished systemic risk for good. For a start, it seems that not all bankers may have cottoned on to risk management in lending. Over the past year or so, regulators have repeatedly given warning that margins have become dangerously thin in the syndicated-loan business, in which banks club together to lend collectively to large firms (see <a href="images/csu216.gif">chart</a>). And last month Michael Foot, the Bank of England's new head of supervision, said that stiff competition for mortgage business between banks and building societies (thrifts) could cause lenders problems if loans later turn sour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The process of securitisation is also a double-edged sword. Many of the loans that banks have disposed of in this way are top-quality, low-risk credits that appeal to a broad range of investors. Those left on their balance sheets are poorer-quality ones, which are more likely to cause problems.
</p><p><b>Cock-ups will happen</b>
<br>Even if banks have decent risk-management systems, they are not immune from what they like to call "operations risk"--a polite word for management cock-ups. At Barings, Nick Leeson, the bank's nemesis, was able to disguise huge losses because the bank committed a cardinal sin at its futures operation in Singapore: it let him keep his own books. Such lax internal controls are not as rare as they should be. Toshihide Iguchi, a bond trader in the New York branch of Japan's Daiwa Bank, somehow managed to hide his mounting losses over a period of 11 years. When he finally owned up to them in October 1995, they had reached an astonishing $1.1 billion. This blew a hole in Daiwa's balance sheet, but luckily it was not fatal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another caveat is that the financial figures available from banks often do not give an accurate picture of their true net worth. Most of their accounts are still drawn up on the basis of historic-cost accounting, so they inevitably fail to capture rapid changes in the risks being run. This gap between financial reporting and reality has grown as banks have taken on more fast-changing market risk--the risk that the price of their holdings of securities or derivatives may fall--via their proprietary trading operations, which bet the banks' own capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the threat of a systemic crisis has probably diminished, the damage that one could do if it did happen has increased exponentially. This is because financial liberalisation and the growth of global trade have brought about changes in national and international financial systems that have reinforced links between banks, as well as their ties with the financial markets. The following figures are only a snapshot of a few of these connections, but they tell a startling story.
</p><p><b>Doomsday scenario</b>
<br>In 1980 the size of America's interbank loan market was $74 billion; by 1995, it had almost doubled, to $170 billion. The international interbank lending market has grown rapidly too, reaching $5.8 trillion in June 1995.
<ul><font size=-1><li></font> According to the Bank for International Settlements (<font size=-1>BIS</font>), a sort of central bank for central banks, turnover in the foreign-exchange market, in which banks are the principal players, has reached an estimated $1.2 trillion a day, almost double the figure in 1989.
<p><font size=-1><li></font> Commercial banks are also heavily engaged in over-the-counter (<font size=-1>OTC</font>) derivatives (ie, those that are not traded on a recognised exchange). A survey of the market published under the auspices of the <font size=-1>BIS</font> showed that at the end of March 1995 the total amount of outstanding <font size=-1>OTC</font> contracts had reached an eye-popping $41 trillion.
</ul><p>In short, banks are doing more business with one another. This proliferation of relationships, together with the large amounts of money that are riding on them, has made it even more important for banks to manage the risks involved. Fortunately, the very things that have created this state of affairs--faster computers, improved communications, innovative financial instruments--have also made it easier for them to do so. This is often overlooked in the debate on whether banks' role in the <font size=-1>OTC</font> derivatives business is a bomb waiting to go off (see <a href="ibsu3.html">page</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more worrying source of systemic risk, but one that gets much less public attention, are the world's payments and settlements systems. These are often taken for granted; yet banks put unimaginably large amounts of money at risk in them, albeit for short periods. If one of the big systems were to break down, it is not just banks that would be in serious trouble, but entire economies.

<h1>Dangerous deriving?</h1>

<br><p>WILLIAM MCDONOUGH, the president of the ederal Reserve Bank of New York, has dubbed it "derivatives angst": the nagging feeling that sooner or later a transaction involving some swap or option will go wrong, causing panic in the banking system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Concern that derivatives may pose a threat to banks has been fuelled by recent derivatives-related disasters at big firms such as Japan's Kashima Oil and Germany's Metallgesellschaft; by a messy legal battle between Procter &amp; Gamble and Bankers Trust, an American bank accused of selling its client dud interest-rate swaps; and by the huge losses on Nikkei and Japanese government-bond futures that sank Britain's Barings. The main culprit was often not derivatives but lax internal controls or a failure to price risk properly; yet the impression that derivatives are dangerous has stuck. Do they really pose a new and particularly pernicious form of systemic risk?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, swaps, options and the like actually help to reduce the chance of a systemic crisis by providing a cheap and efficient mechanism for shifting risk from those who do not want it to those who do. As Martin Taylor, the boss of Barclays Bank, puts it, "Risk, like energy, is neither created nor destroyed, merely passed around." If it ends up in the hands of those who know what to do with it, the system will emerge stronger as a result.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, banks are not putting as much money at risk in derivatives as hysterical commentators sometimes suggest. When a bank makes a loan, it runs a big credit risk. If the borrower defaults, in some cases it can lose all of its money. But derivatives contracts are different. The size of a contract, or its "notional" value, is simply a reference point for calculating how much is actually owed. For instance, an interest-rate swap may have a notional value of $40m, but the cost of replacing it if one party defaults will reflect only the movement in interest rates since the contract was drawn up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Often, this is a small fraction of the notional value. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the cost of replacing all of the over-the-counter (<font size=-1>OTC</font>) derivatives contracts (ie, those not traded on an exchange) outstanding at the end of March 1995 was $1.7 trillion, or just 4% of their notional value. A recent study for the New York Fed shows that--except for J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust--most banks' credit risk from derivatives is tiny compared with that from lending (see <a href="images/csu120.gif">chart</a>). So if they are going to go bust, it will probably still be in the old-fashioned way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The outcome of the Barings affair has also confounded Cassandras who had predicted that the collapse of a big trader would badly hit both the derivatives exchanges involved and the underlying market (in this case, Japan's stockmarket). In the event, both the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange coped with the shock; and when the Japanese market opened on the Monday after Barings closed, the Nikkei average fell just 4% before bouncing back the next day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some regulators worry that derivatives make it easier for banks to "leverage" themselves because the downpayment for a contract is much smaller than the amount of money it puts at risk. But there are plenty of other ways in which banks can take huge bets on markets. As for worries about derivatives' complexity, the recent disasters mostly involved relatively simple contracts. The true cause of the fiascos was not complexity but greed, hubris or mismanagement--and sometimes all three.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another much-cited cause for concern is the biggest banks' domination of their industry's derivatives business. According to the same Fed study, at the end of 1994 the seven largest bank derivative dealers accounted for more than 90% of all contracts held by American banks. But by and large these firms have also invested more heavily in risk-management systems than smaller banks, and have good credit ratings. A more fragmented market would not necessarily lessen the risk of a systemic crisis; it might even increase it by bringing in many less experienced players.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lack of widely available information about some areas of the <font size=-1>OTC</font> derivatives business is worrying. But at last banks everywhere seem to be recognising that it is in everybody's best interest to know as much as possible about their counterparties, and their counterparties' counterparties. In the past couple of years a stream of reports from industry groups and regulatory bodies have recommended changes in disclosure and accounting policies to clear away much of the statistical fog.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This does not mean that regulators can afford to relax. Banks' derivatives activities need no less attention (but no more either) than the other parts of their business. The fact that they have become far bigger forces in derivatives than, say, securities houses, is striking. One possible explanation for this comes from a report on derivatives published in 1994 by America's General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog. This hints that banks may run bigger risks (relative to their capital) because they have a government safety net to fall back on. If so, the real problem is not derivatives, but governments' willingness to underwrite too much risk. Time, perhaps, for some taxpayer angst?

<h1>Can't pay, won't pay</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Watch out for blockages in the financial plumbing</i>

<p>IT IS the stuff of which nightmares and movies are made. The scene is New York, late one Friday the 13th. Wall Street is in turmoil. The stockmarket is plunging. Suddenly a big bank announces that it needs help because trading losses have wiped out its capital. It refuses to settle up with the banks to which it has sent $10 billion-worth of payment instructions earlier in the day. This spells serious trouble for those banks, which have already paid the cash to their customers. So they, in turn, renege on settlements with other banks. Eventually, the entire banking system grinds to a halt. Chaos quickly spreads to the rest of the economy as companies discover they cannot make or receive payments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mercifully, this is fiction. But the threat is real because many of the world's wholesale payments and settlements systems--networks that allow banks to send large amounts of money to one another and settle foreign-exchange or securities deals--operate on the basis of "netting". This works as follows. In the course of a day, two banks, <font size=-1>A</font> and <font size=-1>B</font>, send thousands of payments instructions to each other, but no cash. The bank receiving an instruction simply credits its customers' accounts while the system keeps track of the two banks' net position. At the end of the day, if <font size=-1>A</font> owes <font size=-1>B</font> money, it settles by transferring the amount owing from its account at the central bank (if the payments system is a public one) or the clearing house (if it is privately run) to <font size=-1>B</font>'s account. If that payment cannot be made, then it may affect <font size=-1>B</font>'s ability to meet its settlement commitments to other banks, creating chaos and, just possibly, a string of defaults.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thanks to the growth in payments systems, netting now operates on a multilateral basis, involving many different banks. Tom Labrecque, the president of Chase Manhattan, an American bank that recently merged with Chemical Bank, reckons that the money passing through the world's payments and settlements networks each day now adds up to $6 trillion. The sheer size of the amounts at stake was also highlighted by recent figures from the <font size=-1>BIS</font>, which showed that in some countries the annual value just of interbank payments had more than doubled as a proportion of <font size=-1>GDP</font> since 1985 (see <a href="images/csu125.gif">chart</a>). Payments systems as a whole in America, Germany and Japan now turn over the equivalent of their annual <font size=-1>GDP</font> every few days.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the same time, the amounts that banks owe one another during the day has rocketed. The chart found <a href="images/csu131.gif">here</a> shows a combined figure for America's privately run Clearing House Interbank Payments System (<font size=-1>CHIPS</font>) and Fedwire, a system run by the Federal Reserve. These "daylight overdrafts" are sometimes larger than banks' capital bases. Trying to work out exactly who owes what to whom is tricky. At a recent conference on payments systems hosted by Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, Gerald Corrigan, the chairman of the bank's international advisory council and a former president of New York's Fed, said that these systems "constitute an extraordinarily complex chain of financial flows and resulting credit interdependencies that I dare say nobody fully understands."
</p><p><b>Clear as mud</b>
<br>It is this opacity, coupled with the size of the credit exposures involved, that creates a potential systemic risk. Mr Corrigan fears that banks have become more defensive, and may refuse to meet their settlement commitments at the first sign of trouble. A senior executive of one big European bank agrees. As he delicately puts it, if an important link in a payments system were to break, "it would be every man for himself and screw the rest of you." But what if a troubled bank simply delayed settlement for, say, a day rather than refusing to pay outright? That way the other banks would eventually get their money. But they would still have to raise money to bridge the gap, perhaps by selling assets. If they could not do so fast enough, they might need help.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To start tackling these risks, some central banks have assumed a more active role in payments systems. In Fedwire's case, the Federal Reserve guarantees payment "finality", meaning that transactions will not be unwound if a bank fails to settle. The central bank will pick up the tab if a bank defaults. Private-sector systems, such as <font size=-1>CHIPS</font> and Britain's Clearing House Automated Payments System, have imposed limits on their members' overall indebtedness to one another. <font size=-1>CHIPS</font> and Japan's private-sector payments system have also introduced loss-sharing arrangements, so that one bank's failure will not stop others from settling.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A number of countries, mostly in Europe, have gone for another approach: real-time gross settlement (<font size=-1>RTGS</font>). This involves banks settling their large payments with one another immediately, assuming their accounts with the central bank have enough money in them. This should dramatically reduce systemic risk because if a bank fails, it will owe little to others. The difficulty with <font size=-1>RTGS</font> is to ensure that enough credit is available to smooth payment flows, but without making it so cheap that it encourages banks to take big risks. Some <font size=-1>RTGS</font> systems, such as the Bank of Japan's, forbid daylight overdrafts; instead, banks have to raise loans from an interbank market. Others, such as those in Britain and the Netherlands, require banks to provide liquid assets as collateral before their settlement accounts can be overdrawn.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Progress has also been made in reducing systemic risk in other areas. One is securities settlement, where there is often a lag of several days between, say, the delivery of a share and payment for it. This is gradually being reduced (for equities in America, from five business days to three last year) and may eventually disappear. <font size=-1>RTGS</font> also helps here by ensuring that, once it has been made, a payment for a security is irrevocable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for derivatives, those traded on exchanges pose less of a problem because multilateral netting keeps settlement flows small, members are required to put up collateral ("margin") against their positions and these positions are subject to limits. Some <font size=-1>OTC</font> contracts also include margin arrangements, though it is difficult to say how widespread this practice is. This has prompted some people to recommend that the clearing-house concept should be extended to the <font size=-1>OTC</font> market, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some regulators fear that the international links that derivatives create could complicate settlement problems if a bank defaults. But again, this risk is not new. And because netting arrangements mean that the amounts involved are small, a glitch here is less worrying than in some other areas. Indeed, by far the biggest settlement threat looms in the foreign-exchange market, where bankers still quake in their boots at the mention of "Herstatt risk"--the danger that a bank, having fulfilled its side of a foreign-exchange trade by delivering currency, suddenly discovers that its counterparty has not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1974 Bankhaus Herstatt, a medium-sized German bank, was closed down by the German authorities. Herstatt had been in the middle of over $620m-worth of foreign-exchange trades, and had received <font size=-1>D</font>-marks from a number of American and other banks. But it was shut before New York's settlements system had opened, and so did not transfer dollars in return. This caused a panic in America, where banks that had sent money to Herstatt refused to make other payments on their, or their customers', behalf. <font size=-1>CHIPS</font> wobbled, but fortunately did not go down.
</p><p><b>Keep going round the clock</b></b>
<br>Since then, Herstatt risk has been reduced by measures such as extending the opening hours of national settlements systems to reduce the troublesome gap (next year, for example, Fedwire will stay open an extra six hours). But more needs to be done. Last month, a hard-hitting report from a <font size=-1>BIS</font> committee headed by William McDonough, the New York Fed's boss, said that settlement risk in foreign exchange can sometimes stretch out over more than three days, and berated banks for failing to measure and manage their exposures properly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bankers finally seem to be getting the message that something needs to be done to tackle this problem. Shortly before the <font size=-1>BIS</font> report appeared, a group of the world's biggest banks, dubbed the <font size=-1>G-20</font> (even though there are only 17 members; who said bankers could count?), announced plans to create a 24-hour organisation for foreign-exchange settlements within the next few years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that the world's payments and settlements systems have proved reasonably solid over the past 20 years partly reflects improved risk management. But there have been several close shaves. In November 1985, for instance, the New York Fed lent $23 billion to the Bank of New York--more than 20 times the bank's capital--after a computer glitch caused it accidentally to run up a daylight overdraft of almost $30 billion. The Fed also had to step in after the 1987 stockmarket crash to encourage commercial banks to keep lending to securities houses which were supporting troubled customers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Small wonder, then, that central banks take a great interest in the design and development of payments systems. They are worried that, left to their own devices, banks might not develop real-time systems, which are safer than netting but more expensive. But should central banks run as well as oversee payments and settlements systems? After all, there is no shortage of initiatives from the private sector, such as <font size=-1>CHIPS</font> and the proposed global clearing house for foreign-exchange deals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Central bankers argue that close involvement on their part creates confidence and therefore reduces the chance of a systemic crisis. But it also creates a significant moral hazard. Safe in the knowledge that the central bank will provide finality and a safety net, banks could become slapdash about managing credit and liquidity risks, thus making daylight overdrafts soar and increasing the likely cost of bailouts. This has already happened on Fedwire. To tackle the problem, the New York Fed has recently begun to charge fees for daylight overdrafts and to require collateral from banks that regularly run up large credit positions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tougher rules are probably justified, but the Fed is worried that these may cause banks to decamp to rival systems. This is just one example of how government action can inadvertently increase systemic risk. A much more worrying case of this kind of regulatory failure is the perverse effect of deposit insurance and banking bailouts.

<h1>A financial horror story</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>How safety nets create banking zombies</i>

<p>WHY is the banking system so fragile? The answer seems obvious. On the deposit-taking side of their business, banks are vulnerable to contagious runs by uninformed and flighty customers; on the payments side, they can easily become the innocent victims of someone else's problems. End of story. Or is it? According to some economists, leaving the government's safety net off the list of causes of instability in banking is like leaving the Prince of Denmark out of "Hamlet". The net's operation, they say, has created a perverse set of incentives in banking that is contributing to the rising cost of bank failures.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The debate about the safety net is liveliest in America, which has long relied on deposit insurance to prevent systemic problems in its atomised banking system (at the last count it still had over 10,000 banks). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (<font size=-1>FDIC</font>), which manages the bank insurance fund, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (<font size=-1>FSLIC</font>), which manages the <font size=-1>S&L</font>s' one, were both set up in 1934, after the worst period of instability in American banking history. The aim was to reassure worried depositors that even if their bank ran into trouble, their money was safe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other countries with more concentrated banking systems have largely relied on a lender of last resort to deal with troubled banks. Although many of them have set up their own insurance schemes, these have been intended mainly to protect depositors, not to prop up the system. Most of these schemes offer less generous coverage than America's 100% of deposits up to $100,000 (see <a href="images/tsu258.gif">table</a>), and come in 57 different varieties. Britain's, for instance, is statutory and, in effect, compulsory; Germany's is informal and voluntary. America's scheme is administered by the government, whereas those in Germany and France are privately run. Most rely on contributions from the banks, with governments chipping in once a fund has been exhausted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until the 1980s, government insurance of deposits in America seemed to be that rare thing, an economic policy that worked as intended. In the 1920s the country lost roughly 6,000 of its 30,000 banks, and thousands more between 1930 and 1933, amid numerous runs. But between the establishment of the <font size=-1>FDIC</font> and the early 1980s, on average only about 15 commercial banks a year failed. Much the same was true for <font size=-1>S&L</font>s. Yet by the end of 1991, 1,000 banks were on the <font size=-1>FDIC</font>'s problem list; and by 1992 almost half the 4,000 thrifts that had been around at the start of the 1980s had disappeared. <font size=-1>FSLIC</font> went bankrupt, requiring a $150 billion government bailout.
</p><p><b>Betting the bank</b></b>
<br>What went wrong? Part of the blame has been laid on rising interest rates, incompetent management and lax oversight. But the main lesson of the thrift crisis in particular is the "moral hazard" created by comprehensive deposit insurance. Knowing that their money was safe, the thrifts' small depositors had no incentive to monitor the risks these institutions were taking. At the same time, stiffer competition encouraged thrifts to take bigger risks with depositors' money, safe in the knowledge that if the worst came to the worst, the government would protect depositors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A paper by Arthur Rolnick of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis*<font size=1>(1)&#160; </font> provides a neat illustration of the problem. Assume, he says, that a man who has $200,000 in cash uses $100,000 of it to open a bank, which becomes a member of the <font size=-1>FDIC</font>. Assume, too, that he offers a rate of interest slightly above his competitors' and attracts $900,000 of deposits. The bank now has $1m of reserves (his $100,000 of equity plus $900,000 of deposits). To put the bank's $1m to work, he goes to Las Vegas, finds a casino with a roulette wheel and bets the entire amount on black. At the same time, he bets his remaining cash of $100,000 on the only other colour, red.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the bank's point of view, this is an extremely risky investment, but to the shareholder it looks perfectly safe. If the red comes up, the bank goes bust, making its stock worthless. But the shareholder's winning private bet on red takes his cash to $200,000, back where he started before he opened the bank. If the black comes up, he will have lost his $100,000 bet, but the rise in the value of his bank stock will more than compensate for that. As for the bank's small depositors, they do not care what the bank does because their money, including the interest on it, is protected by the <font size=-1>FDIC</font>. This example shows that, provided shareholders can either hedge the risk of their investment in a bank, or are relaxed about it because it represents only a small fraction of their overall portfolio, they will want the bank to pursue the riskiest strategy possible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is this what happens in real life? The parallel depends on the financial health of a bank. In good times, its managers are unlikely to take huge risks with depositors' and shareholders' money, not least because they have their jobs and reputations to protect. But their attitude could change if the bank is close to insolvency. By raising rates to attract new deposits and then betting everything on a few risky investments, they can try to turn it around. This "gambling for resurrection", in economists' parlance, is what happened at many troubled thrifts, which often tried to avoid liquidation by spending billions of dollars on risky junk bonds, or investing in shopping centres in the middle of the desert. Some banks also took reckless gambles, only to end up in the arms of the insurance fund.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surely, you might think, big, uninsured depositors at a bank or thrift would put a stop to this? Not necessarily. For a start, governments often bail out all the depositors of big banks that run into trouble. When Continental Illinois became insolvent in 1984, the <font size=-1>FDIC</font> announced that it would protect all depositors, not just small ones. The rescue of France's Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais, state support for big banks in Sweden, Finland and Norway, and Latin American governments' efforts to protect their banking flagships all bear witness to a "too big to fail" policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even big depositors in smaller banks have little incentive to keep an eagle eye on their bankers. To see why, consider the ways in which governments deal with the corpse of a bank that has gone bust. These include:
<ul>
<font size=-1><li></font>Burial (or liquidation). This involves paying off a bank's insured depositors and then selling its assets to help reimburse any uninsured creditors, including the deposit insurer itself. <font size=-1>BCCI</font> was laid to rest in this way.
<font size=-1><li></font>Reincarnation (or merger). If there is still some value in a deceased bank's franchise--its customer base, its labour force, its branch network--another bank might be willing to buy it and to take over its liabilities, possibly with some financial help from the deposit insurer. An example of a bank reborn is Barings, which was bought by <font size=-1>ING</font> of the Netherlands in March 1995.
<font size=-1><li></font>Resuscitation (or state guarantee). A bank may be revived either by providing it with a state guarantee of its borrowings, or by stripping some of the worst loans off its balance sheet and placing them in a state-financed "bad" bank. Both France and Sweden have used this method.
<font size=-1><li></font>Divine intervention (or nationalisation). This is the most extreme solution, reserved for occasions when a government fears that the collapse of a bank could trigger a systemic crisis. The Norwegian state took over some of the country's biggest banks in the early 1990s because it feared a run on them.
</ul>
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When a bank is "buried", its uninsured depositors are unlikely to get much, if any, of their money back. In <font size=-1>BCCI</font>'s case, for example, the British government steadfastly refused to pay out more than the official limit. But under the other methods, both big and small deposits are usually fully protected. So the prospect of lots of burials would provide a strong incentive for big depositors either to stop their banks from taking big risks or to pull their money out fast if they do. Unfortunately, burials are rare. In a study*<font size=1>(2)&#160; </font>of 120 bank failures in 24 countries, mainly between the early 1980s and early 1990s, Charles Goodhart and Dirk Schoenmaker of the London School of Economics found that two out of three failed banks were bailed out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This highlights another problem. Regulators routinely tell banks that if they become insolvent, they will be dealt with harshly. But when banks, especially large ones, get into trouble, the same regulators often work hard to keep them afloat. This "regulatory forbearance" undermines the credibility of the threat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why do regulators forbear? They may be worried that closing one bank could trigger a run on others, or they may be under pressure from politicians to show leniency. Whatever the reason, the cost of procrastination can be high, as America's thrift crisis showed. When rising interest rates tipped many thrifts into insolvency in 1982, regulators tried to sweep the problem under the carpet by altering the accounting rules they applied to the industry. They knew that the alternative--closing the thrifts down, at an estimated cost of $20 billion--would bankrupt the <font size=-1>FSLIC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The regulators were encouraged in their efforts by national and state politicians who lobbied on the thrifts' behalf. Thus they helped keep alive what Ed Kane, a professor at Boston College, calls "zombie" <font size=-1>S&L</font>s--living-dead institutions that distorted the rest of the market by offering higher interest rates and slashing loan prices in a gamble for resurrection. This forced healthier thrifts to follow suit, turning them into zombies too. In the end the industry had to be bailed out anyway, by which time the price tag had risen to an exceedingly painful $150 billion.
</p><p><b>Cheques, but few balances</b></b>
<br>In their defence, regulators argue that sometimes forbearance is essential to avert a run on a bank. The same argument is often used to justify the intervention of a lender of last resort to prop up an ailing bank. Take America's Continental Illinois, mentioned earlier in this article. When, in 1984, it suffered a disastrous run on its interbank deposits, nearly 1,000 other banks had money in its accounts. Without government support, a systemic crisis might have erupted. But some academics have since questioned the case for a rescue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;George Kaufman, a professor at Loyola University in Chicago, has claimed that before the bailout, regulators were assuming that the recovery rate on Continental's assets would be around 97%--a level at which only two creditor banks would have lost between half and all of their capital. In the event, the recovery rate was a little above 95%, close to the original estimate. Yet when the crisis occurred, the size of the bank's losses and the time it would take to recover its assets were both unclear. This uncertainty could have triggered a much wider run if the Federal Reserve had not provided the bank with emergency loans. The Bank of England also invoked the threat of a widespread run to justify a &#163;240m ($360m) rescue plan in 1991 for several small British banks that had got into trouble after lending heavily to the property sector.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some scholars, including Mr Kaufman, argue that bank runs are not as threatening as they seem because they generally involve a flight to quality, with depositors pulling their money out of sick banks and redepositing it with healthy ones. This means bad banks close faster. But what if fleeing depositors simply stick their cash under mattresses instead of putting it into another bank? In such cases, the academics say, governments should pump money into the banking system as a whole to offset the effects of a monetary contraction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their case for restraint at first sight seems compelling, but it takes no account of the other economic costs of bank runs. They can destroy long-standing relationships between banks and their customers, who have to spend time and money finding new sources of finance. Moreover, those banks that survive may be reluctant to take risks with new borrowers. It is these side-effects--call the problem "systemic mess"--that make bank failures so damaging to an economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this is an excuse for lenders of last resort to hand ailing banks a blank cheque, however. More than a century ago, in his book "Lombard Street", Walter Bagehot, a former editor of this newspaper, provided central bankers with a classic guide to handling the problem. They should, he wrote, lend only to banks that are solvent but illiquid, and then only at a penal rate. He also said that lenders of last resort should make their intentions clear in advance to discourage banks from taking excessive risks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A handful of central bankers have heeded this advice, including Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. He has publicly stated several times that the Bank will prop up institutions only if their failure poses a systemic risk, and that any support given would be on particularly onerous terms. The collapse of <font size=-1>BCCI</font> and, in particular, Barings provided proof that the Bank means what it says. Most other central banks have left their intentions unspoken--a policy known as "constructive ambiguity". Yet their actions have often been far from ambiguous. Time and again, they have leapt to the aid of big banks, reinforcing the impression that, solvent or not, some of them are "too big to fail". In many cases, they have been unwilling to let even small banks collapse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that by being too generous with their support, most lenders of last resort have eroded the penalties for excessive risk-taking in banking. Japan is one of the countries that has discovered just how dangerous and expensive it can be to ignore Bagehot's advice.

<h1>Trouble in Tokyo</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Moral hazard has played a part in Japan's banking disaster, too</i>

<p>WHEN, in December 1995, America wound up its Resolution Trust Corporation, the body set up to dispose of the bad assets of savings and loan associations, it closed the book at last on an awkward episode in its financial history. Most European countries have also put their banking crises behind them. But Japan's refuses to go away. Among the culprits being blamed for the mess are hapless bankers, greedy property developers and even the <i>yakuza</i> (Japanese gangsters), who apparently built up property businesses with cheap credit from banks. But, in some ways, the real villains of the piece are bank regulators.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japanese banks' problems are especially worrying because bank finance plays a crucial role in the country's economy. At the end of 1995, total bank credit as a proportion of nominal <font size=-1>GNP</font> in Japan was 105% compared with just 37% in America, where domestic capital markets are much bigger. So if several of Japan's big banks were to collapse, the resulting credit crunch might devastate Japan's economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japanese officials have been hard at work trying to prevent anything of the sort. When the depositors of Cosmo, the country's fifth-largest credit union, began a run on it last July, the Bank of Japan stepped in with emergency loans--the first time it had done so since 1965, when it bailed out Yamaichi, a stockbroker. More recently, the government has been trying to push a &#165;685 billion ($6.3 billion) rescue package for seven all-but-bankrupt <i>jusen</i>, or mortgage lenders, through parliament against bitter political opposition. Even if the package gets through, the <i>jusen </i>are the tip of the iceberg. On some estimates, their bad debts are no more than a tenth of the banking system's as a whole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan got into a mess in much the same way as did several European countries that suffered banking crises in the early 1990s. Like European banks, Japanese ones faced a profit squeeze in the 1980s as interest rates on deposits were progressively deregulated. By 1990 the proportion of deposits paying market rates of interest at Japan's city (or commercial) banks had risen to 70%, from only 22% in 1985. To compensate, banks lent aggressively to the property sector, either directly or indirectly via non-banks, many of which were big property lenders too (see <a href="images/csu149.gif">chart</a>). When the property market crashed, they were left with huge bad debts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What made Japan's headache even worse was that its big banks had invested especially heavily in equities during the stockmarket bubble. This created what Andrew Smithers, an economic consultant, calls "a doomsday machine". Under the Basle capital-adequacy rules, Japan's banks are allowed to count up to 45% of the unrealised gains on their equity holdings towards "tier-two" capital. That is fine if the market is rising, but dangerous if it is falling sharply. Last year some analysts predicted that if the Nikkei stockmarket average slipped below 13,000, the aggregate Basle ratio for the country's biggest banks would fall below the 8% minimum. Thanks to various official efforts to prop up the Japanese stockmarket, the Nikkei only fell to 14,485 before it began climbing again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; How did Japanese banks get into such trouble? Not because of deposit insurance, which in America has generally been blamed for encouraging banks' follies. The Deposit Insurance Corporation (<font size=-1>DIC</font>), Japan's version of America's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is puny by comparison. It covers deposits up to a limit of &#165;10m, but exhausted its meagre resources by helping to arrange the mergers of a few small troubled banks last year.
</p><p><b>Blame the bureaucrats</b>
<br>One important culprit is the country's finance ministry, which supervises the banking industry. Until the 1970s, it ran what became known as the "convoy system", under which banks were all expected to steam in the same direction and at the same rate of knots. The ministry's officials more or less took the helm, telling banks what they should and should not do. No wonder bankers did not bother assessing risk. When some banks ran into trouble, officials persuaded healthier ones to bail them out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But now the ministry is finding it increasingly hard to persuade Japanese banks to come to one another's aid. Rei Masunaga, the deputy president of the Japan Centre for International Finance, a research institute, says that even relatively healthy banks have some bad debts, so they are less keen to stump up cash for others. This harder-nosed attitude has been obvious in the debate over who pays for rescuing the <i>jusen</i>. These were originally founded by the big banks, which have refused to foot almost all of the bill for a rescue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the mandarins have been guilty of forbearance, it may be partly because they have had difficulty in finding buyers for troubled institutions. A preliminary report by an advisory committee, appointed by the finance ministry to look into the causes of the crisis, concluded last September that some financial institutions had been allowed to stay in business "even though [their] financial condition had worsened practically to the point of failure... Consequently, disposal costs tended to be larger." A good example of this is Kizu, an Osaka credit union. In 1994 regulators found a &#165;600 billion hole in its balance sheet, but still allowed it to stay open. When it eventually closed in August 1995, the loss had risen to &#165;960 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The regulators were also slow to tackle the problems at many of the <i>jusen</i>. Cynics ask whether this might have had something to do with the large number of former finance-ministry officials who hold senior jobs at these institutions. Whatever the truth, the common practice (known as <i>amakudari</i>, or "descent from heaven") of bureaucrats moving to posts at banks they used to supervise has created the impression, as one foreign consultant puts it, that these people are simply "regulating their pre-retirement income".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The finance ministry has also been reluctant to force the banks to own up to the full extent of their bad loans. Better information matters because if creditors and depositors cannot distinguish between good and bad banks, in the event of a failure they are more likely to cause a run on all of them. Indeed, the ministry's own uncertainty about the true size of the banks' bad-debt problem--put at &#165;40 trillion in June 1995 and &#165;50 trillion only a month later--helped unnerve the market last year. David Atkinson, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, argues that until banks are forced to own up to and realise all of their bad loans, and then refinance borrowers, the country's property market is likely to remain moribund.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For now, though, the ministry seems to be hoping that a combination of low interest rates and tax breaks will be enough to tide most institutions over. Belatedly, it has also allowed some banks to go bust. Until last year, not a single Japanese bank had failed since the second world war. Since then, several small ones have gone under, including Taiheiyo Bank, which collapsed last month. But depositors should not have to worry. Officials have promised that they will not let any of Japan's 21 big banks fail, and that deposits at smaller ones will be protected until the end of the decade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And what then? The finance ministry says it intends to get tougher with its charges. At the end of last year it announced a series of reforms which included beefing up the deposit-insurance fund, hiring more examiners and creating an early-warning system to alert regulators to trouble. Bankers seem unworried by this prospect: there is still no formal commitment to banking burials, and the reforms do not include any proposals to improve financial disclosure. That is a pity, because regulators in other countries increasingly feel that the only effective way to supervise complicated beasts such as banks is to harness market forces to the task.

<h1>Safe banking</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Like safe sex, safe banking requires effective precautions</i>

<p>THERE is a simple solution to the problem of moral hazard. The bosses of Japanese banks that fail could be made to fall on their swords. American bankers could be tossed from the top of the Empire State building, French ones from the Eiffel Tower. That would make bankers much more cautious in future, and banks much less fragile. But leaving aside the humanitarian objections, there is another snag: lending would dry up. Companies and individuals would find it far harder to get credit, and society as a whole would be worse off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Striking the right balance between efficiency and financial stability is a devilishly difficult task, as America's <font size=-1>S&L</font>s and Japan's <i>jusen</i> have demonstrated. Academics, consultants and regulators are still trying to come up with ways of avoiding the pitfalls. One school of thought argues that the present system of regulation can be modified in ways that will help to reduce, though not eliminate, moral hazard. Another argues that more far-reaching changes are needed in the structure of the safety net that underpins most of the world's banks. This article considers the regulators' responses to the increasing complexity of banking risks. The next looks at some of the radical suggestions for reforming the structure of the banking system to make it safer.
</p><p><b>Tightening the screws</b></b>
<br>An obvious answer to the problem of moral hazard is to tighten regulation dramatically, while retaining comprehensive deposit insurance. But there are several problems with this approach. For a start, it probably would not work, because banks are past masters at finding loopholes in laws. Worse, an attempt to turn the screws might simply drive business to more lightly regulated offshore havens. It would certainly impose an even heftier burden on banks, which would pass it on to their customers. A study by the London Business School last year found that the annual direct cost of financing regulators' activities in Britain was almost &#163;90m ($140m); in America, it was $795m. On top of this, banks also have to foot the bill for the paperwork that regulators demand. The American Bankers Association has estimated the cost of this to its members at $14 billion a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So rather than introducing new restrictions, some governments are looking for other ways of getting banks to behave more prudently. One option is to give all depositors a greater incentive to monitor their banks by limiting government insurance to a fixed percentage of deposits--a system known as "co-insurance". Under such a scheme, which is currently used in Britain, all depositors have a strong incentive to watch the activities of their banks carefully. At the same time, there is less of an incentive for regulators fully to protect depositors when a bank does go bust.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another way of encouraging banks to be cautious is to tie their deposit-insurance premiums to the riskiness of their portfolios (at present, most premiums are calculated as a straight percentage of a bank's assets). This amounts to charging banks for the risks that they are asking taxpayers to bear. America's <font size=-1>FDIC</font> is in the van: since 1993, it has based its premiums on banks' capital-to-assets ratios and the results of bank examinations. But assessing the exact riskiness of a bank's portfolio is tricky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Regulators, too, are trying something different. Their idea is to create rules that encourage banks to behave as they would if there were no safety net--a strategy that Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, the chairman of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, has dubbed "market-friendly" regulation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Padoa-Schioppa argues that the original Basle capital ratios on credit risk were a move away from credit ceilings and other administrative measures, and a first step towards market friendliness. But they failed to recognise that some risks cancel each other out; banks must still put capital against them. They also failed to distinguish between different categories of credit risk: for example, loans to a blue-chip corporate giant and a tiny high-tech start-up both carry a risk-weighting of 100%. And so the list of gripes goes on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the rules covering market risk--the threat of losses on securities because of price movement--the Basle committee has taken a new step. Instead of stipulating a framework of detailed capital ratios for everyone, it has given banks a choice. Either they can use their own financial models to calculate how much capital to hold against their risks (although the result is subject to a multiplier laid down by the committee), or they can use the regulators' standard formula. Each bank must calculate a "value at risk" for itself: the maximum amount that it might expect to lose by holding a particular position for a certain period. If all goes according to plan, this new way of measuring market risk will be implemented by the end of 1997.
</p><p><b>Do-it-yourself regulation</b></b>
<br>The advantage of this method is that it should minimise the distortion of banks' activities caused by rigid capital rules. At the same time it is intended to encourage banks to improve their risk management, because the best risk managers should face relatively low capital charges. In the same spirit, America's Federal Reserve has floated another idea for calculating capital requirements for market risk, called "pre-commitment". This would allow banks to decide for themselves what their likely maximum loss will be on a trading portfolio over a certain period and to set capital aside against this. If the actual losses exceed the limits the banks have set, regulators can "fine" them by, say, imposing extra capital charges.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This carrot-and-stick strategy is based on the realisation that regulators will find it hard to judge which risk-management models will work. Under pre-commitment, they need not bother with such assessments. The problem is that such penalties may not always be an effective deterrent to excessive risk-taking. If a bank has run up far bigger losses than expected on its trading portfolio, a hefty fine might push it into bankruptcy, so regulators might think twice before imposing one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is another snag with both the model and the pre-commitment approaches. Neither provides a direct answer to the problem of sloppy internal controls. Yet it was these that caused both the Barings and Daiwa Bank crises. Regulators are trying to give banks an incentive to sharpen up here, too. Some are adding a new form of oversight, which America's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (<font size=-1>OCC</font>) calls "supervision by risk". Eugene Ludwig, the agency's boss, talks about developing "a risk vocabulary for banks" on the basis of the new method that the <font size=-1>OCC</font> began using this year. The idea is for watchdogs to rate banks' internal processes as well as their finances. To do this they must assess, among other things, how much directors know about a bank's risk-management strategy and how independent its internal audit teams are.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But without the powers and resources of a secret police force, regulators will find it hard to monitor banks' affairs so intimately. Better, some say, to rely even more on market forces by making banks issue some form of subordinated debt, if they have not already done so. The idea behind this is simple. Because holders of this debt know that, if a bank fails, their claims will be the last to be honoured (hence the term "subordinated"), they should have a big incentive to monitor banks closely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even subordinated debt might not change banks' behaviour if the debtholders believe that governments will tend to rescue troubled banks. Could something be done to cure this habit, too? George Kaufman of Loyola University in Chicago and George Benston of Emory University in Atlanta think so. They are the brains behind a scheme called Structured Early Intervention and Resolution (<font size=-1>SEIR</font>), which tries to mimic what would happen to banks in the absence of deposit insurance by creating a sort of bankruptcy code. Typically, shareholders of an ordinary company whose equity has shrunk dramatically are asked by creditors to recapitalise the firm. If they do not, the creditors may force it into bankruptcy. Yet troubled banks rarely face such ultimatums because their depositors know that the government will rescue them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>SEIR</font> changes this by forcing banks to hold plenty of capital, and by prescribing a series of progressively tougher actions that regulators must take each time a bank's capital-to-assets ratio falls below certain pre-determined levels. When the bank's net worth has reached a pre-set low point, but before it goes into the red, the regulators are meant to shut it down. This system has three big advantages over the status quo. The first is that the sanctions make it far harder for banks to gamble with depositors' cash as their fortunes decline. The second is that at the point when banks are shut, they should still have enough money in their coffers to pay depositors. Lastly, at least in principle, under such a system no bank should be too big to fail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japanese and other taxpayers might be delighted at the chance to tie their regulators' hands. But will <font size=-1>SEIR</font> work in practice? America has had its own version, known as "prompt corrective action", since 1991 (see <a href="images/tsu142.gif">table</a>). Among other things, this forbids weak banks from accepting brokered deposits--large sums of money broken up into small amounts so that they qualify for deposit insurance--and restricts the interest rates they can offer. But there have been few big-bank failures in recent years, so the system has not yet been fully tested. Moreover, Messrs Kaufman and Benston complain that the American system has watered down their proposals by, for example, including a get-out clause enabling regulators to offer banks special help in some circumstances.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Market-friendly regulation, supervision by risk and prompt corrective action all seem like perfectly good ideas. But there is no guarantee that they will work, or that the proliferation of rules they imply will be cost-effective. One thing is certain, however. None of them will do any good unless banks are forced to provide more information about their business more quickly. At least one country, New Zealand, is relying on greater disclosure as a substitute for much of the traditional paraphernalia of supervision (see <a href="ibsu8.html">page</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some officials are beginning to suggest that the present system may need to be adapted in more radical ways. In a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos in February, Thomas Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Board of Kansas City, said that regulators would find it increasingly hard to keep up with large global banks dealing in complex financial instruments. To do so effectively, he said, they would need to know "as much about a bank, its model and control procedures as the rocket scientists who built the model and the management who designed the risk-management strategy." Given these difficulties, Mr Hoenig suggested that it might be time to remove the safety net from such banks altogether. That is just what many financial economists have been saying for some time.

<h1>A novel bank statement</h1>


<br><p>WOULD a bigger role for market forces in disciplining banks make the system more stable? Many financial economists are convinced that the answer is yes, but they have no recent empirical evidence to support their view. That is about to change.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until the start of this year, New Zealand, which has no deposit-insurance scheme, relied on a system of bank examinations to ensure financial stability. That system has now been scrapped. Instead, every bank must produce a comprehensive quarterly financial statement for the country's central bank, listing items such as the quality of its assets, the sectors it has lent to and its ratings from private credit-rating agencies. A bank's statements must be audited twice yearly, and a two-page summary must be posted in all of its branches. The first statements, for the year to end-March, should appear soon.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is not all. Under the new regime, bank directors will have to validate these reports and state publicly that their bank's risk-management system is suitable for its business and that it is being properly implemented. If a bank subsequently goes bust because of a lapse of control, woe betide its directors: creditors can sue them and they may face unlimited liability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The aim of the reform, says Don Brash, New Zealand's central-bank governor, is to improve banks' internal governance. It will also give investors and depositors more detailed and timely information on the banks' financial health. The banks, for their part, will escape the central bank's rules on internal control systems and its examination fees. They will, however, still have to meet the Basle capital-adequacy ratios, and will be promptly dealt with if they fail to do so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New Zealand's approach to disclosure is anathema to regulators almost everywhere else. Some argue that the country was able to choose this route only because around 90% of the assets in its banking system belong to subsidiaries of foreign banks, which are in effect supervised by their home countries' regulators. Mr Brash insists that the reason for the central bank's decision to switch arose purely from its conviction that the traditional approach to regulation was flawed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other central banks point out several problems with New Zealand's experiment. One is that unlimited liability might discourage good people from taking up directors' posts. Another is that, in some circumstances, too much information can be as dangerous as too little. For example, if a big investment made by a bank suddenly turns sour, the bank's depositors might panic when they see the red figures. Moreover, say the critics, banks will be more willing to own up to difficulties if they know the information will be kept private. The role of father confessor allows regulators to solve potentially serious problems behind closed doors. In short, the market's ignorance is sometimes bliss.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of these arguments is conclusive. If a bank knows that it will have to come clean about its finances every quarter, it is less likely to take a risk that could sink it. Besides, the new regime gives banks a big incentive to build up their financial strength to impress credit-rating agencies. "Banks will be competing for deposits not just on [interest] rates but on ratings," says Mr Brash. As for central banks' ability to keep information under wraps, this has no doubt helped all concerned out of some tight spots; but, as this survey has shown, it may also have led to costly forbearance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is another problem, too. The secrecy of bank examinations encourages the belief that the government is somehow in league with the industry, and is therefore to blame when it allows a bank to fail. This puts pressure on regulators to prop banks up. One reason for New Zealand's change of approach is that the central bank wants to dispel the notion that individual banks carry a public guarantee. Its experiment may not be perfect, but it is worth watching.

<h1>Private ideas for public policy</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>A different insurance policy would produce a very different type of bank</i>

<p>IS THERE a better way of tackling moral hazard and reducing systemic risk than the insure-and-regulate approach to banking? A number of academics and consultants, mostly in America, have envisaged various ways of bringing about a largely unregulated and uninsured banking system, all of which share a common theme: to make explicit the cost of the subsidy that deposit insurance provides and to pass it on to banks and/or their customers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most extreme suggestion now being debated is to privatise deposit insurance and bank regulation altogether. This would force banks to pay a market rate for their insurance coverage and encourage insurance firms to stop the banks from taking excessive risks. But there is a snag: the thought of underwriting banks' deposits fills most insurers with horror. They prefer their risks to be predictable, a quality which bank runs by their nature do not possess. And when a run happens, the cost can be steep--so steep that it can bankrupt insurers, leaving governments to pick up the bill. America's experience has confirmed the worst fears. During the thrift crisis, the state authorities in Maryland and Ohio had to step in to help depositors left in limbo by bust quasi-private insurance funds covering the <font size=-1>S&L</font> industry.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Might another version of private insurance work? Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, has long championed an intriguing plan under which banks would in effect underwrite one another's risks via a system of "cross-guarantees". Before a bank could set up shop, it would have to persuade a syndicate of guarantors (largely other banks) to underwrite all of its liabilities. If the bank subsequently went bust, the guarantors would cover all liabilities left after its equity had been wiped out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to charging a premium for the guarantee, the guarantors would also draw up a contract with the bank laying down operating guidelines; and they would appoint a specialised supervisor, or "syndicate agent", to enforce it. The result would be a complex web of interlocking contracts binding the industry together. A small government agency would ensure that all guarantors were themselves guaranteed and that their contracts met certain minimum standards (see <a href="images/csu088.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main attraction of this plan is that, by removing deposit insurance, it cures the moral-hazard problem. At the same time, it encourages banks to police one another and gives syndicate agents an incentive to watch them like hawks; an agent responsible for supervising a bank that goes bust is unlikely to get more business. Moreover, banks could tailor their contracts with guarantors to fit their strategy--a big advance on the present system of regulation, which tends to have one set of rules for everybody. Given the resources of big American and European banks, Mr Ely reckons that cross-guarantee systems in both regions would be able to withstand all but the most epic shocks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this sounds fine in theory. But in practice, switching to such a system would be a huge gamble. Some of the plan's critics argue that by connecting banks even more tightly together, it would increase systemic risk. Under the scheme's rules, banks are supposed to pay first and complain later if problems do crop up. But what if they refuse to cover a loss? And if the government was still involved in the system via the cross-guarantee agency, would it not have trouble convincing people that it had abandoned its role as a backstop altogether?
</p><p><b>Narrow-minded</b></b>
<br>According to another school of thought on banking reform, the state safety net should not be abolished altogether but merely shrunk. This would be done by splitting today's risk-loving, accident-prone banks into two disparate halves: a super-safe, government-insured "narrow bank" that sticks to traditional business and invests only in secure assets, and an uninsured institution--call it a "broad bank"--that could range more widely under a much lighter regulatory system. Savers who invested in the broad bank would get a much higher return because it could invest in riskier assets; but they would also lose their shirts if it went bust. Narrow banks could be owned by broad ones (or indeed any other kind of institution), but a series of legal barriers, or "firewalls", would prevent broad banks from dipping into narrow banks' coffers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All banking boffins agree that narrow banks could not get involved in risky activities such as property lending, securities underwriting and derivatives, but they differ on details. For instance, Lowell Bryan of McKinsey, a management consultancy, has proposed a system under which narrow banks (or "core" banks, as he likes to call them) could lend to individuals as well as to small and medium-sized businesses, on the ground that such loans are relatively safe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This bothers other narrow-bankers, who consider such illiquid loans too risky for an institution intended as a safe haven. Moreover, they say, the point of narrow banking is to isolate and insure only the unique and critical functions that banks perform. Lending does not qualify because many other kinds of institutions, such as insurers and credit-card companies, also make loans. So what does fit the bill? James Pierce, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, has suggested that "monetary service companies"--his label for narrow banks--should provide only basic payments services and accept deposits, and that their investments should be limited to highly liquid assets, such as Treasury bills.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such narrowness appears to offer a neat solution to several of the problems identified earlier in this survey. It reduces systemic risk in the payments system by allowing only highly liquid banks access to it (others must channel payments through these banks). It tackles moral hazard by limiting deposit-insurance coverage. And it lightens the regulatory load on broad banks, making it easier for them to compete with loosely regulated non-bank rivals. A national commission looking into the effects of the thrifts crisis in America in 1993 was so impressed that it included narrow banking as one of its recommendations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics, however, point out that the system has costs as well as benefits. One is that it prevents broad banks getting information about depositors that would help guide their lending decisions. Another is that even a narrow bank will not be entirely safe because other institutions using it to make payments could run up daylight overdrafts and then go bust before settling them. To tackle the first problem, Frederick Carns, an economist at the <font size=-1>FDIC</font>, has suggested that rather than splitting banks in two, they should instead be allowed to offer savers a choice between "insured" and "uninsured" accounts. The second objection could be met by introducing real-time gross settlement for payments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more serious criticism of narrow banking is that, in certain circumstances, it could lead to more runs on banks. In good times, everyone would want to invest in broad banks; but during bad ones, cash would flood into safe narrow banks, perhaps forcing broad ones to call in some of their loans. Of course, money-laden narrow banks could help channel money back to solvent broad banks by buying their securities. But this might not be enough, and if governments then bailed out some broad banks to avoid a credit crunch, this would undermine the whole point of narrow banking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To avoid this problem, some economists have turned to another banking model, originally thought up in the 1930s by a group of Chicago economists as an alternative to deposit insurance. Instead of breaking banks up, this would force them to back any deposits they hold with an equivalent amount of Treasury bills and other safe assets. In a recent book*, Robert Merton and Zvi Bodie of Harvard University argue that this would not only produce a sound payments system and protect any synergies between deposit-taking and lending, but also force banks to fund their loans by, say, issuing securities rather than relying on deposits. But this approach, too, has its critics, who argue that the banks it would create would be unable to make a profit. Customers, they claim, might even have to pay to deposit their cash with them. The banking system would shrink dramatically.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without a crystal ball, it is impossible to say for certain what economic and social impact narrow-banking models would have. However, there are good grounds for thinking that they would create more stable banking systems. Most regulators, however, remain sceptical about narrow banking's practicality. Instead, they are concentrating their efforts on creating common international standards of financial safety. That is easier said than done.

<h1>A standard dose</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Cross-border prescriptions for banking systems can sometimes do more harm than good</i>

<p>AS MEDICAL science progresses in parallel with the appearance of each new disease, so progress on international co-operation in banking is often linked to crises. The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, founded in the aftermath of the Herstatt affair in 1974, has gradually developed a global framework for dealing with the industry's problems. Many of its achievements are impressive. But occasionally the rich world's central bankers have allowed politics to get in the way of prudence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The original agreement drawn up in 1975 on supervising international banks, known as the Concordat, has been revised twice since then: in 1983, following the collapse of Italy's Banco Ambrosiano, and again in 1992 following the <font size=-1>BCCI</font> affair. Its minimum standards now require, among other things, that all international banks must be supervised on a consolidated basis (ie, looking at their entire business worldwide) by a capable authority from the country in which they have their head office. At the same time, if other countries in which the bank has branches do not think that the "home-country" supervisor is doing a good job, they can restrict the bank's activities there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;International co-operation has not always gone smoothly. Witness the decision last October by Daiwa Bank's American hosts to make it sell its local operations for failing to inform the Federal Reserve immediately after it found one of the traders in its New York office hiding trading losses of $1.1 billion. The Barings affair, in which a gaggle of regulators in Britain, Japan and Singapore failed to spot what a rogue trader was up to, also showed up gaping holes in the system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But at least the committee provides a forum in which such problems can be tackled. At the same time, it is valiantly trying to harmonise some of the prudential rules that govern countries' banks. Why bother? After all, domestic lenders of last resort should be able to deal with most banking crises except, say, Herstatt risk. The answer is that, in the absence of harmonisation, countries that tried to tighten their rules unilaterally could find that their entire banking industry had decamped to other, more relaxed regimes, making the system as a whole more fragile.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble with the Basle approach is that any deal requires a lot of political horse-trading. Often, the separate aims of ensuring the system's stability and creating a level playing field between banks from different countries are mixed up. Consider the original Basle capital-adequacy agreement that covers banks' credit risk. Its main backers were American and European banks, which saw it as an ideal way to rein in the lending of Japanese rivals they considered undercapitalised. Smaller countries went along with this, fearing that otherwise their banks would find themselves shut out of several of the world's main financial markets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The European Union's Capital Adequacy Directive (<font size=-1>CAD</font>), which came into effect in January, is another example of a harmonised rule that puts level playing fields before level-headedness. In a recent paper*, Harald Benink of the University of Limburg and David Llewellyn of Loughborough University argue that the directive is flawed because it applies the same capital standards for market risk--the chance that the price of a security will fall--to banks with securities operations and to ordinary securities firms. Yet securities firms are less risky beasts than banks: they have highly liquid portfolios, unlike banks' illiquid loan books, and are not directly linked to the payments system. By failing to insist on higher capital standards for banks, Messrs Benink and Llewellyn argue, the new European rules may have increased risk in the system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this undermines the case for closer international co-operation among the world's financial regulators, though it does argue for caution in rule-making. One of the most useful things that the Basle committee does is to collate and publish figures on activity in areas such as derivatives. Together with a group of securities regulators, it has also issued joint proposals aimed at improving the quality of the information that banks and securities houses report about their trading activities.
</p><p><b>Three into one</b></b>
<br>Banking watchdogs have also been working with securities and insurance regulators on the risks posed by the growth of financial conglomerates. In Japan, and to a lesser extent in America, rules and regulations restrict the number of hybrids that can combine securities, banking and insurance (or indeed any two of these) under one corporate roof. But in Europe they are all the rage. In two of the most notable deals concluded last year, Barings was bought by <font size=-1>ING</font> (itself the product of a merger between a Dutch bank and an insurer), and Swiss Bank Corporation gobbled up S.G. Warburg, another British merchant bank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany, whose banking groups have fingers in many pies, have largely managed to avoid banking hiccups. This suggests that diversified financial groups are in fact more stable than narrowly focused ones. But a preliminary report published by a joint group of banking, insurance and securities supervisors last July noted that the growth of such conglomerates also makes it harder for outsiders to get an overall view of the risks that they are running. And it pointed out that problems in one part of a group could quickly spread to other areas, as happened at Barings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way of dealing with this blurring of boundaries between different businesses might be to switch from regulation by institution, the most common form now, to regulation by function; in other words, let banking watchdogs supervise the banking operations of all financial firms, insurance regulators the insurance operations and so on. This would ensure a consistent approach to regulation across the industry, but it might cause problems too, because no single body would be able to take an overall view of a group.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some academics have even suggested a variation on this theme that would split supervision between two bodies: one responsible for ensuring systemic stability across the financial industry, and another responsible for consumer-protection issues. Such novel schemes would probably be better than the status quo, but they would not be foolproof. Besides, fiddling with the regulatory system will do nothing to tackle the underlying cause of financial instability: governments themselves.

<h1>Extinguishing banking's fires</h1>

<p><b></b></p>
<i>Bad banks are usually the product of bad macroeconomic policy</i>


<p>EVEN Adam Smith fretted about systemic risk in banking. In his book, "The Wealth of Nations", he drew an analogy between the need of governments to violate the natural liberty of bankers by regulating them, and the need to make neighbours build party walls to stop fire from spreading through a community. Fortunately, since the Great Depression, the legal and other firewalls installed by governments throughout the world's banking systems have stopped all kinds of potential catastrophes from spreading. Somehow, though, that is less reassuring than it should be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a moment, put aside the methods used to tackle these financial conflagrations, and the side-effects that they have. The real point is this: whereas governments have managed to prevent systemic banking crises, they have singularly failed to tackle their underlying cause. This is not because of short-sightedness among bankers, but rather because of myopia among countries' economic policy-makers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This judgment may seem harsh. After all, there have been plenty of occasions--for example, after the 1987 stockmarket crash and during the recent property bust--when swift government action to pump liquidity into the financial system or to lower interest rates has helped to defuse a potential crisis. But in these and many other cases, governments have simply cleared up financial messes that were to a large extent of their own making. Much of the blame for this lies with the volatile monetary policies that caused the boom-and-bust cycles. It is no coincidence that the worst banking crises in recent years occurred in countries where interest rates rose sharply in the late 1980s. Nor is it a coincidence that banks in countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, both paragons of monetary stability, escaped the traumas of the early 1990s largely unscathed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, almost every financial catastrophe can be traced back to some failure or other of economic policy. There is a simple lesson in that. The greatest single contribution that any government can make to better banking is to create a stable macroeconomic environment in which banks can flourish. That means resisting the temptation to respond to sluggish growth by slashing interest rates and stimulating demand with all manner of tempting tax breaks. And it means ensuring that economies get richer gradually and boringly, rather than in a series of spectacular booms and busts.
</p><p><b>The $64 billion question</b></b>
<br>But do not pin too much hope on these things happening. The governments of rich countries may profess to have learnt the lessons of the most recent banking crisis, but a glance at the financial history books shows they have often made such claims in the past and failed to live up to them. Rather than concentrating on fire prevention, they will continue to reach for the extinguishers every time that banks go up in flames.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a strategy, as this survey has shown, simply stores up more costly problems for the future by aggravating moral hazard. Some economists have argued that even though safety nets may have led to excessive risk-taking and wasteful investments by banks, this is a small price to pay for preventing a systemic crisis. Perhaps. But unless the present system is changed, the cost of the safety net is likely to rise inexorably. For one thing, the wave of mega-mergers that is sweeping the industry--including those between Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank in America and between Mitsubishi Bank and the Bank of Tokyo in Japan--is creating ever bigger banks that in the event of failure would cost more to rescue. Moreover, as banks' traditional franchise is invaded by competitors, they are rapidly moving into ever riskier businesses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What can be done to solve the problem of moral hazard? Trying to return banking to its original, heavily regulated state would be a mistake, even if it were possible, which is doubtful because the industry has changed so much. As well as destroying the economic benefits that liberalisation has brought, a <font size=-1>U</font>-turn would reinforce the impression that governments are there to ensure that banks do not go bust. A move to a system of private insurance also seems impractical, although some elements of this could complement government schemes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead, what is needed is a mechanism which would make it possible for most, if not all, banks to fail without causing a systemic crisis, and which would inflict heavy penalties on those that are bailed out as a deterrent to others. Making bail-outs unpleasant is relatively easy. Even if central bankers break Bagehot's rules by lending to troubled banks at subsidised rates, they can still ensure that the banks' shareholders are wiped out and that their managers are replaced, no matter what the size of the institution. Even if some banks are too big to fail, none should be considered too big to suffer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Allowing bank failures without inviting systemic crisis is much more difficult. Domestic insured deposits are now only a tiny percentage of the liabilities of some of the world's biggest banks. In exchange for a lighter regulatory regime, some of them might be persuaded to relinquish their attachment to the safety net. But because they would still play a central role in payments systems, governments might feel duty-bound to support them if they got into trouble. Some form of narrow banking could resolve this dilemma by separating payments from the rest of a bank's activities. But it might take several more banking crises to convince governments that this is worth trying.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the meantime, they will continue to muddle along with the present insure-and-regulate system. This can certainly be improved by, among other things, more co-insurance, more disclosure, greater reliance on subordinated debt and a system of prompt corrective action that makes it harder for regulators to support ailing banks for no good reason. But even with all these improvements, the task of monitoring the far-flung activities of global banking giants seems beyond the wit of many supervisors--just as, it seems, it is beyond some of the managers of the banks themselves. The Barings and Daiwa cases hit the headlines, but many similar, though rather less costly, fiascos have been kept under wraps by embarrassed banks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One change is afoot, however, that is making it easier to let even big banks fail. As more and more countries' payments systems move towards real-time gross settlement, the chances of one collapse causing a domino effect is diminishing. With efforts now focused on exorcising the ghost of Bankhaus Herstatt in foreign exchange too, international banking is moving towards what one central banker has called "real-time everything". The vital but unglamorous job of fixing the world's financial plumbing will still take years to complete, but once it is done, many bankers who persist in leaping out of windows before looking will suddenly discover that there is nobody there to catch them.

<H1>The death of distance</H1>

<P>
<I>Thanks to technology and competition in telecoms, </I>
<P>
<I>distance will soon be no object. The effect on people's</I>

<P>
<I>lives will be dramatic, says Frances Cairncross</I><HR>

<P>
ON MOTHERS' Day this year <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>,
America's second-largest long-distance telephone company, offered
many of its domestic customers free calls. Struck by an annual
outbreak of filial sentiment, Americans make more long-distance
calls on Mothers' Day than on any other day of the year. Americans
also have almost a quarter of the world's telephone lines, so
Mothers' Day traffic in the United States is probably the heaviest
anywhere in the world. Yet MCI felt it could offer a free service
without overloading its network.
<P>
In time, every day may well be Mothers' Day, everywhere. Relentless
technological change is driving down many of the elements in the
cost of a telephone call. Already, the cost of carrying an additional
call is often so tiny that it might as well be free. More significant,
carrying a call from London to New York costs virtually the same
as carrying it from one house to the next.
<P>
The death of <A HREF="tc1.gif">distance</A> as a determinant of
the cost of communications will probably be the single most important
economic force shaping society in the first half of the next century.
It will alter, in ways that are only dimly imaginable, decisions
about where people live and work; concepts of national borders;
patterns of international trade. Its effects will be as pervasive
as those of the discovery of electricity. Who could have foreseen,
in Michael Faraday's time, that electricity would eventually release
women to go out to work, transforming the shape of the family,
or allow the development of cities such as Manhattan and Hong
Kong, whose skyscrapers could never have been built without the
lift?
<P>
The discovery of electricity created new industries, but it killed
some too. The change in the cost structure of telecommunications
will do the same. For the moment, telecoms is a business on the
crest of a wave. (See <A HREF="tcch2.gif">chart</A>) Profitability
has climbed almost without interruption for a decade, and is still
accelerating. In 1994 the ten largest telecoms giants made bigger
profits than the 25 largest commercial banks (see <A HREF="tcch11.gif">chart</A>).
Demand is soaring: over 38m new subscribers were connected to
the fixed network in 1994, more than twice as many newcomers as
in 1986. Another 19m joined a mobile network in 1994 alone. Yet
costs have tended to fall faster than prices, which is why the
industry has been so profitable. Now those fat profits are coming
under attack from an ever-growing band of competitors.
<P>
There was a time when telecoms seemed to be a natural monopoly.
Most governments liked it that way because they owned the monopoly
and siphoned off some of the profits. Even now, most homes are
served by only one wire, so customers cannot switch telephone
services in the way they can change their hairdresser or their
lawyer. But as new technologies reduce the costs of entry, competition
is spreading. Enthusiastically in some countries and gingerly
in most, governments have begun to accept that competition offers
the best way to ensure that changing technology is fully translated
into lower tariffs.
<P>
In each of the world's three big markets, reforms are in train
to foster competition. In the United States, if the <A HREF="http://www.bell.com/">telecommunications proposals</A>
that passed Congress in August become law, the long- distance
carriers, the regional Bell companies and the cable-television
operators will be able to compete freely in each other's markets.
In Japan, the government is wondering how to reduce <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A>'s
iron grip on the local network. In Europe, the <A HREF="http://www.cec.lu/Welcome.html">commission </A>in
Brussels is determined to create a single market in telecommunications
services.
<P>
The benefits to an economy of even a little competition are tremendous.
A recent study by the <A HREF="http://www.oecd.org/">OECD</A>
(``Telecommunications Infrastructure: The Benefits of Competition'')
concluded that liberalisation not only reduced prices, but expanded
the market and improved customer choice. This is true not just
in developed countries but in developing ones too. In the Philippines,
for example, the government's decision in 1993 to allow new entrants
to provide local telephone services on a large scale persuaded
PLDT, the country's main operator, to make a serious effort to
cut waiting lists.
<P>
The case for competition is dawning even on China. A new telecoms
operator, United Telecommunications Co (Unicom), was set up in
1994 by the ministries of electronics, railways and power, the
industries from which many competitors have emerged in the rich
world. Using the railway ministry's routes as a backbone, Unicom
is constructing a fibre-optic network, starting with 15,000-20,000
subscribers in each of four large cities.
<H3>Changing shape</H3>

<P>
Competition has already begun to transform some of the companies
gathering in Geneva for next week's <A HREF="http://www.itu.ch/TELECOM/">Telecom 95</A>,
a giant jamboree for the industry. A dramatic instance came on
September 20th, when <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>
announced it was splitting into three. Where competition is toughest,
telecoms giants are slimming their enormous workforces and trying
to add value to their basic services. AT&amp;T itself has built
a popular credit card on its brand name and billing skills. Hongkong
Telecom and <A HREF="http://www.bell-atl.com/">Bell Atlantic</A>,
among others, are exploring ways to provide interactive entertainment.
Several giants, including <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>, are building alliances
to provide sophisticated telephone packages for international
business customers.
<P>
Their competitors are more diverse still. They now include not
just other telecoms companies but also cable-television operators,
software manufacturers, banks, water companies, railways and many
more, all nibbling at the $500 billion market for global telecommunications.
They are bringing new skills and new approaches, helping to transform
telecommunications from an industry that builds and maintains
networks into one that offers communications as an incidental
part of a host of other services. In particular, telecommunications
will vastly extend, and in its turn be extended by, the reach
of the computer as the two technologies increasingly converge.
<P>
The direction of these changes is fairly clear, but their speed
is uncertain. This survey will argue that the pace will be set
not just by technology but by the interplay of regulation and
competition. Governments can delay the revolution; they cannot
prevent it. If they try, they will merely fail more spectacularly
later. <HR>

<H1>All change</H1>

<P>
<I>From dearth to glut</I><HR>

<P>
THE technological changes that have swept across the telecommunications
industry have two distinct effects. One is to create glut instead
of the capacity shortages of the past. The other is to reduce
barriers to entry and make possible new sorts of competition.
Together, they will transform the industry -- although the pace
at which they take effect will be partly set by regulation.
<P>
The increase in capacity is essentially due to two changes. The
first is the increasing use of fibre-optic cables. These now cost
much the same as copper wire to lay down and much less to maintain,
but carry vastly more traffic. A single fibre thinner than a hair
can carry 30,000 simultaneous telephone conversations. Second,
switches -- telephone exchanges -- have moved on from eavesdropping
operators and clunky electro-mechanical devices to become increasingly
like computers, their costs falling and their capability expanding
inexorably. New cable has been laid most lavishly across the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans and on routes between cities in the United
States. Gluts are already appearing: more than one-third of the
capacity under the Atlantic is unused (see <A HREF="tcch3.gif">chart</A>).
The growth in capacity will continue as competitors lay cables
of their own. The most ambitious such project, the Fibre-optic
Link Around the Globe (FLAG), is run by a consortium in which
Nynex, one of America's regional Bell companies, has the largest
stake at 40%; but most of its partners are from outside the industry.
<P>
Technological change will also allow huge reductions in the running
costs of the network. ''Maintenance accounts for a quarter of
the costs of running a network, and the maintenance costs of a
fibre-optic network are around one-fifth those of a wired network.
Sending guys out in trucks is expensive,'' says Jeffrey Camp,
a senior analyst at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, explaining the pressure
on <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT </A>to replace copper with
fibre. Clever switching installed in the basements of business
premises allows telephone companies to press a button rather than
send a workman.
<P>
The implications of these changes are enormous. Unlike the computer
industry, which thanks to a similar increase in power and memory
has been able to offer customers more sophisticated devices at
the same price, the telecoms industry will have to offer the same
product at a small fraction of its former price. Operators everywhere
are struggling to find ways to add value to the basic telephone
call, but prices are likely to fall more quickly than premium
products can be marketed.
<H3>Loopy</H3>

<P>
Up to now, the main impact of technological change has been on
long-distance calls. In the United States, where four nationwide
fibre networks have been built in a decade, long-distance revenue
per minute has halved during that period. Now other technologies
are cutting the cost of the ``local loop'' -- the connection between
the nearest exchange and the subscriber's home. This connection
is usually made with a twisted pair of copper wires, a technology
unchanged for almost 120 years. As a rule of thumb, local distribution
accounts for 80% of a network's costs. <A HREF="http://khht.com/huber/home.html">Peter Huber</A>,
a telecoms specialist based in Washington, DC, reckons that it
costs around $1,200-2,000 to connect a new customer with copper.
<P>
Two less expensive and more flexible alternatives to copper have
now become available. One is to run telephone services over the
same system as cable television. A breakthrough in laser design
in the late 1980s made it possible to send analogue television
pictures along optical fibres. Since then cable systems, like
telephone systems, have increasingly acquired backbones of optical
fibre. Adding telephony to an existing cable system usually costs
much less than extending the copper-wire network.
<P>
The trouble is that a cable-television system, like a telephone
network, involves high fixed costs and passes homes that do not
want it, as well as homes that do; so building one from scratch
(as in Britain) is expensive. These problems are avoided by the
other technological breakthrough: the use of wireless transmission.
Its extraordinary flexibility and low cost will allow the development
of a new kind of network -- or networks -- competing directly
with fixed wires. ''Wireless is the answer to the local monopoly,''
says Robert Pepper, head of the office of plans and policy at
the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</A>
(FCC) in the United States.
<P>
``If local telcos were to rebuild from scratch today, they would
do so mostly with radio, at a cost of about $800 per subscriber,''
say Peter Huber, Michael Kellogg and John Thorne in ''<A HREF="http://khht.com/huber/geo2/geo2.html">The Geodesic Network II</A>'',
a 1993 review of competition in the industry in the United States.
Mobile telephones will increasingly compete head-on with fixed
systems. But the most important innovation is likely to be a digital
wireless link to a small fixed radio antenna in the home, which
can make extraordinarily efficient use of the radio spectrum:
unlike a mobile phone, the antenna is always tuned precisely to
the correct base station.
<P>
Such systems of wireless local access are now being developed
by several companies including Hughes in the United States and
Ionica in Britain, but are not yet in commercial use in OECD countries.
Nevertheless, calculations by <A HREF="http://www.analysys.co.uk">Analysys</A>,
a British consultancy, bear out the enthusiasm of Mr Huber and
his colleagues for fixed wireless access as potentially the least
expensive way to make the final link to the home.
<P>
If cable companies can supply bandwidth -- the capacity to send
lots of information -- and if wireless telephony will do almost
everything else that wire connections can do more cheaply, what
will that do to the established telephone operators? ''Technological
change always presents a problem for the owners of the old technology,''
says Philip Sirlin of <A HREF="http://www.hydra.com/wertheim/">Wertheim Schroder</A>,
analysts in New York. ''Capital intensity worsens the problem,
and the telephone industry is certainly capital intensive.'' The
big operators still have immense advantages. But are they now
doomed to be the railway magnates of the 21st century, saddled
with vast fixed costs for a network of dwindling value? Certainly
they will have to restructure their tariffs. Once costs are no
longer distance-sensitive, a premium becomes harder to maintain.
In Sweden, it costs the same to call from Malmo to Kiruna, 1,400km
(870 miles) away, as to Helsingborg, some 80km away. ''When you
tell people,'' says Martin Bangemann, an EU commissioner who has
been pushing for reform, ''they think it is a fairy tale.''
<P>
But why end the fairy tale at that point? When many parts of the
network are no longer constrained by capacity, why charge subscribers
by the number of seconds they spend on the telephone? Why not
simply charge them a regular fee based on the speed and capacity
of their line, and something extra for any fancy services they
buy? The pressure for such a change will grow as charges decline
and billing becomes an increasing burden.
<P>
That pressure is being reinforced by the growth of the Internet,
most of whose users pay a flat-rate subscription to cover un-limited
use, plus the cost of a local call to get connected. As more and
more people communicate by Internet across continents for next
to nothing, they will ask why telephone calls should be different.
<P>
Their question is now being answered by a New Jersey company,
<A HREF="http://www.vocaltec.com">VocalTec</A>, which is offering
the software to enable telephone calls to be made over the Internet.
Early versions of the software required both parties to have a
computer and to speak in turns, as with citizens' band radio,
but this has changed with the launch of ''one-end-only'' software
and the technology to allow ordinary two-way conversations. As
Bill Gates, chairman of <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A>,
said recently: ''I'm not sure what the Internet is good for commercially,
but I don't know why you would want to be in the long-distance
market with that thing out there.''
<P>
If the Internet were to become a serious rival to long-distance
telephony, the increase in traffic would require a vast amount
of additional investment -- which probably only the existing telecoms
operators could provide. But even with a tiny share of traffic,
the Internet's impact on prices may be large. That presents the
operators with a problem.
<P>
Until now, tariffs have been based on a cat's cradle of cross-subsidies.
Although a high and rising share of the costs of a network are
fixed, charges in most countries are still based mainly on us.
(See <A HREF="tcch4.gif">chart</A>) Moreover, the price of local
calls is widely subsidised from long-distance and international
calls, where tariffs have long been kept deliberately high. In
many countries local calls are free or extremely cheap. Everywhere,
too, domestic telephone users are subsidised and businesses overcharged.
<P>
Such cross-subsidies from business to domestic users -- and presumably
voters -- have suited governments down to the ground, putting
a lid on political enthusiasm for deregulation. Once competition
hits the more profitable markets, cross- subsidy becomes untenable.

<H1>The end of monopoly</H1>

<P>
<I>Farewell to those fat margins</I><HR>

<P>
FOR years, telecommunications was considered a natural monopoly.
Just in case it was not, governments almost everywhere hedged
it about with regulations to discourage competition. Gradually,
and more quickly in some countries than others, competition has
been allowed to creep in. To flourish, it needs not just the acquiescence
of governments but their willing support.
<P>
New entrants come from three directions. Some have built networks
of their own. Others have found ingenious ways to use infrastructure
leased from other businesses. And some are using new kinds of
infrastructure, mainly cable-television systems and the wireless
spectrum. The effect everywhere is the same: to drive down prices
and expand the range of services.
<P>
Long-distance rates and business customers -- the two areas where
tariffs were most out of line with costs -- have felt the effect
of competition first. Large business customers often begin by
putting together their own internal networks, to link office telephones
and personal computers. The <A HREF="http://www.cec.lu/en/comm.html">European Commission</A>
reckons that there are now around 700,000 private networks in
the United States, but only 14,000 in the less competitive European
Union. The proliferation of personal computers encourages companies
to link them into networks which can cover anything from a single
office to the whole world. Examples of global networks include
those used by the banking and airline industries, or the Internet,
the largest of them all.
<P>
These networks may be purpose-built, or they may run on leased
lines (of which some 20m are now in use). Once such networks are
constructed, spare capacity on them can be resold to other businesses
and operators, local legislation permitting. For example SITA
(Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Internationale de T&eacute;l&eacute;communications
A&eacute;ronautiques), the airline industry's immense global network,
has plans to offer voice services to multinationals.
<P>
Many other businesses have suddenly noticed either that they have
rights of way along which they can easily run fibre-optic cables,
or that they already have networks for their internal communications.
For example, a group of European railways has set up an organisation
called Hermes to carry telephone traffic across Europe's many
international borders; in France, G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux
expects telecommunications to provide 10% of its turnover by the
end of the century; and in Japan a group of regional electricity
utilities is building a network. <A HREF="http://www.mfsdatanet.com/mfs/mfs1.html">MFS</A>,
an American company, has built 46 fibre-optics networks in the
business districts of many big cities around the world, most recently
in Frankfurt and Paris.
<P>
The market is still patchy. Marc Destr&eacute;e, in charge of
international development for MFS, complains about the cost of
buying long-distance capacity in Europe: roughly ten times what
his company pays in the United States. But the important thing
about the market is that lines are usually charged at a fixed
fee, not priced by the amount they are used. That creates an opportunity
for arbitrage against the tariff structure of the big operators.
<P>
Everywhere, but especially in Europe, the big operators have fought
a furious rearguard action to prevent space on the networks being
resold, or to confine resale to closed-user groups such as the
branches of a hotel chain or a bank. But as the market develops,
they have as much interest as anyone in selling their spare capacity.
In the United States in particular, this wholesale market is huge,
with long-distance carriers such as <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>
selling large amounts of spare capacity to specialist companies
which have sprung up to take advantage of the pricing constraints
imposed on the big companies.
<P>
As restrictions are loosened, these resellers will enter the domestic
market too. With freedom to price on the basis of plenty rather
than shortage, they will undercut the dominant players. There
will be many more companies such as the bizarrely named 10297,
which advertises itself in the United States as a long-distance
wholesale club. It buys capacity in bulk from <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>,
MCI and <A HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A> and retails
it to individuals, who need only dial the five digits that make
up the company's name before calling any number to get price discounts
of up to 50%. Such ''systems integrators'', as <A HREF="http://www.ctr.columbia.edu/citi/staff.html">Eli Noam</A>
of the <A HREF="http://www.ctr.columbia.edu/citi/index.html">Columbia Institute of Tele-Information</A>
calls them, will proliferate, using their bargaining power to
bring individuals benefits hitherto available only to companies,
but not actually running the facilities themselves.
<P>
Foreign gold. Even before that, the market in spare capacity will
have a dramatic impact on international tariffs. International
calls produce only 12-15% of the revenues of the big operators,
says the <A HREF="http://www.itu.ch/">International Telecommunication Union </A>(ITU),
but generate 30- 40% of profits (see <A HREF="tcch10.gif">chart</A>).
Margins are high everywhere, but especially in continental Europe.
The share of operators in high-cost markets has come under increasing
pressure from the use of calling cards, which allow callers to
charge calls at lower rates, and from the call-back market.
<P>
Call-back services have been so effective in keeping a lid on
international rates that some countries, including China and Singapore,
are trying to ban them. A caller in a high-cost country, say Germany,
telephones a number in a low-cost country, usually the United
States. A computer identifies the caller without answering the
telephone, rings back and connects the subscriber to a third country,
say France. ''All over the world,'' says Howard Jonas, head of
IDT, a New York call-back company which he says is the world's
largest, ''countries 500 miles apart have rates double or triple
or quadruple the cost of calls from the United States. Rates are
not so much distance-sensitive as politically sensitive.'' Used
mainly by small and medium-sized companies, the call-back market
is not huge -- perhaps $300m a year, guesses Mr Jonas -- but its
impact on rates is disproportionately large.
<P>
Some governments are now trying to use the spare-capacity market
to break the complex settlements system for splitting the proceeds
of international calls among an oligopoly of big operators. Already,
sales of spare capacity between the gateways at which international
tolls are collected mean that international calls take increasingly
complicated routes, making the settlement process harder to police.
Some governments have turned a blind eye to a bit of bypassing.
But now the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Britain,
Finland and Sweden specifically allow resellers of capacity to
bypass the gateways. This has caused rates between these countries
to be slashed. (See <A HREF="tcch9.gif">chart</A>) For instance,
after Britain's agreement with the United States, <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>'s
transatlantic tariffs promptly dropped by a third.
<P>
As their fattest margins are squeezed, the large operators will
be forced to charge domestic subscribers more realistic prices.
Up to now, the combination of high costs and cross-subsidies has
made local distribution the least attractive part of the system
for would-be competitors. It has also been the part guarded most
fiercely by telephone operators. As a result, fewer than 1m people
worldwide have any choice in the fixed-line telephone they can
have. The remaining 650m or so subscribers have to take what the
local operator offers. But restructuring not only encourages more
rational local pricing; it also makes many governments keener
to see competition in the local loop. That is likely to come from
cable companies and from wireless. <HR>

WOULD people rather have bandwidth or <A HREF="tc2.gif">mobility</A>?
The answer will determine which of the two main competitors to
the telecom giants will come out on top. Cable -- provided by
the cable-television operators -- offers the bandwidth; wireless
-- used by the mobile telephone companies -- the mobility. The
global test-bed for cable is Britain, where cable companies have
been offering public telephone services in their own right since
1991, longer than anywhere else.
<P>
The cable-television operators have much in common with telephone
companies. They tend to have a local monopoly; they have a fixed
link with their subscribers; they bill their customers, and they
know quite a lot about their habits. The main difference until
now has been that their system is designed to pump information
in one direction only, while the telephone companies send it two
ways, and can switch it among many different subscribers. Yet
the coaxial cable traditionally used for cable systems provides
much more bandwidth than the telephone network's copper wires.
<P>
Now these differences are starting to matter less. Cable companies
are rebuilding their systems with optical fibre, and their costs
are coming down further as switching capacity gets ever cheaper.
Doug Regan of TeleWest, Britain's biggest cable company, says
that adding telephony increases the capital cost of a cable system
by 20-25%, but boosts revenue per customer by over 50%. Customers
who take the telephone service are also less likely to drop out
than those who take television alone, which means the cable company
saves on disconnecting customers and selling to new ones.
<P>
Mr Regan's arithmetic shows why, wherever they are allowed, cable-television
operators are offering telephone services as well. Not only is
the market much larger, but the double set of revenues makes it
easier to justify the vast cost -- some $10 billion of investment
in Britain, only half of it spent so far -- of digging up the
streets. Britain's cable operators are now investing as much annually
as <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>. In some parts of the country
they are signing up one-third of BT's customers. But not one of
them is yet making an operating profit. Moreover, they now face
a nasty squeeze on their margins. BSkyB, the satellite-television
company that provides most of their programmes, has been pushing
up its charges. At the same time, BT has begun to cut its prices
aggressively. The cable companies have to follow suit: the main
selling point of their telephone service is that it costs 10-15%
less than BT's.
<P>
Is Britain's experience a cautionary tale for cable companies
elsewhere? Not necessarily: Britain has been building a cable
network from scratch. Besides, one of the main attractions of
cable television in the United States -- the quality of transmission
-- counts for nothing in Britain, which has high-quality terrestrial
coverage. And because the cable companies depend heavily for their
programming on BSkyB, which already supplies a well-developed
market for satellite television, the quality of their entertainment
has not been a big selling point.
<P>
In some other countries cable telephony may well be more competitive.
In Hong Kong, for example, where the local monopoly of Hongkong
Telecom expired at the end of June, Alex Arena, the director-general
of telecommunications, licensed three new local telephone carriers.
One of them, New T&amp;T, is owned by the Wharf group, a large
property conglomerate which also owns Wharf Cable. In June 1993
this company won a 12-year licence to provide cable television,
with a guarantee of no competition for the first three years.
Up to now, it has distributed programmes mainly with a microwave
link. The group is now running an optical-fibre loop around Hong
Kong's subway system, a stone's throw from the basements of most
of the island's tower blocks. Servicing tower blocks that house
perhaps 500 families a time clearly costs less than digging up
Britain's suburban streets.
<P>
Competitors offering cable television and telephone together are
springing up in more and more countries. In Japan, two consortia
of Japanese and American companies are amalgamating the fragmented
cable-television companies. One of them is Jupiter, which hopes
to launch a telephone service by the end of 1996. Its president,
Yasushige Nishimura, notes that <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A>,
the former state monopoly, charges &#165;72,800 (about $750) for
installing not just the first line but each and every subsequent
one as well. ''If you can offer a second line for free, that is
attractive in a country where grown-up children tend to live with
their parents until they marry,'' he points out. As the company's
capital expenditure per customer connected is less than &#165;72,000,
the economics makes sense -- for the moment.
<P>
By running telephony on the back of existing cable-television
networks, systems operators in several countries can offer telephone
services more cheaply than the established telephone operators.
But to win a big chunk of the market, they will have to offer
something more than price competition.
<P>
In the United States, the move into cable telephony will be led
by a group built around <A HREF="http://www.tcinc.com/">Tele-Communications Inc</A>
(TCI), America's biggest systems owner, and two other large cable
operators, Cox Cable and Comcast, which have allied themselves
with <A HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A>, the third-largest
long-distance carrier. Their path will be smoothed if this year's
telecommunications bill becomes law: it will then become much
harder for a state to veto cable telephony. With 60% of households
subscribing to cable television, and almost all homes within easy
reach of a systems operator, the cable companies are keen to get
going.
<P>
They still face formidable obstacles. ''The great weakness of
the cable industry is its fragmentation. Every one of the regional
Bells is bigger in its region than all the cable operators in
that region combined,'' admits Brendan Clouston, executive vice-president
of TCI. Moreover, in America ''the cable industry does not have
a great perceived reputation for service. And it has no national
brand.''
<H3>Interactive too</H3>

<P>
Bandwidth is the key advantage the cable companies have over the
telephone operators. It allows them to offer any number of fancy
interactive video services -- and even more once they carry digital
broadcasting. TeleWest's Mr Regan talks of providing 700 channels
once his customers have boxes to decode the digital signals coming
into their homes. That might happen in 1997. Such capacity will
not only offer more television programmes than the most ardent
fan could conceivably want, but allow the interactive use of the
screen, with messages or pictures being sent to and from the home
or office.
<P>
Not many telephone operators can yet rival that. One that may
do so is Hongkong Telecom, where William Lo is exuberantly inventing
new services to offer on the company's state-of-the-art fibre-optic,
digitally switched network. He has already set up a trial based
on 400 households, offering them digital video on demand: by clicking
a mouse, they can order a film, pause or rewind it. In time, they
will be able to shop, bank, draw money from their account by swiping
a smart card through a set-top box and perhaps even gamble: the
Royal Hongkong Jockey Club is one of the partners in the scheme.
Mr Lo plans to have the service commercially available by July
next year. ''If we cannot make this work in Hong Kong, with the
great interest in new products and the low cost of additional
investment, it cannot work anywhere,'' he says.
<P>
How much will customers, or the companies that want to reach them,
pay for such novelties? Enough, maybe, to justify the relatively
small extra investment that existing cable companies have to make;
not enough to reimburse the telephone operators for replacing
their copper wires. So the telephone companies are racing to find
ways of cramming more into their present networks. These include
Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line or <A HREF="http://www.sbexpos.com/sbexpos/associations/adsl/home.html">ADSL</A>,
a technology which allows television pictures to travel along
copper wires. At present this is expensive, and the quality of
the pictures is not as good as the alternatives. Meanwhile, many
telecoms operators are pinning their hopes on <A HREF="http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~henker/dank.html">ISDN</A>
(Integrated Services Digital Network) as a stopgap to expand the
capacity of copper wires.
<P>
If their stopgaps work, and they can squeeze more bandwidth out
of their elderly networks, what will the telecoms operators do
with it? All are desperate for ways to charge their customers
more than they can for a plain old telephone service. ''Rich people
in Nassau County spend well over $100 a month on magazines and
videos,'' says Ivan Seidenberg, boss of Nynex, the Bell in the
New York region. ''They spend only one-third as much on Nynex
services.''
<P>
To extract more, Nynex and two other Bells have set up their own
television venture; other Bells formed an alliance with <A HREF="http://www.disney.com/">Disney</A>,
in the days before Disney itself owned a television network. <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>
bought a 20% stake in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. All may find
they have wasted their time and money. It is difficult to imagine
America's telephone companies as future media moguls.
<P>
More fruitful may be the attempts by some to become Internet service
providers: the personal computer and the Internet are more likely
to be the model for future interactive services than are fancy
experiments with television sets. Undoubtedly, demands for bandwidth
will increase as more people own computers with modems, and want
to use them to contact each other. The launch of <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A>'s
Windows 95, with its built-in capacity for Internet access, will
give a boost to this market. But it will be many years before
on-line services or the Internet make much money. France has the
world's nearest approximation to a mass-market interactive service
with its <A HREF="http://www.minitel.fr/">Minitel</A>, which offers
26,000 services. The most popular, after directory inquiries,
is train timetables. No wonder Minitel has taken ten years to
turn a profit.
<P>
In the contest with the cable companies, the telecoms operators
can point to considerable strengths. Frank Biondi, chief executive
of <A HREF="http://www.mcp.com/general/news5/via.html">Viacom</A>
(which is getting out of operating cable systems to concentrate
on content), points out that the telecoms operators tend to be
bigger and richer than the cable companies. They cover large regions,
whereas the cable companies tend to cover only patches. The telecoms
operators have the cash, the skills and the customer base to develop
new software applications and charge extra for them.
<P>
But they are still vulnerable. Moreover, their grip on the local
loop faces a potent threat from another direction: the wireless
spectrum.<HR>

<P>
<I>Wonderful wireless</I><HR>

<P>
THE advent of mobility is by far the most striking change in telecommunications
in the past decade. It amounts to the introduction of an entirely
new product, with huge new potential. Many people working in telecommunications
assume that mobility poses no threat to the existing networks.
They are almost certainly wrong. But wireless technologies will
also change the economics of fixed networks, providing another
inexpensive way of linking up with customers.
<P>
Worldwide, one new telephone subscriber in six gets a mobile phone
(see <A HREF="tcch6.gif">chart</A>). At the moment, wired and
wireless coexist, often owned by the same big operator. Almost
all the world's 50m cellular subscribers also have a fixed-wire
telephone. But Simon Forge of <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/london-calling/csmg.html">Cambridge Strategic Management Consultants</A>,
author of an influential study of ''near-zero tariff tele-communications'',
argues that mobile telephones may in time do to the public networks
what the railways did to the canals. The canals initially saw
railways as feeder lines, bringing them traffic rather than competition.
The railways, in turn, initially thought the roads would increase
their total traffic. Both were cannibalised. Owning a network
counts for little if others can build a better one.
<P>
Not everybody in the telecoms business is complacent about the
impact of mobility on their business. Sir Iain Vallance, chairman
of <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A> (which has a stake in Cellnet,
a mobile service), accepts that most conversations will eventually
shift from fixed to mobile telephones: ''It has already begun
in Scandinavia, driven by all those second homes.''
<P>
In Sweden one person in six has a mobile phone. Indeed, fixed-line
connections are now declining: flighty young people choose to
have a mobile phone when they leave home, rather than pay for
a new fixed-line connection every time they move. Signs of head-on
competition are emerging elsewhere. In parts of Asia, the cost
of a long-distance call between mobile subscribers is well below
the cost using the public network, which has boosted mobile connections.
In Europe, a proposed EU directive allowing mobile operators to
use leased capacity could produce the same result. In most parts
of the world, mobile phones still represent a triumph of hope
over experience. Britain's Consumers' Association claims to have
been inundated with complaints from mobile-phone users, mainly
about the terms of the contracts they had to sign. And quality
of reception is often maddeningly poor. ''Cellular is full of
holes, but consumers buy it anyway,'' says David Goodtree of <A HREF="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A>
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<P>
At present, few countries allow more than one or two mobile operators.
Regulation hamstrings demand. Jerry Hausman, economics professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has compared American
states that regulate prices and terms for cellular telephony and
those that do not. He has found that in the regulating states
prices are about 17% higher and the use of cellular phones lower.
For the state of California, he estimates the overall annual loss
to consumers caused by regulation at about $1.4 billion a year.
``Even imperfect competition'', he concludes, ''usually provides
greater consumer welfare than regulation.''
<P>
Japan, notes Alastair Grieve of <A HREF="http://cwix.com/cwplc/">Cable &amp; Wireless</A>
in Tokyo, had the world's first public cellular service in 1979.
Yet by the start of 1994 it had only 2m subscribers. In April
that year, the rule preventing customers from buying their telephones
was dropped; two more competitors entered the market; differentiated
tariffs were introduced; and prices fell. Within a year the number
of subscribers had doubled.
<P>
Competition will grow as new sorts of wireless telephone evolve.
Eric Gan of Goldman Sachs in Japan envisages a sort of pyramid,
rather like that in the airline industry. At the apex, the Concorde
equivalent will be expensive global satellite systems that will
allow subscribers to cross national borders. The next layer, akin
to club class, will be cellular services, used mainly by businesses.
In the United States, for example, Fortune 1,000 companies account
for only 5% of subscribers but 19% of revenues, estimates Forrester
Research. In time, digital services will lure customers away from
analogue, solving three of the system's most irritating shortcomings:
crackle, lack of security and fraud (but not fade-out). Operators
will also be able to cram more services into the same spectrum.
<H3>Enter economy class</H3>

<P>
''What you are missing in the mobile-telecoms market is the equivalent
of the airlines' economy class, where they make 70% of their money,''
says Mr Gan. That is now about to arrive. In the United States,
the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">FCC</A>, in a move of great importance,
is auctioning an immense amount of radio spectrum: ''Vastly more'',
says <A HREF="http://khht.com/huber/home.html">Peter Huber</A>,
''than is currently allocated to local television stations. And
the transition to digital will eventually expand its carrying
capacity between tenfold and a hundredfold.''
<P>
The aim is to encourage the growth of <A HREF="http://www.wiltel.com/perspect/93fa12.html">Personal Communications Services</A>
(PCS), a new generation of wireless telephones that will be combined
in all sorts of flexible ways with cordless and fixed-wire telephones.
Other countries are following suit: in Hong Kong, for example,
up to six new PCS licences are being made available (but not auctioned).
<P>
In Japan, a promising economy class is already up and flying.
The ''personal handiphone system'' (PHS) was launched in July
by two operators, an affiliate of <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A>
and DDI Personal Pocketphone. A third service, Astel, will be
launched next month. Using small, low-powered base stations sited
close together in large cities, it offers a telephone about the
size of a powder compact. The best-selling model has 400 hours
of battery life on standby, and five hours of talking time. Its
airtime charges are only a fifth of those of cellular systems,
and local calls cost less than calls from payphones. They are
priced to compete with pagers and aimed at a new market: teenagers
and housewives. Sachio Senmoto, DDI's ebullient co-founder, remarks
modestly: ''As it costs &#165;72,800 to get a phone installed
by NTT and only &#165;7,200 to join the PHS, a student might prefer
our system.''
<P>
Inevitably there are snags. The monthly subscription, at &#165;2,700,
is higher than NTT's &#165;1,900. And the PHS cannot be used in
fast-moving cars. That should not stunt its popularity in the
dense cities of Asia, where Japan hopes to promote it, but it
will be a handicap in countries such as the United States, where
car use is high and density low.
<P>
But the handyphone has one enormous advantage that may catapult
it to the top in Asia. Unlike conventional cellular telephones,
which use lots of their bandwidth to switch quickly among base
stations, its many base stations mean it uses bandwidth extremely
economically. (Britain's Rabbit, a sort of early PHS, failed because
it had too few stations and could not receive incoming calls.)
The PHS will have enough bandwidth to transmit moving pictures
as well as sound. By 1997 users should be able to use it to download
games software. Fitted into a personal stereo, it will allow parents
to contact <A HREF="tc7.gif">roaming</A> teenagers. Attached to
a notebook computer, it will allow the transmission of slow-moving
pictures or digital fax. Small wonder Mr Senmoto describes his
little device as ''wireless multimedia'', and boasts that DDI
will one day be larger than NTT.
<P>
At the very bottom of the pyramid, the pager offers the equivalent
of the airlines' charter class. Although it may one day be driven
out of business by Mr Senmoto's gadget, for the moment it is flourishing.
Hong Kong's 6m people carry more than 1m pagers, provided by 37
companies. Anybody who wants a vision of the mobile-telephone
market of the future will find it here. Companies enter and leave
the business all the time, endlessly innovating, chasing different
markets. Ask Peter Tsang, managing director of New World Telephone,
one of the three new local-service licensees, how he expects to
make money in a city where a residential telephone line costs
HK$62 ($8) a month and local calls are free, and he points to
the pager market. ''It's because services are so cheap that we
expect to make money,'' he says. ''People want more value, and
don't mind paying.''
<P>
Mr Tsang helped to set up New World Paging in 1990, even though
700,000 people already had pagers. He offered Asia's first secretarial
paging service. Calls to the colony's myriad owners of small businesses
can be routed to a communal switchboard which tells callers that
Mr Chan will call them back. Mr Chan, bleeped by his pager on
a street corner, can pretend that he has been summoned from a
meeting to return the call.
<P>
If wireless is a potentially devastating competitor for the telephone
companies, it could also be their saviour. They, too, can use
it, to connect subscribers to the network much more cheaply than
with copper. As that realisation has dawned, television stations
have become hot properties in the United States, valued not for
their viewers but for their spectrum allocation (see <A HREF="tcch5.gif">chart</A>).
<P>
Two of America's long-distance carriers are using wireless to
build direct links with their customers. In 1994 <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>
spent $11.5 billion to buy McCaw Cellular, which made it America's
largest mobile operator. It spent a further $1.7 billion at the
FCC's spectrum auctions. Some observers, such as MIT's Professor
Hausman, wonder whether it will eventually team up with <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@qu81DJBMQQEAQNgy/pathfinder/welcome.html">Time Warner</A>
too. Meanwhile, It is following the same strategy abroad, buying
stakes in wireless operators in a number of countries, often in
exchange for equipment it manufactures.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A> and its three cable
partners invested $2.1 billion in the March auction for wireless
spectrum, making the consortium the biggest successful bidder.
It now has enough coverage to provide a national digital service
on a single-frequency band. It will also be able to use wireless
to connect customers who do not have cable television.
<P>
Increasingly, what the vast majority of customers will want most
from their telephone will be portability. They will be able to
get a single device, containing what would now be two or three
different sorts of telephone (say satellite, cellular and PHS),
capable of switching automatically among systems and allowing
a subscriber to be reached at any time on a single number.
<P>
Mobility will create all sorts of new gadgets and applications.
Already, says Forrester's Mr Goodtree, a Ford car contains some
50 tiny computers: link them to a mobile phone, and they could
be used to tune an engine or do spot maintenance, in effect servicing
the car by phone. Other car-borne telephones, linked with global
positioning devices, are being developed by Germany's Mannesmann
to direct a driver to a less congested route, track stolen cars
-- or, perhaps, charge a motorist for driving down certain streets.
<P>
For the big telephone operators, the development of wireless represents
an opportunity. But it forces them to confront a harsh reality.
Their most valuable assets are not their copper wires, but their
customers, their billing ability and their brand names. There
is nothing much that a fixed network can do that wireless will
not, quite soon, do as well and more cheaply. An established,
capital-intensive business with high costs and an entrenched culture
will find it hard to make the most of a rival technology. It was
neither the 18th-century canal magnates nor the Victorian railway
bosses who built this century's successful trucking companies.

<H1>Dealing with dominance</H1>

<P>
<I>Can't just be left to the market</I><HR>

<P>
COMPETITION in telecommunications may appear to be thriving wherever
governments have allowed it. But it is an odd sort of competition.
A new <A HREF="tc4.gif">entrant</A> must be able to connect to
the existing network. A telephone is useful only because it connects
to other telephones, and the larger the network, the more useful
it is. Yet the network is owned by the very operator with whom
the new entrant plans to compete. It is as if a supermarket had
to use its competitor's in-house distribution system. So the key
to opening markets lies in the terms on which a new entrant has
access to the existing network. How much (to use the supermarket
analogy) does it pay for distribution? Can it use its own drivers,
and paint its name on the vans? If so, who pays? And how are disputes
settled? By the existing supermarket's board?
<P>
Bizarre as such questions may seem, they are central to telecommunications
policy. The power of the incumbent operator to fight off would-be
rivals is so great that governments have to intervene to restrain
it. As a result, competitors -- whether they be America's <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>,
Britain's Mercury or Japan's IDC -- frequently owe their existence
to government-imposed constraints on their larger rivals.
<P>
Using such asymmetry to kickstart competition is a Faustian bargain.
In Britain, the government has found itself trying to shelter
the cable-television companies -- most of them subsidiaries of
large, mainly American telephone companies -- from possible inroads
into their returns. ''They are building an alternative local telephone
network,'' goes the implicit bargain, ''so we should limit the
risk to their investors.''
<P>
The greatest threat to the investment made by new entrants everywhere
is that their competition will achieve the very goal that governments
hope for: a sharp drop in the tariffs charged by the main operator.
If competition succeeds, a regulator may eventually have to persuade
or compel the incumbent to moderate its price cuts, going against
both its own interest (the pursuit of greater market share) and
that of its customers (cheap calls) for long enough to allow rivals
to get established.
<P>
Without intervention, though, the big operators can be guaranteed
to make life difficult for would- be rivals. They benefit from
a familiar brand and (usually) a protected cash flow to finance
new products. A would-be telecoms company in France grumbles:
''It's hard to compete with a company that uses the France T&eacute;l&eacute;com
name to advertise mobile services.'' Bernd J&uuml;ager, a telecoms
consultant in Bonn who advises potential new players, argues that
<A HREF="http://www.dtag.de/dtag/telekom_.html">Deutsche Telekom</A>
has used revenue from its monopoly services to halve the cost
of services which have been liberalised, such as data transmission.
The result has been to confine competitors to a 10% share of these
markets. Even without such cross-subsidies, DT's brand name, experience
and ownership of a largely depreciated network give it huge power.
''The first winner of liberalisation is always the former monopoly,''
observes Mr J&uuml;ager.
<P>
In most countries, one of the strongest cards in the hand of the
former monopoly is numbering. Customers are often reluctant to
switch to a competing telephone company if it means changing their
telephone number. They may risk losing business. Hong Kong's telecoms
watchdog, Mr Arena, calculated that even discounts of 10-15% were
not enough to compensate. He therefore took over the allocation
of numbers from Hongkong Telecom, the island's erstwhile monopoly,
and insists that customers who change operators should automatically
be given the option of keeping their number. The luckiest numbers
will be auctioned for charity, just as lucky car numbers already
are.
<P>
As ever, regulation in the face of a truly determined dominant
player is not straightforward. Last year Don Cruickshank, Britain's
director-general of telecommunications, removed responsibility
for numbering from <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A> and demanded
portability. After much wrangling, the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission is now adjudicating on who should foot the bill. Mr
Cruickshank believes that ''the true cost is very low.'' BT disagrees.
<H3>Only interconnect</H3>

<P>
Important though numbering is, the fiercest battles have always
been over interconnection, and in particular over the rates charged
for access to the local network -- the hardest part to make money
out of (see <A HREF="tcch8.gif">chart</A>). As almost every call
either starts or finishes on the fixed network, such charges set
a floor to the price competitors can offer.
<P>
That competitors who share the network should pay some part of
its cost seems, on the face of it, entirely fair. But how big
a part? Most of the costs of the network are capital: the electrical
pulses that new entrants send down the wires do not add to the
wear and tear. In most countries, much of that capital has been
stumped up by taxpayers. Even where it has not, there is plenty
of room for argument over how to share the cost. A network owner
who is allowed to recover his costs has little incentive to curb
them. And where the operator is obliged to guarantee universal
service -- affordable access for every citizen to a telephone
-- the debate shifts to a new plane. A monopoly can cover the
extra cost with cross-subsidies. But if there is competition,
the most lucrative customers are picked off and offered price
discounts, leaving no one to foot the bill.
<P>
In the case of universal service, most governments allow the main
network operator to recoup some of the cost from competitors --
who promptly complain that the operator inflates the numbers.
Often with reason: studies suggest the true cost of providing
a basic telephone service for unprofitable customers and areas
is usually tiny. Indeed, some think it is ludicrous to regard
universal service as a burden. ''We say it's a franchise,'' says
Robert Annunziata, chairman of Teleport, a company that plans
to offer a telephone service in New York. He argues that serving
low-income customers could be profitable, and would like to see
a negative auction in which companies would bid to serve a high-
cost area at the lowest subsidy.
<P>
Large operators are not usually keen to help new rivals (or regulators)
by providing them with the basis for their calculations. It was
just such a point that persuaded America's Department of Justice
to order the Bells to be hived off from <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>'s
long- distance operation in 1984. AT&amp;T had been haggling over
the proper price of access to its network ever since 1969, when
Microwave Communication Inc (now MCI) was given permission by
the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission</A>
to build a microwave link between Chicago and St Louis and sell
space on it to outsiders.
<P>
But while the split created competition in long- distance traffic,
it left a monopoly in the local network. So the arguments about
interconnection go on. AT&amp;T and its long-distance rivals,
MCI and Sprint, complain constantly about having to pay 40-45%
of the cost of a call over to the Bells. ''Local access is our
largest single cost,'' says Mike Rowny, vice-president responsible
for MCI's strategic planning. That may merely reflect the true
cost of the local loop: but as long as local access is, in effect,
a monopoly, it remains a grievance.
<P>
America's proposed telecommunications bill is, in part, an attempt
to promote competition in the local network. If adopted, it will
remove the regulatory barriers that have kept the long-distance
carriers, the Bells and the cable-television operators from competing
for each other's business. Once the long-distance carriers take
calls directly from customers, perhaps by wireless links, the
argument about interconnection will change: in time, perhaps,
no single carrier will dominate the network.
<P>
In Japan, the three long-distance carriers sound just like Mr
Rowny when they talk about <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/">NTT</A>.
They pay some 40% of their revenues to NTT in interconnection
charges. Although Japan has allowed competition in every area
of telephony since 1985, NTT has kept its grip on the local network
mainly by its power to set access charges. The government has
set up a review and aims to decide by next spring whether to split
up NTT.
<P>
At the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Kouji Hamada,
director-general of the telecommunications business department,
admires the American model of deliberately setting a number of
companies at each other's throats. The break-up of AT&amp;T, he
says, has created several world-class companies in place of one.
Splitting NTT into a group of local companies and a long-distance
carrier would allow it to team up with one of the international
companies and compete in the global market, from which (''like
Gulliver'', says Mr Hamada) it is now largely barred. In fact,
the best reason for splitting NTT is rather different. If NTT's
local and long-distance activities were separated, the local company
would almost certainly have to raise its charges to reflect the
real cost of local distribution. Since local calls cost next to
nothing in Japan, that prospect makes politicians quail.
<P>
Splitting the network is one way to bring clarity to the argument
about costs. Jonathan Solomon and Dawson Walker of <A HREF="http://cwix.com/cwplc/">Cable &amp; Wireless</A>
have recently argued for separating the provision of telecommunications
services from the operation of the infrastructure. The network
owner would manage the wires and exchanges, offering access on
the same terms to providers of services of all kinds. At present,
the owner of a local network has every incentive to make it hard
for competitors to use it. But separation would create a powerful
incentive to fill the pipe rather than keep traffic away.
<H3>Better unbundle?</H3>

<P>
In the United States, a few companies are already voluntarily
``unbundling''. Ameritech is planning to split into a network
business unit, levying a non- discriminatory access charge, and
a dozen retail units marketing capacity. In New York state, Rochester
Tel has split itself into a network and a competitive retail arm.
One reason for that, say critics, is that the company wants to
deter others from building rival networks. Another approach has
been used in Stockholm, where the city has set up a company to
build a fibre network which rents capacity to all comers.
<P>
Should <A HREF="tc3.gif">unbundling</A> be imposed by law? The
difficulty with the Solomon-Dawson version, say critics (including,
not surprisingly, BT), is that separating the network from services
is technically difficult. The more intelligence is built into
the network, the harder it is to disentangle the parts, and the
greater the danger that mandatory separation will create new distortions.
<P>
In any case, unbundling alone does not resolve the basic issue:
how should the underlying cost of the network be allocated? ''The
options range from supporting new entrants to protecting the established
monopoly,'' argues <A HREF="http://www.ctr.columbia.edu/citi/staff.html">Professor Noam</A>.
An instance of the first approach would be to adopt an Internet
model, basing access charges not on length of use but on a flat
fee plus some charge for maximum capacity, and letting the company
that sent the calls keep the proceeds. This would work in favour
of new entrants, since they would send far more calls to the main
network than vice versa. But it would leave the question of capital
costs unresolved, as they are for the Internet itself.
<P>
This kind of solution turns the problem of asymmetry on its head.
If the true cost of putting an extra call over a network is almost
zero, will any charging structure allow a network operator to
make a living, especially if he cannot discriminate between customers
by price? With such a model, the regulator's job may one day be
to protect the network, not its users. In most countries, though,
that day is an aeon away.<HR>

<H1>Welcome to the world </H1>

<P>
<I>With ever-cheaper international calls</I><HR>

<P>
TO CALL Penzance from London during the working day costs 9.9p
(15 cents) for a minute; to call Paris or Bonn, a similar distance,
35.5p. The members of the European Union (EU) treat each other,
from a telephonic point of view, as lands sufficiently distant
to justify a premium tariff. The <A HREF="http://www.cec.lu/en/comm.html">European Commission</A>
wants them to behave like the single market they say they are.
Nothing illustrates more clearly the political, as well as the
economic, gains that could flow from making charges insensitive
to distance. Moreover, if the commission triumphs, the whole structure
of international call rates will change.
<P>
At present, international calls are often a monopoly or at least
a cartel. Usually only one operator -- the national giant -- has
the right to hand calls across the international gateway that
separates one country's telephone network from another's. At the
gate, predictably enough, it pockets a charge. This lucrative
custom is backed up by the system of international accounting
rates, which allocates the cost of a call between countries. The
two operators agree on a price for handling the call and split
it, usually down the middle. If one operator puts through more
calls to another than it receives, it hands over a settlement
payment to even things up.
<P>
For some developing countries, such payments are an important
source of hard currency -- more important than foreign aid. They
allow Guyana, for example, to make a tidy living as a base for
<A HREF="tc5.gif">sex-chat</A> lines. But most settlement payments
go to rich, overpriced markets. The system is biased against countries
that send more calls than they get because they have relatively
low tariffs. In countries where prices have fallen fastest, the
rates at which operators are now having to settle are above what
they charge their customers. The system particularly irritates
the United States, which has a deficit of some $4 billion, aggravated
by a lively charge-card and call-back business. ''It is a way
for carriers to extract monopoly profits,'' says Scott Harris,
chief of the international bureau of the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">FCC</A>.
''We want to drive them down to cost.''
<P>
Nowhere do these arcane rules appear more anachronistic than in
the EU. Prodded by the commission, the EU countries have committed
themselves to opening every market for telecoms services -- voice,
mobile and satellite -- at the start of 1998. Except for the poorer
countries of southern Europe, which can delay a bit, every market
should then become even more open than those of Britain, Sweden
and Finland already are.
<P>
In theory. But Europe has set off down this path before, and been
waylaid. On paper, many of these markets were opened by the 1990
telecommunications services directive. In practice, progress has
been patchy. The two EU commissioners steering the latest attempt,
Martin Bangemann and Karel Van Miert, are only too aware of the
gap between agreement and implementation. Mr Van Miert cautiously
argues that ''the mentality in the Community has changed considerably
in the past four to five years.'' But the main reason for the
failure of the 1990 directive, he says, was that the market in
infrastructure was not open: would-be competitors could not acquire
spare capacity to carry their calls. This time he is determined
to avoid that mistake.
<P>
He is therefore threatening to push through a directive that would
allow alternative infrastructure to be used from January 1996
for services that are already liberalised. That essentially means
everything except public voice telephony (which, however, still
constitutes 85-90% of the market). Moreover, mobile operators
can either own or lease the infrastructure they use. Mr Van Miert
is using article 90 of the Treaty of Rome, which does not require
the agreement of the Council of Ministers, but he knows that he
needs to carry member governments with him.
<P>
If Mr Van Miert succeeds, the implications for long-distance tariffs
could be tremendous. All over Europe, companies with distribution
networks in businesses other than telephony have been laying fibre-optic
cables along their routes. At present, they cannot lease out capacity
at will, as they could in the United States or Britain. But once
traffic is allowed to travel across borders along capacity that
does not belong to the established operator, the forces for change
will become irresistible. Mr Van Miert's proposal would mean that,
from the start of 1996, <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A> and
its partner Viag, a German utility group, could build their own
network and deliver calls directly to large business customers.
<P>
Even more significant changes could follow once public voice telephony
is liberalised. From the start of 1998, says Andrew Entwistle
of <A HREF="http://www.analysys.co.uk">Analysys</A>, BT will have
an incentive to deliver the international traffic it pipes into
Germany not to <A HREF="http://www.dtag.de/dtag/telekom_.html">Deutsche Telekom</A>,
as it does now, but to Viag -- which would then deliver the calls
to Deutsche Telekom, which would not know whether they came from
Birmingham or Bonn. Until now, Deutsche Telekom with its high
rates has done well out of the international settlement system
because Germany has tended to receive more calls than it makes.
But if BT and Viag were to by-pass the settlements system, DT
would become a large net exporter of calls. The stability of the
settlements system would be threatened.
<H3>Will it happen?</H3>

<P>
At first the telephone companies might hold on to some of the
cash they now hand over in settlements. But as competition on
international and long-distance routes in Europe hotted up, rates
would have to come down with a bump. In continental Europe, these
tariffs are even further out of line with costs than they were
in America when that market was liberalised a decade ago, says
Mr Entwistle. And the floor in Europe would fall faster as all
those fibre- optic cables come on stream, causing a capacity glut
just like that in the United States. It is easy to find sceptics,
especially in the companies that have most to lose. Reform in
Europe always takes longer than expected. The telecoms giants
have considerable opportunities for obstruction, which are being
brutally exploited in Germany. Gerd Tenzer, a board member of
Deutsche Telekom, is adamantly opposed to the liberalisation of
infrastructure in 1996. It would, he complains, pre-empt the decisions
needed to translate the broader liberalisation of 1998 into German
law (which is, of course, precisely why the commission wants it).
The German government plans to privatise DT next year in what
will be the country's largest ever flotation; its officials are
torn between a desire to open the market and anxiety about the
effect.
<P>
Yet the benign impact on European unity of eliminating distance
from Europe's telephone tariffs will surely be greater than anything
else the EU has ever done. If calling from Tipperary to Thessalonika
cost no more than ringing next door, the squabbling Europeans
might at last begin to think of each other as neighbours. Certainly
Europe's businesses would think again about location.
<P>
If Europe liberalises, can the rest of the world be far behind?
In Geneva, a committee chaired by Neil McMillan of Britain's industry
ministry is racing to meet an April 1996 deadline to open global
markets in telecommunications services. Now that the countries
of the European Union, which negotiate as a block, have agreed
to open their markets to each other, they could -- if they wished
-- agree to do the same to the rest of the world. If the Geneva
talks were to succeed, as they may well do, unrestricted competition
on the larger routes would take effect by the end of next year.
That would probably deal a fatal blow to the system of accounting
rates. Countries might move towards one of two systems. One, ``sender
keeps all'', would copy the Internet model. The other, favoured
by the <A HREF="http://www.oecd.org/">OECD</A>, would impose a
single access charge: whether France T&eacute;l&eacute;com took
a call from BT or <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>,
the sender would pay the same.
<P>
Either way, inflated international tariffs and a goodly slice
of telecoms operators' profits would vanish. With so much of their
revenue under threat, what is the future of the old giants?<HR>

<H1>A giant effort </H1>

<P>
<I>To keep on top, it is no longer enough to be big</I><HR>

<P>
AT THE start of the 1980s, the international airline industry
was booming. Ten years later, after privatisation, deregulation
and cut-throat competition, it was in deep trouble. In 1990-92,
it arguably lost more money than it had made in profits in all
of the first 60 years of its history. Only this year have airlines
in the United States begun to creep back into profit. Elsewhere
in the world the shake-out continues.
<P>
Over the coming decade telecoms, an industry now at least twice
as big as the airline industry, faces even greater upheavals.
Airlines have not had to cope with the relentless onrush of technological
change in telecoms that is destroying old barriers between industries.
Liberalisation will attract new entrants lured by huge returns
on capital, especially in Europe. If America's telecommunications
bill becomes law, the competition it will trigger will be just
a foretaste of what lies ahead elsewhere. Companies as diverse
as America's <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A>,
Japan's <A HREF="http://www.toshiba.com/">Toshiba </A>and Germany's
RWE all expect a slice of a business now in the hands of a relatively
small number of giant oligopolies or monopolies.
<P>
Such competition will carry considerable risks. ''In a business
with small variable costs and huge overcapacity, a price war would
be nuclear annihilation,'' says <A HREF="http://www.hydra.com/wertheim/">Wertheim Schroder</A>'s
Mr Sirlin. ''Serious price competition in telecommunications would
make the airline business look terrific.''
<P>
Even without an all-out price war, the industry will head in two
different directions at once: fragmentation and consolidation.
The first will follow from the sheer range of activities covered
by the term ''telecommunications''. A host of smallish companies
will flourish, especially in the areas closest to the customer,
trading on their skill in buying commodity transmission capacity
and adding value with ingenious new services.
<P>
For the big established operators, (see <A HREF="tcch7.gif">chart</A>)
life will be rougher. They will have to cut costs, shed thousands
of employees and innovate as never before. To survive, they may
have to bring in fresh blood. ''We have found a direct correlation
between corporate success and managers who don't have phone-company
backgrounds,'' says Robert Morris, director of international equity
research at Goldman Sachs in London. He points to the examples
of Alex Mandl, a former shipping-company boss now at the helm
of <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A> Communications Services,
and Michael Hepher, who came from the life-assurance industry
to <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>. <A HREF="http://www.dtag.de/dtag/telekom_.html">Deutsche Telekom</A>'s
new boss, Ron Sommer, used to work for <A HREF="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</A>
Europe.
<P>
Where an established operator is well run, it will still have
huge advantages. In a business with massive overheads and very
low marginal costs, notes MIT's Professor Hausman, the number
of competitors is likely to be small. The winners will tend to
be vertically integrated and have good access to the customer.
Size will also make it easier to carry the costs of developing
ever more fancy services: not necessarily entertainment or home
shopping, although those will come, but more ingenious ways to
integrate the technology of the telephone into everyday products
and services. ''This is essentially a consumer-services business.
The product is the software that sits on the switch,'' says Mr
Morris. But software development costs AT&amp;T or BT the same
as it costs Mercury or <A HREF="http://www.uswest.com/">US West</A>.
What is different is the size of the customer base over which
the development cost can be spread.
<P>
The incumbent giants have other strengths, such as their billing
skills and their financial muscle. They also have a well-recognised
brand, which AT&amp;T has taken great care to preserve. Victor
Pelson, chairman of the company's global operations team, says
its highly successful credit card was launched because ''we were
concerned that we didn't have a direct link with our customers.
They got their bills from the local exchange company. We found
that a customer with an AT&amp;T card was much more likely to
stay with us as a long-distance carrier.'' According to a review
of prospects for the Bells by <A HREF="http://www.salomon.com/">Salomon Brothers</A>
in New York, two Americans in five still believe that AT&amp;T
is their local phone company.
<P>
The benefits of size will encourage mergers. Ten years from now,
America's 11 large telephone companies -- the successors of the
seven Bells, <A HREF="http://info.gte.com/">GTE</A> and the three
long-distance carriers -- are likely to have taken on a different
shape. Some will have merged with each other; some will have found
new lives in adjacent markets such as television, computer services,
finance and travel. For some other countries, mergers will raise
political problems. Will they be willing to accept part or full
foreign ownership of their national giant, or will they prop it
up in the same way as they have subsidised national airlines?
<H3>Going global</H3>

<P>
The economies of scale and scope in the transmission of information
are such that, by the second quarter of the next century, only
a handful of really big international providers may be left. Most
national operators will shrink and mutate as their peripheral
business is picked off by competitors. The big operators in the
rich world are getting ready to grab a share in the global market
by forming alliances with partners in other countries.
<P>
Global business is still only a tiny teaspoon of most operators'
revenues, but many hope that it will provide tomorrow's jam. As
the operators' business customers become more global, says Ted
Schell, head of corporate development at <A HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A>,
''they will want one global provider to integrate services such
as voice mail and electronic mail.'' Several international alliances,
such as AT&amp;T's WorldPartners, hope to win contracts to run
big companies' global telecoms networks.
<P>
Some of these groupings -- such as Unisource, a bunch of operators
in some of Europe's smaller countries -- consist of national networks
tacked loosely together. Some, such as Atlas, an alliance between
France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Deutsche Telekom, and Phoenix,
their joint alliance with America's Sprint, are awaiting approval
from suspicious regulators. Others, such as <A HREF="http://cwix.com/cwplc/">Cable &amp; Wireless</A>'s
minority stake in Germany's Veba, amount to little more than a
memorandum of understanding.
<P>
Can such cross-border alliances really work? One of the more coherent
ones is led by BT, which has chosen second-division players as
allies. It now has a 20% stake in MCI Communications, and marketing
partnerships with Viag in Germany and with a couple of banks in
Italy and Spain. ''We reckoned'', says Sir Iain Vallance, ''that
the joining of any two major players would be fraught with regulatory
difficulty.'' Concentrating on banks and utilities brings access
to large networks, large customer bases and lots of money. It
also allows BT to insist that its partners accept its network
architecture. Even so, some customers claim that BT and <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>
quote them different prices for the same services.
<P>
For the time being, rich-country telecoms giants have this business
to themselves. They are also pouring money into the world's fastest-growing
markets -- in the developing world. (See <A HREF="tcch1.gif">chart</A>)
''Half the world's population has never made a phone call,'' says
Richard Klugman of PaineWebber in New York. While operators in
the rich world worry about getting more people to use their systems,
poor countries worry about their immense waiting lists. ''Almost
without exception, there is huge unmet demand, even at the prices
the incumbent monopolies charge,'' says Bj&uuml;orn Wellenius,
telecoms adviser at the World Bank.
<P>
For the rest of this decade, demand will grow fastest in Asia.
Andrew Harrington, director of research at Salomon Brothers in
Hong Kong, expects the region to install 15m-20m new lines annually
for the next half- dozen years: three to four times as many as
are being added in the United States every year. China alone is
now adding the equivalent of a new Bell a year. By 2000 it hopes
to have 140m lines, which would put it not far behind America's
figure of some 160m today.
<P>
The boom in the developing world is a golden opportunity for the
telecoms operators of the rich world -- for the moment. It has
been seized eagerly by those operators whose domestic markets
are most competitive, and therefore most under threat. Thus Nynex
is one of the most active foreign companies in Asia, with stakes
in Thailand and the Philippines, a small joint venture in China
and a bid for a fixed-wire licence in India. <A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/">Telstra</A>
of Australia, one of the first foreign companies to invest in
Asia, is active in Vietnam and Cambodia. Among other things, it
has installed payphones in Phnom Penh. <A HREF="http://www.bell-atl.com/">Bell Atlantic</A>,
together with a large Mexican cellular operator, hopes to install
a fixed-wire network in Mexico; <A HREF="http://www.bst.bls.com/">Bell South</A>
has stakes in several Latin American cellular operators; US West
has permission for a build-operate-transfer scheme in southern
India.
<P>
What if, as privatisation and liberalisation progress, the concept
of national operators becomes an anachronism? Odd though it may
seem for one country to provide the telephone service of another,
there are precedents: for example, the service in the Maldives
(as in many other small countries) is run by Cable &amp; Wireless.
If C&amp;W in the Maldives, why not Nynex in Belgium or AT&amp;T
in Britain? And if some global giants emerge from the rich world,
might the developing countries not grow their own? Already China
makes many of the world's telephones. By the late 2020s, might
it not handle many of the calls too?<HR>

<H1>Communicating freely </H1>

<P>
<I>Near-zero tariffs will change the world</I><HR>

<P>
WHAT will it be like to live in a world where it costs hardly
any more to make a phone call to another continent than to the
house next door? Some countries will be well on the way to such
a world before the end of this century. And what will happen when
the cost of communications comes down to next to nothing, as seems
likely some time in the first decade of the next century?
<P>
The <A HREF="tc6.gif">death</A> of distance will mean that any
activity that relies on a screen or a telephone can be carried
out anywhere in the world. Services as diverse as designing an
engine, monitoring a security camera, selling insurance or running
a secretarial paging service will become as easily exportable
as car parts or refrigerators.
<P>
Already, first glimpses of this world are beginning to appear.
India has built a flourishing computer-software industry around
Bangalore. Its exports more than doubled between 1990 and 1993,
to $270m. India is now attracting back-office work from airlines
such as Swissair and British Airways. Some of Hong Kong's paging
services are manned from China. In Perth, in Western Australia,
EMS Control Systems monitors the air-conditioning, lighting, lifts
and security in office blocks in Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Indonesia and Taiwan. <A HREF="http://www.broadcom.ie/telecom/dupjmc/teprofile.html">Telecom Ireland</A>
has been trying to build itself up as the main call-centre for
Europe, handling toll-free 0800 calls from all over the continent.
Last April it launched an intercontinental service to allow companies
to link their European and American call- centres and to take
advantage of the time differences between them.
<P>
All this will expose white-collar workers in rich countries to
the same competitive pressures that have already squeezed manufacturing
workers. But it will also offer educated workers in poor countries
the chance to attain a standard of living that they can now get
only by emigrating.
<P>
Countries that want to take a share of such markets have a huge
incentive to make telecommunications as inexpensive as possible.
That is a lesson few developing countries have yet learnt. Among
the exceptions are some Asian countries such as Malaysia and South
Korea, which are installing state-of-the- art telecommunications
networks and have a relatively high density of telephone lines.
<P>
As prices fall, companies will change the way they do business.
Detlef Linssen, in <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>'s
office in Bonn, remembers that when he first joined from a German
telecoms company, he was amazed to discover that once a month
AT&amp;T held an hour-long telephone conference with 120 participants
from all over the world. ''In Germany, the one that arranges the
call carries the whole cost; in the US, each participant carries
his own share,'' he points out.
<P>
Within countries, work-related travel may decline, and so may
the demand for office buildings, as people increasingly work from
home. Big cities will thus increasingly have to look to a future
as entertainment centres. Regional development policies may at
last become effective when white-collar jobs can be relocated
more easily than manufacturing ones ever could.
<P>
Many services now provided by government will be changed out of
recognition. Welfare and social-insurance payments will increasingly
be made by plastic card rather than by relays of officials. Monitoring
crime will be made easier by remote surveillance, perhaps carried
out by people in a different time zone, and by global positioning
devices to track cars and miscreants.
<P>
Teaching, too, will be less constrained by distance. At present,
Kentucky's National Guardsmen frequently have to be flown to retraining
sessions. Richard Jay Solomon and his colleagues at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology are developing a way to use distance-learning
instead. ''We're going to teach them to kill people in their homes,''
he says jovially, ``but train them in paramedicine first.'' Health
care will benefit in similar ways. In Alaska, more than 100 villages
are linked by a dedicated medical telephone network on which local
health workers can have regular telephone consultations with <A HREF="tc8.gif">doctors</A>
at the regional hospital.
<P>
For the old and the isolated, cheap communications will be a godsend.
If a telephone costs nothing but the initial subscription, why
not keep a line open all day, just as people now leave the television
on all the time? For women racing from job to nursery to home,
accessibility on the move will make life easier. Staying in touch
will acquire a new meaning. Starting next month, customers of
New World in Hong Kong can have their calls switched to wherever
they want them: their mobile telephone, hotel room abroad, voice
mail or computer.
<P>
Inevitably, with all these benefits will come drawbacks. Privacy
and security may suffer as everybody leaves a trail of data and
transactions across the globe. Theft of ideas, films and music
will become ever more difficult to stop. Policing shipments of
information across borders is infinitely harder than policing
shipments of goods and human beings (which is hard enough). That
may be all to the good when the information flow brings useful
knowledge or helps political freedom, but unwelcome when it serves
pornography, sedition or crime. Just as the death of distance
brings far-flung communities closer together, so it undermines
national sovereignty, without a countervailing improvement in
global regulation.
<H3>The unknowable and the predictable</H3>

<P>
Predicting the future of a new technology is a mug's game. Marconi
thought radio would be useful mainly for ship-to-shore calls.
Guessing the social impact of a new technology is even more hazardous.
Who would have foreseen that the invention of the post box would
contribute to women's liberation -- by enabling new generations
of young ladies to post letters to their sweethearts without their
parents' knowledge?
<P>
It is possible, then, only to ask questions. Will everyone acquire,
in time, a telephone number or name for life on which they can
be reached anywhere in the world? How will society regulate the
intrusion of near-free communications? How will national governments,
their power bounded by geography, be affected by a technology
that makes distance irrelevant?
<P>
Big changes driven by technology can happen relatively quickly
in the economy. Social changes lag behind. People will take many
years to come to terms with many of the consequences of near-costless
communications. But as they do, the world will become, on balance,
a better place. <HR>

<H1>The accidental superhighway</H1>

<P>
<I>The explosive growth of the Internet </I>
<P>
<I>is not a fad or a fluke, but the result </I>
<P>
<I>of a digital free market unleashed.</I> 
<P>
<I>Christopher Anderson considers its future.</I><HR>

<P>
FOR the past few years the titans of media and communications
have waged a war for the digital future. With great fanfare, <A HREF="http://www.cablelabs.com/NR/telco_page.html">telephone</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.cablelabs.com/NR/cable_tv.html">cable TV companies</A>
have launched dozens of trials to demonstrate their vision of
speedy electronic networks, connecting homes to a boundless trove
of information, communication, education and fun. Shambling towards
their distant goal of a wired world, they have been too busy to
notice the unruly bunch of computer hackers, engineers and students
scurrying about at their feet.
<P>
They should have paid more attention. For while the giants have
just been talking about an information superhighway, the ants
have actually been building one: the Internet. For almost all
of its 25-year life, this loose confederation of interconnected
networks has been the arcane domain of computer scientists and
academics, a private line for electronic conversations that no
one else would understand anyway. It grew, fast, because it was
left to its own devices and filled unmet needs. The Internet's
builders laid no cables and dug no trenches; they simply leased
existing telephone lines. When the Internet linked up with public
and commercial networks in the mid-1980s, its growth accelerated.
Yet most big telephone companies still wrote it off as nothing
more than a playground for bitheads and boffins.
<P>
In mid-1993 something new happened: the Internet sprouted multimedia
wings. A combination of special software and a way of connecting
documents allowed users to travel the network with pictures, sound
and video, simply by pointing and clicking a mouse. Suddenly the
light dawned. The Internet was not just a way to send e-mail and
download the occasional file. It could be a place to visit, full
of people and ideas: <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@AJNd1wAAAAAAAGr1/time/magazine/domestic/1995/special/special.cover.html">``cyberspace''</A>.
It was a new medium, based on broadcasting and publishing but
with another dimension added: interactivity. Internet veterans
had known this for years; they could see the potential behind
the screens of plain text and baffling computer commands. But
thanks to the friendly, multimedia side of the Net, called the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/WWW/">World Wide Web</A>,
a much broader audience started to catch on to it.
<P>
Last year the Internet as a whole doubled in size, as it has done
every year since 1988. It now reaches nearly <A HREF="http://www.catalog.com/zone/WWW/top.html">5m ``host'' computers</A>,
each of which may connect several individual users (see <A HREF="chart1.gif">chart</A>).
At the same time the <A HREF="http://www.netgen.com/infoarea/growth.html">Web grew</A>
almost 20-fold; in just 18 months users created more than 3m multimedia
pages of information, entertainment and advertising. No one knows
how many people are behind this, but an estimate by <A HREF="http://www.tic.com/mids/pressbig.html">John Quarterman</A>,
an Internet analyst, put the number of users at 13.5m in October
1994. Whatever the number is today--20m is not an unreasonable
guess--it will be at least half as big again a year from now.
No communications medium or consumer electronics technology has
ever grown as quickly; not the fax machine, not even the PC. At
this rate, within two years the citizens of cyberspace will outnumber
all but the largest nations.
<P>
What does that mean? This survey will argue that the Internet
revolution has challenged the corporate-titan model of the information
superhighway. The growth of the Net is not a fluke or a fad, but
the consequence of unleashing the power of individual creativity.
If it were an economy, it would be the triumph of the <A HREF="http://opal.cencom.net/~jen/life/ertelt/polrsc.html">free market</A>
over <A HREF="http://ccme-mac4.bsd.uchicago.edu/DSADocs/SocFAQ.html">central planning</A>.
In music, <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Music/Jazz_and_Blues/">jazz</A>
over <A HREF="http://classicalmus.com/composers/bach.html">Bach</A>.
<A HREF="http://www.teleport.com/~pcllgn/id.html">Democracy</A>
over <A HREF="http://www.pinsight.com/~write/cybrary/Facts.root.nazi.html">dictatorship</A>.
<P>
As a result, the information superhighway will arrive sooner,
but it will be a very different kind of road from the one the
giants intended. Cable and telephone companies will still build
their high-speed networks to people's homes, but what will pour
through them will be the Internet, not just the network providers'
canned content. This will be a grown-up version of the Internet,
made much easier to use. It may even be called something else.
But the basic ingredients of success will be the same: openness
and interactivity, making it a combination of community and marketplace.
<P>
Some people argue that the Internet already is the information
superhighway; it simply looks different from the television-based
version promoted by the cable and telephone companies. Others
say that some important features are still missing: the real superhighway
will combine not just computer networks but all sorts of other
communications links, from telephone to wireless and satellite.
It will be fast where the Internet is slow.
<P>
Yet the Internet already offers, albeit in embryonic form, most
of the services and technologies that cable and telephone companies
are still a decade from delivering. You can make a <A HREF="http://www.vocaltec.com/">telephone call</A>
on the Internet; watch a <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/mbone-faq.html">video</A>;
listen to an <A HREF="http://www.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/radio/ITRintro.readme.html">audio broadcast</A>,
or broadcast yourself; <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Business/Corporations/Shopping_Centers/">shop</A>;
learn; and, of course, communicate. Every day the Internet delivers
more of the features of the fabled superhighway. It may be doing
these things clumsily, unreliably and slowly, but it is doing
them, now.
<H3>Electronic potholes</H3>

<P>
Sceptics abound. The Internet, they say, is chaotic, frustrating
and intimidating. Only those lucky enough to be able to afford
a high-speed connection can really enjoy its multimedia side;
for those using a modem, it simply takes too long. Finding what
you want can be maddeningly slow: in an ocean of information,
sense and understanding is often lost in a flood of random facts
and rhetoric. Moreover, you need a computer equipped with some
telecommunications link to use the Internet in the first place,
which excludes most of the world's homes. Even in America, where
a third of all households have a PC, only about half of those
also have a modem connected to a phone line.
<P>
All true, the believers concede, but just wait. Already the Web
is making the Internet easier to use, and hundreds of companies
are developing software to make it easier still. Hundreds more
are developing software and services to make sense of the sea
of data on-line. At the same time the equipment is becoming much
more widespread. Private consumers are expected to buy some 15m
PCs worldwide in 1995: the home is now the fastest-growing market
for such computers. And the cost of high-speed data links is falling.
<P>
This survey will argue that the Internet's fans have a better
case than its foes. The Net will suffer plenty of growing pains,
and it may not change the world as much as the cyber-Utopians
would have us believe: compared with the richness of real life,
even the best on-line ``virtual spaces'' are cartoons. But it
is here to stay, and it will allow people to exercise one of their
most basic desires: to communicate. This they will be able to
do on an unprecedented scale: globally, openly, to one person
or many. In that sense, the Internet will almost certainly have
a stronger impact than the PC alone. PCs put computing power in
the hands of ordinary people; the Internet gives them something
compelling to do with that power (other than play games). How
important this revolution will eventually turn out to be is as
yet impossible to say. A reasonable guess might put it ahead of
the telephone and television but behind the printing press and
the motor car.
<P>
Such a ranking is clearly subjective. But <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/people/marca/index.html">Marc Andreessen</A>,
the main creator of <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/NCSAMosaicHome.html">Mosaic</A>,
the software program that made the Web easy to use and thus launched
the mainstream Internet revolution, suggests a mathematical reason
why it may be quite near the mark. Computers owe their growth
and impact to a phenomenon dubbed Moore's Law (after Gordon Moore,
the founder of <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</A>), which
says that computing power and capacity double every 18 months.
This exponential growth has led to the digital revolution, and
it has only just begun.
<P>
Networks have their own growth rule. According to Metcalfe's Law
(named after Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of the Ethernet standard
commonly used in PC networks), the ``value'' of a network--defined
as its utility to a population--is roughly proportional to the
number of users squared. An example is the telephone network.
One telephone is useless: whom do you call? Two telephones are
better, but not much. It is only when most of the population has
a telephone that the power of the network reaches its full potential
to change society. The Internet owes its extraordinary growth
and impact to its ability to harness both these laws at the same
time. The world has never seen a technology like this before.
``Data dialtone''--networking as widespread as the telephone--suddenly
seems not only possible, but likely.
<H3>The fish-tank phenomenon</H3>

<P>
This is the sort of brave talk one hears about all sorts of plans
for the information superhighway. The difference is that the Internet
is already there. Today a handful of cable TV and telephone companies
are conducting interactive television trials, giving a few thousand
homes a limited taste of video-on-demand, games, home shopping,
advertising, education and information. Yet if those same homes
have a PC, they can get all this (bar video-on-demand, although
that too may come) and more on the Internet. It is not yet as
fast, but there is infinitely more of it: a whole world of content,
from the glossy digital fa&ccedil;cades of the Fortune 500 to
thousands of ``home pages'' created by people who have assembled
some unique information--or just want to show the world their
<A HREF="http://www2.netscape.com/fishcam/fishcam.html">fish tank</A>.
<P>
Of the two, the fish tank is actually the more profound. In its
audacious uselessness--and that of thousands of ego trips like
it--lie the seeds of the Internet revolution. The Internet allows
everything: anyone can be a publisher, and publish anything he
wants. Set up a home page to show all comers what you are <A HREF="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~milesm/ontv.html">watching on TV</A>
at that moment, and it will stand side-by-side with <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</A>,
competing equally for visitors.
<P>
That is why the Internet has exploded past commercial on-line
services such as <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>
and <A HREF="http://webcrawler.com/AOL/">America Online</A> (although
they, too, are growing quickly, in part because they offer Internet
access). Many of its users are not just information consumers,
they are producers as well. For them, the Internet serves as personal
printing press, radio station and billboard, all in one. No commercial
service can ever hope to rival the quantity and quality of the
output of 20m people. True, much of what they produce is rubbish;
but much is astoundingly creative, sometimes even useful.
<P>
This is a lesson the PC revolution should have taught us already.
PCs toppled mainframes and changed the world because they put
power in the hands of individuals, bypassing centralised control.
The same is true of the Internet. Yet a remarkable number of those
who rode the PC revolution to greatness missed the significance
of the Internet. Even <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>
underestimated its impact. The company designed its forthcoming
commercial on-line service, the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/services/msnet/msnintro.htm">Microsoft Network</A>,
around a proprietary network technology. Only last year, when
the Web took off, did Microsoft adopt the Internet standard as
well.
<P>
The big names on the Internet are not <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</A>,
IBM or <A HREF="http://www.nec.com/">NEC</A> (at least not yet),
but a motley collection of young companies, university students
and entrepreneurs. <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape Communications</A>,
started in 1994, rules the Internet software market; <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco Systems</A>
(1987) and <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</A>
(1982) sell the most hardware. The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web</A>
was invented by a software engineer at a physics lab in Switzerland,
and the software that popularised it was written by an undergraduate
at the University of Illinois. Almost anything that made a difference
on the Internet was produced by people whom the corporate world
might consider nobodies.
<P>
Equally, it was not the telephone companies that built the Internet,
although it uses their networks. They carry its data for a fee,
just as they carry data from thousands of other sources. The companies
that lease this capacity to bring the Internet to users around
the world (see <A HREF="chart2.gif">map</A>) are mostly newcomers:
<A HREF="http://www.psi.com/">Performance Systems Internationa</A>l,
<A HREF="http://www.netcom.com/">Netcom</A>, <A HREF="http://www.pipeline.com/">Pipeline</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.alter.net/">UUNet</A>, <A HREF="http://www.demon.co.uk/">Demon</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.pipex.net/">Pipex</A>. America alone has more
than 600 of them. Almost all of them are under five years old.
<P>
This is what Tony Rutkowski, executive director of the <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org/">Internet Society</A>,
calls ``bottom-up information infrastructure''. In the late 1970s,
telecoms and computer titans tried to chart the future of communications
for decades to come. They planned to build their own digital highways
and sell videophones, Videotex and other such wonders. It never
happened--consumers were not buying. Instead, the PC arrived,
spawning office networks. Once telecoms competition had lowered
the cost of connecting these networks, the makings of a highway
of a very different kind began to emerge.
<P>
Mr Rutkowski recalls visiting America's <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commissio</A>n
in 1990 and seeing an official excitedly waving two charts. One,
from the FCC, showed the traditional telecoms investment, worth
several billion dollars and growing at the same rate as for the
past few decades. The other, from the <A HREF="http://www.doc.gov/">Commerce Department</A>,
showed all network infrastructure investment--including office
PC networks and private long-distance data networks. It had started
at about the same level as the telecoms investment a few years
earlier, but had grown exponentially to double that figure by
the late 1980s. The gap was widening rapidly, representing something
altogether new; something, the FCC official admitted, ``we know
nothing about''.
<P>
It was the foundation for the Internet, even though the true importance
of that development did not become clear for another decade. The
Internet not only challenges the traditional way of building networks;
it is so chaotic, decentralised and unregulated that it also defies
conventional understanding of such networks. <HR>

<I>How the Internet works without really trying</I><HR>

<P>
MOST people imagine that anything as complicated as, say, an economy
or a global computer network must be designed and run by some
central authority. Take the Internet. Those who know little about
it usually reckon it is run by a company to whom you pay a subscription
fee and an hourly charge to use the network. The way it works,
they think--if they think about it at all--is that once you are
in the system, your computer sends requests or messages to a central
data centre. Big computers in this centre send out information
in answer to your requests or pass your messages to other users.
If you want to put some of your own material on to the network,
you approach the company and strike a deal.
<P>
It all sounds perfectly plausible, but it is completely off the
mark. In his book ``Being Digital'' (Alfred Knopf, 1995), Nicholas
Negroponte, the director of MIT's famed <A HREF="http://www.media.mit.edu/">Media Lab</A>,
gives an example of the ``centralised mind-set'' fallacy that
leads to such expectations. We usually assume ``that the frontmost
bird in a V-shaped flock is the one in charge and the others are
playing follow-the-leader. Not so. The orderly formation is the
result of a highly responsive collection of processors behaving
individually and following simple harmonious rules without a conductor.''
<H3>Parcel force </H3>

<P>
This is as good a description of the Internet as any. For collection
of processors, read all the computers and wires that make up the
thousands of smaller networks connected by the Internet; for harmonious
rule, read a method of transferring data called TCP/IP, stemming
from the Internet's <A HREF="history.html">military origins</A>.
The rule says simply that data shall be broken up into chunks
called ``packets'', and that the first part of each packet shall
consist of the address it should go to. That is all. What happens
next is not laid down in any master plan. There is no central
computer; indeed, there is no centre at all. Far from being a
hub with spokes, the Internet is more like a spider's web, with
many ways of getting from point A to point B.
<P>
Physically, it has little substance: most of it is simply leased
space on existing telephone networks, with some dedicated computers
at connection points. <A HREF="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A>,
a consultancy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, estimates that total
sales of Internet-specific hardware this year will be only $50m;
like a parasite, the Internet uses the multi-billion dollar telephone
networks as its hosts and lets them carry most of the cost. That
makes it largely a ``virtual'' network, running on top of the
physical network of the telephone companies.
<P>
This works because the Internet does not need what telephone companies
consider to be their main assets: the centralised mainframes and
big switches they use to control their network. Instead, the Internet
uses distributed intelligence, taking advantage of the telephone
companies' lines while bypassing their tollgates.
<P>
Imagine you wanted to make a telephone call from New York to Los
Angeles without paying the long-distance charge. If you had the
right kind of telephone and knew enough people across the country,
you might call someone at the western limit of your local zone,
who would call someone at the western edge of their local zone
and patch you through, and so on across the country. This may
be an impractical method of making telephone calls, but it hints
at the way the Internet uses the telephone networks without being
controlled by them.
<P>
All the content on the Internet is held in computers known as
``servers'' at the edges of the network, usually owned and operated
by the companies and organisations that want to distribute the
information. <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A>
has servers; so do thousands of other companies (including The
Economist). In response to a request, the machines parcel up data
in a lot of packets with an address on each one, and send them
blindly down the nearest connection to the Internet.
<P>
When they arrive on the network, they are read by a computer (called
a ``router'') that has a rough idea of where things are on the
Internet. It reads the addresses and sends the packets in the
right general direction, using the best path available at that
moment. The same thing happens at the next intersection, and so
on until the packets reach their destination. The network's best
path from A to B at any one time may bear no relation to real-world
geography. At the moment this paragraph was written, for example,
the best path from London to Amsterdam, using one Internet provider,
was via New Jersey. Other providers might have used different
routes.
<P>
None of the routers has a map of the whole Internet; it just knows
the best way to the next router at that time. That makes it impossible
to predict what path a particular packet will take. It all depends
on what is available at that moment; the individual packets making
up a single message may end up taking different routes, only to
be sewn back together again at their destination.
<H3>Free-for-all</H3>

<P>
This is the power of networked intelligence. The Internet does
not need any particularly smart computers to run the show, just
a lot of dumb-but-fast ones that know how to work together. The
secret of its success is an idea of breathtaking simplicity. Think
up a universal way for networks to share data that will work with
any kind of network, of any size, carrying any kind of data, on
any sort of machine. Let anyone use it, for free, with no restrictions
or limitations. Then just stand back.
<P>
Networks want to connect. As Metcalfe's law states, the value
of a network increases geometrically with the number of people
who use it. Local area networks linking PCs within offices have
been widespread for years, but isolated from each other. The Internet
broke that bottleneck. It offers a standard method of transmitting
data that works equally well for anything from voice to e-mail.
Most importantly, it is in the public domain. Nobody owns it and
nobody charges a fee for its use.
<P>
Proprietary networks using different data standards can be part
of the Internet as long as they package their data to the TCP/IP
standard when they meet each other. But increasingly they use
TCP/IP internally, too, because otherwise they miss out on the
thousands of Internet software programs. These allow the Internet
to be used for things its founders never imagined, from telephone
calls to live rock concerts. An open standard means more users
speaking a common language, and hence a potentially huge audience,
which makes it worthwhile producing such programs.
<P>
But software is just the beginning. Internet content--everything
from classic books to underground music--is exploding even more
spectacularly. This same critical mass of users has stimulated
a creative outpouring not seen since the arrival of the PC (another
open standard). Without any prospect of profit, thousands of individuals
have put millions of pages on-line--anything from complete libraries
of technical information to day- by-day personal diaries or mini-directories
to their favourite part of the Internet. Some of them do it because
the Internet has the remarkable power to make an ordinary person
an on-line celebrity; it bypasses distribution channels and public-relations
machines. Others do it because they see a new world emerging on
the Internet, and want to contribute to it. Still others do it
simply because the Internet is there, and nothing stops them.
If the site is interesting enough, it might be visited by hundreds
or thousands of people a day.
<P>
All this activity keeps the wires humming and attracts millions
of new users each year. It also puts a great deal of pressure
on the network; the companies that provide access and store data
are often swamped by the relentlessly rising tide of traffic.
In theory, the solution is simple: buy more and faster equipment.
But that takes more money, and therein lies a problem. The Internet's
economics are still stuck in its non-commercial past. <HR>

<H1>A changeling's tale</H1>

<P>
<I>From cold war to cyberspace</I><HR>

<P>
SAY Internet, and you instantly conjure up a picture of creative
anarchy. Yet, incongruously, that cheerfully chaotic child was
fathered by cold-war paranoia and born in a military laboratory.
It started life in 1969, as ARPAnet, named after its sponsor,
the Pentagon's <A HREF="http://www.arpa.mil/">Advanced Research Projects Agency</A>.
The aim was modest: to allow computer scientists and engineers
working on military contracts all over America to share expensive
computers and other resources. As an afterthought a few researchers
cooked up a way of sending messages, too. ``E-mail'', as it became
known, quickly turned the network into a new communications link.
<P>
The Internet owes its main technical advantage to its military
origins. Splitting data into tiny packets which can take different
routes to their destination makes it hard to eavesdrop on messages.
And a ``packet-switched'' network can resist large-scale destruction,
even a nuclear attack; if one route is knocked out, packets will
simply travel along one that remains intact.
<P>
Until 1983 the Internet consisted of fewer than <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isoc.org/isoc/charts/90s-host.txt">500 ``host'' computers</A>,
almost exclusively in American military labs and academic computer-science
departments. But the word was getting out to other academics.
By 1987 the Internet had grown to include 28,000 host computers
at hundreds of different universities and research labs.
<P>
Using it was still difficult and frustrating, but its power was
already obvious. No other method to network universities around
the world was so universal and so flexible. Internet users invented
ways for many people to participate in open discussions, created
software and document libraries on the network and made them accessible
to all. This was exciting stuff for computer scientists and some
other academics, but it remained a cloistered world.
<P>
Yet during the late 1980s, while the Internet was growing in the
academic world, a networking revolution of another sort was taking
place outside. Businesses realised that, having traded their mainframes
for a multiplicity of PCs, they needed some way to recapture the
mainframe's ability to share data and devices such as printers.
So they strung wires around their offices and connected the PCs
together.
<P>
These internal ``local area networks'' (LANs) did more than save
money; they changed the way people worked. E-mail took off within
offices, and soon between them, as companies created ``wide area
networks'' to connect distant workplaces. But there it stopped.
Different software and hardware standards used by different companies
made creating wider networks a nightmare of incompatibility.
<P>
At home, PCs had made computer power affordable, and modems had
allowed them to be connected up over telephone lines to commercial
``on- line'' services and ``bulletin boards''-- electronic discussion
groups and software libraries usually set up by enthusiasts. Both
of these grew steadily, but not explosively. Each had disadvantages.
The networks offered by <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>,
the leading on-line service provider, and others that followed
in its wake were national, even global, but they were closed.
The providers controlled what was available. Private bulletin-
board systems, which had sprung up in their thousands, were unrestricted
but usually confined to a small group of users near the host computer.
<P>
Around the same time the American government was relaxing its
hold on its network. The <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</A>,
a civilian agency, was now paying for most of it, originally to
connect the agency's supercomputer centres, but later as a way
to allow all kinds of academic and government researchers to communicate.
For the first time companies were allowed to join, although not
to use the network for purely commercial purposes.
<P>
Still, that was enough. Having conquered the academic world, the
Internet began to serve as a connection point for commercial networks,
both to reach academics and to communicate amongst themselves.
``The Net came at a unique time when the computers and networks
that existed were waiting for a way to bring them together,''
says John Curran, chief technical officer at <A HREF="http://www.bbn.com/">Bolt Beranek and Newman</A>,
a Cambridge, Massachusetts, technology company widely credited
with creating much of the early Internet. Commercial use skyrocketed
as restrictions were eased, and last year companies passed universities
as the dominant users. In April all remaining curbs on commercial
use were lifted, and the National Science Foundation began to
phase out the last direct federal subsidies for the network. The
Internet had grown up. <HR>

<H1>Freeloading as a way of life</H1>

<P>
<I>The strange economics of cyberspace</I><HR>

<P>
A SIMPLE question: if the Internet runs over telephone lines,
why does it cost the same to send an e-mail message around the
world as it does to send it next door? Answer: no one really knows;
maybe it should. Just as the Internet has overturned the conventional
wisdom on building telecoms networks, so it has challenged their
archaic pricing systems. Unhelpfully, though, it offers nothing
more substantial than a vacuum in their place. When Internet builders
lie awake at night worrying that the whole thing might fall apart,
as often as not their nightmares are about its economics.
<P>
Start with the distance puzzle. The first reason why distant messages
costs no more than local ones is that the Internet, although it
runs on telephone lines, uses them much more frugally than voice
calls do. A voice call is an analogue signal which needs a lot
of electronic space to avoid interference, so it takes up an entire
line for the duration of the call. By contrast, the Internet is
digital, so its data bits--ones and zeros--can be compressed.
<P>
Second, and more important, the Internet data is split up into
packets, which do not need a line to themselves. Packets from
hundreds of sources are mixed up by the computer and shoved down
the pipe in a jumble. The router at the other end of the line
receives each one, reads its address and sends it in the right
direction. When you make a telephone call, you are consuming a
scarce and expensive resource: a whole line. When you send a message
on the Internet, you are sharing a plentiful and cheap resource:
the entire bandwidth on the line. Your packets are just a drop
in a passing river.
<P>
But there is a third reason: telecoms pricing is a notorious scam.
A large part of the price of a telephone call (often more than
40%) goes to the recipient's telephone company for taking it the
last few miles. Through a complicated accounting scheme known
as ``settlements'', telecoms companies exchange billions of dollars
each year to pay for the local component of international calls.
<P>
The Internet bypasses all this. It usually operates on leased
lines, out of reach of national telecoms accounting. Even if these
companies could track the traffic, they would simply find a constant
stream of ones and zeros, 24 hours a day.
<P>
Digital data makes short work of all the anachronistic pricing
schemes and implicit cartels of the international telecoms market.
Telephone calls are priced at what the market will bear. Data
transmission on leased lines is priced somewhere nearer to what
it actually costs. The difference can take several noughts off
the amount you pay. Talk to a friend abroad for an hour and you
may be charged $50. Make the same call on the Internet, using
software from companies such as <A HREF="http://www.vocaltec.com/">VocalTec</A>,
and you pay nothing, or nothing more than the cost of a local
phone call. Even after allowing for your monthly fee, the call
costs just a few cents.
<H3>Forget economics, let's surf</H3>

<P>
One of the many remarkable things about the Internet is that once
you have paid your monthly connection charge--say $20--it appears
to be free. Send one e-mail message around the world or send a
thousand, the price is the same: $0. In fact, each e- mail message
does cost somebody something, because it consumes a tiny bit of
``bandwidth'', the capacity of the expensive data pipes that make
up the Internet. But since the Internet providers have no way
of billing for such infinitesimal consumption, they have settled
for a rough approximation instead. They multiply the number of
their subscribers by the average network usage to calculate the
capacity they need to lease, which gives them a fair idea what
to charge. As long as the average usage does not change much,
this works.
<P>
But usage does change. Until recently the Internet has been mostly
a world of text, which is an efficient way to communicate. A million
bytes can capture the text of a 700-page book, but only 50 spoken
words, five medium-sized pictures or three seconds of video. Yet
people are now flooding the Internet mainly for the sake of byte-hungry
multimedia. The World Wide Web lets users navigate the network
by simply clicking on colourful screens of words, pictures, sound
and video. Already the Web accounts for more than a third of the
traffic on the Internet, and will soon chew up more bandwidth
than any other service. Assumptions about average use may need
to be revised.
<P>
This worries some network analysts. The Internet is a shared resource,
like the fish in the sea. Economic theory is gloomy about these:
individuals tend to exploit shared resources, but look after private
ones. Eventually that leads to depletion which ruins the resource
for all its users: the sea becomes fished out, the Internet gets
swamped.
<P>
At the moment users have every incentive to exploit the Internet.
The more they use it, the more they get for their monthly fee.
And many users would rather click on data-rich pictures than read
lots of frugal lines scrolling down the screen. Some analysts,
such as <A HREF="http://gopher.econ.lsa.umich.edu/EconInternet.html">Hal Varian and Jeffrey MacKie-Mason</A>,
two economists at the University of Michigan, now argue that those
who spend all day surfing the Internet should pay more than those
who just send the occasional e-mail message. Pricing, they say,
should be based on usage.
<P>
That is easier said than done. At the moment, individual useage
is usually not even measured, much less charged for. Counting
all those packets just means more work for some overloaded computer.
Likewise, the most obvious sort of usage pricing--a charge per
packet--would consume more computer capacity than is needed to
transmit the packets in the first place. A simpler way to charge
(which is actually incorporated in the next version of TCP/IP)
is to allow each packet to carry a ``priority''. High-priority
packets--live transmission such as voice or video--would flow
through the network without delay; low-priority packets--such
as e- mail--would wait for a lull. Internet providers would charge
more for high-priority items.
<P>
The reason why usage-based pricing on the Internet is so controversial
is that it would abolish one of the system's big attractions:
the ability to surf at whim, with no meter running. Users do not
have to work out if the latest picture of someone's fish tank
is worth a few cents. They can have a look because it is fun,
and free. Critics fear that usage-based pricing might kill the
vitality that built the Internet. Where it has been tried--in
New Zealand, Chile, and some universities--usage growth has usually
slowed.
<P>
Compromises may be possible. Users may decide at the outset what
level of service they can afford. A high-priority connection would
cost more than a low-priority one, but it would still be charged
at a flat fee. Or providers could charge on tiered usage: users
would pay a fixed monthly fee up to a certain level; if they exceeded
that, they would pay more. This might discourage excessive use
without that ticking-meter feeling.
<P>
There is one other option: do nothing. The Internet has come this
far without complicated charging systems, and although the traffic
jams today are bad, they have been worse in the past. The existing
system does already include a crude form of usage pricing. Big
pipes cost more than little ones: a leased line that can handle
up to 64,000 bits per second can cost 50 times more than a dial-up
connection at only 14,400 bits. Perhaps this is enough. In competitive
markets, the cost of bandwidth is dropping almost as quickly as
usage is climbing. The computers that route Internet traffic are
getting faster. Maybe market forces, along with the rough limits
of pipe size, will set prices at the right levels. Nobody really
knows. <HR>

<P>
<I>The electronic souk is open for business</I><HR>

<P>
FOR the past two decades, teenage hackers and pony-tailed ex-hippies
have been labouring in American university computer labs to build
the Internet. Now it is the turn of smartly besuited young men
in gleaming corporate offices to take it over. The commercial
world has suddenly become serious about the Internet.
<P>
Some of those suits have set up <A HREF="http://www2.pcy.mci.net/marketplace/marketplace.html">MarketplaceMCI</A>,
a ``virtual mall'' created by <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>,
an American long-distance telephone company. It does not look
like much in the real world; just another big room of cubicles.
But a few computers create a more mall- like illusion on-line.
Seen from a netsurfer's screen, there are plenty of stores to
``visit'' (a bit like looking at a mail-order catalogue), and
a mall-like range of unrelated items--from software to bathrobes--to
see and buy. MarketplaceMCI, along with dozens of other new <A HREF="chart3.html">on-line shops</A>,
has proved that it is possible to market in grand style over the
Internet.
<P>
The idea sounds compelling. You look up the company you want in
a sort of Yellow Pages, click on its name to be taken to its Web
site, and are presented with all the information you need, and
usually some way to order. In reality, buying on the Internet
today is still chaotic: there are hundreds of directories, each
organised differently, and none lists more than a fraction of
all the stores on-line.
<P>
But for many merchants, especially small ones, the Internet is
hard to resist. It is inherently global, so a corner florist can
become an international flower power simply by getting an Internet
connection (and some good marketing). Overheads are minimal. In
some businesses, distance may not even affect delivery costs because
the merchant may pass the order to a regional warehouse, or ship
the goods electronically. And on the Internet, no one knows whether
you are a giant multinational company or a one-man band.
<P>
A handful of companies have shown that on- line commerce can work
if you pick your product carefully. Software, technical books
and flowers seem to do well on-line. They are easy to describe
in a few pictures and text, and they suit the market: Internet
users tend to be computerphiles who sometimes spend too much time
in front of their screens, hence the occasional need for flowers.
But what else will sell?
<P>
This is not just a question for stores. Huge consumer-goods companies
such as <A HREF="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</A>, <A HREF="http://www.vmg.co.uk/">Virgin Records</A>
and <A HREF="http://planetreebok.com/">Reebok</A> are now turning
to the Internet for marketing. Newspapers, magazines and music
and book publishers see the on-line world as a combination of
threat and opportunity. As a new medium with almost no distribution
costs, the Internet has the potential to reshape the media world,
letting new competitors in and forcing established giants to evolve
or die. Already sales of the <A HREF="http://www.eb.com/">Encyclopaedia Britannica</A>
have collapsed in the face of competition from CD-ROMs; the next
battlefield will be on-line.
<P>
The commercial world now dominates Internet use. More than 80,000
companies are connected. Between them, they have more than 1.4m
Internet hosts, each of which may support many individual users.
Some of them are joining as consumers, but many are there to sell.
For the moment the market is probably small: estimates put it
at no more than $100m last year. But its potential is huge. Analysts
point to the existing $53 billion catalogue and $2.5 billion TV
home-shopping markets worldwide, and they wave surveys showing
that the average Internet user earns 50% more than the national
average and likes mail-order shopping.
<H3>A world of window browsers</H3>

<P>
But it is early days for that. Mr <A HREF="http://www.tic.com/mids/pressbig.html">Quarterman</A>
calculates that by the end of 1994 about 8m Internet users had
the right connections to use the Web; perhaps half of them actually
did so. It is the Web--with its multimedia gloss, interactivity,
and emerging secure areas--that most companies would choose as
their Internet marketplace. However, most Web users are in companies
and universities with leased-line Internet connections; for the
average home user, downloading the Web's graphics-rich pages over
a modem connection is too slow and clumsy. This balance will shift
as more home consumers get faster modems, ISDN connections and
other high-speed links, but only gradually. <A HREF="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A>
reckons that it will take at least four more years for consumer
users to pass corporate ones in America; by that time there should
be about 10m American home users on the Web.
<P>
If Forrester is right, Internet commerce may take off a lot more
slowly than the suits at MCI think. Home consumers are the key
to on-line shopping. Browsing through catalogues and chasing discounts
tends to be a leisure-time activity. But the technology that makes
the Internet bearable usually stays at work. Cathy Medich, the
director of <A HREF="http://www.commerce.net/">CommerceNet</A>,
an industry consortium aimed at getting this market going, has
perhaps more reason to be sanguine than most other people; yet
she admits that ``I don't have time to shop on-line at work, where
I've got a fast connection. But at home all I've got is a modem.''
<P>
Moreover, browsers are not necessarily buyers. Many Internet merchants
record hundreds or thousands of visits each day, but ring up only
a few sales. This is not a problem unique to the Internet: commercial
on-line services such as <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>
have had electronic marketplaces for more than a decade, but total
retail sales have never exceeded $75m annually.
<P>
There are good reasons for consumers' reluctance. Compared with
the security and ease of telephoning a company they know and placing
an order, buying on-line is still mostly for the brave and curious.
For the average home Internet shopper, for example, finding a
particular music CD on the Internet can easily take half an hour.
And even when the would-be buyer has eventually located the goods,
he may hesitate. After all, anyone can scan in a few pages from
a CD catalogue, register an Internet address and start taking
credit-card numbers. By the time buyers realise that they are
not getting their wares, a crook may have collected hundreds of
credit-card numbers. If he lives abroad, he may be hard to bring
to book.
<P>
Then there are technical problems. Internet merchants are just
starting to adopt encryption techniques that allow credit-card
numbers to be sent safely, but the competing standards may take
a while to sort out. <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>,
maker of the most popular Web browser software, as well as CommerceNet,
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft </A>(with <A HREF="http://www.visa.com/">Visa</A>)
and others are working on ways to check the identity of both the
merchant and the customer to limit fraud, but results could be
a year or more away.
<P>
Other forms of payment seem even further off, from the on-line
accounts offered by <A HREF="http://www.fv.com/">First Virtual</A>,
which aggregates purchases from merchants and bills the buyer's
credit card, to the futuristic ``digital cash'' of <A HREF="http://www.digicash.com/">DigiCash</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.cybercash.com/">CyberCash</A> and others.
None has made much headway so far. ``We have a business model,''
Dan Lynch, a co-founder of CyberCash, recently told a conference,
``but we don't believe it. We don't know what we're doing, and
the other guys don't either.''
<H3>Selling bits and pieces</H3>

<P>
But home shopping is just one of many commercial possibilities
on the Internet. Companies selling news and other information,
such as financial data and research, may well hold greater appeal
for those with fast corporate Internet links. The same is true
for services that make the Internet easier to use, such as <A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com:80/Home">InfoSeek</A>,
which lets subscribers search its database of Internet content.
And many firms are exploring the Internet as a way to conduct
electronic transactions with suppliers, which at the moment take
place over expensive private lines.
<P>
The biggest market for the Internet, however, is advertising and
marketing; and here business is already thriving. Most of the
corporate ``home pages'' on the Web amount to little more than
the usual marketing gloss, polished to an extra shine by electronic
means. But the best ones offer something potentially useful as
well. <A HREF="http://www.fedex.com/">Federal Express</A> offers
a way to track the status of a package. The site for <A HREF="http://www.zima.com/">Zima</A>,
a drink, offers links to bar and restaurant directories across
America. <A HREF="http://www.holiday-inn.com/cgi-bin/Web.ksh">Holiday Inn</A>
offers direct booking for its hotels, and <A HREF="http://www.visa.com/locator/atm_region.html/">Visa</A>
lets visitors search for the nearest hole-in-the-wall cash machine.
<P>
Companies are starting to include the address of their Web sites
in their traditional print and television advertising. Others
are paying to place a link to their home page on a popular site,
such as the <A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/index.html">on-line version of Wired</A>
magazine (which is said to have made $2m from selling such placements
last year). Some firms sponsor on-line magazine articles or an
entire publication. The advantage of Web advertising over the
traditional variety is that consumers are free to explore as little
or as much of the information as they want, instead of having
all of it shoved down their throats. ``If the remote control was
the great equaliser in the battle between advertiser and television
viewer, [the Web] and the mouse may shift power completely to
the hands of the consumer,'' writes Gerald O'Connell, of the Internet
advertising firm <A HREF="http://www.modemmedia.com/">ModemMedia</A>.
<P>
But this increasingly sophisticated Internet advertising carries
a cost: a return to domination by the traditional giants. It takes
money to stand out in the Internet's sprawl. Big companies can
pay to promote themselves in the most popular sites. Little companies
may not be able to afford to advertise their Web page anywhere
but locally. Suddenly the Internet is beginning to look a lot
less like the much-hyped global-village market. <HR>

<H1>Paradise by the modem lights</H1>

<P>
<I>Remove your prejudices before entering</I><HR>

<P>
NEW technologies tend to create new cultures. Early radio pioneers
had to learn Morse code and soon developed their own language
and conventions. A similar mystique grew up around the earliest
computers and the PC. Eventually these technologies all entered
the mainstream, relegating the insider culture of their infancy
to fringe groups. The Internet is still in its pioneer phase,
and its culture is still like nothing else on the planet.
<P>
The network's main language, inevitably, is English: the Internet
was born and raised in America. At the beginning of this year
America still had twice as many users as the rest of the world
put together (see <A HREF="chart4.gif">chart</A>), although other
countries are now slowly catching up). Most of the Internet's
key resources--not only software but things like directories and
information libraries--are in English. And e-mail, newsgroups
and other text areas are generally limited to roman characters,
forcing more of the world to use fiendishly complicated phonetic
versions of their languages.
<P>
Although the Internet is global in reach, much of its content
is surprisingly narrow and local in focus. Anyone with an Internet
connection can go to Amsterdam's <A HREF="http://www.dds.nl/">Digital City</A>,
but they need to speak Dutch to get around: this is a local outpost,
built by and for natives. The same is true for hundreds of local
discussion groups, from German ``help wanted'' to New Zealand
politics.
<P>
But despite the local variations, there is a recognisable flavour
about the way Internet users talk among themselves, accentuated
by a highly developed insider's language. The Internet dialect
is full of mysterious abbreviatons. Some of them--FTP, PPP, IRC--refer
to technologies and services. Others take some of the labour out
of typing: BTW (By The Way); IRL (In Real Life); IANAL (I Am Not
A Lawyer). Yet more characters, called emoticons, try to compensate
for the limited ``emotional bandwidth'' of text communications
by using letters to sketch a facial expression sideways on; a
wink, for example, becomes ;-).
<P>
The content of the messages is often as distinctive as the language.
The classic user takes a libertarian stance, is suspicious of
government, disdainful of politicians, and actively hostile towards
those who would screw up his paradise with indiscriminate advertising,
stupid questions and ``newbie'' (naive newcomer) behaviour. But
the Internet attracts people of all leanings: liberals welcome
it as a tool of empowerment for the disenfranchised; conservatives
love it as a free marketplace.
<P>
Fundamental to the Internet credo is the protection of free speech
and the right of every group to be heard. This has given an international
voice to cat fanciers and quilting clubs, but it has also brought
out more worrying sides of human nature. As one would expect,
there is lots of talk about sex of various kinds; at the same
time the Internet provides a home for hate groups, from Holocaust
revisionists to Turkish Armenian-bashers.
<P>
Internet debates can easily become heated to the point of mutual
vilification. Just as no one needs any special permission to speak
up, nobody is accorded any special courtesy either. Yet Internet
users will often go to extraordinary lengths to help perfect strangers
with information, tips, even research on their questions. The
Internet is still a surprisingly altruistic place.
<H3>Life, but not as we know it</H3>

<P>
Enthusiasts see the Internet as a sort of digital Utopia, not
because everything on it is admirable, but because it is there
at all. The Internet defies centralised authority; its mantra
is ``do your own thing''. The Internet's most passionate evangelists
believe that its radical heritage is not about to be swept away
by a tidal wave of conventionality and electronic shopping. Its
interactive culture, they think, will take root and flourish.
Once introduced to the powerful consensual illusion of cyberspace,
people will surely choose to embrace it, spending hours on-line
in virtual places and joining vibrant electronic communities.
<P>
In this future world, people will read not only newspapers but
books--embellished with multimedia hypertext--on-line. ``Intelligent
agents'' will act as personal butlers, travelling the networks
on their masters' behalf, bidding against other agents for theatre
tickets and making dinner reservations. Users will telecommute
to work, and their children will be taught on-line. Much of this
is already possible; soon it will be technically easy.
<P>
To the evangelists, this is a message of hope and optimism about
the future. They are puzzled that it seems to make other people
bristle. Earlier this year Louis Rossetto, the editor of <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/">Wired</A>,
sketched out his vision of the digital future to a large audience
in London. The first response from the audience was typical. ``We've
heard this before. This was <A HREF="http://www.intac.com/~dimitri/dh/learywilson.html">Timothy Leary</A>
telling us the drugs were going to make this a better world. It
didn't happen then; why should we believe it will now?''
<P>
By comparison with the electronic nirvana of the information superhighway
prophets, today's Internet is easy to ridicule. Yes, things are
quite difficult to find; yes, 90% of what is available is rubbish.
True, information is not the same as knowledge. And quite right:
everything takes far too long.
<P>
But while the hype of the information superhighway is setting
dreamers off on flights of disembodied fancy, the Internet is
already becoming ensconced in daily life in all kinds of prosaic
ways. Lots of people send each other e-mail. They may follow a
newsgroup or two. Increasingly, their daily routine now takes
them to a few Web sites, for news or stock prices or whatever
else they may want to know. Indeed, rather than Internet culture
pervading the world at large, the reverse seems to be true. The
centre of Internet activity is shifting from the anarchic if enjoyable
chaos of the newsgroups to the commercial and more passive Web,
a place of fascinating images, places and information, but little
real contact with other people.
<P>
So the culture of the Internet is changing. For 20 years its users
managed to maintain a world with the core values of a hippy commune.
Now Mum and Dad and the suited advertising smoothies have moved
in, bringing with them their consumer culture and corporate values.
For now the two cultures coexist uneasily, but the numbers are
on the side of the mainstream. This is beginning to challenge
many of the principles of Internet culture. Calls for more government
involvement are getting louder. If one day the Internet is to
become a ``data dialtone'' like the telephone system, those critics
argue, then perhaps the principle of universal service should
apply here too--which would mean subsidising some of the poorer
Internet users with revenues from some of the richer ones.
<P>
The flood of new users on the Internet is also putting a strain
on its egalitarian principles. When everyone is talking at once,
how can you tell sense from noise? Increasingly, the old filtering
prejudices are creeping back, creating new hierarchies that mirror
those of the real world. If an open discussion triggers hundreds
of e-mail messages, even Internet junkies must start weeding.
Predictably, comments from big companies (microsoft.com), the
government (senate.gov) or prestigious universities (mit.edu)
tend to get read. Those from some obscure free library connection
in Cleveland fall victim to the ``delete'' key. <HR>

<H1>Lawless</H1>

<P>
<I>Too many loopholes in the Net?</I><HR>

<P>
THE net interprets censorship as damage, and routes around it.''
This quote from John Gilmore, a founding member of the <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</A>,
often appears on the Internet. It reflects its users' confidence
that their electronic world, designed to resist nuclear attack,
can also shrug off government regulation. By nature of its global
reach and its decentralised design, they believe, it is unpoliceable.
<P>
They may be mistaken. On April 27th the US Congress held a hearing
on terrorism in the wake of the bomb that killed 167 people in
a federal building in Oklahoma. Senator Edward Kennedy waved a
76-page ``Terrorist's Handbook'' that his staff had downloaded
from the Internet, and explained that it contained instructions
for building different types of bombs, including the ammonium
nitrate bomb used in Oklahoma: ``Right now we're considering a
telecommunications reform bill in the Senate that is trying to
do something about porn on the Internet--we should do something
about this terrorist information, too.''
<P>
The telecoms reform <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/Alerts/s652_95_a1362_exon_coats.amend">bill </A>the
senator mentioned would do more than something about pornography
on the Internet. It would criminalise the sending of any content
deemed (by some unspecified definition) ``obscene, lewd, lascivious,
filthy, or indecent''. The bill was passed on June 15th; similar
legislation is moving through the House. In Washington state the
legislature has already passed a bill that would make Internet
access providers liable for any obscene content going through
their lines. At least a dozen other states have proposed similar
legislation.
<P>
Internet activists claim that such legislation puts <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/Alerts/cda_passage_eff.analysis">unconstitutional restrictions on free speech</A>.
But that would not stop it from becoming law before it is challenged
in the courts. Since screening for all obscene content is impossible,
network providers in states that passed such laws might have to
shut down. Even the Internet cannot route around that.
<P>
Internet providers have so far ducked responsibility for what
they transmit by claiming ``common-carrier'' protection. They
argue that they are not like publishers, who can be held responsible
for the contents of their publications, but like telephone companies,
acting simply as a conduit for messages they have no knowledge
of.
<P>
The current round of congressional hearings indicates that the
common-carrier exemption is not enough. Somebody has to take responsibility
for protecting vulnerable groups from obscene material. Usually
this would be the person who had put the material on the network
in the first place. But that person may live in a place where
such material is perfectly permissible. And besides, it is quite
easy to put material on the Internet anonymously. This leaves
the Internet community with two broad options: to regulate itself
or be regulated. Most Internet users prefer self-regulation, but
the nuts and bolts of that are a technical nightmare.
<P>
The problem is that obscenity on the Internet can appear under
an infinite number of guises. Some of them are obvious, including
newsgroups with names such as alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children,
along with Web sites put up by Penthouse, Playboy and a host of
amateurs. Others are harder to find: live ``keyboard sex'' on
<A HREF="http://mistral.enst.fr/~pioch/IRC/IRC.html">Internet Relay Chat</A>
channels; secret libraries known only to porn traders; even a
live video-sex service, where real women obey the typed commands
of paying viewers. Cutting off the more obvious pornography newsgroups
is easy, but that will merely make them adopt a heavier disguise.
More generic filters are bound to fail. No computer on earth can
recognise an obscene picture.
<P>
One possible self-regulating solution seems to be voluntary ``tagging''
of adult material, so that specially configured software on users'
computers can screen it out. Parents could set the software to
view such material only with a special password. Several companies
are already developing software that would allow this. Smart kids
can no doubt get round it; but users hope that such gestures may
yet save the Internet from being regulated to death.
<H3>Inadvertent criminals</H3>

<P>
But it is not just pornography that concerns the would-be regulators:
they also paint the Internet as a haven for piracy and crime.
There is something in that. Software programs by the hundreds
are illegally copied on-line, and hackers are having a field day
breaking into poorly guarded sites. But some of the problem also
has to do with the failure of legislators to keep up with new
technology.
<P>
Copyright law is having particular trouble with adjusting to the
new age. It has not been able to come to terms with a unique property
of digital information: the ease of making an infinite number
of perfect copies, essentially for free. Copy an article, casually
post it to a newsgroup, and at a keystroke you may have robbed
a company of thousands of sales. For publishers who still see
a threat in the photocopier, the Internet looks like the end of
the world.
<P>
The problem with copyright law is that it is unable to distinguish
between abuse and ordinary use. On the Internet, any number of
normal activities may inadvertently break the law. The simple
act of reading a document on-line often makes a copy of it in
a user's hard disk. Internet providers often keep copies of popular
Web sites on their local servers so their subscribers do not jam
their long-distance lines. Then there are innumerable deliberate,
but essentially innocent violations without a commercial motive:
copying an interesting electronic article and e-mailing it to
a friend, or putting it on a company LAN.
<P>
In the end copyright laws must change to reflect this new digital
domain. Publishers need some assurance that their work will not
be pirated to the point where they have nothing left to sell,
yet a way must be found to avoid criminalising normal use.
<P>
Cyberspace has no respect for trademark law, either. An <A HREF="http://rs.internic.net/rs-internic.html">arm</A>
of the <A HREF="http://www.isoc.org/">Internet Society</A> issues
``domain'' names--mcdonalds.com, for example--to companies on
request. But it does not usually check to see if the person requesting
it owns the trademark; indeed, when a journalist took mcdonalds.com
as a prank, the company had to threaten to sue him to get it back.
Worse, different companies may own the same name in different
countries, yet an Internet domain is inherently global. As the
writs fly, groups such as the International Trademark Association
are desperately trying to find some solution.
<P>
Crime is another mess. The trouble is not so much that criminals
will use the Internet, but that the police will not be able to
keep track of them there. Techniques for encryption--scrambling
messages so that only the intended recipient can read them--are
now so advanced that they can be virtually uncrackable, even with
the biggest computers. Encrypted messages make Internet wiretapping
nearly impossible. This is why the American government has <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/export/export.html">banned the export</A>
of strong encryption technology, and law-enforcement agencies
want to set up a <A HREF="http://www.quadralay.com/www/Crypt/Clipper/non-tech.html">system</A>
which allows them to decode messages sent within the country.
Internet users, fearing invasion of their privacy, have mounted
the virtual barricades. But the battle has slowed the deployment
of encryption technology in general, ironically making it even
easier for criminals already on-line to steal information.
<P>
Crime, the maintenance of public decency and the protection of
intellectual property are the problems of any mature and complex
society. No doubt the Internet will find solutions to them in
time; but meanwhile they act as a reminder that building a real
electronic nation involves a lot more more than laying down the
pipes. <HR>

<H1>The shape of nets to come</H1>

<P>
<I>There could be one, or many</I><HR>

<P>
IN THE early 1970s, a new communications network began to take
off in America. It bypassed traditional links and grew from the
bottom up. Millions of people joined it to communicate and share
information. It developed its own culture and language. Visionaries
saw it unleashing creativity and opening the door to an egalitarian
future. It was CB radio. By 1980 it was almost dead; it had collapsed
under the weight of its own popularity, its channels drowned under
a sea of noise and chaos. Could the Internet go the same way?
<P>
For parts of it, the answer seems clearly yes. In some newsgroups
and mailing lists the ``signal-to- noise ratio''--the fraction
of messages that are even remotely interesting--is becoming quite
unrewarding. Sensible people will go elsewhere and those newsgroups
will die.
<P>
But as a whole, the Internet seems safe from CB radio's fate.
Where CB radio had just 40 channels, the Internet has an infinite
number. Broadcast chatter is just one of its many forms of communication;
the Web, moderated mailing lists and private e-mail are not as
easily swamped. Technically, there is some concern about the system's
ability to make the leap from a few thousand computers to tens
of millions. But so far nothing has emerged that experts feel
they cannot set right.
<P>
Most important, the Internet has commercial potential. A critical
mass of companies have now bet heavily on it. Already some of
the world's biggest telecoms companies are developing ``industrial-strength''
parts of the Internet for such businesses. <A HREF="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>, <A HREF="http://www.bt.com/">BT</A>--along
with some of the regional Baby Bells, and smaller networking companies
such as <A HREF="http://www.bbn.com/">BBN</A> and <A HREF="http://www.psi.com/">PSI</A>--are
rolling out services with lots of bandwidth, security, reliability
and a help desk to call when things go wrong.
<P>
There is plenty of scope for growth. At the moment fewer than
100,000 of the many millions of businesses around the globe are
on the Internet. Even in America, the most wired society in the
world, less than 7% of the population is connected up. And yet
the network seems to be straining at the seams already, with long
delays during the American business day.
<P>
For a while, more users will continue to strain the network. But
much of the congestion that users chafe at is not within the network
itself, but at its periphery: in the hundreds of thousands of
servers owned by companies, universities and local Internet providers.
This is where the Internet content is stored, spread among many
private computers. Firms can reduce the queues by buying more
and faster servers, or bigger links to the Internet. If they want
people to come back to their sites, they will spend what it takes
to keep up with demand.
<P>
Even if the jams can be avoided, though, some users fret about
information overload. They see themselves surfing a sea of random
facts, half- baked thoughts and blabber. But the Internet is not
a database. It is a world with many facets: information of varying
quality, entertainment, people and places. Just like the chaotic
real world, the on-line world contains too much information to
make sense of. But this is evidence not of its unmanageability,
but of its vitality. Like newcomers in a foreign land, people
will have to find their place on the Internet. But they will get
plenty of help. Entire industries will grow up to make sense of
the information available on-line, just as a plethora of guides
do in the real world.
<H3>The empire strikes back</H3>

<P>
Today no one in particular owns the Internet; which is to say
that hundreds of companies own small parts of it. Over the next
few years a shake-out seems inevitable. A dizzying number of companies
are clamouring for a share. Beyond the big telephone companies,
America alone has 600 small Internet providers. Cable TV companies
have suddenly realised that the Internet has bypassed their fitful
interactive TV trials. Led by <A HREF="http://www.tcinc.com/">TCI</A>'s
<A HREF="http://www.home.net/">@Home</A> effort, they are racing
to offer Internet and other data services on their own networks.
<P>
In this new world, the commercial on-line services--mostly <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com/">CompuServe</A>,
<A HREF="http://webcrawler.com/AOL/">America Onlin</A>e and <A HREF="http://www.prodigy.com/">Prodigy</A>,
with the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/pages/services/msnet/msnintro.htm">Microsoft Network</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.eo.net/">Europe Online</A> due to be launched
later this year--have an uncertain future. At the moment, the
Internet explosion means that their business is booming. They
can provide their subscribers with a safe home from which to explore
this teeming jungle.
<P>
But already hundreds of other companies are developing software
to make the Internet easier to use. Until now, the commercial
services have made their money by keeping their subscribers within
their own service, paying for something that they alone can offer.
But content providers are looking for a better deal. There is
little incentive to limit their clientele to the 3m subscribers
that, say, CompuServe can offer when they can get at least 10m
on the Web. <A HREF="http://www.forrester.com/">Forrester Research</A>
projects that the commercial services' growth will peak around
1998; after that the growth is all Net.
<P>
Providing Internet access may soon become a tough commodity business.
The companies that will continue to make money are those who offer
more. Users will need--and be willing to pay for-- Internet directories
and guidance. Businesses will pay Internet companies to run their
on-line storefronts, as some already do.
<P>
Yet the best business prospects lie not in carrying other people's
bytes or running their stores, but in having something to sell
yourself. Telephone companies agree, which is why so many of them
are getting into the content business. In May <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A>
committed itself to investing up to $2 billion in News Corp, following
the path taken by <A HREF="http://www.ba.com/">Bell Atlantic</A>,
Nynex and <A HREF="http://www.pactel.com/">Pacific Telesis</A>
(which invested $300m to start a new content shop), <A HREF="http://www.bst.bls.com/">Bell South</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.sbc.com/">SBC Communications</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ameritech.com/">Ameritech</A>
(which put $500m into a deal with <A HREF="http://www.disney.com/">Disney</A>),
and <A HREF="http://www.uswest.com/">US West</A> (which bought
a quarter of <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/@@olU4xQAAAAAAAEz5/pathfinder/welcome.html">Time Warner</A>
for $2.5 billion).
<P>
In the meantime, the telephone companies are fighting to regain
the pipes. The explosive growth of the Internet may have caught
them off-guard, but they are now believers. ``A year ago,'' says
Lance Boxer, MCI's data services chief, ``we thought of the Internet
as an interesting model, but not as a necessary model. Now we're
probably investing more in the Internet than any company has in
history. We've never had an opportunity like this.''
<P>
Or a threat? If the Internet does become a ``data dialtone'',
regular dialtone might find itself out in the cold. It is already
possible to make telephone calls on the Internet from specially-equipped
computers; the spread of multimedia PCs and faster Internet connections
could make this commonplace. At the same time companies are turning
an increasing amount of their telephone traffic into digital data
and sending it through private data networks, saving up to half
their telecoms costs. Regulation permitting, this traffic could
eventually move to the Internet. For the telephone companies,
``the only decision is whether they participate in the cannibalisation
of their revenues or watch it happen,'' says William Schraeder,
president of <A HREF="http://www.psi.com/">PSI</A>.
<P>
At the moment, neither the Internet, nor any digital network,
could handle all the world's telephone calls. But MCI predicts
that by the turn of the century the Internet will be carrying
as much data as the voice networks. When that time comes, the
Internet may have to grow up in a hurry. It will be too important
to stay in the grey market of borrowed wires and back-of-the-envelope
economics.
<P>
Growing up could be painful. Mr Schraeder suggests one way things
could go wrong: at some point in not too many years the telephone
companies have enough customers within their own parts of the
Internet to launch an attack on the network. They want to go back
to the telephone model that has earned them so much for so long:
settlements, usage-based pricing, the works. They cut off independent
networks that refuse to go along. The Internet splits in two,
leaving a high-priced, orderly business network and a cheap, chaotic
consumer network, with minimal interconnection between them. Thus
balkanised, the Internet as we know it fades away, leaving the
field to commercial networks. The cable TV and telephone companies'
vision triumphs.
<P>
But there are more ways in which that vision might fail. If enough
consumers choose the more chaotic, but more open, independent
networks, the telecoms giants would be unable to cut them off.
Or the telephone companies could simply accept the new world and
the inevitable decline in voice revenues it foretells. They could,
as some are doing now, embrace it and look for new ways to make
money.
<P>
Ironically, in these rosier scenarios the Internet might also
fade, but in a different way: it just keeps on growing, absorbing
other networks of all sorts until it becomes so ubiquitous that
it is simply woven into everyday life, carrying not just data,
but telephone calls, television, everything. This is the information
superhighway writ large--and small. In this vision, we plug into
the data stream as casually as we plug into an electric socket
today. Content and transmission are disaggregated; the network
has turned into an open road.
<P>
This, indeed, may be the more likely future. Despite the racing
pace of the Internet today, it will not happen overnight. After
all, the PC, more than 15 years after its launch, is still nowhere
near being considered an appliance. But ubiquitous, open networking
seems as fundamental to civilisation's needs in the first half
of the 21st century as ubiquitous, open roads did in the first
half of the 20th. The lesson of the Internet is simple and lasting:
people want to connect, with as little control and interference
as possible. Call it a free market or just an efficient architecture:
the power of open networking has only just begun to be felt.

For 50 years mankind has lived uncomfortably with the knowledge that Armageddon is no longer just a piece of biblical symbolism: the end of the world has been an achievable, man-made possibility. Moral outrage at this prospect lay at the heart of the old abolitionist cause, even if others exploited it for less noble ends. But the idea of the West giving up its nuclear arms never found majority support in the democracies as long as communists elsewhere were determined to hang on to theirs. Now the cold war is over, Soviet communism presents no threat, and the disarmers have been joined by some prominent ex-generals, statesmen and thinkers. No misty-eyed idealists or stooges they. They make serious arguments that deserve serious thought.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the new abolitionists see it, the risk that a nuclear weapon might go bang unexpectedly or fall into the wrong hands now outweighs whatever deterrent value these weapons may still possess. Moreover, as long as some countries have nuclear arms, others will want to acquire them. The solution is for the haves to join the have-nots: dump the bomb.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, the world has changed faster than government thinking about nuclear weapons. Attention is at last turning to getting rid of old weapons, rather than building new ones (see <a href="sf0805.html">page</a>), but the big powers still have enough bombs and missiles to make the post-Armageddon rubble bounce. America, Russia, Britain, France and China are frank about their nuclear arsenals. Israel, India and Pakistan are more coy. Plenty of other countries could go nuclear if they wanted to, and some would if they could.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of the ideas recently put forward by the Canberra Commission (an international body set up by the Australian government), and by a group of about 40 mostly American and Russian ex-military men, make sense: take all nuclear weapons off alert; store their warheads separately; make much deeper cuts than planned in nuclear arsenals; and include those of Britain, France and China in arms-cutting treaties. Along with an ever tighter clamp on nuclear skills and materials, such measures would reduce the dangers of accident, miscalculation and proliferation.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that would still be only a partial means to a different end: a less nuclear world, not a non-nuclear one. Though they recognise it would not be easy, both the Canberra group and the old soldiers want nuclear weapons abolished completely. But could it be done? And would a nuclear-free world be a safer place? If the answer to both questions is a pretty confident yes, then, with courage and foresight on the part of the nuclear powers, a non-nuclear era could indeed be in prospect. Unfortunately, the answer to neither question is as straightforward as the disarmers would like.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nuclear technology is old technology; it cannot be unlearned. The blueprint for a bomb could probably be discovered in any decent university library, or retrieved from the Internet. The engineering techniques can be tricky, though many countries could master them. The hardest part is producing enough of the right sort of uranium or plutonium to make the thing go bang. That is what prevented Saddam Hussein from adding nuclear weapons to his arsenal of nasties before he attacked Kuwait in 1990. North Korea's dabbling with plutonium alerted the world to its nuclear moonlighting. And Iran's attempts to get hold of uranium from Russia and others confirmed its nuclear ambitions.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if the world cannot unlearn the alchemy of the bomb, might it be persuaded to do without it? Such is the reasoning behind the Canberra Commission's case: that big-power disarmament could set off a beneficial chain reaction.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nuclear fission can be reversed by political will. Some countries that secretly had the bomb or were making one-- South Africa, Argentina, Brazil and others--have renounced nuclear weapons. Others that could have gone nuclear chose, or were persuaded, to forgo the pleasure (though usually in return for nuclear protection from America or Russia). The Canberra Commission argues that, in today's rather different world, if the big powers agreed to give up their nuclear status symbols, even Israel and others might agree to follow.<br><b><br></p><p><b>Man remains vile</b></b><br>Maybe. But probably not. Few countries have sought the bomb just because America and Russia had it. India, more status-conscious than most, exploded a nuclear device in 1974 mostly out of fear of a large, hostile, albeit by now also nuclear-armed, China right next door. Threatened already by India's superior strength in conventional weapons, Pakistan built the bomb because India did. Israel, its neighbours vowing to drive it into the sea, saw nuclear weapons as the great equaliser, should Doomsday dawn. To the governments concerned, nuclear bombs were simply the most ferocious weapon their technology could build. They still are.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, big-power disarmament would scarcely make the world a safer place. As North Korea and Iraq have shown, catching nuclear cheats is an uncertain business. Lining up enough international support to punish them is harder still, even when the would-be chastiser--usually America, for want of much help from China or Russia--is dealing from overwhelming nuclear strength. Had the big powers renounced nuclear weapons, would a Saddam with a bomb or two have been prepared to listen? America has plenty of other weapons with which to bomb Baghdad. But there is every reason to believe that it was America's nuclear arms that stopped Saddam using his chemical and biological ones (renounced, as it happens, by almost everyone else) in the Gulf war. America's nuclear support for South Korea would surely be an element in the calculations of North Korea should it ever in desperation turn on South Korea.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an imperfect world, nuclear weapons do still deter. Even without any more Saddams (a futile wish), there is still enough rivalry among the bigger powers--think of China's muscle-flexing in East Asia, or Russia's pushiness with its neighbours--to want some sort of mind-concentrating force, even if only a small one that is kept well in the background.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, however, the new abolitionists do raise an issue that should not be overlooked. Someday, possibly quite soon, the world will wake up to face a rogue regime or a bunch of terrorists with a nuclear bomb and the will to use it. Urgently needed are missile defences (ones that avoid setting off still greater nuclear rivalries--see <a href="sf0796.html">page</a>) to protect troops sent in to do the necessary dirty work. But needed most of all are the tightest possible controls over nuclear materials, earlier warning of cheating and then the will to do something about it. In a nuclear-knowing world, eternal vigilance, not a disarming gesture, is the best hope for keeping the peace.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="sf0805.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h2>America feels good</h2>
<h5><a href="bw1.gif">(See chart)</a></h5>
<b>American consumer confidence</b> jumped in December, and for the year, paving the way for "a healthy economy during the first half of 1997", according to the Conference Board. That boost follows a spurt of 14.2% in sales of new homes in November, the fastest growth for four years. Consumers spent more, too, but not enough to raise worries about inflation.<p>
The <b>Dow Jones </b>industrial average fell back at the end of the year, leaving it 26% higher at the end of 1996 than at the start. But some European bourses made bigger gains: Frankfurt rose by 28%, Paris by 27% and London by 12%. For dollar investors, Hungary was the most profitable emerging market, rising by more than 130%.<p>
<h2>Sparking</h2>
The latest merger linked to the deregulation of America's electricity industry may end the woes of <b>Long Island Lighting Company. Brooklyn Union Gas</b> agreed to a $3 billion share swap with the larger utility. Lilco charges the country's highest electricity rates, largely because of a disastrous $5.3 billion investment in a nuclear-power plant that was never used. The combined firm will have revenues of $4.5 billion and 2.2m customers.<p>
The top managers at <b>CITIC Pacific</b>, China's investment conglomerate in Hong Kong, bought a 15.5% stake in their company from its state-owned parent for HK$10.9 billion ($1.4 billion), a handsome 24% discount. The chief beneficiary was Larry Yung, <font size=-1>CITIC</font> Pacific's chairman and the son of Rong Yiren, China's vice-president.<p>
<b>Apple Computer</b> won back its founder of 20 years ago, Steve Jobs, after announcing it was buying <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font> Software for $400m. Mr Jobs, who owns half of <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>, says he will devote a smidgen of his time to his one-time baby. Apple's shares, though, continued to sag alarmingly as investors waited for word of what the computer firm proposed to do with <font size=-1>N</font>e<font size=-1>XT</font>.<p>
Both in value and in number, management <b>buy-outs and buy-ins </b>in Britain reached record levels in 1996, according to the Centre for Management Buy-Out Research. There were 619 deals, up a modest 7% from 1995, but the value of them, &#163;7.5 billion ($11.7 billion), was up a robust 39%, swollen by three big British Rail privatisations.<b>Mergers and acquisitions</b> in America rose to a record $658.8 billion in transactions announced in 1996, said Securities Data Co, up from $519 billion in 1995, itself a record. The most feverish activity was in telecoms, followed by utilities.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<b>Marvel Entertainment Group</b>, a comic-book publisher, filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors. This is part of an elaborate battle for control of the company between two financiers: Ronald Perelman, who owns 80% of Marvel, and Carl Icahn, who heads a group of investors that owns some $900m of junk bonds issued by Mr Perelman that are secured against his Marvel shares. <p>
<b>Telmex</b> lost its half-century monopoly in Mexico as the government threw open the country's $7 billion telecoms market to competition. More than half a dozen competitors, including <font size=-1>AT&T</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> and their local partners, are now poised to improve services, cut bills and increase long-distance traffic. <p>
Helped by "Twister", <b>Hollywood</b> had a record year. Box Office receipts in America increased by 8% to $5.86 billion as more people went to the cinema, reversing a recent decline. The biggest hit was Twentieth Century Fox's "Independence Day".

The first of two special articles looks at the continuing burden of nuclear weapons--both of keeping and destroying them. The second turns to the growing threat of missile proliferation</b></p><br>WHAT price peace? That is not a trick question. The cold war is over and nuclear arsenals are shrinking. The biggest nuclear powers, with the partial exception of China, co-operate where once they competed; they have struck agreements to cut the numbers of nuclear weapons, to stop pointing those that remain at each other and, by ending nuclear testing, to stop the race to design ever fancier warheads. Yet winding the nuclear-arms race safely down will be enormously costly, just as the race itself was. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As stockpiles of nuclear weapons shrink, surplus warheads and bombs must be dismantled. That is expensive enough. In addition, there are the costs of cleaning up the environmental mess weapons leave behind. According to America's Department of Energy, the United States will have to spend over (possibly well over) $230 billion during the coming decade or two to clean up contaminated sites, from old test ranges and storage sites to disused weapons-assembly plants.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are no comparable figures for the former Soviet Union. No one knows--or is ever likely to know-- just how much was spent building its nuclear arsenal. In the end, the general burden of military spending on the civilian economy proved crippling--and in many ways remains so for today's Russia. What is certain is that the nuclear-weapons industry did its bit to make the territory of the former Soviet Union among the most polluted on earth. The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl power station in Ukraine in 1986 focused international attention on the poor safety standards of the Soviet civilian nuclear industry. Standards at military plants were no better. Vast tracts of land and water around weapons plants, research establishments and test sites are badly contaminated with radioactive residue. Russians and their neighbours will be paying this clean-up bill, in cash and in damage to health, for generations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is necessary to keep such costs in perspective. The burden of building and maintaining nuclear weapons during the cold war was itself heavy, though finding reliable figures is hard since nuclear-weapons costs, from development and production to deployment and control, were scattered across the defence budget and beyond. A preliminary, unofficial guess by the United States Nuclear Weapons Costs Study Project, based at the Brookings Institution in Washington <font size=-1>DC</font>, is that, over the more than five decades from its inception in 1940 to 1995, the United States nuclear-weapons programme cost American tax-payers a minimum of $4 trillion (calculated in 1996 dollars). The study's final estimate, due out later in 1997, is likely to be "significantly higher", according to Stephen Schwartz, its editor. And the cold war was relatively cheap compared with the cost of real world war: one estimate made back in 1948 of the military, economic and commercial costs of this century's two world wars translates into about $22 trillion in today's money.<br></p><p><b><b>A long, expensive half life</b></b><br>All the same, by ordinary standards, the cost of disarmament is high. According to another recent study, over the years the United States built some 70,000 nuclear warheads and bombs, more than 6,000 strategic missiles and getting on for 5,000 strategic bombers. Its stockpile of usable weapons rose to about 30,000 at its peak in the early 1960s, dropping to some 20,000 in the 1970s and 1980s (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). The Russians have not disclosed exactly how many nuclear weapons they built in total, but their usable stockpile is thought to have peaked at around 45,000 weapons by the mid-1980s, dropping to about 33,000 in the early 1990s.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under the <font size=-1>START-1</font> agreement the United States and Russia are obliged to reduce their arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons to some 6,500 apiece by 2001 (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>); under <font size=-1>START-2</font>, which has yet to be ratified by the Russian parliament, these totals would drop to around 3,500 apiece by 2003. Although both treaties require the destruction of missiles and bombers only, not their warheads, and although both sides are likely to keep plenty of extra warheads in reserve, both America and Russia are busy dismantling thousands of surplus warheads.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia, with the larger stockpile, says it has the capacity to take apart up to 3,000 warheads a year, though it refuses to give an exact tally of the number disposed of so far. America has the capacity to pick apart up to 2,000. A typical American-built warhead has up to 6,000 parts, each of which needs to be properly catalogued and safely disposed of. America's current operational stockpile is now less than 9,000 warheads, its lowest since the 1950s. According to the Department of Energy, America has dismantled close to 4,000 warheads over the past three years and plans to dispose of another 1,700 or so by the end of the decade. However, the rate will then drop off sharply, unless Russia ratifies <font size=-1>START-2</font>.<br></p><p><b><b>Bombs away</b></b><br>But taking apart old nuclear weapons and cleaning up the places where they were made is not the only costly hangover from the nuclear past. To military strategists, the great attraction of nuclear weapons was that they were megatonnes more than the sum of their parts. Finding safe ways to store and then dispose of their plutonium or uranium cores is proving the biggest headache of all.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hardest part of making a nuclear bomb is getting hold of the right sort of plutonium and highly-enriched uranium to make it explode. Thus, keeping the superpowers' surplus stocks out of the hands of nuclear wannabees, such as Iraq, Iran or North Korea, is becoming something of a costly industry in itself.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It takes about 15 kilogrammes of highly-enriched uranium, or up to about half that amount of plutonium, to make a standard-issue nuclear bomb. Until it stopped making the stuff in the late 1980s and early 1990s, America over the years had accumulated about 98 tonnes of bomb-usable plutonium and 994 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium. Russia has even larger stocks: an estimated 130-200 tonnes of plutonium and about 1,200 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium. Assuming the Russians are dismantling at full capacity, each year some 15 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium and 45 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium shift from the relatively secure custody of the Ministry of Defence to the less certain control of Minatom, the civilian ministry that controls Russia's sprawling nuclear industry. If the process is to continue safely, there is a pressing need to find new, more secure methods of storage and disposal.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As part of a wider consolidation of its nuclear industry, the United States recently announced a $2 billion plan over 20 years to dispose of 52 tonnes of surplus weapons plutonium, more than half its stockpile. It will do this partly by immobilising the stuff--mixing it with other radioactive wastes and vitrifying it in glass or ceramic blocks for permanent storage underground--and partly by burning it in commercial reactors to generate electricity. America has long campaigned against using plutonium to fuel civilian reactors, since keeping the cycle going requires separating out the plutonium from spent fuel for re-use, creating a proliferation hazard. The new plan would burn the plutonium once as mixed oxide fuel and then dispose of the radioactive wastes without reprocessing, making it difficult and dangerous for any would-be black-market proliferator to retrieve the plutonium for bomb-making.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia (like Japan, Britain and France) is inclined to see plutonium as a commodity to be exploited for commercial purposes as part of the civilian fuel cycle. However, it did agree in 1994 to end its production of new plutonium by 2000 (like America, it has already halted production of weapons-usable uranium; both countries support the negotiation of a global agreement to end production of such fissile material). The deal still hinges, however, on finding other sources of heat and energy for the regions that depend on the three plutonium-producing reactors concerned. But the recently announced American plan for plutonium disposal should make it easier to co-operate with Russia in getting rid of surplus weapons stocks.<br></p><p><b><b>Getting a grip</b></b><br>Indeed, America's help--commercial, financial and technical--is crucial to Russia's efforts to prevent skills, technology and materials from its nuclear (and chemical and biological) weapons programmes being spirited away by middlemen for the various unrepentant members of Bomb-Builders Anonymous.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1992, the American government organised an imaginative $12 billion commercial deal under which Russia will release some 500 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium from its weapons stockpile over 20 years for blending down to lower levels of enrichment suitable for making into fuel rods of the sort commercial reactors can use. In 1994, America's Departments of Defence and Energy (the military and civilian controllers respectively of America's nuclear-weapons programme) secretly joined forces with the government of Kazakhstan in an operation, codenamed Project Sapphire, to transport to America some 600 kilogrammes of highly-enriched uranium, found lying around, virtually unsecured, at a nuclear-fuel fabrication factory in eastern Kazakhstan. According to American officials, the Iranian government had been showing an unhealthy interest in the stuff.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the past five years the American Congress has authorised some $1.6 billion to be spent helping secure Russia's "loose nukes", with more to come. This Co-operative Threat Reduction programme (known as the Nunn-Lugar programme, after its two sponsors) has been plagued by bureaucratic delays on the American side and Minatom's suspicion on the Russian side. Yet it has helped speed the transportation of thousands of nuclear weapons from Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine back to Russia; consolidate the number of sites within Russia where weapons are stored; improve basic security, from locks to computer-based radiation-detection systems, at some of the storage sites; and, among other projects, is helping to build a new plutonium storage facility at Chelyabinsk, in the Urals. Meanwhile, collaboration between American and Russian scientists is helping to stem Russia's skills drain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nunn-Lugar money is only a bucketful in the ocean of Russia's nuclear problems. So far, it is true, there have been few serious cases of nuclear smuggling from Russia, and then only in quantities too small for bomb-building. Yet the danger will persist, indeed will grow, if morale in the armed forces continues to plummet. A special summit of the <font size=-1>G7</font> industrial countries and Russia held in Moscow in 1996 came up with a list of resolutions to co-operate more effectively to prevent proliferation. This activity is also a priority for the big powers' intelligence services, and is claiming a growing share of their budgets. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Add all this up, the money and the effort, and cleaning up after the nuclear era will be a long and costly business. Paradoxically, to the costs of disarmament may soon have to be added a little rearmament. If Russia goes on refusing to ratify <font size=-1>START-2</font>, America and Russia both may end up maintaining in working order thousands more nuclear warheads than they know they need. The nuclear era may have a longer half-life than anyone expected.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="sf0796.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

The West also faces a threat from the proliferation of cruise and ballistic missiles. How should it respond?</b></p><br>IN 1944 and 1945 the Nazis used both cruise and ballistic missiles. German <font size=-1>V1</font>s flew low towards London, rather like aeroplanes. These, the first cruise missiles, killed over 5,000 civilians even though fighter aircraft shot down some. Then came the <font size=-1>V2</font>s, rockets which flew high out of the atmosphere and dropped onto their targets with such speed that no defence was possible. These "ballistic" missiles--called that after their curved trajectories--killed 2,500 Londoners.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The technology the Germans pioneered in the early 1940s is no longer difficult to acquire. The Falklands war revealed the military value of cruise missiles: Argentina sank two British ships with (French-made) air-launched Exocets. The Iran-Iraq war showed the power of ballistic missiles to intimidate and terrify civilians. During one six-month phase of that war, in 1987-88, Iraq rained down missiles on Tehran, killing 2,000 Iranians and driving half of the population from the city. During the 1991 Gulf war, Saddam Hussein's strongest card was his stock of Al Hussein ballistic missiles. His attacks on Israeli towns nearly provoked the Israeli retaliation which could have ruptured the allied coalition. Those attacks killed just two people, but a missile which hit an American base in Saudi Arabia killed 28. These weapons can also be used to try to frighten governments: last March China fired four <font size=-1>DF-15</font> ballistic missiles into the sea near Taiwan.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is perhaps hardly surprising that growing numbers of third-world governments are finding the case for developing or buying missiles irresistible. If your neighbour's military prowess is a worry, or if you wish to stop the West from pushing you around, missiles appear to offer a solution. They are easier to make and cheaper to acquire than squadrons of fighter aircraft. According to the defence studies centre at Britain's Lancaster University, 35 non-<font size=-1>NATO</font> countries have ballistic missiles, including Algeria, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. And it reckons that 18 non-<font size=-1>NATO</font> countries are capable of installing either nuclear, biological or chemical warheads.<br></p><p><b><b>The infamous five</b></b><br>The greatest potential menace are the five "rogue" regimes, some of which have helped each other's missile programmes: Iran, Iraq (see <a href="sf5.gif">chart</a>), Libya (see <a href="sf3.gif">chart</a>), Syria and North Korea (see <a href="sf4.gif">chart</a>). The last is the most dangerous of all, for it has tested a ballistic missile with a 700-mile (1,120-kilometre) range, called the Nodong, and is probably developing a two-stage missile (the Taepo Dong 2) with a range of 2,500-4,000 miles. Iran has helped to finance North Korea's missile programme and is reported to be, like Libya, keen to buy the results. Fired from North Korea, Nodongs could reach Japan; from Iran, Israel would be in range; and from Libya, parts of Southern Europe would be threatened. From Pyongyang, the Taepo Dong 2 might reach parts of Hawaii or Alaska; from Libya, it could reach London.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cruise missiles may pose as great a threat. Compared with ballistic missiles, they are often more accurate (some can use satellites to navigate), sometimes harder to shoot down (they can be stealthy and swerve) and about a quarter of the price. The Lancaster team estimates that 67 non-<font size=-1>NATO</font> countries possess cruise missiles (even though most of them are short-range anti-ship weapons). India is producing the Lakshya, a missile with a range of 350 miles, while China, Iran and North Korea have cruise missiles of similar ranges.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Slowly, politicians in the West are waking up to the dangers. Even if the missiles cannot hit western countries directly, they can have an impact on western foreign policies. Imagine the West were to send another expeditionary force to the Middle East. It could be attacked by more sophisticated missiles than Iraqi Al Husseins.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Should governments seek to defend not only troops on such missions, but also cities at home? Should they be prepared to counter Russian and Chinese missiles, as well as those of rogue dictators? Can they make missile defences compatible with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (<font size=-1>ABM</font>) treaty, by which the Soviet Union and the United States agreed to limit their defences against inter-continental ballistic missiles (<font size=-1>ICBM</font>s)? And which of the anti-missile technologies actually work?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America and parts of East Asia these questions are matters of serious debate. In Europe, few people are concerned. Yet it is Europe, not America, which faces the more immediate threat from missiles.<br></p><p><b><b>Four defences</b></b><br>Western governments can respond to the danger of hostile missiles in four ways. They can, through diplomacy, seek to reinforce the <b>Missile Technology Control Regime </b>(<font size=-1>MTCR</font>), an agreement among 28 states to curb exports of key components. Russia has joined; China has not, but says it will observe the regime's rules; none of the rogue states is a member. The regime has no enforcement mechanisms, and does not apply to civilian rocket technology, which is little different from the military sort. So the regime--like some bilateral agreements--has slowed but not prevented the diffusion of missile know-how.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments can hope to <b>deter missile attacks.</b> Any state which launched a missile at a western country could expect to be bombed. But deterrence works only if the regimes concerned can make rational calculations of their own self-interest; some dictators find that hard.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Governments can <b>attack missile launch sites.</b> But the Gulf war illustrated the difficulties: although a significant part of America's air power was deployed in search of Iraq's well-hidden mobile launchers, none was destroyed from the air.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The imperfections of these three responses have led America and Israel to pursue a fourth: <b>missile defence systems.</b> The interceptors and radars required are neither cheap nor easy to develop. The Americans have spent nearly $50 billion on missile defence since President Reagan launched "star wars"--officially, the Strategic Defence Initiative--in 1983, but have still not got the cleverer ideas, such as space-based lasers, to work.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ballistic missiles can be shot down at three points on their flight: during the early "boost phase"; in mid-course, when most of them are outside the atmosphere; and in the terminal phase, shortly before they strike. Ideally, a defender should hit a missile during the boost phase, before it can divide into multiple warheads (if it has them) and so that the debris falls on the enemy. But that kind of interception is hard to achieve, for the boost phase even of a long-range missile will last less than three minutes; by the time satellites have spotted the launch and informed the defender, that phase may be over.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The next best time to hit the missile is in mid-course: if an interceptor misses there is time for another shot. The terminal phase is the worst time, for any debris will fall on the defender's country. But terminal interceptions are the easiest to achieve with current technology. During the Gulf war Patriot, a short-range system designed to protect particular sites, engaged Iraqi missiles with some success. Such short-range systems can also hit cruise missiles.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the time being, America can deploy only short-range systems. But the possible shape of new anti-missile defences can be discerned there, in the work of the Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation (<font size=-1>BMDO</font>). Its chief priority is to defend American forces overseas. This is because America's intelligence agencies have concluded that no rogue regime will be able to develop ballistic missiles that can threaten the continental United States for at least 15 years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>BMDO</font> is working on three short-range systems: an upgraded version of Hawk, an interceptor used by the Marines; an improved Patriot, with a new missile, for the army; and a sea-borne Navy Area Defence System. It is also developing two defences designed to protect larger areas through mid-course interception. They are called Navy Theatre Wide and, for the army, Theatre High-Altitude Area Defence (acronym: <font size=-1>THAAD</font>). Both these have undergone trials, but neither of their interceptors has yet succeeded in hitting a missile.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for that ideal of blowing up a missile in its "boost phase", a ship armed with Navy Theatre Wide that was close to the missile launch site might achieve it. The Pentagon has just awarded a contract for a prototype jumbo jet-borne laser that will-- it hopes--destroy missiles in the boost phase. But the technical obstacles remain formidable. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second and lower priority for the Clinton administration is a limited system of national missile defence, consisting of 100 interceptors linked to ground-based early-warning radars. This could protect against <font size=-1>ICBM</font>s from rogue states, though not much else. The administration says that it will spend the next three years developing this system and will then decide whether to spend a further three years deploying it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The administration's final priority is to continue research on more advanced technologies, such as space-based lasers and sensors, descendants of star wars. It is surely developing more varieties of missile defence than will actually be needed. But the American defence budget--now $265 billion a year--has room for them all. In any case, each service demands its own sorts of missile defence.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton administration insists that it wishes to abide by the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty, which permits theatre defences as well as a maximum of 100 interceptors aimed at <font size=-1>ICBM</font>s. However, some of the programmes under development would, if deployed, breach the treaty. For instance it permits only ground-based defences and outlaws those based on "other physical principles". That means that lasers--whether airborne or space-based--and satellite radars, if integrated with batteries of interceptors, would contravene the treaty.<br><b>Clinton in the middle</b><br>President Clinton's policy on missile defence faces two groups of domestic critics: those who think the government should do less, many of whom are on the left, and those who think it should do more, many of whom are on the right. The first group sees little point in spending money on missile defence: a dictator who wished to terrorise a western city, they say, would find it simpler to pack a lorry with explosives than to develop long-range missiles.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These sceptics also doubt the efficacy of missile defence systems. Ted Postol, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claims that none of the Patriots fired during the Gulf war destroyed an Al Hussein (though classified army studies suggest a 60% success rate). Mr Postol believes that <font size=-1>THAAD</font><t--mode> </t--mode> interceptors (the army's theatre-wide anti-missile system) could easily be defeated anyway. A missile might split into several warheads and decoys to confuse the interceptors. <font size=-1>THAAD</font>'s defenders reply that such counter-measures would be neither cheap nor easy for a rogue regime to master: Britain spent 13 years and several billion pounds building Chevaline, a nuclear missile with multiple warheads and decoys.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lastly, the critics claim that America's theatre defence programmes are undermining the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty. Mr Postol argues that, if space-based radars were integrated with <font size=-1>THAAD</font>, America would have a shield capable of defending against strategic missiles, which the treaty forbids. He points out that General Malcolm O'Neill, the former director of <font size=-1>BMDO</font>, told Congress that one <font size=-1>THAAD</font> system could protect the British Isles, and that <font size=-1>THAAD</font> interceptors could in certain circumstances thwart <font size=-1>ICBM</font>s. Mr Postol reckons that a dozen such systems could cover the continental United States. That would seem to contradict the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Pentagon retorts that <font size=-1>THAAD</font> could not be an effective strategic system because it has not been tested against missiles travelling faster than 5 kilometres a second; <font size=-1>ICBM</font>s travel at 7 kilometres a second (the longer the range, the faster the missile). It also points out that the Russians accepted, during recent negotiations on clarifying the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty, that interceptors which fly at less than 3 kilometres a second (<font size=-1>THAAD</font> ones go at just below that speed) are in accordance with the treaty.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But last October Russia pulled back from signing this clarification, saying it would not accept interceptors that fly more slowly than 3 kilometres a second until both parties had agreed whether faster systems such as the navy theatre-missile shield--with interceptors that go 4.5 kilometres a second--complied with the treaty. The Russians show no signs of accepting those faster interceptors.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans say they hope the Russians will accept that the Navy Theatre Wide system complies with the treaty; but that if they do not, it will be deployed anyway, because the administration has unilaterally determined that the treaty permits it. The Russians are livid.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's missile hawks do not care: they would like to scrap the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty altogether. They view it as a relic of the cold war, when, since both America and the Soviet Union lacked missile defences, neither would risk starting a nuclear war. They argue that it has no relevance in an unstable world of irrational dictators and rapidly proliferating missile technology. The administration's view that no third-world missile attack on the continental United States would be feasible for 15 years is, to them, misleading, for it assumes that neither Russia nor China will help a rogue regime and forgets that Hawaii or Alaska could be hit much sooner. They think the president is surrounded by peaceniks who are ideologically opposed to missile defence and will never allow him to deploy any form of national defensive system.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Heritage Foundation, a hawkish think-tank, proposes, for a start, upgrading the navy's theatre-missile defence system, which is based around the powerful "Aegis" radars carried on many warships. Then it would integrate space-based sensors with that system before switching, in the long run, to space-based lasers or interceptors. This would give America a lightweight shield, effective against missiles from rogue states, China or a mad Russian submariner, but not against the full force of the Russian arsenal. The Heritage Foundation claims that all this could be deployed for an additional $2 billion a year, beyond <font size=-1>BMDO</font>'s current budget of around $3.5 billion.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bob Dole, the Republican presidential candidate, supported the idea of deploying a national missile defence system but did not specify the sort he wanted. He never made it an election issue, perhaps because most Americans seem unenthusiastic about space-based missile defence.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The chiefs of staff, who have other spending priorities, see merit in the argument of Bill Perry, the outgoing defence secretary, that there is no point in deploying a system before a threat emerges, for its technology would soon be out of date; and that it would be better to work on improving the technology until deployment is necessary. They recognise that, if America scrapped the <font size=-1>ABM</font> treaty, Russia would neither ratify the <font size=-1>START</font>-<font size=-1>2</font> treaty (limiting nuclear weapons) nor engage in further efforts at arms control.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In May 1996 the Congressional Budget Office reported that Mr Dole's "Defend America Bill"--which implied a need for space-based systems similar to those proposed by the Heritage Foundation--would cost an extra $30 billion-60 billion by 2010. That excludes operating costs (likely to be $2 billion-4 billion a year) and assumes no cost overruns. This report helped turn Congress away from star wars-style programmes and scotched the Dole bill. All the same, Congress has forced the administration to spend more on theatre missile defence in 1996-97.<br><b>Planetary problem</b><br>Israel is surrounded by potentially hostile states, brimming with missiles. So it is not surprising that it will be the first country to deploy a national missile defence system. For a country of Israel's size, theatre defence is national defence. With the help of American money, it has developed Arrow, a system designed to hit missiles in mid-course. And if Arrow fails to hit a missile, Patriot will take a shot.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Patriot system has been sold to Germany, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Japan and, in modified form, to Taiwan. The Japanese, who lie within range of Chinese and North Korean missiles, are upgrading their Patriot interceptors and talking to the Americans about buying a theatre system. That has angered China, which fears that its own fairly limited strategic arsenal could be disabled by such a system or by America's plans for a national missile defence. But the more bellicose the behaviour of China and North Korea, the more likely are Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to invest in national defence systems.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Few European governments take the threat of missiles seriously. Three that did were France, Germany and Italy. A few years ago, they began work, together with America, on a "Medium Extended Air Defence System", a more mobile and powerful short-range system than Patriot. But the French pulled out in 1996 and, although the Americans are putting pressure on the British to join, the system is far from certain to be built.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since troops on expeditionary forces generally serve in multinational coalitions, it would make sense for <font size=-1>NATO</font> governments to develop a common protective system. And there would be little point in their seeking to protect their cities (if they reach that point) without collaborating. <font size=-1>NATO</font> has decided that it must protect expeditionary forces. But any decision to deploy a missile defence system will require consensus, painstaking negotiations, and lots of time. Unless, course, a rogue missile strikes a <font size=-1>NATO</font> city.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="xm0008.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

It may, in the end, lead to better things</b></p><br>A CONFERENCE at London's plush Caf&eacute; Royal, last October. On the sixth floor, in two cavernous conference halls, a small but earnest collection of geared-up people discuss telecoms switching technology, billing systems and something called "international simple resale" before a small and scattered audience. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two floors down, the trade exhibition is humming. Pony-tailed young men demonstrate ground-breaking technology for reducing credit-card fraud on the Internet. Glamorous girls in skimpy skirts talk earnestly of turnover and call-minutes in booths emblazoned with the names of countries that nobody would readily associate with the leading edge of global communications: Sierra Leone, Moldova, Guyana. And Dan Guess, the burly chief executive of Virtual Dreams, presides happily over an admiring crowd experimenting with his videoconferencing equipment.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No ordinary videoconferencing. The young Dane who has taken over the keyboard at the computer is typing furiously. "Take off your . . . " He turns to a friend. "How you spell 'clothes'?" he asks. The friend obliges. On the computer screen, a lithe young woman with long brown hair begins, jerkily, to disrobe. "All the way from San Diego," says Mr Guess proudly. "And over an ordinary telephone line."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is an annual get-together of the world's audiotext industry. The transmission of information and entertainment on telephone lines and over the Internet is at the core of the communications revolution. A great deal of the material being communicated is what the trade describes as "adult entertainment": nobody, but nobody, calls it porn. (And, just for the record, all the companies named in this article insist they stay firmly within the bounds of what is legal.) Many of the main innovations in communications are tried out first--and, in a few cases, even developed--by the adult-entertainment business. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Videoconferencing on personal computers is merely the latest in a list of electronic technologies whose chief early colonisation is by the erotic. The cinema, the videocassette, France's Minitel system, the compact disc and pay-per-view television have all been used, in their early years, partly or mainly for adult entertainment. Some of them still are. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the late 1970s, when few American homes had videocassette players, more than 75% of all videocassettes sold were in this category. Since then, following a common trend, the percentage has fallen as the medium has acquired more conventional uses. Paul Fishbein, publisher of <i>Adult Video News</i>, a trade publication based in California, reckons that sales and rentals of adult video tapes through video stores were worth about $3.1 billion in 1995. Mail-order sales may have been worth another $1 billion or so. The business thus accounts for about 14% of rentals and sales by volume, he says. But, because adult tapes sell at a premium, the business probably accounts for rather under a quarter of the $16 billion revenues of the home video market. There is, Mr Fishbein complains, "a glut of products on the market. The profit margins are not what they once were."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Germany, too, adult fare accounts for the largest single chunk of the market for video rentals: 40% of a market worth about DM2.8 billion ($1.8 billion). The figures come from the trade association of erotic-video producers, which spends its time collecting royalties for its 190 or so specialist producers of adult films. <br></p><p><b><b>That's entertainment?</b></b><br>Adult entertainment is now a mainstay of pay-per-view television. In American hotels $150m-175m, or at least half of the revenues for pay-per-view films, usually comes from adult entertainment. Not surprisingly, as pay-per-view television in the United States has become available on cable and satellite channels, the two main companies in the business, Playboy and Spice Entertainment (which owns the Spice Networks), have rushed to take advantage of it. Between them, their four adult channels account for perhaps $200m of the $600m American market for pay-per-view television.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both have done well from the launch of direct-to-home digital satellite television in the United States two years ago. Now, both Playboy and Spice are bringing their television and film channels to more sex-starved parts of the globe: in late 1995 Playboy was launched into Latin America, and the Spice Networks have been moving into Asia. Within five to ten years, both of them think that at least half of their television revenues will come from abroad.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, both have big plans to make money from cybersex. At Spice, Roger Faherty, the chairman, believes that "if there is money in the on-line world, it will be in sex and sport." His company has launched Cyberspice, an "on-line peepshow". Tony Lynn, president of Playboy Entertainment, sees his company's Internet site, with 5m "hits" a day, as "potentially our most important revenue earner". The company is now experimenting with charging people to peek at a page.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Elsewhere, a cable channel is already using the Internet--legitimately--to avoid the irritations of regulation on television channels. In Britain, the Adam and Eve film channel has found it hard to win permission to broadcast throughout the day. Instead, the company is running its films of erotic cavorting around the clock on the Internet (at www.adamandevechannel.com, if you really must know). Ray Miller, the channel's chief executive, grumbles that it is hard to establish his tasteful offerings in the Internet's thickets of hardcore porn.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Larger companies, such as Spice and Playboy, face a similar dilemma. They aim to provide, as Mr Faherty of Spice puts it, "good taste within the genre". They are keen to offer value for money, because they recognise the need for repeat customers. "You can't throw garbage out there and expect people to pay for it," says Mr Faherty. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But they know good taste is not always the first concern of those who watch adult entertainment. Spice runs Eurotica, a more explicit cable service, in some European markets, and is exploring ways to launch a version in America. And on the Internet they will come head-to-head with competitors battle-hardened in an area where the ability to make good use of the latest electronic kit is the key to success. These are the veterans of the telephone sex industry.<br></p><p><b><b>A vision of the future</b></b><br>One such is Mr Guess of Virtual Dreams. "The two contents that drive technology are warfare and sex," he avers. "And sex generates the revenues." His company gets $700,000 a month in revenue from its "videoconferencing" service, which has been running for two and a half years. The service is, in fact, a one-way broadcast (the customer sees the girl, but not vice versa) with a two-way connection for typed messages or for a voice conversation. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The picture comes across an ordinary telephone line. The service hopes to show 12 frames a second to a viewer with a standard computer and a basic modem. That will be jerkier than a television broadcast, which shows 30 frames a second, but is still an astonishing testament to the powers of digital compression. "Like getting an elephant down a garden hose and reconstituting it at the other end," says Mr Guess--a little unkindly, considering that winsome figure in San Diego.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of the customers dialling Virtual Dreams' videoconferencing service, 75% are in the United States and the rest abroad. On January 1st the company launched an Internet-based service, which it expects will eventually be a far bigger business. It will be possible, for instance, to offer a broadcast with several hundred people watching the same live show. In time, the user will be able to control the camera from his home computer. It will also be possible to offer customers sites all over the world (eager viewers at morning sessions in the Caf&eacute; Royal had to wait for the girl in San Diego to finish her breakfast before she would perform). And customers outside the United States who use the telephone have to pay the high cost of an international telephone call. An Internet link cuts out that cost and opens the service to the world.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The service, in any case, does not come cheap. Customers pay $5.99 a minute, and stay on the line, on average, for 13 minutes, running up a bill of $78. The girl at the other end receives $25 an hour. At least some of the difference goes to finance the development of a technology that will ultimately change many activities apart from voyeurism. Medicine, education and a whole host of commercial and industrial transactions will eventually apply the technology now used almost exclusively for long-distance sex. <br></p><p><b><b>Hold the phone</b></b><br>"Telephone sex may be good for development." Who says? The International Telecommunication Union (<font size=-1>ITU</font>), the staid club of national telephone operators. While Virtual Dreams and its handful of competitors offer live colour video pictures of lightly dressed lasses (and lads, who are what one caller in five wants to watch), a larger and more established business sends live or recorded sex chat across an ordinary telephone line.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Customers may pay in one of two ways: through the cost of the call (in which case the bill appears on their ordinary telephone bill--or their employer's) or by credit card. To escape regulatory constraints, companies using the first method frequently run their services from faraway places with strange-sounding names, many of them penurious developing countries. Others use domestic premium-rate lines.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The industry reckons that 1.5% of all international traffic is telephone sex, with a global turnover of around $2 billion a year. The key to the business, explains the <font size=-1>ITU</font> (whose interest in it is purely academic), is a settlement system which ensures that the country in which an international call originates and the one in which it terminates share the revenue from the call.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This settlement system means that the public telephone operator (<font size=-1>PTO</font>) of a small developing country can benefit hugely if it can generate a large amount of incoming traffic. The <font size=-1>PTO</font> splits its share of settlement payments with the service provider, who drums up business and provides the girls. Often, the calls are routed back over a leased line (on which there are no settlement payments) to the country where the call began. The amorous fellow thus pays for an international call to talk to a woman who may be just a few miles away.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prize example is Guyana, a dirt-poor country in Latin America (<font size=-1>GDP</font> per head around $2,000 a year). Since the country's <font size=-1>PTO</font> was taken over in 1991 by <font size=-1>ANT</font>, an American company, it has increased its volume of incoming calls from 23.8m minutes to 139.7m in 1995, a compound annual growth rate of 56%. As a result, its yearly revenue from telecommunications services is now around $130m, or the equivalent of 40% of the country's 1993 <font size=-1>GDP</font>, or--to put it another way--$700 per household. Not all the revenue stays in the country, but with the money that does the <font size=-1>PTO</font> has been building one of the region's finest telephone networks. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>ITU</font> points to a couple of even more extraordinary instances. Niue, a New Zealand protectorate in the South Pacific, handles many calls from Japan, one of the fastest growing markets for telephone sex. The island has more lines than inhabitants. Some of the lines are connected to answering machines rather than human operators. Others are routed back to a call centre in Toronto which is manned by operators who can speak English, French, Spanish, Greek, Italian and Swedish. Like many other countries in the business, one of Niue's selling points is that the tiny size of its population guarantees short telephone numbers. Dial the international access code of 683, and another four numbers will connect you to your heart's desire. It would be easy for the naive or ignorant to imagine they were making a local call.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dutch Antilles, in 1994, was receiving the equivalent of 2,600 incoming minutes of calls for every telephone subscriber in the country and generating at least $1,000 a head from settlement payments. Since Germany alone accounted for 47% of its incoming minutes in 1994, the tiny country will have been badly hit by Deutsche Telekom's decision in 1995 to clamp down on international sex calls--part of an effort to clean up before privatisation.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Germany is a big loss: all told, it accounted for about a third of the 60m minutes a month of the world's international sex calls. After the German clampdown, the United States is now the biggest caller. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even with Germany knocked out, more poor countries are crowding into the chat trade. Should <font size=-1>PTO</font>s be in this business at all? Those in the developing countries are, says Stuart Sharrock, editor of <i>Voice+</i>, one of the main trade magazines, "quite open about it. They are often in a tough commercial situation, and this allows them to invest in equipment that allows all sorts of facilities for their domestic customers. Many of them are well-run organisations with slick operations and published accounts." And, because they split their takings with the service providers, they make less from the business than the telephone companies in the rich countries where the calls originate, which pocket the other half of the settlement payment.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The international business is run by perhaps five to ten companies worldwide. More are based in the Netherlands than anywhere else, but all move easily between countries. Delegates at the Caf&eacute; Royal perked up when Sean Taylor, from Redwood Technologies, spoke of the work his company had put into developing telephone equipment that could work in any country, and be used equally for international and domestic calls. That sort of flexibility will be useful to many businesses, but is perfect for the adult market.<br></p><p><b><b>The puritan counter-attack</b></b><br>For it is, not surprisingly, a trade that has to keep one step ahead of the regulators. That is even more the case for the domestic premium-rate business. Premium-rate services allow telephone companies to charge callers a higher rate than the normal telephone tariff for dialling certain services. When premium-rate services were first introduced, in the 1980s, many of them were sex-chat lines.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gradually, national regulators have clamped down on many of them. Richard Cadman, author of a recent study of premium-rate services in Europe for Eurodata, a telecommunications consultancy based in London, reckons that adult services are 25% of the premium-rate market in Switzerland, 14% in Finland, but hard to measure anywhere else. A growing number of countries have banned or restricted the services or advertising for them. In Britain, where 70% to 80% of all premium-rate calls were to adult services when premium rates were launched in the late 1980s, the proportion is now down to less than 1%, according to the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services. Why? British Telecom and Vodafone required would-be customers to register for a special identification number and prove that they are over 18. That, not surprisingly, scuppered the market.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1995 the industry in Britain sought a way to revive it: by setting up closed user groups, telephone networks used by businesses such as travel agents or hotels to link their branches together. Connected to such a network by clever software, a customer can take part in a live conference call. Today, the conference agenda may be smut. But here, too, there is potential consolation for the moralists. In future, such a network could link a family or a group of housebound disabled people.<br></p><p><b><b>The problem with getting paid</b></b><br>In the United States, premium-rate sex calls have suffered from a different handicap: the difficulty of extracting payments. Telephone companies are obliged by law to tell customers at regular intervals that as long as they pay for the transmission of a sex-chat call, they do not need to pay for the content. As a result, the industry suffers from huge bad debts--perhaps 30-40% of all the business in the United States, say some.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is one of the reasons adult services have increasingly moved to charging their customers by credit card. There are other advantages: once they have persuaded a customer to divulge a credit-card number, some services make it hard to cancel. And, in many countries, the range of premium rates that telephone companies will charge is limited and the top band is low: only 13 tariff bands are available in Britain, ranging up to $2.30 a minute, says Eurodata's Mr Cadman, compared with 28 in Finland, ranging up to $4.75. Above all, credit-card calls have been less regulated than premium-rate calls: regulators have accepted that, since only adults are eligible for credit cards, the system offers some automatic protection for children.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, as the adult business suffers so much fraud, credit-card billing is not necessarily a protection. Banks often refuse to accept such business. Two years ago Richard Gordon, a Californian businessman, developed a system for detecting and preventing fraudulent credit-card calls. When, in response to a request by a chat-line, a customer punches a credit-card number into the telephone, Mr Gordon's system checks it against an elaborate database. If the number is approved, his company processes and clears the payment. He claims to have almost eliminated bad debts.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, more than half the company's new credit-card business arises not from the telephone but from the Internet. That brings problems. Credit-card fraud rates are high. Moreover, while companies taking calls from telephone customers in the United States can see the telephone number from which they are calling--and thus spot whether the call is from a number with a history of attempted frauds--an Internet connection provides no such protection. So Mr Gordon's company is developing a system of electronic "finger-printing" to recognise a particular computer.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a system will, in time, be used not only for adult entertainment but for all the other services traded on the Internet. It is already being used by some companies selling software on-line. Software distributed that way, says Mr Gordon, shares a key characteristic with adult entertainment: there is no "deferred delivery". By the time the trader has found out that credit-card details are fraudulent, the customer has already received (and, in the case of porn, consumed) the product.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Guesses about what proportion of Internet trade is adult entertainment are bound to be vague. Forrester Research, a Boston-based consultancy that specialises in communications issues, reckons that adult services in 1996 accounted for about $50m-worth of business, or about 10% of all retailing on the Internet to customers in the United States (although that includes materials ordered on-line and then sent by post). That put adult business behind sales of computer products and travel. But the figure may well be too low. Mr Gordon reckons the market for telephone video-conferencing has been running at $1.5m a month recently; and that market is shifting rapidly to the Internet.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet has many advantages for the adult-entertainment trade. It is global; it is cheap to use over long distances; above all, it is hard to regulate. For a trader, though, it has drawbacks: customers are hard to trace, and intellectual piracy is rife. The adult-entertainment business, which has pioneered so many communications technologies, will find ways to solve these problems and will thus blaze a trail for more conventional businesses. To expect their gratitude, though, would be a mistake.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="st4106.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

To keep the organ pure, a gatekeeper known as the blood-brain barrier screens any molecule that might try to gain access.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The blood-brain barrier is omnipresent. It consists of all the endothelial cells that line all the blood vessels that flow through the brain. These, unlike the cells lining the vessels servicing less critical organs, form tight, impenetrable junctions with their neighbours. Only a few substances necessary for the brain's proper functioning are able to get past this close-knit thicket of endothelium.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is normally a sensible arrangement. The brain is the body's most sensitive organ as well as its most vital one. The blood-brain barrier keeps out things that might upset it. It also keeps essential biochemicals, such as neurotransmitters (molecules that carry messages between nerve cells), in their proper place inside it. But its vigilance can be a drawback. For it also keeps out a few things that might help the brain--such as drugs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment, the conventional way of getting round the blood-brain barrier is by the painful procedure of intracerebroventricular instillation--that is, dropping the drugs in question into a patient's brain through holes drilled in his head. But even this delicate operation can deliver medicines only to the brain's surface. Deeper centres (where disease may lie) are inaccessible to it. What is needed, therefore, is a less invasive, less expensive way of breaking through the blood-brain barrier.<br></p><p><b><b>Rites of passage</b></b><br>William Pardridge, at the Brain Research Institute of the University of California, Los Angeles, thinks he has one. His method is to get his drugs to tag along with the chosen few natural molecules that are permitted access to the inner sanctum.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These privileged chemicals (such as the components of proteins and genes) are carried in by special receptor proteins, each tailored to a particular substance. So one way of sending drugs across the blood-brain barrier is by subverting a receptor into carrying them in, too.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Pardridge has succeeded in doing so for a range of substances, including an anti-cancer drug called daunomycin. The real job of the receptor he exploits for his trick is to transport a protein called transferrin across the barrier. (Transferrin carries atoms of iron and manganese into the brain, picking them up on one side of the barrier and releasing them on the other.) Dr Pardridge is able to make the receptor carry his drug, too, by using another protein, known as a monoclonal antibody, as a molecular roof-rack.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Antibodies are normally manufactured by the immune system. They are designed to latch on to particular substancess in a highly specific way. This allows them to neutralise key molecules in disease-causing invaders without damaging similar, but not quite identical, molecules in the body they are supposed to be protecting.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This requires that hundreds of billions of slightly different antibodies exist in a single animal. But by cloning the cells that make a single variety of antibody, a pure version of that antibody (ie, a monoclonal version) can be produced. Dr Pardridge uses a monoclonal antibody that sticks specifically to rat transferrin receptor (like many drug researchers, his preferred experimental animals are rodents). When the receptor crosses the barrier, the antibody is also dragged across. And by attaching drug molecules to the antibodies before they are injected, these too are pulled inside the brain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, Dr Pardridge can do better than that. By stuffing his drugs into balls of fat called liposomes, and attaching each liposome itself to a number of antibodies, he can get as many as 10,000 drug molecules across the barrier in one packet. In a paper just published in <i>Proceedings of the Na tional Academy of Science</i>, he has shown that his "immunoliposomes" can successfully shuttle daunomycin into the brains of experimental rats up to 24 hours after they are injected into the rats' bloodstreams.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is the transferrin receptor the only one on which this sort of trick can be pulled. At Neuromedica, a drug-delivery firm based in Conshohockon, Pennsylvania, Victor Shashoua is studying the receptor that transports cis-docosahexaenoic acid or <font size=-1>DHA</font>--a naturally-occurring fatty acid that forms a significant proportion of the brain's grey matter--across the blood-brain barrier. Dr Shashoua is using this receptor to sneak dopamine into the brain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dopamine is one of the most important neurotransmitters, and a lack of it is implicated in several diseases, including tardive dyskinesia, a progressive loss of motor control which afflicts more than 300,000 people in America alone.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Attempts to boost the level of dopamine in the brain in order to treat such diseases have often been thwarted by the blood-brain barrier. But Dr Shashoua has been able to increase the brain's uptake of dopamine almost eightfold by attaching it to <font size=-1>DHA</font>, and getting the receptor to carry it across. He hopes his <font size=-1>DHA</font>-dopamine combination, known as "Doprexin", may make a drug that combats tardive dyskinesia.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If hitching a lift on a receptor fails, though, a drug designer has two other options for getting into the brain without the aid of a drill. One is to disguise the drug as something that is normally allowed in. The other is to exploit natural weaknesses in the barrier.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Disguising a molecule usually means making it look more like a fat. Fatty molecules are able to slide across the blood-brain barrier because the membranes surrounding endothelial cells are also composed of fats. It is a general property of fats that one can easily dissolve in another. So, if a drug can be modified to make it more fatty without affecting its action, it can often be absorbed into the brain without having to involve any receptors.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This trick was first performed over a century ago (though the details were not properly understood at the time). The result--a modified, fat-loving form of morphine that was once used as cough mixture--was named "Heroin" by Bayer, a German drug company which marketed it. It can cross the blood-brain barrier 100 times more easily than morphine. Now the trick is being recreated--ironically to assist the passage of enkephalin, one of the family of neurotransmitters that heroin mimics in order to produce its effects.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The work is being done by Nicholas Bodor, at the Centre for Drug Discovery at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Enkephalin would make a good drug because it is a natural pain-relieving substance. But, like morphine, it is spurned by the blood-brain barrier. So Dr Bodor is attaching lipophilic chemical groups to it in order to ease its passage into the brain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Bodor's chemical disguises are very cunning. Though fat-like in the blood and thus easily ushered through the endothelium, they are transformed by enzymes on the other side into water-soluble compounds known as pyridinium salts. This means that once through, the enkephalin is locked in by the barrier and should thus build up inside the brain.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A paper recently published by Dr Bodor in the <i>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry </i> shows that enkephalin travelling through the blood in such chemical incognito does indeed concentrate in the brain, rather than the peripheral nervous system. And recent clinical trials in Britain have demonstrated that this method can work with drugs other than enkephalin. Oestrogen-- the principal female hormone--can also be effectively and selectively delivered to the brain by tinkering with it to make it more fat-soluble. This reduces the likelihood of complications from high hormone levels in other tissues.<br></p><p><b><b>A chink in the armour</b></b><br>The third way to bypass the blood-brain barrier--exploiting existing weaknesses in it--is perhaps the neatest. This is because such weaknesses are often caused by the diseases that the drugs are intended to cure.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Occasionally, particularly in cases of cancer, the barrier lets down its guard. The blood vessels supplying gliomas--malignant brain tumours which strike almost 200,000 Americans each year--are more likely to leak than those in healthy brain tissue. This is because the diseased endothelium is much more responsive to a naturally occurring chemical called bradykinin, which causes endothelial cells to pull apart.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scientists at Alkermes, a drug-delivery firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are exploiting this weakness in tumours in order to push anti-cancer agents across. Their weapon is <font size=-1>RMP-7</font>, a bradykinin look-alike, which has been biochemically tailored to increase its stability and potency. A swift intravenous dose of <font size=-1>RMP-7</font> can open up the blood-brain barrier just long enough for toxic anti-cancer drugs such as carboplatin to sweep inside the tumour. And since the action is specific to the tumour, the rest of the brain--untouched by malignancy--is also unaffected by <font size=-1>RMP-7</font>.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>RMP-7</font>-carboplatin combination has been put through its paces in several clinical trials in Europe and America. Results from European studies (announced late in December) show that almost 90% of patients with recurrent malignant brain tumours that have failed to respond to surgery and radiotherapy do respond to monthly intravenous injections of <font size=-1>RMP-7</font> and carboplatin. Indeed, in three-quarters of the cases the tumours were either completely stalled or even reversed. The new treatment appears to double the chance of survival. And there is not a drill in sight.<br><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="st4107.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

It seems, however, that war may open some soldiers' minds, too--in many cases a little too literally. Research in Israel by Alon Friedman at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, in Beersheva, and Hermona Soreq at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem suggests that stress may cause soldiers' blood-brain barriers to leak.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a recent paper in <i>Nature Medicine</i>, Dr Friedman and Dr Soreq follow up an earlier observation that Israeli soldiers from the Gulf-war period are three times more likely than peacetime volunteers to experience central-nervous-system effects from a substance known as pyridostigmine. This chemical is an anti-nerve-gas agent widely used to protect troops from the effects of organophosphates in chemical weapons. It is designed to safeguard the peripheral nervous system from the effects of such weapons, thus keeping essential organs--particularly the heart and lungs--functioning.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But pyridostigmine cannot enter the brain (where it causes such tell-tale symptoms as headaches, insomnia and nervousness) unless the blood-brain barrier is breached. Dr Friedman and Dr Soreq believe that stress, of both mind and body, is to blame for the soldiers' fragile brain defences. They have found that mice put under pressure--by forcing them to swim a few laps of a small swimming pool, for instance--are 100 times more susceptible to the brain effects of pyridostigmine than those allowed to rest. This is primarily due to the increase in the amount of the drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biochemical basis of the connection between stress and the blood-brain barrier, though noted in other experiments, is as yet unknown. Dr Soreq speculates that neurotransmitters such as serotonin--a known disrupter of the barrier which has recently been implicated in anxiety disorders--may play a part.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stress afflicts patients, as well as soldiers. If the blood-brain barrier does open up under duress, this creates new opportunities for delivering drugs to the brain and new complications for sending them to other organs. In medicine as in war, a weak defence demands a careful offence.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?852339600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp;<a href="index.html">Contents</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&copy; Copyright</a>1997 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1 align=center>Palestine by proclamation</h1>


<CleverDrop>THE settlements grow, the talks stagnate and the prospect of Palestinian frustration leading to endless violence grows apace. Is there a way for Yasser Arafat to avert the coming explosion and make Israelis once again take the "peace process" seriously?
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Arafat has few instruments at his command other than gestures, and gestures can often prove empty. Even so, this could be the moment to take a risk--and proclaim Palestine independent. He has in fact done it before, in Algiers on November 15th 1988. Some 60 countries recognised the new state almost at once, and as many again have done so since. Nothing happened. But this time it just might be different.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason is that outside opinion has shifted Mr Arafat's way. Most of the democratic world was hugely pleased to see the success of the Oslo peace effort, and distinctly apprehensive when, in May 1996, Binyamin Netanyahu was elected Israel's prime minister, bringing with him a Likud-led government hostile to the concept of a land-for-peace deal on which the accords rest. Still, the world was ready to wait and see. It has now done so, and the evidence suggests that Mr Netanyahu is not prepared to contemplate serious bargaining over basic issues, including borders and settlements.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For their part, the Palestinians have downgraded their expectations. All they insist on, they say, is that Israel should implement agreements already signed: not so much over Hebron (about which there is now little dispute) but on "further redeployments", something that sounds boringly technical but isn't. Under an agreement signed in 1995, Israel is supposed in the next year or so to give the Palestinians full (rather than just civic) control over the villages where most West Bankers live, and to move its army out of most of the countryside. Since Mr Netanyahu is deeply reluctant to do any such thing, he seems to be suggesting that the two sides skip redeployment and move briskly into the final-status talks. There, if present circumstances are any guide, he can make sure that nothing happens at all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this prospect that makes a renewed declaration of Palestinian independence seem less outlandish. Mr Arafat could argue that a Palestinian state already exists, recognised by most countries. He could go on to acknowledge that the Palestinian Authority is, in effect, a Trojan horse for an elected Palestinian government with an executive, a legislature, a judiciary and its own security forces. He would then apply for membership of the United Nations.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What would all this achieve? It would pre-empt time-wasting argument about what the Palestinian "entity" should eventually be. More important, it would raise the sights of the peace process. Instead of an indeterminate crowd of former guerrillas and exiles begging for "concessions" from the all-powerful state that defeated them, the negotiations would be between two states, equal under international law even if far from equal in brute power, and the talks would be about borders, security and perhaps a shared capital.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, Israel would not accept this straightaway. Yet the notion of a Palestinian state is no longer anathema to most Israelis; the Labour Party did not oppose it in its latest election manifesto. And with the peace process stuck, there is an argument for building a stronger foundation for the time when it eventually unsticks itself. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By giving Palestine international standing, membership of the <font size=-1>UN</font> could help cement that foundation. Palestine already has observer status. Were it to gain full membership, it would be no more curious than some other <font size=-1>UN</font> members. Its alphabetical neighbour, Palau, for instance, is a fully sovereign and independent state of 15,000 people on 340 Pacific islands with its own American zip code. It makes no pretence of being responsible for its own defence. Palestine would have to accept its own defence limitations.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The world on the spot</b></b><br>
China and Russia would support Palestine. Two other members of the Security Council, France and Britain, have expressed support for eventual statehood. For a while at least, Britain, which likes to make the recognition of other states technical rather than political, would nitpick about the criteria. Is Palestine a defined territory over which sovereignty is not seriously contested? And has it effective control over territory and population? A fuzzy yes can be given to both questions. Israel has not claimed sovereignty over the Palestinian land it conquered in 1967, East Jerusalem apart (admittedly, a crucial exception). Egypt administered Gaza but never asserted sovereignty over it. Jordan renounced all claims to the West Bank in 1988. And the Palestinian Authority, with its sometimes brutal security forces, does control most of the people in the territory, if not most of the land itself. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What, then, would the United States do? Optimists argue that it was the all-pervading paralysis of the American election that helped to send the peace process spiralling downwards. Now that Bill Clinton is safely into his second term, he can, they hope, rise above his reputation as Israel's favourite president. Might he support Palestine's application to join the <font size=-1>UN</font>? He should. If Palestine were a recognised state within the United Nations, it would increase the hope of a peaceful Middle East. But the reality is that American public opinion has not been prepared for it, and Mr Clinton, however exasperated he is with Israeli policy, is not, at present, likely to stick his neck out for the Palestinians.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the biggest objection to a unilateral declaration of independence. America is the only country that can influence Israel. A Palestinian <font size=-1>UDI</font> would be seen by many Americans as provocative, drawing attention away from Israeli backsliding and robbing the Palestinians of whatever sympathy they may currently enjoy. A cynic might argue that Mr Arafat would do better to wait until Israel had unambiguously shown its contempt for the peace process, openly reneging on its 1995 agreement on the villages. Yet to wait for that might be to await the shedding of lots more blood. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another objection is that after <font size=-1>UDI</font> the Palestinians could find themselves worse off. They might jeopardise all hopes of regaining control of their villages. They might see renewed border closures, even occupation of areas already handed over. And so they might. Yet these are risks they run anyway.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It has long been accepted that there can be no confident peace in the region until the Israelis believe themselves secure and the Palestinians believe their rights restored. Neither of these things can happen, absolutely. But an established state should give the Palestinians the confidence to accept the restrictions--on guerrilla movements, arms and foreign policy--that are vital if the Israelis are to be confident too. A declaration of independence is a risk worth running.<br>

<h2>The great survivor</h2>
 <p>
<b>Boris Yeltsin</b> survived two challenges: a campaign for re-election and a heart-bypass operation. His security adviser, Alexander Lebed, made peace in Chechnya, and was then sacked.<p>
<b>NATO </b>agreed to start talks in 1997 about letting some East European countries join. Russia said it would discuss a charter to define its relations with the alliance. <font size=-1>NATO</font> troops kept the peace in <b>Bosnia</b>, and will remain until mid-1998.<p>
<b>Helmut Kohl </b>became Germany's longest-serving chancellor since Bismarck. Spain elected its first right-wing government since Franco; a left-leaning coalition won power in Italy. Both countries ran austerity budgets in preparation for a single currency, as did Germany and France, despite record unemployment. The European Union agreed on a <b>stability and growth pact</b> for countries that adopt a single currency in 1999.<p>
Necmettin Erbakan became Turkey's <b>first Islamist prime minister</b>.<p>
The European Union banned exports of <b>British beef</b> after scientists discovered a link between "mad-cow disease" and a new variant of <font size=-1>CJD</font>, a fatal human brain illness.<p>
Voters ousted <b>former communists</b> in Romania and Lithuania and elected reformist presidents in Bulgaria, Latvia and Estonia. Vaclav Klaus, the Czech Republic's pro-market prime minister, hung on to power. Alexander Lukashenka, Belarus's despotic president, tightened control.<p>
<h2>Peace broken?</h2>
<b>Binyamin Netanyahu</b>'s narrow win in Israel's election stopped the Arab-Israeli peace process. Before the election, bombs in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem killed 59 people. Israel attacked Hizbullah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, killing many civilians. Later in the year, over 70 people died in two days of Israeli-Palestinian clashes.<p>
<b>Carnage in Algeria </b>continued, as Islamist guerrillas battled the army, and both killed ordinary people. Voters approved a constitutional ban on parties based on religion.<p>
Iraq provoked <b>American missile strikes </b>by helping one group of Kurds against another. <p>
America moved 4,500 troops in <b>Saudi Arabia</b> to a new base after 19 servicemen were killed by a bomb in Dhahran. <p>
<b>Kofi Annan</b>, Ghanaian head of peacekeeping at the United Nations, will be the <font size=-1>UN</font>'s secretary-general after America vetoed another term for Boutros Boutros-Ghali.<p>
The civil wars in Rwanda and Burundi spilled over into <b>eastern Zaire</b>. Tutsi rebels established an enclave there, and 500,000 Hutu refugees went back to Rwanda.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
President Mandela inaugurated a new constitution for South Africa. Nigeria's General Sani Abacha permitted small steps towards a return to <b>democracy</b>. Somalia carried on fighting.<p>
<h2>A great comeback</h2>
<b>Bill Clinton</b> won a second term as president, the first Democrat to win two presidential elections since Franklin Roosevelt in 1936. Mr Clinton picked Madeleine Albright to replace Warren Christopher as secretary of state and William Cohen, a Republican, as defence secretary. The Whitewater investigations rumbled on.<p>
Mr Clinton ended the 61-year federal guarantee of <b>welfare payments</b>, replacing it with block grants to the states.<p>
The president signed the Helms-Burton law, allowing Americans to sue foreign investors in <b>Cuba</b>, but delayed its application, after protests from other countries. <p>
Latin America's move toward <b>market economics </b>stumbled on. Venezuela's ex-populist president bowed to the "Washington consensus". Ecuador's new populist president ate his campaign words even faster. Brazil saw some privatisations and congressional steps toward bigger ones. But in Mexico ruling-party activists rebelled against fresh sell-offs.<p>
Colombia endured an upsurge of killings by <b>guerrillas </b> and paramilitaries opposed to them. Peru's Shining Path and Tupac Amaru terrorists came vigorously to life again; Guatemala's agreed to peace. In Mexico a new left-wing armed movement emerged.<p>
<h2>Containing China</h2>
 <p>
East Asia saw its tensest <b>military confrontation</b> since the end of the cold war. China staged missile tests off Taiwan. America dispatched two aircraft carriers. Taiwan pressed on with its first democratic presidential election, which was won by Lee Teng-hui of the ruling Kuomintang. <p>
<b>Japan</b>'s Liberal Democratic Party staged a comeback. After three years ruling in coalition, the <font size=-1>LDP</font> did well enough in the election to form a government from its own ranks.<p>
An era ended in <b>South Korea</b> with the conviction of two of the country's former presidents on charges of corruption and treason.<p>
A corruption-tarnished Congress party lost power in <b>India</b>'s election. It was replaced by a United Front coalition of left-wing and regional parties, but Congress's economic reforms survived.<p>
For the second time, <b>Benazir Bhutto</b>, Pakistan's prime minister, was turned out of office by the president.<p>
China selected Tung Chee-hwa, a local businessman, to be<b> Hong Kong</b>'s first chief executive after it reverts to Chinese rule in July 1997.<p>
<b>Australians</b> elected a right-wing government. New Zealanders clipped their rightists' wings.<p>

<h2>On the defensive</h2>
 <p>
The reconstruction of <b>America's defence industry</b> reached a climax when Boeing announced its takeover of McDonnell Douglas-- which will make it the world's biggest aerospace group. Northrop Grumman bought Westinghouse's defence-electronics business and Lockheed Martin bought most of Loral. By contrast, Europe managed one joint venture, in missiles, between Matra and British Aerospace.<p>
<b>Asia's businessmen</b> worried about slower growth. A collapse in electronics exports hit Singapore and Taiwan. And in South Korea, a slowing economy forced conglomerates to cut back at home while pushing even harder overseas. The rising Asian star was the Philippines.<p>
Although a lower yen helped exports, record losses plagued <b>corporate Japan</b>. Sumitomo Corporation, a trading company, racked up the largest trading losses in the country's history, thanks to the activities of its head copper trader, who was accused of fraud.<p>
<b>Conglomerates </b>were out, focus was in. Lord Hanson, Britain's arch-predator of the 1980s, broke up his eponymous group. <b>Daimler-Benz</b> started dismantling the industrial empire it created in the 1980s and went back to cars and some aerospace, leaving Fokker, its Dutch subsidiary, to go bust.<p>
<b>Airline alliances </b>multiplied. Germany and America signed an "open skies" treaty freeing air traffic between the two, allowing United and Lufthansa to get together. British Airways, taxiing to a deal with American Airlines, is selling its stake in <font size=-1>US</font> Air. <p>
<b>America's tobacco industry</b> had a hard year. Its legal ramparts, impregnable for 40 years, were breached when a court awarded a man with lung cancer $750,000 damages against a cigarette maker. Bill Clinton warmed to a proposal to restrict sales and advertising on the ground that nicotine is a drug.<p>
<h2>Wired</h2>
 <p>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">table</a>)<br>A law opening America's <b>telecoms markets </b>brought mergers galore. Most notable was the $21 billion takeover of <font size=-1>MCI</font>, America's second-largest long-distance firm, by Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font>. In Europe, where liberalisation is due in 1998, progress was slower--though <b>Deutsche Telekom</b> was partially privatised. Japan pretended to split up <b>NTT</b>.<p>
<b>Microsoft</b> embraced the Internet, which had challenged the company's dominance of the computer-software industry. Microsoft's new Internet software threatened to dethrone Netscape, the Internet king of 1995.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Consolidation continued in <b>drugs and health care</b>. Ciba and Sandoz, two Swiss drug firms, merged to form the world's largest life-sciences company, Novartis. Aetna took over U.S. Healthcare to become America's biggest medical-benefits group. Trials of protease inhibitors, a new type of <b>drug for AIDS</b>, brought hope that the disease might be controllable.<p>
France bungled two privatisations. The sale of <b>Thomson</b>, a defence-electronics firm, fell apart after the privatisation committee said Thomson's multimedia unit should not be sold to a South Korean firm; that of <b>CIC</b>, a group of regional banks, failed when the committee said the bidding had been mismanaged.<p>
<b>Olivetti</b>, a computer maker once symbolising Italian flair, drifted towards disaster, shedding its long-time boss, Carlo De Benedetti, on the way.<p>
<h2>Courting couples</h2>
<b>Rogue-watchers </b>were busy. Deutsche Bank bailed out Morgan Grenfell Asset Management after a unit-trust manager breached investment rules. A manager at Jardine Fleming caused the Hong Kong-based merchant bank similar embarrassment.<p>
<b>Lloyd's of London</b> settled with its names, the once-rich investors who supply the insurance market's capital. The agreement will allow the market to pay for past losses while underwriting new risks.<p>
<b>In court</b>: Ian and Kevin Maxwell were acquitted in London of fraud; Australia's Alan Bond wasn't, and was jailed; the European Court of Human Rights decided Ernest Saunders, ex-Guinness, had an unfair trial in 1990; German prosecutors indicted Jose Ignacio Lopez, General Motors' defector to Volkswagen, for betraying company secrets; and Swiss banks were pressed to reveal their holdings of war-time loot.<p>
Two <b>banking mega-mergers</b> were sealed: Bank of Tokyo's marriage to Mitsubishi Bank, and Chase Manhattan's to Chemical. A big new one in the pipeline: NationsBank's $9 billion purchase of Boatmen's Bancshares.<p>
Consolidation continued in <b>global insurance</b>. Two of the biggest deals: Munich Re, the largest reinsurer, purchased American Re; and France's <font size=-1>AXA</font> merged with Union des Assurances de Paris.<p>
<h2>Bullish</h2>
(See <a href="bw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The rampant Dow set the tone for <b>stockmarkets </b>almost everywhere except Tokyo: the Nikkei rose only 1%.<p>
At the first pow-wow of trade ministers since the Uruguay round of <font size=-1>GATT</font>, the <b>World Trade Organisation</b> reached agreement in principle on scrapping tariffs on high-technology goods.<p>
<b>Oil prices </b>beat expectations. Brent crude rose from $18 a barrel in January to $25 in October, dipping later when the first exports of Iraqi crude for six years began after partial lifting of a <font size=-1>UN</font> embargo.<p>

<h1 align=center>Gentle giants</h1>


<p><b>Technology can create near-monopolies. That is sometimes a good thing</b></p><br>
MONOPOLIES are usually ugly. They tend to be fat and lazy. They tend to charge high prices for dull products. Yet the computer industry seems to say otherwise. Many computer firms have won 70% or more of their markets while remaining lean, mean and keen to innovate. The best known is Microsoft--a firm much investigated by America's antitrust authorities these days. However, as our series on other technological monopolies--technopolies--has shown (see <a href="$link 108.html page"></a>), plenty of other firms are comparably powerful within their markets yet attract hardly a word of complaint from trustbusters or even competitors: Cisco (which dominates the market for Internet routers), <font size=-1>IBM</font> (mainframe software), Intel (microprocessors) and Intuit (personal-finance software).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why are these technopolies so much nicer than your average monopoly? The answer is not, if anybody was naive enough to think so, that they have devoted themselves to the greater good of mankind. Nor is it their sunny disposition-- the motto of Intel's boss, Andy Grove, is: "Only the paranoid survive." Technopolies are neighbourly because it is in their interests to act that way. More important, they retain their market power because it is in the interests of other high-tech companies to let them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technology is about standards. To succeed with consumers, one firm's gadget often has to work with other gadgets from other firms. Technology moves so quickly that standards set by committees usually come too late. Instead, the industry organises itself around de facto standards championed by single firms with the clout to make them stick--as, for instance, Intel has done with microprocessors. By bringing order to an otherwise chaotic marketplace, the standard can serve as a foundation from which many firms can sell compatible products, strengthening the industry as a whole.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As long as the technopoly puts most of its effort into expanding the overall market (as Intel has with <font size=-1>PC</font>s), the rest of the industry is happy. And if a technopoly uses its dominance to charge too much, then its customers are quick to rebel. When <font size=-1>IBM</font> began to plunder the mainframe-software market in the mid-1980s, it only accelerated the move towards networked <font size=-1>PC</font>s; ever since the early 1990s, Big Blue has had to cut prices. One of the beauties of technology is that even a seemingly well-entrenched monopoly can be overthrown by a challenge from outside its market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where a technopoly's empire is not built on proprietary standards its ability to throw its weight around is even more limited. Both Cisco and Intuit gained an early lead in their markets by offering better products than their peers. The technology industry's propensity to coalesce around one winner has left both firms with enormous market shares and, in Cisco's case, a huge stockmarket valuation (it is worth as much as General Motors). However, their products are accepted as "standards" only in that most people who use Internet routers or financial software would rather stick with what they know than change to something else. Their position depends on their ability to out-innovate their peers.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Big, bad Bill is sweet William now</b></b><br>
If technopolies are such a good thing, why is Microsoft so unloved? Bill Gates's problem is that he has broken one of the cardinal rules of technopoly by using his power in one software market (operating systems) to push into others (such as word-processing and now the Internet). This was a good business decision, but it is surely right for trustbusters to keep an eye on how he colonises these areas. That said, Mr Gates has also provided the industry with a standard and he is still vulnerable to competition, just like other technopolists. If Microsoft either gouged its market (in fact, it has consistently lowered its prices) or failed to deliver a new technology quickly enough, it would lose its lofty perch. That, rather than Mr Gates's undoubtedly sweet nature, is what keeps Microsoft and its technopolistic peers so charming.<br>

<h1>The perils of complacency</h1>

<p><b>A combination of neglect and misuse seems to have made the word liberal almost meaningless. That is not just a pity, it is dangerous</b></p><br>
ONE of the rudest things you can call an American politician nowadays is a liberal. Bob Dole threw this insult at Bill Clinton so often during the presidential campaign that Mr Clinton, laughing at the idea that there might be anything in it, called the slur a "golden oldie". In the now-standard American usage, a liberal is the opposite of a conservative--and almost the same as what Europeans used to call a socialist, or possibly a social democrat. That is, someone who favours big government, lots of taxes and public spending; someone, in short, willing to infringe economic liberties in pursuit of the common good.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Europe, to the extent that "liberal" is used at all, it is more often an opposite of "socialist" than a synonym. A European liberal will favour limited government, and give freedom priority over the supposed interests of society. Historians would say this sense of the word has the prior claim. But today, even in Europe, people with such views would more often be called conservative. So it seems that in America "liberal" has become detached from its proper meaning and attached to the opposite, whereas in Europe it is merely falling out of common political parlance. Abuse, misuse and disuse: a sorry fate for such a word.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The confusion is by no means confined to everyday speech. In political philosophy, liberalism sometimes seems so broad a term as to exclude almost nothing--that is, to mean almost nothing. The philosopher Robert Nozick is a liberal, in the tradition that descends from Locke. Mr Nozick's view of the just society (as set out in "Anarchy, State and Utopia") calls for the minimal state: the demands of liberty are such that governments may legitimately carry out only the narrowest range of functions. But then the philosopher John Rawls is also a liberal, in a different tradition that runs through Bentham and Mill. His view, explained in "A Theory of Justice", calls for a large state, one of whose jobs is to decide the distribution of income among citizens.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Speaking loosely, Mr Nozick the liberal is well to the right of any mainstream conservative in Britain or America, and Mr Rawls the liberal (if he accepts the implications of his analysis) well to the left of any social democrat. If "liberal" imparts so little information even to those whose job it is to use such terms carefully, why worry about its corruption in popular parlance? Why not return to matters of substance?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Put aside whether the American or the European sense of liberal should prevail (the European sense is the better-rooted). There is a more important issue.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two apparently contradictory things are true. One is that, however much some may protest, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, John Major and Tony Blair, Robert Nozick and John Rawls, not to mention Locke, Bentham and Mill, are indeed all liberals, in a perfectly intelligible sense of the word. The second is that, even when defined so broadly as to accommodate all of these and more, "liberal" still means something important. To understand why it means something to be a liberal, even when membership of the club is flung indiscriminately wide, is to see why liberalism is worth not merely defining but also defending.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Freedom and its limits</b></b><br>
Despite the countless quarrels that liberals have had with each other over the past three centuries, certain core beliefs, clear in the writings of the earliest thinkers, have been central throughout. In different ways, almost all of these beliefs are concerned with protecting the status of the individual confronted with the demands of larger social groups. The liberal society, as it was first conceived, aims to guarantee freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom from coercion, freedom from illegitimate authority (ie, from unconstitutional government), freedom to buy and sell property (including one's own labour), and so on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Liberals have always recognised the need to set limits to the freedoms of individuals. But in describing how these limits should be devised, liberals only made their tendency to exalt the individual all the more apparent. The scope of freedom in a liberal society is given by the "harm principle", which in Mill's formulation says this:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.
 There must be curbs on the freedoms of individuals, the classical liberals conceded, but only to prevent those freedoms hurting others. Perhaps the individual is the best judge of his own interests, perhaps not; but, unless the well-being of others is jeopardised, he should be the judge. A crucial implication is that, if freedom is to be infringed, the burden of proof rests with the infringer. The individual does not have to prove that his actions harm nobody. The state that limits his freedom, if it is to act rightfully, has to prove the opposite.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is obvious that the harm principle formulated this way, or indeed in any plausible way, is open to many interpretations-- each supporting a different kind of liberalism. First and foremost, what does "harm to others" mean? My conspicuous consumption may offend people: should my visits to Bond Street and Rodeo Drive be curbed? My pornographic novel may corrupt them: should it be banned?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Every economic interaction among individuals has implications for third parties. Some such externalities (pollution, for instance) are relatively uncontroversial cases for regulation--that is, for liberty to be infringed. But a different kind of externality (called a pecuniary externality) is pervasive in economic life, as when I decide to buy something, and thereby force up (however fractionally) the price that others must pay. Attempting to curb "harms" of that kind would be inconsistent with the very idea of a market economy, an idea that all liberals are committed to.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider also what Mill meant by his stipulation of a "civilised community". Not, as you might suppose, that any society which failed to apply the harm principle must be uncivilised. His point was that only civilised people--mature and educated--could use liberty wisely. The principle did not apply to children. Power can be rightfully exercised over them, though not over adults, so long as it is for their own good, and regardless of whether third parties would otherwise be harmed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mill said the same was true of "barbarians" (a term which is harder to define than "children"). In other words, the full set of liberal rights was not granted to all people merely by virtue of their being people. Rather, it was extended to those who qualified by virtue of their ability to behave responsibly--that is, to members of civilised communities. From this idea springs the liberal passion for education and for equality of opportunity: only a civilised society, in this special sense, can be a liberal society. But the fact remains that, just as it is unclear exactly what liberals mean by "harms", it is also unclear under exactly what circumstances people qualify for liberal freedoms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Difficulties such as these are only the beginning. A larger, indeed inexhaustible, source of dispute is the fact that some liberal freedoms appear to be in conflict. For instance, if the state is to provide its citizens with freedom from coercion, it will need to exact some resources from them (policemen need to be paid). Even in Mr Nozick's liberal state the government must confiscate some property: one freedom is secured only at the expense of another.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More generally, a distinction is often drawn between two kinds of freedom: the negative kind, such as freedom from illegitimate authority, and the positive kind, such as freedom to lead a good life. The first (freedom from . . .) protects the individual from outside interference; the second (freedom to . . .) may often require it. Even liberals who favour a minimum night-watchman state regard it as the state's job to secure certain positive freedoms. Its role in protecting property rights, enforcing contracts, and so on, may all be seen in this light.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most classical liberals went further, arguing that the state should provide relief to the poor, and supply the services (notably education) needed if people are to play a full part in society. Such ambitions require larger takings from citizens. And some liberals went further still, defending an idea of distributive justice that requires transfers of income from rich to poor, not to relieve poverty but to achieve a "just" distribution of income (Mr Rawls's theory is a modern example). A case for the full-blown modern welfare state can be developed along similar lines. For each such regime, different schools of liberals have proposed different ways of establishing its legitimacy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given these complexities and uncertainties, each one creating a niche for a different kind of liberalism, it is hardly surprising that "liberal" is a term that stretches so widely. But what matters is whether the things that all liberals have in common are more important than the things they disagree about. If they are, then the term, however elastic, is serving some purpose.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A profusion of liberalisms</b></b><br>
If Bill Clinton, Robert Dole and (yes) Newt Gingrich are all liberals, the answer might seem quite the opposite. What divides them is surely bigger than what unites them: on the face of it, apart from being white American men, these politicians have little in common. To say this would be a mistake, however, and a revealing one. For all three share a belief in the liberal society as defined above: a society that provides constitutional government (rule by laws, not by men) and freedom of religion, thought, expression and economic interaction; a society in which infringements of individual liberty must be justified.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So what?" you might say. By that definition, everyone in the mainstream of American politics is a liberal. Quite so. America's system of government, for all its faults, is probably the most successful liberal-constitutional regime the world has seen. And virtually all other systems of government in the West, and the politicians within them, are liberal too, despite their competing policies. They are liberal because the systems embody, and the politicians share, those defining beliefs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this sense, despite the anger and bitterness they generate, the quarrels of western politics are arguments among friends. But this is not proof that "liberal" is too vague a term to be useful. Rather, it demonstrates the extraordinary triumph of liberalism in the West--a victory so total, in fact, that it brings perils of its own.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Joseph Nye, an American expert on international relations, once drew an analogy between security and oxygen. It serves here just as well. In the West, we have come to take fundamental liberal freedoms for granted--as we do with breathing. Normally, it is easy and even desirable to forget about breathing. But sometimes it becomes terribly obvious that breathing is necessary. When that happens, nothing else matters.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Two centuries ago, it was plain that what united liberals was more important than what divided them, because liberals were opposed to many aspects of the ruling order. All denounced autocratic rule, religious intolerance and political power by inheritance. In the West these battles have been won so decisively that no serious politician any longer questions--even thinks about--such fundamental preferences. But here lies the danger: the liberal triumph has encouraged a kind of complacency, a corroding intellectual laziness, in the West's politics. It takes a variety of forms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For instance, so secure does the West feel in its liberal freedoms that its politicians feel able to look indulgently on countries in other parts of the world where rulers still deny their people such liberty. Several East Asian economies have startled the world with their economic progress in recent years, but in some cases their governments have failed to enact the full range of liberal rights. Some of these rulers defend this as a matter of policy: they argue that liberal freedoms are not for their people, saying that Asian values and western licence do not mix. This is listened to politely, even sympathetically, in the West.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If their own liberal freedoms were less securely entrenched, western sympathisers would need to temper this indulgence. Otherwise it might be seen as support for new restrictions on freedoms at home. (The sympathisers would appear to be asking why, if Singapore can do so well without a free press, Britain or America should need one.) Precisely because those liberties are taken for granted in the West, nobody need fear being so accused. But that also means there is no need to rehearse the arguments that helped to entrench the liberties in the first place--and nobody need be reminded that those arguments apply to Asians every bit as much as to Europeans and Americans. In short, we may be liberals, but we seem to be forgetting why.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The poverty of anti-liberalism</b></b><br>
Not content merely to neglect the arguments for liberalism, other western thinkers, such as Alasdair MacIntyre in America and John Gray in Britain, these days go much further, and pronounce grandly on the failure of "the liberal project". Western rationalism has smashed traditional modes of thinking, they argue, and the result is disastrous: incipient moral collapse. Again, what licenses intellectual anti-liberals to embark on such a critique is the very fact that liberalism seems so secure.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just 60 years ago in Western Europe, and a mere ten years ago in Europe east of the iron curtain, any thinker who declared liberalism a failure would have been understood as proposing a radical alternative--such as fascism or Soviet-style communism. In one way, that was a good thing: it helped concentrate minds on the virtues of a liberal order. Today, few in the West can even imagine desiring any such alternative. So announcing the failure of liberalism arouses no fears, and elicits no urgent reflection on what life is like in an illiberal regime. ("Obviously, when I say that liberalism has failed and morality is collapsing, I don't mean that we should repudiate our civil liberties, tear up the constitution and install an authoritarian regime." No, quite, of course not. But then, what <i>do</i> you mean?)<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet another form of modern, house-trained anti-liberalism is emerging from what used to be the socialist left. For several decades, the increasingly apparent failure of communism sapped this movement's animating spirit. Then, when communism collapsed altogether, the jolt was such that even leftist politicians who had never been communists had to rethink their ideas. Popular opinion has turned against planning, exaggerated concern with economic equality, grandiose schemes of public spending and the grandiose taxes needed to pay for them. The left must therefore shift its ground accordingly. Now deprived of its economic distinctiveness, it is seeking a big new idea to mark out its territory.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such idea is to question the naive liberalism, as the left would call it, of the political right. A favourite theme is to deplore the classical-liberal emphasis on self-interest. This is worth a moment's pause. The notion is especially popular just now in Britain, where Tony Blair's Labour Party is trying to shape a new post-socialist political vision. The liberalism of the political right, says Mr Blair, puts the individual too much at the centre; it glorifies selfishness and naked competition; it allows too small a role, if any, for altruism or the common good. Margaret Thatcher and Adam Smith were wrong: there is such a thing as society.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By all means let there be a vigorous argument between liberals who want to promote new forms of social co-operation and liberals who do not. That, in itself, would be fine. But it will be a great pity if ex-socialists come to rest their case solely on a repudiation of liberal self-interest--because that argument can succeed only if people forget what liberals actually mean by self-interest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Adam Smith was no 18th-century precursor of Gordon Gekko, pronouncing "Greed is good." To say that individual self-interest promotes collective welfare is not to glorify selfishness, but merely to explain how a market economy can work. And, by the way, Margaret Thatcher was quoted out of context. When she said, "There is no such thing as society," she was replying to a questioner who had argued that society should bear the cost of some new initiative. Mrs Thatcher was merely pointing out that individual taxpayers, not some disembodied "society", would still have to pay. No liberal--indeed, nobody with an ounce of sense--ever denied that man is a social animal, and that social virtues such as trustworthiness and a willingness to co-operate are essential to man's well-being. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When classical liberals praised self-interest, it was not to contrast it with altruism or virtuous self-sacrifice, but to recommend it in preference to blind habit and irrational passion (such as racial or religious bigotry). Implicitly, self-interest always meant enlightened self-interest. As Hobbes, a "pre-liberal", argued, if men had always been rational pursuers of self-interest, history would not have been an endless tale of savagery and mayhem. For the classical liberals, moreover, the idea of self-interest had a crucial moral component, always neglected by modern anti-liberals. To recommend self-interest as a guide to behaviour is to acknowledge that no individual's interests have priority over another's. What goes for you goes for everyone. That claim, in turn, is the cornerstone of the case for constitutional government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tacit approval of illiberal regimes abroad, grandly paradoxical denunciations of liberalism at home, casual attacks on liberal virtues--none of these may pose an immediate threat to our liberal freedoms. The West's modern anti-liberals, softies by comparison with their predecessors, have no such agenda. Indeed, they are nearly all liberals like the rest of us, if only they would admit it. Yet, unalarming as they may be, they are still to be opposed. Their arguments help people to forget why liberal freedoms matter. That is a pity in itself, and it eases the way for any bolder followers who may come along.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the West, by and large, we are all liberals now. Instead of ignoring or affecting to deplore this, we should be recognising and reaffirming it. Or else, you never know, it might one day no longer be true.<br>

<h1>And a wary Christmas to you</h1>

<p><b>Can the Net save you from joyless Christmas-shopping treks through dank streets and chaotic malls? We asked our resident geek to find out. His reply came through gritted teeth</b></p><br>
LIKE other computer journalists, I have written my share of stories about how Internet shopping will revolutionise the retail trade. On the Net, I usually explain, anyone--department store or corner grocery-- can set up an on-line shopfront, and reach the world. The overheads are tiny: just an Internet connection and a computer to tend the store. Here is a whole new dimension to shopping, with far more information than any salesman or shelf display can provide. There was, though, one nagging irony in all this punditry: I had never actually bought anything on-line, and virtually nobody I know had, either.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sure, I had tried demonstrations of futuristic "electronic cash" schemes, paying for a report or two with fake cyberbucks. I had even spent real money a few times for subscriptions to on-line newspapers and their woollier cousins, the "e-zines". But I had never bought a physical thing, something that would show up at my door in a cardboard box, or an envelope. For all the Internet's potential to reshape the world of commerce, I had not even come close to matching on-line what I routinely do with a telephone or a stamp.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few years ago it was easy to explain this away by pointing to the embryonic state of the on-line industry. It was easy for hackers to steal a credit-card number. There were not many big stores on-line, anyway. These days, those excuses look thin. Any glance at an Internet directory reveals thousands of wired stores, including most of the famous real-world ones. Indeed, it is rare to find an advertisement these days that does not point to some Web site. And most on-line stores that accept credit cards over the Net use software that allows a Web browser to send them in an encrypted code, which is practically unbreakable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, nobody I knew bought anything on-line. Why not? The only way to find out was to try, and try big. I would do my Christmas shopping on the Net this year. Whatever happened, it was bound to be better than the usual sweaty rush around a blur of identically random malls and department stores. Or so I thought.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Which way do I turn, please?</b></b><br>
I start with the usual gift list. Clothes for a sister, <font size=-1>CD</font>s for a brother-in-law, and so on. I turn to my <font size=-1>PC</font>, fire up a Web browser, and dial in. This is when I discover the first problem with Internet shopping. I have no idea where to do it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I try the closest thing the Internet has to a subject index: Yahoo (<a href="http://www.yahoo.com">www.yahoo.com</a>). Alas, "shopping" is not listed on the front screen, but, after typing it into the search box, I am gratified to see some responses. More than 500 listings later, I realise I need to be more specific. I am also irritated by the time it takes for the stuff to trickle down the telephone line. My old modem makes each a minute-long ordeal. Perhaps the first thing to buy is a new modem.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Typing in "modem" seems to bring up only manufacturers, so I decide to go to an on-line mall. The word "mall" turns up another stream of listings, about half of them simply advertisements for real malls. When I finally find the on-line malls, more than 600 are listed, 23 starting with "cyber" alone: Cyber Home, CyberShopper, CyberShop, CyberShoppe, Cyber Park, CyberWorld . . . Eyes glazing, I scroll down until I happen to spot <font size=-1>ISN</font>, the Internet Shopping Network (<a href="http://www.isn.com">www.isn.com</a>), which, as I recall, was bought by cable television's Home Shopping Network a few years ago. Cubic zirconia rings are a risk, but Yahoo says it specialises in computer gear.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ISN</font> was one of the first sites to suggest the nearly infinite opportunities that fired the hype about Internet shopping. It offered not only product pictures but links to reviews in trade magazines. Apparently, this does not extend as far as modems. <font size=-1>ISN</font> lists about 300 of them--but most had only a price; no linked reviews are in sight.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, I decide to buy one I have heard good things about. At last, my first purchase. Great. I click on "add to shopping basket". My browser (I am using America Online's at the moment) reports that the document does not exist. This strikes me as unlikely, since it would be a relatively high priority of a shopping service to keep a till open. I switch to another Internet access provider, and navigate into <font size=-1>ISN</font> again using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This time it works fine, and over in America <font size=-1>ISN</font> confirms that I have selected a modem to purchase. Or rather, four of them. Hmmm. I reset it to one, then click on "buy". <font size=-1>ISN</font> asks me to join its shopping club first. I plough my way through the application form, typing in my name and address, until I get to "state", which is tough as I live in London. I muse about this for a moment until I see a note at the bottom about international ordering. I click. Oh. <font size=-1>ISN</font> will not sell outside the United States. "We are working to develop an international shipping policy and procedure. However, until this is completed, all orders placed by international customers with international credit cards and/or addresses will be cancelled." So much for the much-vaunted global reach of the Internet.<br>
</p><p><b><b>The mouse is tiring</b></b><br>
Start again. This time, I go through Yahoo's regional listings. I try the European Shopping Centre (<a href="http://www.euroshops.co.uk">www.euroshops.co.uk</a>): lots of clothes, but no computer stores. Then the London Mall (<a href="http://www.londonmall.co.uk">www.londonmall.co.uk</a>), which has mobile telephone and Psion gear, but no <font size=-1>PC</font> hardware. I decide to try MarketNet (<a href="http://mkn.co.uk">mkn.co.uk</a>): again, a random assortment of stores, but not, I fear, a computer one. The <font size=-1>UK</font> Shopping Centre (<a href="http://www.ukshops.co.uk:8000">www.ukshops.co.uk:8000</a>) has a software store (by now I have given up on a modem and will settle for anything for my <font size=-1>PC</font>, even a game). Its virtual storefront turns out to be a listing of products in alphabetical order-- and it stops at N.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few stores later, I realise why each seems to have an arbitrary selection of a few <font size=-1>PC</font>s, a monitor or two, and some software, at prices that are no lower than those of a dusty little high-street dealer. They actually are dusty little high-street dealers, but with some tenner-a-month space on someone's Web site. Each takes about six mouse clicks (and, with my slow modem, about three minutes) to reveal the bareness of the shelves that I would have spotted through the real-world window. Perhaps it is time to go back to America, and see if I can find a firm willing to ship overseas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I try another index service, Excite (<a href="http://www.excite.com">www.excite.com</a>), which claims to have reviews of its sites. It does, of sorts. But it has only a fraction of Yahoo's listings, and the "reviews" are simply two-sentence descriptions of the site, giving up to four stars. I back out when I see that a site which simply lists the telephone number and address of a Greek jewellery shop gets two stars. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, I try a few more computer shops I find there. The first four turn me off by taking international orders only with a bank wire transfer, but eventually I stumble on NetBuyer (<a href="http://www.netbuyer.com">www.netbuyer.com</a>), which serves as a broker for several computer mail-order companies and is the on-line side of <i>Computer Shopper</i> magazine. It has a slick interface and provides technical comparisons between products. I am so pleased that I overlook the fact that it lists only one vendor for each product (no doubt at the insistence of its clients), making price comparisons impossible. I place the order, and get a confirmation. Time elapsed since I started: about four hours.<br>
</p><p><b><b>So, down to business</b></b><br>
Emboldened by this apparent success, I dive into my real Christmas list, starting with the <font size=-1>CD</font> for my brother-in-law. On Yahoo, I notice a link to a site where Andersen Consulting is demonstrating Bargain Finder (<a href="http://bf.cstar.ac.com/bf/">bf.cstar.ac.com/bf/</a>), an experimental "electronic agent" that shops at various on-line music stores to find the best price for a <font size=-1>CD</font>. I ask for The Cure's "Mixed Up". After a minute or so, it comes back with the results: three of the biggest stores had blocked its agent (presumably because they are not keen to be forced into a price war), but three others had responded. Prices range from $10.54 to $13.98. I pick out the cheapest, <font size=-1>GEMM</font> (<a href="http://www.gemm.com">www.gemm.com</a>), which turns out to be another sort of agent, in this case a broker. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Searching <font size=-1>GEMM</font>'s site, I find someone selling the <font size=-1>CD</font> for even less, $9.98, which makes me wonder a bit about the efficiency of Andersen's agent. Shipping costs $7 outside the United States, and it would go by regular post, which could take weeks, but even then it would be cheaper than buying it from a British retailer. I am just about to enter my credit-card number when I check my browser's status bar. Despite the site's promise of "secure ordering", it is not encrypting the transmission. I get a queasy feeling, and back out.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, agents sound like just what I need to help me through the digital maze. I have heard raves about Firefly, a site set up by Agents Inc (<a href="http://www.ffly.com">www.ffly.com</a>), which is designed to help you find music you might like as well as order it. It turns out to be the best thing I have found on-line for months. It asks me to type in a few of my favourite bands, then to rate some other bands it displays: Bryan Adams: "hate it"; Sex Pistols: "great stuff". After a few more lists, it is dead on, suggesting most of the other bands I like, as well as (and this is the useful bit) throwing in some bands I don't know but are recommended by people who tend to like the stuff I like. Click on any band name and you get a biography, discography, reviews from other visitors, reviews from the music press, links to Web sites on the band, and a place to order the music. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I realise that I have fallen into the trap of shopping for myself again, so I stop playing around and pick a <font size=-1>CD</font> I think my brother-in-law might want. The store will ship it abroad, but that will cost $15, which is more than the <font size=-1>CD</font> itself. I decide that the local record shop is looking better by the minute, and move on to clothes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At this point, my standards have fallen to the point where anything actually ordered on-line will suffice: my sister will be impressed by the novelty factor alone. J.C. Penney, a big American retailer, is advertising its site a lot on-line, so I click on one of the ads that pop up while surfing elsewhere and go to www.jcpenney.com. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like most big stores, J.C. Penney is offering only a tiny sample of its wares on-line, with no more information than their catalogue listing. (Why is this? Surely the whole point of Web sites is that they can show you more than mere paper.) Since I am still stuck with my slow modem, I have turned pictures off to speed the downloads. But the J.C. Penney site consists mostly of a column of pictures, with no text. Since the pictures' file names give no clue to their contents, I have to spend three minutes downloading them all to know that they carry nothing I would want to buy. Other parts of the site do not work at all. To add insult to injury, the fine print, several layers in, reveals that the company does not sell abroad ("We are still developing our domestic market").<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Someone mentions Lands' End, another catalogue retailer with a line that my sister might actually wear. Its site is faster, but no bigger than J.C. Penney's, and with no explanation for the relatively bare virtual shelves. What is there looks reasonable, except that the pictures are about two inches high, and scanned at low resolution. I decide I would be better off buying clothes from across a room, and bolt back across the Atlantic. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the British stores I try are worse. Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, John Lewis and J. Sainsbury are on-line, but only two are actually selling anything--and that is only wine and chocolates. I decide to order two bottles of champagne from Sainsbury's, but see a note at the bottom which says orders must be in multiples of 12. I place the order for two anyway--and hope.<br>
</p><p><b><b>At last! he cried</b></b><br>
Now getting slightly desperate, I surf randomly until I stumble on British Telecom's on-line shop (<a href="http://www.btshop.bt.com">www.btshop.bt.com</a>), which reminds me that my sister-in-law needs a new answering machine. <font size=-1>BT</font> has a reasonable one for &#163;29 ($48.72), so I place the order with my credit card, which goes smoothly until the last step, where it confirms the order and displays an electronic receipt--"Sub-total: &#163;569000.43; delivery charge: &#163;3.99". I really hope that is wrong.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few days later, a box from <font size=-1>BT</font> shows up with the right machine, and by separate post a letter from <font size=-1>BT</font>. The good news is that it is not a bill for half a million pounds; the bad news is that it is still a bill. Despite having been given my credit-card number on the site, <font size=-1>BT</font> has sent me a demand for &#163;33. I call the customer-service desk. The lady gets a bit lost when I mention the Web site, then goes off to find a supervisor. She returns to say someone will call me back. The next day, a manager leaves a message: "The system is a bit slow in putting debits against credits." Apparently, the credit-card checking process is still done by someone over the telephone, giving the billing system time to sneak in and claim my order. Ignore the bill, I am instructed. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I see a very grim Christmas coming if I do not buy something else, soon. With eyes smarting and repetitive stress injury looming, I find the idea of tromping through real-world malls now positively blissful compared with another minute on the Web. Before I disconnect for the last time, a colleague suggests that I give books a shot. A store called Amazon (<a href="http://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a>) is the toast of cyberspace these days. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I become a believer in Internet commerce again. Amazon offers a million books from around the world, including hard-to-find and special-order ones. You can search by title, by author, or by fragments of each. Visitors are invited to post their own reviews. You can order a book with gift wrapping (from a choice of papers) and with a card, delivered straight to the lucky gift-getter. The prices are at least 10% less than retail and often even better. And shipping is even a reasonable $13 for 14-day delivery to Britain. Scrambling for my credit card, I order a stack of Beatrix Potter books. Even with wrapping paper, card and shipping, the total is still less than I might pay at my local bookshop. Maybe the preceding week of on-line hell had been an aberration, and this really was the future. Perhaps my original journalistic optimism had not been so naive after all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three weeks pass. The books, the modem and the champagne have still not arrived. Amazon has sent an e-mail saying it has shipped the order, but no word from the others. I will give them another week before I slink out into the real world to do my shopping all over again. Galling as it may be, I am secretly looking forward to rediscovering the little pleasures of pre-electronic shopping: holding things in my hands, trying them on, and even taking them home with me after I have paid.<br>

<h1>Bad, but not that bad</h1>

INTERNET shopping is a mess, but perhaps not for the reasons you think. Here are two frequently-heard fallacies:<br>
<li> The Net is unsafe. Alas, this is only half wrong. By and large, the least of the problems with shopping on-line is the risk that hackers may intercept your messages and steal your credit-card details. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To get the same information that we happily give any shop assistant, a hacker would have to comb through all the trillions of bytes of Internet transmissions looking for strings of characters that look like credit card numbers. Even then, they would probably fail: most of the larger online retailers operate their Web sites from "secure servers" which tell the browser to scramble all information before sending it. Breaking such codes is a matter for supercomputers and weeks of effort--hardly worth it for a credit card with a spending limit of $3,000.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But fraud remains a more serious worry. In the real world, when you walk into a store you usually get what you pay for on the spot--and the size of the store or its name gives you an idea of whether it will be there next week if something goes wrong. On the Internet, two teenagers in a bedroom can set up a site that looks every bit as professional as those of the biggest retailers. They can scan a store's worth of merchandise out of some catalogue, and make up a grand name--"The Computer Megaplex". Getting listed by the big indexing sites like Yahoo is as easy as asking. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Endowed with such instant credibility, the site's owners simply wait for the punters to show up: the choice of whether to run a legitimate business or simply to keep the storefront up long enough to collect a stack of credit card numbers is a matter of morals, not practicality. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a few years, a system for authenticating merchants will become widespread, but until then the best bet is to stick with real-world names you know (but type carefully: for a while www.micr0soft.com --with a zero-- was actually an anti-Microsoft site). <br>
<li> The Net is waiting for "digital cash". Much of the publicity about electronic commerce has focused on efforts to develop a new currency and payment system, tailored for the Internet. The idea is appealing: "e-cash" could be used anywhere and would not even require a bank account. But clever as such digital cash schemes may be, none has won much support yet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This lack is less of a barrier than one might suppose. The real advantage of e-cash schemes is that they allow "microtransactions": sales of a few cents or fractions of a cent--far too little to process efficiently with credit cards. Someday we may pay for information this way (pay-per-view news, for example), but for hard goods, this smacks of overkill. Credit cards work fine for purchases above $10 or so, and they are every bit as international as digital cash hopes to be.<br>

<h1>The coming global tongue</h1>

<p><b>It is, says Jacques Chirac, a "major risk for humanity". AIDS? The bomb? Over-eating? No: what frightens the president of France is what the Internet may do to language, not least his own country's language</b></p><br>
THE spectre haunting the president of France is not new. In 1898, when Otto von Bismarck was an old man, a journalist asked him what he saw as the decisive factor in modern history. He replied: "The fact that the North Americans speak English." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This Bismarckian alarm, says Geoffrey Nunberg, of Stanford University in California, now has a new significance. For the electronic media that bind the world together are essentially carriers of language. To work efficiently, they need a common standard. The personal computer (<font size=-1>PC</font>) has one: Microsoft's operating system, Windows. The Internet has another: <font size=-1>TCP/IP</font>, its Esperanto or transmission protocol, which allows computers anywhere in the world to hook into it, whether they are <font size=-1>PC</font>s or rival Apple Macs. The English language is now the operating standard for global communication.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, electronic communications have affected, and will continue to affect, language in three distinct ways. First, they change the way language is used. Secondly, they have created a need for a global language--and English will fill that slot. Third, they will influence the future of other languages which people will (perhaps perversely) continue to speak.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Start with the simplest sort of change: the way English is used in electronic converse. The language of electronic chat is splattered with abbreviations that make it not just faster to type but also impenetrable to the novice. Plenty of activities have vocabularies of their own, badges of identity for the cognoscenti: think of motoring enthusiasts. So, too, with electronics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technology is, after all, fertile ground for vocabulary. Technology and science, including medicine, together account for 50-60% of the new words in the addenda pages of "Webster's Third New International Dictionary", according to Frederick Mish, editor-in-chief of its publishing company. The test of cyberjargon will be its durability. Mr Mish is mulling over the inclusion of "Internet", "browser", "newsgroup" and "World Wide Web" for the 1997 "Collegiate Dictionary", which changes more often than the main volume. He says sternly: "We want to look at a new word for three to five years before considering it for publication." In the instant world of cyberspace, that is eternity. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not only is the vocabulary of electronic communication different from ordinary English; so is the way in which it is used. In his magisterial "Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language", David Crystal argues that broadcasting has already created some novel language forms. One is for sports: "Because commentary is an oral reporting of ongoing activity, it is unlike other kinds of narrative (which are typically reported in past time)." Indeed, it is unlike any other kind of speech. A radio commentary is a particularly odd creature. Charles Ferguson, an American linguist, describes it as "a monologue . . . directed at an unknown, unseen, heterogenous mass audience who voluntarily choose to listen, do not see the activity being reported, and provide no feedback to the speaker".<br>
</p><p><b><b>Weirder yet and weirder</b></b><br>
Other kinds of speech have been created by electronic communications. The answering machine, or voice-mail, has prompted new versions of the monologue (and one, to judge by the messages that most people leave, which most of us do not much enjoy delivering). The telephone itself made common something that had previously been a rarity: a conversation with somebody you cannot see. Like talking in the dark, it encourages speakers to confide. For the listener, concentration on the voice alone, stripped of misleading body language, can be far more telling than a face-to-face conversation. One study found that it was easier to detect when a person was lying in a telephone call than either in a video call or face-to-face.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Electronic mail has created another novelty: the written conversation. Charles Evans of Chyden.Net, a company based in Virginia which retails software electronically around the world, describes the style: "There's no social pressure to avoid the broken sentence. The key word is 'bandwidth'--which implies that the Internet will collapse if you use flowery language, but really just means 'Get to the point.' " Hence the staccato style of much electronic exchange: "The five-word sentence doesn't rattle on the screen as much as it does on paper." And getting it right first time is less important than in a letter or a fax: "The cost of clarifying later is low."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A written conversation has one great advantage over the spoken word: writers can refine their words before "speaking" them. But it also lacks a key quality of speech: the tone of voice that conveys emotion. In electronic mail, says Mr Evans, "I find we all have a tendency to apologise for the fact that we can't see the other person's expression or hear their tone of voice. You wouldn't do that in a letter. It's because we're thinking of it as a conversation."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At one point, some users solved this problem with the "smiley", a use of punctuation to express delight by :-) and sorrow by :-(. Other symbols represent other basic responses. True cyberians now dismiss such typographical fancies. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Being <i>pass&eacute; </i>on the Internet is a hideous offence, as socially ghastly as speaking with the wrong accent at the Ritz. To help the <i>parvenu</i> (or "newbie") avoid "flaming"--insults and attack--a whole collection of books offer advice on "netiquette". So vast has the industry become that anthropologists such as Steve Mizrach, of the University of Florida College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, are writing theses on the "sociolinguistics of electronic mail", exploring the proposition that "social power is linguistic power in virtual communities." Or, to put it another way, if you write clearly, people will take more notice of what you say--even in cyberspace.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To foster such clarity <i>Wired</i>, a magazine much read by the <i>digerati</i>, recently produced its own style guide, grandly called "Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age". It is rather odd, therefore, that the guide seems notably uninterested in being comprehensible to those whose first language is not English--or, indeed, to some of us who had thought that English was our mother tongue. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For example, in a chapter called "Screw the Rules", the <i>Wired</i> guide offers this exemplary gem from its pages:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On August 17, Mike Nelson, the government's point person on encryption, stepped up to the podium at a workshop . . . and proceeded to blow smoke up the ass of more than 100 crypto wonks.
Constance Hale, the guide's editor, explains: "I would be very cautious about accessibility being our first requirement, because it seems to me that you then wash out some of the most lively language." <br>
</p><p><b><b>A new Latin</b></b><br>
But in spite of the best efforts of the geeks to give English "freedom from the shackles of grammar" (as the <i>Wired</i> press release promises), the development of the Internet will be one more fillip to the development of English as a world language. Mr Crystal, whose book on English as a global language will soon be published by Cambridge University Press, argues that something unprecedented is occurring. "There has never been a language spoken by so many people in so many places" as English, he says. The result will soon be something even more extraordinary: a language spoken by more people as a second tongue than a first. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, the United States contains four times as many English mother-tongue speakers as any other country. Britain is next. Between them, these two have 70% of the 320m people whose first language is English. That number excludes another 57m who speak creole, or creolised English, in countries such as the Gambia, Liberia and Jamaica. But far more rapid growth is taking place in the number of people who speak English as a subsidiary language. Within a decade, their numbers will exceed the number of mother-tongue speakers. Peter Strevens, a Cambridge don who wrote about the rise of world English, predicted a time when "English will be taught mostly by non-native speakers of the language, to non-native speakers, in order to communicate mainly with non-native speakers."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is an extraordinary state of affairs. Carl Mills, professor of English at the University of Cincinnati, says nervously: "It will be the first time in the history of the world that the language is not ours any more. If a language is no longer the property of its native speakers, it will change, and it's not clear what the consequences will be." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The change, Mr Crystal points out, has occurred only since the 1960s. But the foundations of the growth of English as a world language were laid earlier, with Britain's expansion as a world power, peaking towards the end of the 19th century, and the emergence of the United States as the leading power of the 20th century. America's commercial dominance has, in the latter years of the century, been built partly on products that incorporate the English language. It is easily the world's biggest exporter of intellectual property--ranging from the conventionally intellectual, such as Miller and Mailer, through the less conventional Madonna, to digital Microsoft.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the 1950s, the number of countries in the world has tripled. Most newly independent countries have given English a special role, making it the dominant or official language in over 60 countries. Of course, the English is not always of the queen's variety. "Don't leave your values in the trolley," exhorts a sticker in a Hong Kong supermarket. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, Mr Crystal lists 75 countries where, on a rather broader definition, English is "routinely in evidence, publicly accessible in varying degrees, and part of the nation's recent or present identity." Their combined population would now be two billion--more than a third of the world's population--routinely exposed, at least in theory, to the English language. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His list includes none of the countries of continental Europe, where learning English has become as much the proper prelude to a professional career as learning to play the piano was for a Jane Austen heroine. Bernabe Feria of Berlitz International, the world's largest language school, says that 70% of the 5m lessons that Berlitz gives each year are for English, compared with between 5% and 7% for French and slightly fewer for Spanish. In Europe, French is the second most popular language; in the United States, Spanish; in Asia, Japanese. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Winner take all</b></b><br>
The demand to learn English may be only in its infancy. For a growing share of world trade will be goods and services that incorporate language--maybe just on the packaging or in the instruction leaflet, but also in the form of entertainment and information. Standardising on English is a safety measure (which is why it is virtually the universal language of air-traffic control); but it also makes communications easier and cheaper. Like falling telephone tariffs and lower transport costs, it will create a virtuous circle: communication becomes less expensive, so more of it occurs.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of it will be between computers. Already 80% of the information stored in the world's computers is in English. On the Internet, English is dominant, although exactly how dominant is hard to quantify. Mr Crystal has tried searching for a variety of words for one thing--"orchestra", say--in different languages. The research suggests that, for scientific subjects, almost all material on the Internet is in English; in all, the proportion is around 70-80%. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the understandable upshot of the fact that most Internet hosts and users are in the United States. "The proportion of native English-speakers on the Internet is dropping very rapidly," Stanford's Mr Nunberg points out. People are finding ways to overcome the difficulty of sending and receiving accented characters--Norwegians, for instance, have standardised on using OO as a substitute for their character O/--and non-Roman characters. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The big question is: as the proportion of Internet users who are not native English-speakers rises, will they make disproportionate use of English? If so, then the Internet will further drive the spread of the English language, and perhaps incidentally create a large new category of users: those who can write the language colloquially, but not necessarily speak it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What might hinder the spread? One obstacle could be the emergence of some other potentially global language. But even Spanish, which Mr Crystal reckons is the world's fastest-growing language, is still used by far fewer people than English. The lead that English has already established is probably too great to be challenged. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another possibility is machine translation. If it were reliable, then English as a world language would not be needed. Geoffrey Kingscott, editor of <i>Language International</i>, a magazine for translators and other language professionals, argues that the problem is the ambiguity of much language. He cites a sign at London's Heathrow Airport: "No electric passenger carrying vehicles beyond this point."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Machine translation may be better than nothing, but it calls for a highly restricted use of language, with limited use of subordinate clauses and no word used with more than one meaning--for instance, "replace" must always mean either "put back" or "substitute" but not both. Such rigour may be too much to ask of most native-speaking writers of electronic mail, and certainly the contributors to <i>Wired</i>. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without a serious competitor, linguistic or mechanical, English may now be impregnably established as the world standard language: an intrinsic part of the global communications revolution. If so, what are the consequences for other languages--and for their users?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far as the Internet is concerned, its main impact is likely to be to protect subsidiary languages, rather than to kill them. In that sense, it is unlike radio and television. For one thing, the limitless space on the Internet means that languages do not compete in the head-on way they do in other media. A Danish rock festival can advertise itself on the World Wide Web in English, German and Swedish--but it can also tout its wares in Danish. Moreover, languages with few speakers may gain in other ways, says Stanford's Mr Nunberg:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In half an hour's wandering around the Net the other day I found discussion groups in more than 60 languages, at which point I stopped counting. The Italians were talking about . . . elections, as they always are. The French people were exchanging dirty jokes. The Indonesians as best I could tell were arguing over whether the movie "True Lies" was anti-Islam or merely stupid . . . If you give people the chance, they are less interested in turning the Net into a world forum than a backyard fence.
On his cyber-wanderings, Mr Nunberg also discovered that discussions were going on in Aragonese, Armenian, Basque, Breton, Cambodian, Catalan, Esperanto, Estonian, Gaelic, Galician, Hindi, Hmong, Macedonian, Swahili, Welsh and Yoruba--and so on and on. The Internet may be just the thing for people separated from their esoteric and exotic linguistic roots.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, increasingly, people will have two languages: one for doing the shopping and talking to their friends, the other for communicating with the formal world. That language will be English. As Robert Frank and Philip Cook argue in "The Winner-Take-All Society", published in 1995 by the Free Press, that will give the English-speaking countries an advantage in attracting and keeping the world's professionals. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will be true not only for the United States and Britain, but for developing countries too. The Philippines, one of the largest English-speaking (or, rather, American-speaking) countries, hopes to exploit that advantage, together with high literacy and a deregulated telephone service, to become a media centre. India and Jamaica both use their familiarity with English to sell data-processing services to rich countries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who are lucky enough to grow up speaking English will have a career advantage in big multinational companies. Provided, that is, the future non-native speakers of English can understand them. <br>

<h1>The Geekicon</h1>

UNLIKE the reference monoliths that respond to changes in English the way an elephant flinches from gnats, the "Hacker's Dictionary" or "Jargon File" is an electronic compendium as fluid and variable as the language it records. It has many authors and sits in many editions on different Internet sites. The latest issue contains over 2,000 entries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many are computer-geek slang from the 1970s or earlier, and many are rarely used logical puns, of which geeks are fond, on the illogicality of English. (The plural of "mongoose", states the dictionary, is widely agreed to be "polygoose".) A few, though, are terms that have made their way to the wider Net community and even the outside world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netlish is an ad hoc sort of tongue, creating words and spellings as the need arises (<i>adhockery</i> itself, now used for all sorts of arbitrariness, may have originated as a programmer's term for random problem-fixing attempts).<i> Software </i> is familiar even beyond Net-users--but, on the Net, much software is freely distributed in forms such as <i>freeware </i>(no cost), <i>shareware </i>(appeals to your conscience to send a fee), <i>careware </i>(the fee is a donation to charity), <i>postcardware </i>(send a postcard to the programmer), and others. People, in contrast to computers (<i>hardware</i>), may pejoratively be referred to as <i>wetware</i>. Another Netlish effect is to cross-breed languages: Italian hackers, says the dictionary, have invented <i>scrollare </i>and <i>deletare </i>in place of the Italian words for "scroll" and "delete".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Abbreviations in e-mail (no one now says "electronic" mail) are also a favourite. Their original purpose, speed, has been supplanted: it is the convention that matters. A contentious statement may be prefixed by <font size=-1>IMHO</font>, <i>in my humble opinion</i>. Often this is ironic, since no humility is intended; some users dispense with the irony, preferring <font size=-1>IMAO</font>--<i>in my arrogant opinion</i>. Jeering or wistful references may be made to <font size=-1>IRL</font>--<i>in real life</i>, ie, not in cyberspace. Another well-known <font size=-1>TLA</font> (<i>three-letter acronym</i>--also sometimes used <font size=-1>IRL</font>) is <font size=-1>URL</font>, of which it can safely be said that more people know what it is (an Internet address) than what it stands for (<i>uniform resource locator</i>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a while the <i>smiley</i>, <b>:-)</b> (like a face on its side), seemed to be a metalinguistic breakthrough for expressing emotion on the cold face of a computer screen. An industry in <i>emoticons </i>was briefly spawned, including <b>:-(</b> (sad), <b>:-O</b> (shocked) and <b>%)</b> (punched in the face). Few, though, are used. Over-use now is the mark not of the true geek but of the <i>newbie</i>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oddly, the Hacker's Dictionary does not give the origin of <i>geek</i>. A couple of mouse-clicks, however, lead to the online site of a more traditional source: Webster's, which has "a carnival performer often billed as a wild man whose act usually includes biting the head off a live chicken or snake."<br>

<p><b>The other technopolists</b></p>
<h1>Intuitively competitive</h1>

<p><b>Intuit owns most of the market for financial software. In the last of our series, we look at its prospects in the age of on-line financial services</b></p><br>
THE technopolists this series has covered so far have tended to concentrate on markets where the customers are all big, sophisticated firms. Consumer software is different. Products for home use tend to be cheap, consumers fickle and standards less important than in a networked office.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the home is exactly the market where Intuit rules. Thanks largely to a program called Quicken, the 13-year-old Californian firm has consistently held around 75% of the financial-software market, despite fierce competition from Microsoft. That dominance has helped its revenue grow fourfold in as many years, to $538m (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>) for the year that ended in July, although its aggressive acquisitions of other firms and investments in new business have often kept it in the red.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intuit's secret for winning, and keeping, its quasi-monopoly is simplicity itself. When Scott Cook founded Intuit and started selling Quicken in 1983, it faced 43 competing products, many of them highly sophisticated ones. Quicken, on the advice of Mr Cook's wife, distinguished itself by replicating on-screen a universally familiar device for paying bills: a plain chequebook. Since then the program has remained among the easiest to use, resolutely focused on the daily needs of ordinary people. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intuit is one of the few firms to have bested Microsoft. For more than five years the software giant has been pushing a competing program, Money, even giving it away at times, but has been unable to gain more than a quarter of the market. In April 1995 Microsoft even offered to buy Intuit in a generous $2 billion deal that included a promise to give away Money to another firm to maintain a semblance of competition in the market. But America's trustbusters were unconvinced. Faced with the prospect of a long and bruising court battle, Microsoft dropped the bid.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having beaten off an all-out assault from Microsoft, Intuit has every right to walk tall, but its victory provides no guarantee of future success. The biggest challenge for the firm may not be its larger competitor but a changing marketplace. Over the next few years software of any sort will become less important than providing services on-line, such as letting people pay bills, manage their share portfolios and buy pension schemes over the Web.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Booz-Allen & Hamilton, a consultancy, reckons that nearly one in six American households will be banking over the Internet within four years. Most of these will be relatively well off, so between them they will make up nearly a third of bank profits by then. Such rich pickings have attracted many firms, including banks, to the emerging on-line financial-services market. In the face of this new competition, as well as that from Microsoft, can Intuit carry its dominance to this new market?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of Intuit's products connect to its Web-based Quicken Financial Network (<font size=-1>QFN</font>). Intuit acts as a middleman, offering information about mutual funds and insurance schemes, and introducing buyers and sellers. Some of these services are free, others require a monthly subscription. Intuit hopes to make its money from these subscriptions, as well as from advertisements on its site. And Intuit's Open Exchange, which connects Quicken users directly to their bank accounts, is used by 38 American banks, which pay the company a licence fee. Mr Cook reckons that within five years the Internet might account for as much as half of Intuit's revenues.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intuit's relations with the banking industry will be complicated. On the one hand it wants banks to use Open Exchange and support Quicken as part of their on-line banking services. On the other, it will be in head-to-head competition with them. More than 1,000 American banks will develop Web-based banking services within three years, according to Booz-Allen & Hamilton. These banks will find that <font size=-1>QFN</font>, rather than themselves, will rapidly become the point of contact between on-line customers and their financial institutions; and if the banks get their customers via <font size=-1>QFN</font>, they may have a hard time differentiating themselves from their rivals. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Intuit has two advantages over the banks. The first is that it can be seen to give impartial advice on current accounts, investments and pensions. The second is that its users are fiercely loyal. "People would change their bank rather than switch from Quicken," says Philippe Amouyal of the Boston Consulting Group.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile Microsoft has redoubled its efforts to promote Money, and linked it to a personal-finance Web site that is part of its Microsoft Network, the core of its ambitious push into media and other "content". Microsoft's Open Financial Connectivity, a direct rival to Intuit's Open Exchange (the word "open" means little, since both are proprietary networks), has brought in 61 institutional partners. Yet, ironically, Microsoft's attempt to buy Intuit boosted Open Exchange because it made the banks take the smaller firm more seriously. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Intuit, winning the battle for on-line financial services is a matter of survival, much more so than for either Microsoft or the banks, which have deep pockets to keep them going while they work out a new strategy. In a networked marketplace, standards count for more than they do in a home environment, and Intuit's standards are just one set of many. A commanding lead is a good place to start; but Intuit's greatest advantage may be that it is a lot hungrier than its rivals.<br>

<h1>Weird, perhaps, but quite wonderful too</h1>

<p><b>Nothing left to discover on earth? Don't believe it. Wherever humans go, other creatures have beaten them to it; and pretty odd most of them are</b></p><br>
WHEREVER you look, life is there. Within the hair follicles of hamsters, and even of people, mites hatch, have sex and die. Inside the hearts and lungs of crocodiles, worms grow through adolescence and enter young adulthood, feasting on the rich blood of their hosts. Parasitic flies lay their eggs inside the bodies of fire ants; when the maggots hatch, they crawl into their host's head and devour the brains before they pupate. And this is just on the world's surface. Down in the bowels of the earth, curious bacteria flourish. Deep in the darkest oceans, fish with huge eyes and gigantic mouths patrol the gloom.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is nonsense to say that the Last Frontier has been crossed. Apart from the almost limitless expanses of space, where the physical cosmos may or may not blend into a non-physical one, there are plenty of places down here on humdrum old earth yet to be opened to human knowledge. Antarctica offers volcanoes, deserts, rivers and huge lakes deep beneath the ice. In more temperate climes, caves riddle the continents, offering amateurs the chance to discover places where no one has ever been before. And on the bottom of the ocean, fumaroles--"black smokers"--sear the rift valleys, spewing super-heated water and sulphuric gases from the globe's belly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of these places is hospitable to people. No one would plant a flag or build an empire there. But other organisms do not mind the dark, the heat, the cold, the poisons, or any of the other apparently dreadful conditions of these last untravelled reaches of the earth. Creatures thrive there; and they are weird.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A mere 3m years old</b></b><br>
In eastern Antarctica, the central ice sheet never melts, not even in midsummer. In the upper regions of the ice sheet, the temperature averages minus 50&#176;C. Yet four kilometres below the frozen surface lies Lake Vostok, a vast freshwater lake. According to the latest measurements*, it is in places 500 metres deep and covers 14,000 square kilometres (5,400 square miles), as much as Lake Ontario. Things move slowly down there. The average length of time a water molecule stays in the lake is about 50,000 years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lake Vostok could be a biological treasure trove. Ice samples taken from above the lake contain bacteria and other microbes such as algae, diatoms and other microfungi; the microfungi are possible sources of new antibiotics. As the gigantic lid of ice melts into the surface of the lake (something that occurs at the stately rate of about a millimetre a year), these organisms will be released into the water. At the point of their release, they will be 500,000 years older than they were when they first landed on the Antarctic ice-cap.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Work on Siberian permafrost by David Gilichinsky and his colleagues at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Pushchino shows that some bacteria can remain alive, if quiescent, for 3m years. Other microbes can certainly stay alive in ice for at least 180,000 years. No one knows the mechanics of such longevity. But one day, when sampling can be done without polluting the ice and the water, Lake Vostok could do for biologists what distant galaxies do for astronomers: it may allow them to look backwards through time, giving them a tiny window through which to explore an ancient world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Antarctica is a good place for this. The cold is so searing that many organisms expend little energy. Indeed, the world champions of leisurely growth live in Antarctica. But these under-achieving organisms are not interesting only because of their excruciatingly slow pace of life. They have chosen an unlikely residence: they actually live inside rocks.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "endolithic" communities of Antarctica, as they are called, live where it seems impossible for anything to survive. In the dry valleys of eastern Antarctica, along the polar plateau, the cold, dry katabatic winds blow down from the central plateau at an average speed of about 70mph (110km per hour). They expose the quartz crystals of the sandstone rocks, keeping them free of snow. The year's average temperature (including the wind-chill factor) is minus 45&#176;C. Nothing, apparently, steps outdoors in this part of town. Yet the landscape is not so barren as you might suppose. Within some of the rocks, strange, layered communities of black lichens, white fungi and green algae have been living comfortably for centuries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to David Wynn-Williams, a biologist with the British Antarctic Survey, rocks are quite cosy places to live in, once you can get inside them. Within, the temperature is hospitable (for Antarctica), hovering around 0&#176;C. They are even pleasantly humid; although no moisture lasts for more than a few minutes outside, droplets of water sometimes seep into the cracks and escape obliteration by the winds.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, even if an organism can get between the grains of the rock, another difficulty arises: food. The inside of a rock is, after all, dark. Or so it would seem. But to the algae, the basis of this quiet community, this is no problem. They are able to photosynthesise--harness the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide from the air into the organic compounds needed for living-- with the little light that makes it through several millimetres of rock and two layers of other living organisms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The black lichens are the first layer; then come the fungi; then, at last, the algae. The lichens live one millimetre under the rock's surface. They too photosynthesise; their black colouring comes from a pigment, melanin, which protects them from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. The stringy white fungi feed on the algae. And the algae are so efficient that they can get by with 180 times less light than most other plants. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides a little sunshine and a little water, these communities do not need much. One molecule of carbon dioxide captured from the air lasts them for 10,000 years before it is released again to the atmosphere. Yet, despite all this, the communities are relatively common in the translucent sandstone outcrops fringing the polar plateau. They may even occur on Mars. And they are probably centuries old. The key to long life, it seems, is not to do too much.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Groping in the dark</b></b><br>
A little light is, of course, different from none at all. In truly dark places, life seems impossible. Again, life surprises. Even in the blackest passages of the deepest caves, where the air is hot and foul, something is probably alive. Of all of earth's remaining frontiers, caves are perhaps the most accessible. New ones are discovered all the time, often by lucky amateurs. And, once in a while, a cave is found that has for ages been sealed off from contact with the earth's surface.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Movile Cave, underneath a cornfield in southern Romania just a few minutes' drive from the Black Sea, is one of these. Discovered by Cristian Lascu, a geologist at the Emile Racovita Speleological Institute in Bucharest, it was entered for the first time in 1986. Until then, it had been closed for more than 5.5m years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This cave has turned out to be stranger than most. Completely dark and virtually silent, it is home to a tremendous number of little animals. Part of it is quite dry; the rest is filled with warm waters (about 21&#176;C). The atmosphere is unpleasant: in parts, the cave is dangerously low in oxygen and poisonously high in carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. And, most unusually, life in Movile Cave has no need of sunlight (or virtually no need--vital oxygen seeps in through cracks in the cave's walls).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For almost all organisms in almost all ecosystems, sunshine is the ultimate source of energy. Plants capture the sun's rays and, through photosynthesis, use the sun's energy to convert carbon dioxide in the air into organic molecules. Animals then feed on plants and on each other; fungi and bacteria grow on the living and dead tissues of plants and animals. If there is no light at all, life gets much more difficult.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, usually, caves do not hold much of interest. Bats sometimes roost; eyeless fish sometimes splash about in the water; the occasional spider sometimes startles an unsuspecting spelunker. But these beasties all depend indirectly on the sun. Bats fly abroad to collect their supper; the fish eat the detritus from dead things; spiders depend on straying insects that in turn depend on plants. Without some kind of regular food supply, a cave will be a desolate place, home only to small populations of just a handful of species.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence the oddity of Movile. So far, 48 definably different animal species have been found there, 30 on the land and 18 in the water. Of these, 33 are peculiar to this cave. Woodlice and millipedes graze on mats of bacteria and fungi; pseudoscorpions, centipedes and spiders gorge on the meat of whatever they can catch. In the water, leeches prey on worms; eyeless shrimps try to evade capture by water scorpions. No plants and no vertebrates (except for visiting scientists) are found there.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the animals are troglomorphic: that is, they look as if they live in a cave. They have tiny eyes, or no eyes at all, and have often lost all colour. Their bodies are white or translucent; if you look at them with a torch, you can see their guts. They are true creepie-crawlies: they have extra-long legs and antennae (being crawled over by one of the millipedes would be, well, an experience) to feel and smell their way around. For cave biologists, Movile Cave may help to resolve an argument. One camp argues that the loss of eyes in cave animals happens because, when not much food is around, eyes become too expensive. The other argues that eye loss has nothing to do with the food supply. Movile--which is rich in food--suggests that the second camp may be right.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The water is the key to this diversity. It is "geological water"--it comes from a source far underground, not from the land above or the Black Sea. It could be 25,000 years old, and may have come, a long time ago, from the Danube. And it contains three substances that can provide energy to organisms which have evolved the equipment to take advantage of them: hydrogen sulphide, a gas that smells like rotten eggs; methane, a gas that (to humans) smells of nothing at all; and ammonium ions.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using one of these as their power supply, instead of using the sun, the bacteria in Movile Cave somehow (nobody yet quite knows how) convert carbon dioxide from the air into organic compounds. According to Serban Sarbu, a biologist at the Speleological Institute, and his colleagues Thomas Kane and Brian Kinkle, of the University of Cincinnati in Ohio, these bacteria underpin the whole ecosystem.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The upper passages of Movile Cave are like those in most caves: not much lives there. But down near the water's edge, about 200 metres below the cave's entrance, lots of animals scurry about (and occasionally one of the leeches comes out on to the bank). To get to the most interesting parts of Movile Cave, however, requires something more: cave diving. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For, although it becomes impossible to travel farther in the cave by foot, the cave continues in a series of underwater passages. Dive along one, and every so often it opens up into an "airbell"--a large pocket of air. And it is in these airbells that Movile Cave really comes alive, because it is within them that the food (huge mats of bacteria) is most abundant. Each of the three airbells investigated so far has a different atmosphere, the one farthest from the shore of the lake being the most toxic (to humans, that is). Each is inhabited by a bustling community; but the creatures that live in one airbell may not survive in the next. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Movile Cave is the first terrestrial (as opposed to aquatic) ecosystem to have been discovered that does not depend on sunshine. It will not be the last. The geological water that fuels the life in Movile extends over an area of more than 100 square kilometres. More airbells, complete with their denizens, probably live in this subterranean expanse. And networks of other, as yet undiscovered, caves in other parts of the world will probably turn out to be supplied with the energy to house even more creepy-crawlie critters in the dark.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Life under pressure</b></b><br>
Now plunge lower still. The darkest, deepest and most bizarre ecosystems of all are the deep oceans. Below the "photic zone", at depths where no light penetrates, the oceans are a surrealist desert. In the darkness, monstrous fish go for long stretches of time without food. On the ocean floor, organisms depend on falling detritus from dead creatures in the waters above. It is cold. And the pressure is immense.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Occasionally, though, the monotony of this desert is broken by equally surrealist oases. These are the deep-sea vents, known as black smokers, that belch out sulphidic water as hot as 400&#176;C. Over and around these vents live some of the wackiest creatures imaginable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1977, deep-sea vents were discovered along a rift valley in the eastern Pacific, not far from the Galapagos islands. Since then, vents have been found scattered like islands in archipelagoes along the edges of the oceanic plates wherever the plates are spreading apart. The consequences of volcanic activity, these vents are springs of super-heated water. And, to the surprise of almost everybody, they have turned out to support ancient and complex ecosystems.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to Robert Vrijenhoek, of Rutgers University in New Jersey, exactly what you find living on a deep-sea vent depends on four things: which ocean you are in, how deep you are, how hot the water is, and how long the vent has been there.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the mid-Atlantic, the vents tend to last longer than the hotter, more ephemeral ones found in the eastern Pacific. On a vent four kilometres under the surface of the Atlantic, you might find bacteria with filamentous strands so enormous they can be seen by the unaided human eye (unaided, that is, except by a good submarine and a bright light), brilliantly-coloured mussels and clouds of small orange shrimps. The mid-Atlantic vents are often home to endemic species, suggesting that some of them have been stable for millions of years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the eastern Pacific, the shrimps are much less common; instead, gigantic tube-worms, sometimes two metres long and two or three centimetres in diameter, cluster around the mouth of the vent. Their protective tubes are white, and feel leathery. The worms themselves are purple, with bright red gills. Crabs without eyestalks prey on the worms, pulling them from their tubes like spaghetti. Also present in the eastern Pacific are mussels and clams up to 30 centimetres across. Here, the creatures have to move around because new vents erupt, ready to be colonised by the enterprising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the western Pacific, the fauna is different again. Few worms and mussels cavort in the deep spas of these waters. Instead, hairy snails the size and colour of golf balls are stacked high around the edges of the vents. These snails do not often comb their hair; they are full of bacteria. And the shrimps of the western Pacific vents graze directly on the bacteria living among the snails' tousled manes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Several things are notable about the communities living on these vents. First, like the organisms in Movile Cave, none of them seems to depend on light. The bacteria are able to use hydrogen sulphide, or other sulphurous gases that are belched from the belly of the earth, as a source of energy. But, unlike the Movile residents, some of the other vent organisms do not depend on free-living bacteria for food.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The clams, mussels, snails and worms all have special links with their own species of bacteria. These endosymbionts, as they are known, are housed by their hosts within chosen chambers (cells in the gills in the case of clams and mussels, a structure called the "trophosome" in the worms). There, they metabolise the sulphide gases on behalf of the organisms they live in. In the clams and mussels, the bacteria are passed down the generations from parent to child; but in the worms, Dr Vrijenhoek and his colleagues have found, the symbionts must be recaptured afresh by each new generation--a curious arrangement, for, without their symbionts, these creatures cannot survive for long.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another feature of life on deep-sea vents is that all the animals seen so far reproduce sexually. This is unexpected (to those who ponder these things) for two reasons. First, organisms that live in extreme environments are usually asexual; that includes the endolithic communities in Antarctica. Those that live widely dispersed are also usually asexual; it only needs one to start a new colony. This suggests that, though boiling-hot sulphidic water at a depth where the water pressure may be 600 times greater than at sea-level sounds like a tough environment, such conditions are in fact the deep-sea equivalent of a lush tropical forest.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor are the vents as dark as might be supposed. Until recently, almost all the species were thought to be eyeless. On closer examination, some species, especially the shrimps, have turned out to have eyes of a sort. In 1996, a new species of shrimp was collected from the Snake Pit vent on the mid-Atlantic ridge. Like others previously found in the mid-Atlantic, it has a small eyespot with no lens. Instead, the eye is covered by a smooth sheet of material that is highly sensitive to light.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first, this seems peculiar. So far under the sea, it is not immediately apparent that there is much to look at. But, of course, these creatures live near exceedingly hot water. Hot things, when viewed in the infrared, become visible. Very hot things become very bright. And, even more surprising, these vents actually give out a dim glow in the reddish end of the visible part of the spectrum. No one knows what causes it. But the shrimps can probably see it. They feed on bacteria spewed up from the fiery cauldrons below the seabed. The shrimps themselves do not actually live in the hot water: they would be boiled alive. So being able to see enough to maintain a healthy distance from the heat is a useful trick.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Vrijenhoek and his colleagues have traced the ancestry of the vent creatures. They have found that, contrary to some theories, the animals down there, weird as they are, have all evolved from more familiar relations in the tidepools and reefs of the more familiar earth. It just shows what too much pressure can do to you.<br>

<h1>A bit about photographs</h1>

<p><b>Digital photography is developing rapidly. How quickly it will overtake conventional cameras and film, though, is debatable</b></p><br>
HIGH on The Peak--the mountain that overlooks Hong Kong's famous skyline--one of the colony's more enterprising hawkers has gone high-tech. Piled on to his hand-cart are a personal computer, a monitor and a colour printer, all powered by batteries and linked to a digital camera mounted on a tripod. Tourists are offered instant souvenir pictures of themselves against one of the most spectacular backdrops in the world. And if the dramatic view is obscured by clouds, never mind: the hawker's imaging software will soon superimpose a clear skyline.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Digital cameras are the first serious change in the technology of recording static images since Louis Daguerre perfected his process in 1838. By storing pictures electronically, they avoid all the tedious mucking about with chemicals that is required to turn out photographs. And, as a bonus, they deliver their images in a form that multimedia computers can play with. Not surprisingly, sales of digital cameras are growing rapidly--up from 200,000 in 1995 to 800,000 in 1996.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It seems likely, therefore, that the digital revolution is going to ride rough-shod over photography, as it has over other areas, such as the music industry. But probably not quite yet. For electronic cameras, despite all their wizardry, still lack the thing that has given digital devices their edge elsewhere--they are not yet as accurate as the old-fashioned, analogue way of doing things.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Colouring the picture</b></b><br>
Digitising something means dividing it up into discrete parcels that can be described by numbers. In the case of pictures, these parcels are known as "pixels" (the individual spots on a television screen are one familiar example of them). A digital camera generates its pixels by focusing light not on to a film, but on to a silicon chip known as a charge-coupled device (<font size=-1>CCD</font>)--a component that also forms the core of moving-picture cameras such as camcorders.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main working elements of the best-known chips--the microprocessors at the heart of computers--are transistors. These are semiconductor switches with three wires protruding from them. One carries current in. A second carries current out. And a third tells the transistor whether or not to let the current (and thus a signal) through. <font size=-1>CCD</font>s are also made of semiconducting switches, but in this case the switches are diodes, and thus have only two protruding wires. <font size=-1>CCD</font> diodes, however, are light-sensitive, and it is this sensitivity that provides the third input--the one that controls the electrical signal. When exposed to an image, each diode produces a signal that depends on the brightness and colour of the part of the image that is falling on it. Since a <font size=-1>CCD</font> has at least several hundred thousand light-sensitive diodes, the image can be broken up into a corresponding number of pixels.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pixels generated by a <font size=-1>CCD</font> can be stored either in an internal memory chip in the camera or in a small plug-in "flash" memory consisting of yet another type of chip. When the memory is full, the picture files stored in it are transferred to a computer where, with the appropriate software, the pictures can be viewed, edited, printed out, placed in other programs (such as desk-top publishing documents), used to decorate a web site or e-mailed to a friend.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, with no chemicals and no more films to buy, why would anyone ever bother with a conventional camera again? The reason is resolution. The light-sensitive gels on photographic film are very fine-grained, and can thus store a lot of detail. To reproduce the detail found in a good-quality colour transparency would require about 80m pixels. Even the most expensive digital cameras cannot manage this. A digital version of a Nikon single-lens reflex (<font size=-1>SLR</font>) camera, for example, can produce an image of only about 6m pixels. And at $27,000 a throw, it is unlikely to be gracing the Christmas stockings of even the most enthusiastic amateurs. Meanwhile, digital cameras affordable by lesser mortals (those retailing for less than $500) can manage but a few hundred thousand pixels.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor do the putative digital photographer's problems end there. Having taken his photograph, he must store it--and a traditional slide box will not do the trick. Instead, a fair amount of electronic memory must be available.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The simplest pixel conceivable requires one "bit" of information. Photos based on single-bit pixels would not, however, be very exciting, since one bit would allow a pixel only to be either black or white (off or on in a computer's vocabulary). Once shades of grey are included, the number of possibilities escalates-- and so does the storage space required. A simple 8-bit image allows each pixel to have 256 possible shades of grey or basic colours. For richer 24-bit colour (which many computer monitors use) each pixel can have 16.7m different colour possibilities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each extra bit, however, requires more storage space. Exactly how big the picture file ends up depends on the size of the photo, the level of detail, the camera's colour-management software and the format in which it is stored (there are many such formats, and some use compression techniques to try to cut down on the storage capacity required). Yet even a dozen 24-bit colour snapshots, each made up of only 200,000 pixels, will occupy two megabytes of memory (a quarter as much as an average personal computer holds), while some of the professional digital cameras around spew out so much data that they have to be tethered directly to a fast computer's hard disk in order to gather it all. A picture of the quality required by a magazine could easily gobble up 60-80 megabytes. A large poster would require some 400 megabytes. Lugging around the hardware necessary to cope with all this is not going to appeal to the average holiday maker.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Digital cameras are improving, to be sure. But so is conventional photography. Chemical imaging, which has come a long way since Daguerre's day, is getting better still. Kodak and its arch-rival, Fuji, recently teamed up to launch the "Advanced Photo System" (<font size=-1>APS</font>). This employs ordinary film to capture the image, but incorporates a magnetic strip on which data such as the lighting conditions prevailing when a shot was taken are stored. <font size=-1>APS</font> is easier to use than a digital camera, and allows more accurate processing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So film wins? Not necessarily. And certainly not for many professional photographers. Even if their work is shot on film, the pictures taken by most working photographers increasingly end up as pixels anyway. In many newspapers and magazines, darkrooms are already a thing of the past. Both colour-negative and transparency film are now routinely machine-processed and scanned directly into digital files. The pictures are edited on a computer screen and placed straight into the electronic page-make-up.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, where speed is important, a growing number of professional photographers are already using digital cameras. Not just news photographers, but police-cameramen, estate agents and insurance assessors. Many of the photographs used in catalogues are also taken with digital cameras: if the final pictures are going to be small anyway, then digital cameras are already good enough. They are also good enough for images that will appear only on a computer screen, or will be printed out in a document on a low-resolution printer.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this tolerance for imperfection that may yet allow digital cameras to win the mass market. For, while a small group of well-equipped amateurs armed with <font size=-1>SLR</font>s and enough lenses to start a minor observatory might like to think themselves a cut above the average holiday photographer, most people only want to take snapshots.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those not in search of the ideal, the digital camera already is--or soon will be-- perfectly suitable for many types of photography. <font size=-1>CCD</font>s will surely get better and so will the software that the cameras use. Kodak recently joined up with Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and a new Californian firm called Live Picture in order to establish a new format for digital snapshots. Called FlashPix, it promises less memory-intensive pictures and faster editing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The cost of digital photography will also fall, particularly since it will soon no longer be necessary to build your own digital dark-room at home to process and display the pictures. A plethora of new products and services to support digital photography is starting to arrive. These range from simple-to-use snapshot-quality home printing machines for digital cameras, to instant print and enlargement services from high-street film developers. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And digital photography could shake the equipment market up even further. Camera companies may know a lot about optics, but they do not necessarily have much experience with electronics. It is not just film manufacturers that should be quaking in their boots--if Nikon, Canon and Minolta are not careful, they may find themselves competing with the likes of Sony and Casio.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So eventually, as with every battle between digital and analogue, it is likely that digital will win. Film will live on, but probably only in specialist use. Just as a few die-hards still shun <font size=-1>CD</font> players and listen to vinyl discs through valve amplifiers, in years to come there will always be one tourist in that group high above Hong Kong who pulls out a battered old Nikon <font size=-1>F5</font> and delights in informing everyone that photographs never look right unless they are made from silver halide. For most people, though, the chance to alter their holiday's weather conditions after the event will win out every time.<br>

<img src="monmor.gif"><br> "Heresy! Rank heresy!" The editor squeezed his hands together unhappily."Come now, Geoffrey. Tom was merely being provocative."
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Edward, why do you persist in ignoring the truth about this subversive? Tom has just questioned whether we should continue to support the Anglo-American special relationship! He'll be telling us next that we should drum America out of <font size=-1>NATO</font> and rely on the French." Hodgskin's voice rose in a screech. "The French!!!"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tom St Loe Rathbone's patronising drawl cut in. "Chill out, Geoffrey. I thought the whole point of editorial meetings was to think the unthinkable."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hodgskin drew himself up to his full six feet four. "There is the unthinkable and there is the unspeakable. And what is not speakable is the querying of our fixed principles."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In fairness, Geoffrey," said the editor mildly, "our commitment to the Atlantic alliance was relatively recent."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Geoffrey Hodgskin's enormous frame quivered. "For over a third of <i>The Economist</i>'s life a guiding principle has been the need to keep our allies from going back into Fortress <font size=-1>USA</font>."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, for heaven's sake," said the editor irritably. "You know perfectly well Tom is just expressing his own personal opinion. We don't necessarily agree with him. Just because he tilts at our sacred cows doesn't mean the cows aren't sacred."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hodgskin's voice rose to a scream. "With an editor who has chosen to abandon the monarchy, how can I have any faith that we will be true to our heritage?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The editor sighed. "We've been through all that. Bagehot took a relaxed view on that over a century ago."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"To be precise," observed the Britain editor, "Bagehot said he didn't expect the monarchy to last much beyond his life-time."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bugger Bagehot," said Rathbone. "Who cares what he thought. It's what <i>we </i>think that matters."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Typical," shouted Hodgskin. "Typical of your complete failure to appreciate . . . "<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rathbone yawned. "Oh, for God's sake, Jeffers, you're carrying on as if we had abandoned free trade. Though I have to say I've been wondering recently if protectionism mightn't have the virtue of . . . "<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's it," howled Hodgskin. "You infidel! You apostate!" He picked up his coffee-mug and threw it across the room at Rathbone. It bounced off the deputy editor's shoulder and shattered against the window. As Hodgskin stormed out, the assembled staff showed no emotion. As one man they shrugged and moved on to discuss whether anything useful might emerge from the latest European Union summit.<br>

<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Five minutes later, the luscious Julia Barrington, one of the editor's secretaries, emerged from the lift into the lobby and stopped in mid-stride to stare through the plate-glass window at what looked like the corpse of Geoffrey Hodgskin lying on the plaza among several pieces of wood and metal. As she exclaimed with alarm, two passers-by materialised and helped Hodgskin to his feet.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's happened, Zoe?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The receptionist tittered nervously. "I think Geoffrey has finally gone bonkers. He came charging out of the lift, rushed over to James . . . " She waved at the forbidding marble statue of the founder of <i>The Economist</i> that stared from a corner of the lobby, " . . . waved his arms at him, shouted something like 'It'll be back to the Corn Laws next,' rushed out the door and crashed straight into that . . . that whassitsname." She consulted a piece of paper. "Oh, yes. 'Fiscal Rectitude'. Now, what's been going on? What have you been doing to him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's not us," protested Julia. "It's him. He's off his bleeding rocker. Comes screaming out of the editorial meeting about how the world's coming to an end or something." She looked over at the statue. "If you ask me, he thinks he's James Wilson. He's nearly as ugly anyway."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Leave off making fun of James. Sanest person in this place if you ask me. At least he doesn't shout and run about. Seems to me Geoffrey is driving himself mad spending every night crouched over old <i>Economists</i>."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, blimey. Is that what he's at? So that's why he's raving on about getting rid of the welfare state, is it?" <br><img src="xth2.jpg"><br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And why he's going blind and falling over things. Mind you, I'm delighted he's messed up that piece of rubbish. Art, indeed! With a bit of luck it can't be repaired."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Should we try to calm Geoffrey down?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Too late, love." Zoe waved towards the plaza. "I think he's taken his nervous breakdown home."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Let's hope he stays there with it. Sometimes I think Geoffrey's going to do someone an injury."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Like Tom, for instance? Serve him right. From all I hear, he's always winding Geoffrey up."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Julia looked cross. "It may seem like that from down here, Zoe, but on the 13th floor it's different. As Edward says . . . " -- her voice took on a note of pomposity-- "we have a noble tradition of dissent."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zoe laughed coarsely. "Dissent my bum! There's nothing noble about Tom Rathbone. Nasty flashy bit of work."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You just don't like him 'cos he's a bit stand-offish," said Julia. "In editorial we admire him 'cos he's brilliant."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Julia's relief and Zoe's regret, the arrival of a visitor brought the dispute to an end. <p><img src="wedeve.gif"><br> The editor groaned and picked up his phone. "Sophie? How the hell did Geoffrey's privatisation leader get through? For God's sake, he starts from the premise that government has no legitimate role except to organise defence and then proposes privatising the armed forces. Even James Wilson might have thought that was going a little far."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sorry, Edward. What with the allegations of group sex in the cabinet and the rapprochement between Margaret Thatcher and Ted Heath, we're all up to our eyes."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Anyone around who can write a substitute?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Tom, maybe."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Don't tell Geoffrey. He'll go completely off his head."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How would we know the difference?" enquired the Britain editor icily. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was unfortunate, the Britain editor agreed, after the murder of Tom St Loe Rathbone, that she had not ensured that Geoffrey Hodgskin had gone home rather than--as it turned out--having been on the 14th floor obsessively reading 1840s <i>Economists</i> and occasionally keying into the system to find out what had happened to his leader. It was even more unfortunate that no one had time that evening to read and amend Tom's proposition that privatisation was yesterday's solution to tomorrow's problems and that the time had come to look again at the merits of public ownership of the means of production. Unfortunately, the senior editorial staff were working frantically to cover an unprecedented series of political crises.<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At 7.00pm the cabinet sex story which had formed the basis for a leader on terminal sleaze had turned out to have been invented by a disgruntled secretary at No. 10 who had had her advances rejected by the prime minister; at 8.30 the cover showing Thatcher and Heath in an embrace under the heading "Bygones will be bygones" had to be replaced when the Moscow correspondent sent through the news about Boris Yeltsin's double; the flash from the Washington office that there was to be a congressional inquiry into the allegation that the cat Socks occasionally ate food paid for from the White House Hospitality Budget came at 9.30; and at 10.30, just as the remnants of the graphics department were leaving, came the news from Reuters that Rupert Murdoch had bought Indonesia, necessitating a change of cover for three editions, a new front leader and a complete reorganisation of two sections. Mass hysteria at 11.00 when the computer system crashed was narrowly averted by a successful rescue mission by the technical department's Donald Barrington. <p><img src="thumor.gif"><br> <img src="xth3.jpg"><br> At 2.00am, having indulged in mutual congratulation, discussed the latest stage of the Hodgskin-Rathbone feud and consumed wine and sandwiches, the five senior editors left the building together.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As they walked towards the waiting taxis, the deputy editor stopped.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"'Market Forces' seems to have come a cropper. No doubt Geoffrey will blame Tom."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's certainly been an expensive week on the sculpture front," said the foreign editor. "I hope it's not an omen. There's only one left intact."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The quintet walked over to inspect the damage. It was the finance editor who spotted a flash of beige cloth and the deputy editor who said worriedly that it looked like an arm.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And isn't that a leather glove?" asked the editor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As one they dashed back into the building, instructed the security guard to call the police, took the lift back to the editor's office and broke open a bottle of whisky. "That looked like cashmere to me," said the Britain editor, as she tremblingly raised the glass to her lips. "The only person I know who wears a cashmere coat is Tom Rathbone."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Where's Geoffrey?" asked the other four, in unison. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It took an hour for the police to summon up the block-and-tackle necessary to restore "Market Forces" to its vertical position. Having identified the squashed and bloody remains of Rathbone, at 3.30 the senior editorial staff went shakily home; the editor had time only to shower and change before making it back at 5.30 to start reading the first proofs.<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By 10.00am he had joined Detective-Inspector Greg and Detective-Constable Asquith in the board room.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I hope my secretary was able to assist you, gentlemen."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Thank you, sir. Mrs Barrington made us very comfortable. Now would you be so kind as to tell us which of your colleagues would have wanted to kill Mr Rathbone."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Surely it was an accident?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sorry, sir. It won't wash. The sculptor's been round; the constructor's been round; the security guards have had a look. They're all adamant that that whateveritwas . . . "<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sculpture. An abstract representation of Adam Smith's invisible hand."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whose what?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The economist Adam Smith agreed that selfish, individual actions work together, through market forces, to the benefit of society as a whole--as if guided by an invisible hand."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He did, did he? Well, there's no accounting for taste, sir. Well, then, this very large and--if Mr Smith will forgive me-- visible triangular object was rock-solid on its base. It simply could not have fallen over without help." He gazed severely at the editor. "What's more, it will have taken three people to push it over on top of that unfortunate gentleman. What have you to say to that, sir?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The editor took a grip on himself. "I'm sorry, Inspector Greg. You've lost me. What exactly are you implying?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That the deceased was murdered by at least three people on the staff of your magazine."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Newspaper," corrected the editor absent-mindedly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If you say so, sir. For all I care you can call it a comic. What I want to know is which of your staff you think might be responsible for this dastardly deed."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why should you point the finger at my staff? I am responsible only for the journalists. This building also houses <i>The Economist</i>'s management as well as six different organisations."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspector Greg looked at the editor sternly. "Come now, Mr Strachey. You are wasting your time and mine. Thomas St Loe Rathbone was murdered at some time between midnight and 1.30. The likelihood has to be that the murderers were in your building at the time. How else would they have known that Mr Rathbone was around and available to be murdered? Mrs Barrington tells us that if it hadn't been for all the unexpected news he'd have been gone hours earlier."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're begging a large number of questions, inspector."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm only a policeman, sir. Not an intellectual. Now Mrs Barrington's given us a list of who was on the premises at the relevant time. Can you confirm it?" He shoved a piece of paper at the editor, who scanned it and sighed. "Not a complete list, inspector. Julia can be forgetful. She hasn't put her husband on it, for instance. Or the security guards. Or Geoffrey Hodgskin, who spent much of the night on the 14th floor. Or even the finance editor, who, as you know, was one of those who discovered the body. And she's misspelled some names."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He amended the list and tossed it back. "You were asking which three people on that list might have had a motive."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"At least. Of course, there might have been more than three of them in it."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The editor sat bolt upright. "This is ridiculous, inspector. My colleagues are journalists, not members of the Mafia. They often have robust arguments with each other; on occasion some will get excited and raise their voices; one of them has even been known to throw a typewriter through a window. But in 153 years they've never resorted to homicide."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There's a first for everything," said the inspector genially. "Now, sir, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you through this list and ask you to tell me what relationship the late Mr Rathbone had with each of his colleagues. <p><img src="thuaft.gif"><br> "My head's spinning, lad. I can't take much more of this. I don't understand the half of what they're going on about."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You mean about the ideological differences, sir?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Whatever they call them. What was it that bird said?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Which one, sir?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The one that had swallowed a dictionary and kept going on about dead economists."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ah, yes. Sophie Hamilton, you mean. She certainly seems to be a true intellectual."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They're all bluestockings here if you ask me. The men as well as the women. But she takes the biscuit. What was all that about . . . " He consulted his notes. " . . . the revolt against classical economics? And what are Canesians and Freedmanites when they're at home? Football teams?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asquith smiled rather condescendingly. "In <i>Economist</i> terms they are, sir. Keynes and Friedman were two of the most influential economists of this century. Dr Hamilton was explaining that their adherents on the paper had had a sharp difference over the causes of inflation, that a few young neo-Keynesians on the staff who favour an attack on high unemployment are prepared to consider an incomes policy, how the Friedmanites are still convinced that inflation is purely linked to the money supply and why . . . "<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Stow it, will you? It's bad enough being lectured in double dutch by a bossy cow in jeans who looks about 12 without having my own constable following suit."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He looked at his subordinate with ill-concealed resentment. "You should be one of them too, if you ask me, instead of working for the humble police force." He glowered. "Bloody graduates. All the same. No common sense. Nothing to beat the university of life."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asquith, who was well used to this line of attack from his superiors, gazed expressionlessly at the table.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, all right then. I suppose you're only doing your best. But stop showing off and call in the next git."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Which git, sir?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That Geoffrey Hodgskin that had a row with the corpse on Monday. Maybe he'll make a bit more sense."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was a pity, Asquith remarked afterwards to his wife, that Hodgskin's answer to a question about why he thought Rathbone had ended a promising career underneath "Market Forces" should have led to a harangue about the invisible hand and the poetry of laisser-faire. Inspector Greg eventually erupted with rage. "Shut up," he bellowed.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a moment Asquith thought Hodgskin had been shocked into sanity, but he then leaped to his feet, cried "<i>L</i><i>&egrave;se majest</i><i>&eacute;</i>," and rushed from the room. Before he banged the door behind him, he turned and glared malevolently.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're just like him. Meddlers. Statists. Possibly even protectionists! And not a fixed principle between you!"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Hodgskin banged the door, Inspector Greg put his elbows on the table and clasped his head tightly in his hands. After a moment he looked up. "What was that about? As far as I could tell, he seemed to be saying Adam Smith did it."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Well, of course, in a sense he did," said Asquith. And then hastily, seeing Greg's face, "I think Mr Hodgskin isn't well, sir. He wasn't making any sense."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"If it could have been done by one of them, we'd have him," said Greg. "He's barking." He shook his head. "But it's just not possible that he could have worked without accomplices. There's something funny going on here."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sir, could I just . . . ?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Sssshhhh, lad. Stay quiet. Let's go and get lunch." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As they passed the reception desk, Zoe beamed cheerfully. "Found out whodunnit?"<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Fat chance." Greg stopped. "Are they as mad as they seem? Some of them don't seem to be on this planet."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, they're all right, most of them," she said indulgently. "It's just that they live in their heads too much. Anyway I'm sure none of them murdered Tom. Lots of them would have liked to get rid of Stuck-up Mr Superior Rathbone--including me--but they're not practical enough, for one thing."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The inspector's attention was caught by a screen on the wall behind her. "What's that."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's all part of the exhibition."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What exhibition?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We had a competition among the art schools to show the essence of <i>The Economist</i>. That's a film made up of identical photographs of James Wilson's statue that plays round and round in slow motion 24 hours a day."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"'Cos James is our founder.'<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What's the point of the film?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She took out a leaflet and read aloud: "The perceptual response of the ever-revolving loop is a metaphor for the velocity of circulation." Seeing the inspector's uncomprehending face, she added helpfully, "I think it's something to do with money. James was very interested in that sort of thing."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Was he interested in over-filled wastepaper baskets, too?" asked Greg, pointing to a large mess to the right of Wilson's statue. "Is that art as well? Or are you waiting for the garbage collectors?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zoe was enjoying herself. "Surely you realise that's what's known as an installation. This one's called 'Paper Covered with Adam Smith's Invisible Ink'. And then out there used to be 'Fiscal Rectitude', until Geoffrey fell over it. And 'Market Forces', until it fell over on Tom. And that thing that's still standing--the giant kid's football with the question mark on top--is 'The Pursuit of Reason'."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspector Greg sighed. "From what I've seen of this place, they're not pursuing it fast enough. Come on, Asquith."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shouldering their way through cameras and importunate reporters, they set off to a pub. <p><img src="xth4.jpg"><br> Mollified by a vast plate of steak-and-kidney pie and a pint of bitter, Greg beamed at his subordinate. "All right then, brains. What do you think?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I think Rathbone was murdered by just one person, sir."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How do you work that out? Is there an Arnie Schwarzenegger on the staff I haven't met yet?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"A lever, sir. You wouldn't have to be strong to lever up that sculpture and then push it over."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg ruminated for a moment. "You're seriously suggesting that Rathbone obligingly stood still while someone levered up that pile of metal and then shoved it on top of him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not quite, sir." Asquith took a handkerchief from his pocket and opened it to reveal a large pebble. "I found this lying near the . . . ", he hesitated, " . . . the murder weapon."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So what? There are lots like that around the place."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"My theory, sir, is that Rathbone made a date to meet someone by 'Market Forces'. The murderer equipped himself with a crowbar, levered up the sculpture beforehand and wedged the pebble underneath. That gave him the purchase to push the sculpture over on Rathbone and disappear, knowing no one would pay any attention to a pebble."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Far-fetched."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Less so than a murderous troika, sir, if you'll forgive me."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg drained his second pint. "Sometimes I see the point of having graduates in the police force, son. Come on back to the Tower and let's ask about crowbars." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Summoned by Zoe, the head of maintenance went in search of <i>The Economist</i>'s crowbar and returned to announce its disappearance from its accustomed spot in the basement. "It'll be in some litter bin, somewhere, I expect," said Greg.<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But who'd have known where to find it?" enquired Asquith.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Put it this way, constable," said the maintenance supremo. "Anyone working here knows we're located in the basement. It wouldn't take a genius to guess we'd have a crowbar and to slip downstairs and find it after we'd gone home."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg nodded his thanks. "I'm going back to the board room, Asquith. Find the editor and bring him to me." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What do you mean he says no? Who does he think he is?"<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He's got a crisis, sir. The <font size=-1>US</font> Secretary of the Treasury's just been forced to resign over a Chinese rent-boy, Wall Street's taken a nosedive and they've got to change the first leader and give the American edition a new cover. He sends his apologies and will be with you as soon as he's sorted things out."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What about the others who were with him last night?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"They've gone home to rest: he's holding the fort."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Bugger. I wanted to hear more about Hodgskin."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Surely he's First Suspect now, sir."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You may be right, lad, but my guess is he wouldn't know a crowbar from a slide-rule."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He noticed Asquith's puzzled expression. "Don't you know what a slide-rule is? Oh, God. I suppose to you it's as relevant as a bloody abacus. Never mind. Just find Hodgskin."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one could be found who had seen Hodgskin since late morning. The police whiled away the next hour or so taking unhelpful statements from whatever members of editorial were around. As with their colleagues that morning, there was a general consensus that <i>Economist</i> staff settled their differences at worst with rows or sulks or back-biting. No one was prepared to suggest any likely murderer, and all of them indicated that they couldn't imagine Hodgskin having the ability to unzip a banana, let alone locate a crowbar and do something murderous with it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Why, he's a computer illiterate," observed Henry Lathbury, the classics double-first who informed the world what South American greybeards were doing wrong.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"But we were told that he would have seen on the system that his leader had been scrubbed in favour of one by Rathbone which he'd have hated."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, yes. He could manage that. But he still used a portable typewriter. Couldn't even manage e-mail. Always barged into people's offices instead." He smirked complacently. "Too old to learn, I expect."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg was overwhelmed by a wave of hatred. "Thank you, young man. Now run along and tell your elders and betters how to run their affairs."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Lathbury left, the editor came in. "Sorry about that," he said. "We're having a bad week for crises. There was just time to stop the American presses. Now how can I help you? I'd like this cleared up as fast as possible. The tabloids are going to play merry hell with our anonymity. Ever since they cottoned on to the fact that we're not all middle-aged men with pointy heads, they're trying to get together a of page mug-shots.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Now what do you want to know?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strachey was in the midst of an impassioned defence of Hodgskin when the door opened to reveal a young woman who said breathlessly, "Edward, the foreign secretary's crossing the<br>
floor over Europe. Shall we stop the presses?"
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the editor ran from the room he called, "Sorry, but the way things are happening Deng will die just in time for us to stop our Asia edition. Come back tomorrow." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I'm not happy with ideological murder, Asquith. People don't kill people over points of principle. They kill them for old-fashioned reasons like money or sex."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asquith looked shocked. "But this is <i>The Economist</i>, sir. They do things differently here."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Even intellectuals feel greed and lust, son."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Not Hodgskin, from what we've seen. Or Dr Hamilton, for that matter. They seem to be pure intellects."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To Asquith's astonishment, Greg leaped to his feet and declaimed: "Hath not an intellectual eyes? Hath not an intellectual hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?" He grinned triumphantly. "If you prick us, do we not bleed?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He fell back into his seat. "Just because I didn't go to university doesn't mean I'm completely ignorant. I do dramatic recitations at the Freemasons' charity Christmas concert. Now you mark my words, son. As Kipling said, 'The colonel's lady an' Judy O'Grady are sisters under their skins!' I'll bet my shirt the same's true of Sophie and Julia." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"I know what he's getting at," said Asquith to his wife, who was a lecturer in political science. "And I'm not saying that intellectuals can't be driven by base passions. But I've been reading <i>The Economist</i>'s history, and from what I can see, Hodgskin is pretty typical. The founder, for instance, used to get his rocks off on arguments about currency."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She yawned. "Sorry, Richard. I'm knackered. I had two seminars, a lecture and four distressed students today, quite apart from marking essays. And a faculty meeting to boot."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"There you are. You may be an intellectual, but you've got students to keep your feet on the ground. These people get plucked out of Oxbridge or Harvard or wherever and transported to the 13th floor of the Economist Tower where they sit in cubicles so small they'd disgrace a Singapore prison, think deep thoughts and debate with each other like members of a senior common room."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He would have gone on, but his wife was asleep. <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Poor kids," said Mrs Greg. "Sounds as if they don't get much fun."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You're as bad as Asquith. Just because they argue about things we don't understand doesn't mean they don't have fun on the side. The kids are probably off clubbing as we speak. And I wouldn't be surprised if Dr Hamilton wasn't a right little raver when she's off duty. It's just that they've got to pretend to be serious."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"In that case, why have they murdered someone because they didn't agree with him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Oh, never mind, dear. Let's see what's on telly." <p><img src="frimor.gif"><br> "Why didn't the security guard hear this thing falling over, Greg?" asked Chief Inspector Palgrave.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He had a hoax call around midnight from an unidentified chap claiming there was an intruder in the garage. Reckons 'Market Forces' must have been pushed on to Rathbone by the time he got back. He wouldn't have seen it, of course, in that dark corner beside Boodles."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Do we know what Rathbone was doing hanging about the plaza at that time of night anyway? Seems a funny time and place to make a date."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Indeed it does, sir. We're pursuing the matter."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Damn slowly," said Palgrave. "Get a bloody move on, Greg, and make that toffee-nosed little constable of yours shake a leg as well." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"All this praise of competition that you get here is infectious, Asquith. We'll split up. You take the intellectuals. I'll take the plebs. And I'll get the answer afore ye."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Will Hodgskin be mine, sir?" asked Asquith eagerly.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg chuckled. "For all the good he is to you, lad. I've just had a call that he was home before midnight and safely in the arms of his landlady. She is, I'm told, a lady of mature charms who said with a wink that she'd succeeded in calming him down by the traditional methods."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"You can't believe her, sir, surely?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Her next-door neighbour, a busy-body of the first order, agrees that he came home at around that time. Apparently he fell over several milk-bottles, woke her up and she rushed to the window and saw him just before he closed his front door."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Asquith swore. "Never mind, lad," said Greg gaily. "Cherchez l'intellectual. See you for lunch. <p><img src="friaft.gif"><br> "By the time they met, Asquith's spirits had recovered. "I think I've got it, sir. It's much more important than we thought. The prime suspect is the editor."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Wait until I've ordered my shepherd's pie, lad. A pint?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Just a half," said Asquith, who hated drinking at lunchtime but feared ridicule.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"OK, then," said Greg, when they had settled. "Why the editor?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"He's not an economist and Rathbone was brilliant, arrogant and delighted in showing him up in front of his staff. The editor's prestige was slipping."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Couldn't he have fired him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"It's not the sort of place where you can afford to fire your intellectual superiors. Everybody would know why'd he done it. According to a few of the people I talked to today who like him and think him a competent and decent bloke, the editor was getting increasingly pressurised at the Monday morning meetings as Rathbone pushed him to justify all the paper's traditional attitudes. It was like a weekly viva."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So he murdered him?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"That's certainly what some of them are suggesting. Apparently, he suffers from an inferiority complex because he got only a second-class degree."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We all have our crosses to bear," said Greg. "It's your round, lad." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Julia Barrington broke down under Greg's harsh questioning that afternoon. "It's all my fault he's dead. I should have known that e-mail cancelling our date wasn't his. It hadn't any quotations. If I'd kept our date he'd be alive now."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg patted her shoulder. "Look on the bright side, love. If you'd met him, you might both be dead." <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"So you've won," said a disgruntled Asquith. "It was her husband, I suppose."<br><br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Certainly seems like that on the face of it. You can't read people's e-mail unless you have their passwords, but the technical department would have no difficulty in cracking that."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Congratulations, sir. Simple marital jealousy, then."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Greg sighed. "Would that it were so simple. I've had an instructive chat with Zoe and the guys in the post-room. I need the answers to a few key questions."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Like what?"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How could Rathbone afford cashmere? Why does the editor have a secretary as dim as Julia? Why was Geoffrey Hodgskin taking everything so personally? Why did the Britain editor put up with Rathbone when the American and foreign editors had chucked him out as unendurable? And why do people as intelligent as these like such idiotic modern art?"<br>

<h1 align=center>The wrong design</h1>


<CleverDrop>LEADERS of the European Union meet in Dublin this weekend to discuss, among other things, the budget-deficit rules that will apply to members of their planned economic and monetary union. To most readers, whether in Baltimore, Bangkok or even Brussels, this might seem an abstruse technical matter. Yet it goes to the heart of the debate over Europe's future and the prospects for its new currency. The details of the proposed "stability pact" have proved contentious, but governments seem willing to accept that tight restraints from the centre should apply to national policies on taxes and spending. That would be a far-reaching decision, and one that sets <font size=-1>EMU</font> on a wrong and dangerous course.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a view may seem odd, given <i>The Economist</i>'s earlier support for monetary union in principle; or unduly dramatic, given that so few other voices have been raised against the stability pact. It will strike some as a reversal of our earlier stance. It isn't, and it may be useful to say why.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>A design for diversity</b></b><br>
For years, since long before monetary union began to be seriously discussed, <i>The Economist</i> has maintained an unusual position on the matter. Our view has been that <font size=-1>EMU</font> could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how it is done. This has offended Euro-visionaries, eager to see monetary union proceed on almost any design, and it has disgusted Britain's minds-of-oak Eurosceptics, who think <font size=-1>EMU</font>, however conceived, is a foreign plot to enslave them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Monetary union has long been more than an academic curiosity. Despite that, public debate on the subject has been dismally poor right across Europe. This is worrying. Without broad and informed consent, <font size=-1>EMU</font> may prove fragile--and informed consent requires proper debate. Equally, the costs of staying out, if that is what Britain or other countries choose, need to be widely understood. Far from engaging in argument, the pro and anti tribes ignore each other resolutely. Neither seems interested in the commonsense proposition that the case for monetary union turns on what kind of monetary union it is. In our view, that question--what kind of <font size=-1>EMU</font>?--remains the central issue. The budget-rules are crucial because of the light they shed on it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Before coming to that, however, what would a good <font size=-1>EMU</font> look like? It would derive the greatest gains from Europe's single market while preserving the broadest political autonomy for its nation states. There need be no conflict between those goals: it is wrong to argue that further economic integration requires further political integration. If the system's foundations were properly laid, political autonomy and economic integration could be mutually strengthening.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A truly single market in Europe, based on a single currency, could support competition among governments across nearly the full range of domestic policy--on education, welfare, taxes, public investment, labour-market regulation and more. Different ideas on particular policies, and on the overall role of the state, could be tested in a uniquely revealing way. Efforts to suppress such competition by harmonising large areas of economic policy are not just unnecessary; they militate against exploiting the single market to the full.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You might ask, why should money be exempt from this competition among governments? Why harmonise currencies, as it were, and not those other things? The answer is simple. Allowing competition in monetary policy, which means letting currencies float, is collectively damaging. It causes volatility and misalignments in exchange rates. Coping with this consumes resources: it puts costs on business, impedes competition and retards investment. And in return for these public bads, there is no long-term advantage. In other areas of policy, differences over what works best (should labour markets be lightly or heavily regulated?) or what is right (how much should a country spend on its welfare state?) are inescapable. In these cases, diversity is good--a method of economic discovery and a necessary form of political self-expression. In monetary policy, there is no such uncertainty. Its only long-term purpose is to secure low inflation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantage derived from retaining national monies is strictly short-term: the freedom to cushion a local economic slowdown by devaluing the currency. Notwithstanding Britain's experience since 1992, this freedom is much less than it is held up to be. Devaluation ends in tears (higher inflation, no lasting gain in competitiveness) far more often than in triumph, as Britain's longer-term record confirms.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is well-trodden ground. Rather than tread it again, let us move on. Suppose that we have been right in the past to argue that there is much to be said for a monetary union of Europe's nation states. Suppose too, as we have also argued, that moving towards political union faster than the citizens of Europe want is wrong in principle and runs the risk of a bitter falling-out in due course. Supposing all that is true, why would a stability pact of the kind that Europe's leaders are contemplating be such a disturbing development?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all, its defenders could argue as follows. Rules requiring governments to curb their debts and run small budget deficits do no more than codify good fiscal practice. Why should responsible governments feel threatened? Moreover, once <font size=-1>EMU</font> starts, there may be an opportunity for governments to borrow partly at their partners' expense. Fiscal rules are needed to guard against this. Finally, it might be argued, rules on deficits and debt leave entirely unconstrained the bigger decisions that governments make about how much to spend and on what; they require only that governments collect enough in taxes to pay their bills.<br>
<b><br>
</p><p><b>An awfully big adventure</b></b><br>
This may seem a powerful line of argument. We <a href="sf0803.html">return</a> to a detailed discussion of its economic aspects-- in particular, to the idea that rules are needed to restrain excessive borrowing. Our conclusion there is that, judged in narrow economic terms, the rules are not merely unnecessary but positively undesirable. For the moment, though, put the economics to one side and consider the politics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The case for budget rules in Europe may be compared with the case for a balanced-budget amendment to America's constitution. Regardless of whether or not such an amendment would make sense, if the United States were ever to enact it the effect would be to set one branch of the government to restrain the others, according to a procedure that would be democratically well-grounded. What Europe is considering stands in stark contrast. Governments are to be held accountable not to separate powers at the national level but to supranational discretion; they are to be not merely restrained but, if they break the rules, punished, along with their citizens; all this according to procedures that command little or no popular consent. You could be forgiven for thinking the whole idea a plot to destroy the <font size=-1>EU</font> from within.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is possible that the <font size=-1>EU</font> will proceed by its usual methods--making progress incrementally, reacting to changing political and economic circumstances, interspersed by bursts of constitution-making by treaty. Those who argue that the stability pact is acceptable, because it won't work anyway and will eventually have to be ditched, are presumably making this assumption. At the end of that course may indeed lie the perfect Union sought by Euro-visionaries. Yet <font size=-1>EMU</font> is a far bigger and riskier adventure than any that the Union has previously embarked upon. The risk of doing so with a poor design, amid a constitutional arrangement that still lacks popular support in many member countries, is that if an economic crisis comes, pitting member against member, or member against the Union, it will come too quickly and on too large a scale to be dealt with in the usual way. When <font size=-1>EMU</font> fails that test, the entire structure could fold.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no need to take this risk. The best course would be to fix <font size=-1>EMU</font>, rejecting both Germany's stability pact and France's counter-proposal of a "stability council", which is unnecessary and looks designed to put political pressure on the supposed-to-be-independent European Central Bank. Admittedly, if a badly designed <font size=-1>EMU</font> is indeed launched in 1999, each country will still then have to balance the costs and benefits of joining in or staying out, and that balance will vary from country to country. But such a calculation lies in the future. The priority now, for all the governments of the Union, must be to improve the design. There is still time.<br>

<h2>NATO looks east</h2>
The West's foreign ministers agreed in Brussels that next July <font size=-1>NATO</font> would unveil its plan to <b>expand into Eastern Europe</b>. It will offer more security co-operation to countries not joining. Russia's foreign minister said his country would start talks to define <font size=-1>NATO</font>-Russian relations.<p>
President Yeltsin told his defence minister, General <b>Igor Rodionov</b>, to retire from the army--but to hold on to his government post, technically making him Russia's first civilian defence minister since Trotsky.<p>
In the run-up to the summit meeting of the European Union's 15 countries in Dublin on December 13th and 14th, France and Germany argued about a "<b>stability pact</b>" to control borrowing by members of Europe's proposed single currency. <p>
Demonstrations which began two weeks ago in Serbia's largest cities continued to weaken the grip of the president, <b>Slobodan Milosevic</b>. Independent trade unions, as well as supporters of opposition parties, began to take part in the protests. No compromise was in sight.<p>
The president of Slovakia, Michal Kovac, accused the government of <b>Vladimir Meciar </b>of--among other things--perpetrating "violence and physical liquidation" and "corrupting and criminalising state organs and political life".<p>
Public-sector workers went on strike in <b>Spain </b>to protest against the government's decision to freeze their salaries for the whole of 1997. The government said most people came to work as usual.<p>
<h2>Double fury</h2>
To the fury of <b>Israelis</b>, an Israeli woman settler and her 12-year-old son were shot dead by Arabs who then fled to Ramallah. To the fury of <b>Palestinians</b>, Jerusalem's municipality gave planning permission for 132 Jewish homes in the heart of Arab East Jerusalem.<p>
After a six-year gap, <b>Iraq's oil</b> began flowing through Turkey again. Under a <font size=-1>UN</font>-sponsored food-for-oil deal, Iraq can sell $2 billion-worth of oil over six months. Iraq's dispute with the <font size=-1>UN</font> over missile engines (which is holding up any wider lifting of sanctions) was "frozen" until February. <p>
<b>Ghanaians</b> re-elected their president, Jerry Rawlings, for one more term. In a reasonably fair election, the challenger, John Kufuor, won 40% of the vote.<p>
On its 50th birthday, the <font size=-1>UN</font> <b>Children's Fund </b>(<font size=-1>UNICEF</font>) called for an end to hazardous child labour. At least a quarter of the developing world's children work, and many will continue to do so until poverty is reduced. <p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
The United States protested at the inclusion of Hiroshima's peace dome--a ruin, preserved from 1945--among 35 new <b>World Heritage Sites</b> named by <font size=-1>UNESCO</font>. Others included national parks in Nigeria and China, a barrier reef off Belize, a group of medieval towns in Mauritania, and Russia's Lake Baikal.<p>
<h2>Core competence</h2>
Defining his second-term agenda in an address to the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, President Clinton said his first priority was to balance the budget. After that, he would work on welfare reform and campaign-finance reform. He spoke of creating "a vital and <b>dynamic centre </b>that is a place of action."<p>
The American government offered a $500,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the person who bombed the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta last summer. To avoid a libel lawsuit, <font size=-1>NBC</font> television agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to <b>Richard Jewell</b>, who was cleared in October of involvement in the bombing. <p>
For the eighth year running, <b>Los Angeles </b>was named by the Texas Transportation Institute as the most gridlocked city in America.<p>
In <b>Colombia</b>, deaths from guerrilla and paramilitary violence mounted. The government promised a crackdown on paramilitaries and a $1m reward for the capture of one notorious leader. So-called left-wing guerrillas made yet more conditions for freeing 60 captured soldiers. <p>
<b>Peru's legislature </b>passed a law, hastily put to it by President Alberto Fujimori, that freed retired General Rodolfo Robles from the military-justice system. At liberty, the general denounced the ambitions of the president.<p>
The <b>Bolivian government </b> privatised, in three chunks, parts of the state oil company, <font size=-1>YPFB</font>. It will still hold 50% of them, but through<p>
privately managed pension funds.<p>
<h2>Governing again</h2>
After nine weeks of post-election haggling, Jim Bolger begins his third term as <b>New Zealand's prime minister</b>, this time as head of a centre-right coalition. Winston Peters, who has sought curbs on Asian immigration, and has been critical of Mr Bolger's policies, became his deputy.<p>
In a Hong Kong vote by 400 prominent people chosen by China, Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate, was picked to be <b>Hong Kong's chief executive </b>when the British colony reverts to China in July 1997.<p>
The lower house of Australia's federal Parliament voted to overturn a law passed in the Northern Territory allowing voluntary <b>euthanasia</b>. The Senate will take a final decision on the issue.<p>
In a battle between rival <b>taxi firms </b>in Taipei ten drivers were hurt and 60 cars were smashed. In a taxi war last year, 300 cars were destroyed and 50 drivers injured.<p>

<h2>Holding pattern</h2>
 <h4><a href="bw1.gif">(See chart)</a></h4><p>
The Japanese government is set to lift the country's ban on holding companies. American occupation authorities forbad them in 1947 so as to break the hold of the <i>zaibatsu</i> (conglomerates). The catalyst for the change is the decision to split the world's largest company, <b>Nippon Telegraph & Telephone</b>, into three--all to be owned by one holding company. The change will allow Japanese companies to spread their liabilities and also shed excess capacity more readily.<p>
Germany's <b>Hoechst</b>, one of Europe's biggest drug and chemical groups, made an FFr18.1 billion ($3.5 billion) offer for the 43.3% of Roussel Uclaf it does not already own. Anticipation of the bid had driven up the French drug group's share price by 70% this year. Hoechst also plans to merge its DM6.5 billion ($4.2 billion) specialty-chemicals operations with Clariant, a Swiss chemical firm, creating a market leader.<p>
After a week of dithering, the French government announced <b>a new plan for Thomson</b>. It now says that next year it will privatise the troubled defense and consumer-electronics company in two parts. <p>
Homestake Mining is paying $2.3 billion for Santa Fe Pacific to create a <b>gold producer </b>in North America second only to Barrick Gold of Canada. An unwelcome bid from Newmont Mining for Santa Fe was earlier rejected.<p>
Britain's Monopolies Commission is to investigate the proposed takeover of <b>Carlsberg-Tetley</b> by <b>Bass</b>. The two combined would become the country's largest brewer with a 38% share of the beer market.<p>
The Australian Senate narrowly approved the A$8 billion ($6 billion) sale of one-third of <b>Telstra Corp</b>, the country's telecoms carrier. It will be the biggest share offering in the country's history. <p>
Aiming to hang on to its 12m cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> subscribers as competition from satellite-<font size=-1>TV</font> mounts, <b>Time Warner </b>is buying 1m new digital-<font size=-1>TV</font> set-top boxes, at a cost of around $400m. The new boxes will more than treble the average subscriber's choice of channels to about 175.<p>
<h2>Question:</h2>
"How do we know when<p>
<b>irrational exuberance</b> has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions?" The answer to Alan Greenspan was a bout of rational depression which continued to upset shares during the week after the Fed chairman's speech.<p>
Russia's main stockmarket regulator scored a modest, but important, point for <b>shareholder rights </b>when it insisted that Surgut Oil and Gas, one of the country's biggest energy firms, call off a controversial share-dilution scheme.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
In the first pay-out since the <b>Bank of Credit and Commerce International </b>was closed down by regulators five years ago, liquidators are paying out $1.35 billion to over 25,000 creditors, 24.5% of their losses. The final dividend is likely to be between 30% and 40%.<p>
<b>Aon Corporation</b> agreed to buy Alexander & Alexander Services, another American insurance broker. The deal, worth $1.2 billion, will create the world's biggest broker.<p>
<h2>Consuming less</h2>
 <h4><a href="bw2.gif">(See chart)</a></h4><p>
Sluggish consumer spending in North America and Europe this year has brought a sharper slowdown than expected in the growth in <b>world trade</b>, said a report released to coincide with the first ministerial gathering of the World Trade Organisation, held in Singapore. The <font size=-1>WTO</font> made some progress in its talks on liberalising trade in telecoms and technology. China also indicated that it would lower trade barriers to gain admittance to the <font size=-1>WTO</font>. <p>
The strong dollar produced America's largest-ever quarterly current-account<b> deficit</b>. It rose to $48 billion, 19% more than in the previous quarter, as quarterly merchandise exports fell for the first time in three years. Japan's current-account <b>surplus</b> in October was down 19.6% on the year, to &#165;367.4 billion ($3.27 billion), a sharper drop than predicted.<p>
<h2>Regrets, a few</h2>
The <b>industrial-espionage spat </b>between General Motors and Volkswagen shows no signs of ending peacefully. Ferdinand Piech, <font size=-1>VW</font>'s chairman, expressed regrets over the legal costs and the "confusion and anger", but did not apologise. An apology is a prerequisite, as far as <font size=-1>GM</font> is concerned, for an out-of-court settlement. <font size=-1>VW</font> also said 1996 profits and sales would be well up on last year. Meanwhile, German prosecutors indicted four <font size=-1>VW</font> employees, including Jose Ignacio Lopez, on criminal charges.<p>
The British government said the proposed alliance between <b>British Airways </b>and <b>American Airlines </b>would not face a monopolies inquiry if the two gave up 168 take-off and landing slots at London's main airport, Heathrow. <font size=-1>BA</font> has 3,100 slots there. Other American airlines said <font size=-1>BA</font>'s concessions were not enough. <p>
After years of wrangling, nine oil and gas companies, including America's Chevron and Russia's Lukoil, and the governments of Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman signed a $2 billion agreement to build a 1,440km (895 mile) <b>Caspian pipeline </b>that will connect remote but oil-rich western Kazakhstan with the Black Sea.<p>

<h1>And what Alice found there</h1>

<p><b>Europe's road to a single currency was mapped out in the Maastricht treaty. Or so you supposed. Germany says that one or two details still need sorting out</b></p><br>
THE criteria for entry into Europe's monetary union have a looking-glass quality: try for years to reach them and the goal recedes; do nothing and you're almost there. Like Alice, voters are baffled onlookers. And for European politicians, no image seems more appropriate than the White Rabbit. Like that flustered courtier, Helmut Kohl, Jacques Chirac and others are looking at their watches and muttering "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" as they scamper towards Wonderland. The cause of their nervousness is the timetable for <font size=-1>EMU</font> laid down in the Maastricht treaty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The treaty's biggest loophole--a provision that allowed the start of <font size=-1>EMU</font> to be postponed from 1997 until 1999--has already been exploited. The treaty now obliges all countries that meet the convergence criteria to lock their exchange rates irrevocably on the first day of 1999, in preparation for the adoption of a common currency, the euro, in 2002. Only Britain and Denmark are not bound by the plan. For the rest, the formal position is that the big decisions have already been taken. All that remains is to tie up some loose ends and let next year's figures on the convergence indicators take their course. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To which Alice retorted, "Stuff and nonsense!" More than you might think, given the timing, the nature of Europe's proposed monetary union remains far from clear. Its character--supposing it goes ahead at all--will be decided not just by the design laid down in the treaty, but also by the various fudges that governments will undertake between now and 1999.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most important adjustment will provoke fierce debate at the meeting of Europe's leaders which begins in Dublin on December 13th. Germany has decided that countries taking part in <font size=-1>EMU</font> must be placed under a permanent obligation--through a "stability pact"--to keep budget deficits low.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In doing this, it is stretching the terms of the Maastricht treaty. The convergence criteria specify that countries with budget deficits of more than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> will be ineligible for membership of <font size=-1>EMU</font>--unless the deficit is (a) "close" to the target and (b) either moving in the right direction or only "temporarily" too high. The treaty also obliges all governments to avoid "excessive deficits". As with the 3% threshold, this notion is defined flexibly. The drafters of the treaty foresaw a long and tortuous procedure before sanctions are applied to violators--persistent and egregious violators, it was assumed. The treaty justified these provisions by the need not to control deficits minutely, but to avoid "gross errors" in budgetary policy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was never envisaged that <font size=-1>EMU</font> members would be under a strict obligation to keep their deficits always (or nearly always) below 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, or that violators would face semi-automatic and massive fines. But that is what Germany has proposed. (As Alice told the king: "That's not a regular rule: you invented it just now." "It's the oldest rule in the book," said the king. "Then it ought to be number one," said Alice.") If a rule like the stability pact were adopted at Dublin or thereafter, it would affect Europe's monetary union profoundly.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Curiouser and curiouser</b></b><br>
According to the German formula (which is opposed by other countries, notably France), governments failing to keep their budget deficits below 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> would have to place "a deposit" with the European authorities. If the excess borrowing continued, the funds would be forfeit. Fines might be calculated at the rate of 0.2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> plus another 0.1% for every percentage point by which the deficit exceeded 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. A deficit of 6% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> would attract the maximum fine of 0.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>--an enormous sum.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be confident of hardly ever violating the 3%-of-<font size=-1>GDP</font> limit, governments would need to run budget surpluses during "normal" times, leaving room for borrowing to rise during recessions. In this way, the "automatic stabilisers" of fiscal policy would be allowed some scope to work.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Otherwise, it would be not a stability pact but a deepen-your-recession pact. Suppose a country with a deficit of 2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> (small by contemporary European standards) began moving into recession. To prevent the deficit rising above the ceiling, the government would need to cut spending and raise taxes--worsening the slowdown and putting further upward pressure on borrowing. In thinking about the scale of the needed fiscal adjustment, recall that when Britain moved from boom to recession at the end of the 1980s, the public sector's financial balance deteriorated by ten percentage points of <font size=-1>GDP</font>: from a surplus of 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> to a deficit of 7%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the government failed to hold borrowing at less than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, it would then have to pay a big fine-in-waiting to the European authorities. It could hardly be allowed to meet this impost by borrowing. If the rules allowed such a manoeuvre, they would be saying, in effect: borrowing to pay unemployment benefit is not allowed, but borrowing to pay the fine for borrowing to pay unemployment benefit is. This seems preposterous, even by <font size=-1>EU</font> standards. So the government would have to cut spending and raise taxes once more--all in the midst of a recession, by command of the European Union. If that is not enough to bring anti-Brussels protest on to the streets, what is?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The great peculiarity of the debate about the stability pact is that, so far, few if any advocates of closer political integration have recognised the danger that it poses to their vision of Europe's harmonious and ever closer union. This apparent complacency may reflect the conviction that, in practice, the rules would have to be waived. That seems to be what the French want: a flexible version of the pact. Many precedents for such flexibility have been set (more on the convergence criteria shortly). Even so, it seems odd to "strengthen" monetary union by writing rules that are acceptable only because no one expects them to be enforced.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Supporters of a stability pact reply that, if credible, it would deter governments from making a fiscal mess in the first place. Moreover, they say, there is a clear need for such a pact. In part, this is a matter of politics. German voters need to be convinced that the euro will be as strong as the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark they are about to surrender; otherwise they might simply reject <font size=-1>EMU</font>. A stability pact, by calling for better-than-German standards of public finance, offers reassurance that the euro will be solid.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A pact also seems to be needed for economic reasons. The argument goes as follows: once <font size=-1>EMU</font> begins, governments will find it easier to borrow more. At present a would-be heavy borrower--Italy, say--is limited by the size of its domestic capital market. If the Italian government wants to borrow more than this market is able to supply, it must borrow in a foreign currency, which exposes the government to exchange-rate risk. But with <font size=-1>EMU</font> in place, Italy's "domestic" capital market is suddenly much bigger: <font size=-1>EMU</font>-wide, in fact. The government can borrow far more than before without taking on any exchange-rate risk.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Supporters of a stability pact claim that special arrangements will be needed to prevent this increased capacity to borrow leading to all sorts of dangers. When Italy seizes its borrowing chance, they say, the cost will be shared with its <font size=-1>EMU</font> partners. The increase in Italy's borrowing will force interest rates higher across the union. In effect, it is argued that without a pact, the other countries will end up subsidising Italy to borrow too much. Finally, if all this were not enough, there is also the question of default-risk. The markets may calculate that <font size=-1>EMU</font> provides an implicit guarantee of its members' debts. If so, any risk premium on Italian debt will disappear, again encouraging the government to borrow more. And if this overborrowing does lead Italy to default, the other governments may indeed end up bailing it out. A stability pact may seem a plausible response to these dangers--and none too onerous, you might think, given that it appears to call for no more than good fiscal practice.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Beware the Jabberwock, my son</b></b><br>
Quite how onerous it proves to be depends on the details, which await the outcome of negotiations at the summit, or later. What can be said now is that Germany's first proposal went far beyond what most governments would regard as sound fiscal practice. It would appear not only to leave less scope for the operation of automatic stabilisers than nearly all economists would regard as wise; it would also leave less than the most fiscally conservative governments (including Germany's) have adopted in practice. To tie governments' hands as tightly as that seems downright dangerous--especially considering that, with currencies and interest rates locked together, fiscal policy under <font size=-1>EMU</font> will have to carry more of the burden of cushioning recessions than it does now.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What of the argument that some fiscal rules, even if less strict than the ones Germany would like, will be needed to check the greater temptation to borrow too much? This is less convincing than it seems at first sight. It is true that the advent of a euro capital market would make it possible for countries to borrow at lower exchange-rate risk. But this privilege comes at a heavy price: that of abandoning control of your monetary printing-press.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a many-currency Europe, currency risk goes hand in hand with the opportunity to reduce the real burden of debt by raising inflation: these are two sides of the same coin. In principle, one cannot say which effect of <font size=-1>EMU</font> would be greater--the effect of less exchange-rate risk (tending to raise borrowing) or the effect of denying governments inflation as a way to service their debts (tending to reduce it). In practice, the latter may well dominate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suppose, however, that some governments did borrow more. Would this force interest rates higher in other <font size=-1>EMU</font> countries, as advocates of the stability pact say? The effect, if any, would be small. The world's capital markets are increasingly integrated, forming a single pool. The euro capital market would be part of it. Higher borrowing by one or more European countries would therefore raise euro interest rates only (or almost only) to the extent that it raised world interest rates. And that would not be much: Europe's economies are too small to have much effect on the global demand for capital.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What if a country overborrowed so much that the markets feared it might default? Again, there is little danger that its <font size=-1>EMU</font> partners would suffer as a result--provided they had made it clear to the markets that there would be no bail-out. In that case, the default-risk premium would be loaded exclusively on to the debt of the over-borrower; there would be no free-riding. But the no-bail-out promise is essential. The Maastricht treaty explicitly forbids governments or the European central bank to come to a defaulter's rescue. If the markets doubt this promise, the default-risk premium may be spread more widely. And if governments themselves doubt it, they may be tempted to borrow more adventurously.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But having granted this, how much does the stability pact really help? Its advocates, notably Germany, are undermining the treaty's no-bail-out rule by suggesting there is a fiscal problem that needs solution at a European level, instead of by insisting that each country's fiscal stance is a matter for it and it alone. By doing that, they are adding to the moral hazard that the treaty was at pains to eliminate. Indeed, the outcome may be worse than this. Suppose governments and markets view the pact as a sign that, in extremis, there will indeed be a bail-out; suppose also that the markets think that the pact is either too weak to be any use or too strong to be enforceable. This would be the worst of all worlds: maximum incentive to cheat, minimum protection if anybody does.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Will you join the dance?</b></b><br>
The merits of the stability pact may be dubious (at best), but Germany's determination to write new rules for the conduct of governments once <font size=-1>EMU</font> begins is easy to understand. Its problem is that the convergence criteria will not, as it might once have hoped, divide the candidates for <font size=-1>EMU</font> neatly into solid citizens on one side and troublemakers on the other. If anybody needs reminding, the criteria are to be tested on figures for 1997, available in the spring of 1998, and are as follows:<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Inflation</b>: no more than one and a half percentage points higher than the average of the three best-performing states;<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Long-term interest rates</b>: no more than two points above the same benchmark;<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Budget deficit</b>: 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> or less;<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Public debt</b>: no more than 60% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>;<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Exchange rate</b>: observe the "normal margins" of the exchange-rate mechanism (<font size=-1>ERM</font>) for two years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next year, only Luxembourg will comply with all these criteria, on the strictest definition. For that reason, the criteria will be loosely applied. The need for fudge-room was anticipated in the treaty--and there is plenty. (The European Commission's attitude to the criteria is rather like Humpty Dumpty's to language: "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.<b>"</b>) <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The public-debt criterion, for instance, may be deemed met if "the ratio is sufficiently diminishing". "Sufficient for what?" you may ask. Sufficient to let you in, obviously. The budget criterion will also let you through, provided your deficit "comes close" to the threshold. Since 1993, the <font size=-1>ERM</font> bands have been widened to plus-or-minus 15%, so nobody is sure what "normal margins" means. Britain says this criterion is defunct (a view that would protect its option to join <font size=-1>EMU</font> in 1999). To be on the safe side, Italy and Finland resolved to enter the <font size=-1>ERM</font> this year, aiming to clock up two years inside before the start of 1999.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On top of this, there is scope for all manner of accounting fiddles. The European Commission is supposed to stop such jiggery-pokery, but it rarely meets a scam it doesn't like. Of the multiple dodges so far submitted to it by France, Spain, Belgium and Italy (to name just four), it has blocked only one, a Belgian wheeze. In September it ruled in favour of the biggest and most patently bogus manoeuvre yet. France T&eacute;l&eacute;com plans to pay the French government a sum equal to roughly 0.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> to take on its pension liabilities. This purports to reduce the budget deficit in 1997; plainly, it does nothing whatever to improve the French public finances. Somehow, the commission thought this was all right.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given flexibility of that sort, the convergence criteria could let in almost everybody; only Greece seems beyond the pale. Barring accidents, therefore, the list of members to be drawn up in April 1998 (when Britain, by the way, will have the presidency) will be a matter of ticklish diplomatic negotiation, not disinterested statistical scrutiny.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The treaty says that the commission and the European Monetary Institute (forerunner of the new central bank) will report on whether the criteria have been met, and the commission will recommend countries for admission. Finally, heads of government will, by qualified-majority vote, make the choice. The scope for tactical voting-- for instance, Spain and Italy seeking to block France's entry unless they are let in too--promises some fine entertainment. ("<i>Everybody </i>has won, and <i>all </i>must have prizes.") Then, the decisions may be subject to challenge in the courts. Recall that Germany's constitutional court almost blocked ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The scrum of 1998 will make the Maastricht process look like a model of judicial propriety. At the end of it, Germany could have some monetary partners it would rather be without.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Sentence first--verdict afterwards</b></b><br>
Germany's doubts about its future partners may be understandable: in economic terms, the country has more to lose from monetary union than any other. Yet those doubts conspire to make a successful <font size=-1>EMU</font> much harder to achieve. The stability pact, one expression of those doubts, could easily misfire, turning popular opinion against the whole idea. But that is not the only way in which German anxieties could undermine the great German vision.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if all goes well until <font size=-1>EMU</font>'s participants are chosen in 1998, Europe's single-currency design will still be acutely vulnerable between then and 2002. According to the Maastricht timetable, exchange rates will be locked at the start of 1999. Exactly how they will be locked poses something of a dilemma. If the authorities leave the fixing of rates until the last moment, speculation may cause a lot of exchange-rate turbulence in the very months or weeks before <font size=-1>EMU</font> starts. If instead the rates were announced in advance, as some propose, everything would depend on the credibility of Europe's monetary authorities. If they retain the markets' confidence, speculation could help pin exchange rates at the preannounced levels; if not, the preannounced parities might be attacked just as the old <font size=-1>ERM</font> was--with similar results.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problems will continue, and perhaps worsen, once exchange rates have been fixed "irrevocably", at whatever parities, at the start of 1999. The plan proposes that national currencies will then stay in circulation for another three years, until the euro replaces them in 2002. Surely, you might think, this cannot be tenable: denied even the flexibility of the old <font size=-1>ERM</font> (in which currencies were allowed some freedom to move), this system will surely yield to speculative attack. Europe's planners say it will not. By this point, Europe's new central bank, the <font size=-1>ECB</font>, will have taken command of monetary policy: national central banks will be acting on its instructions. This, it is argued, makes all the difference.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suppose that the French start swapping their francs for <font size=-1>D</font>-marks. The <font size=-1>ECB</font> will simply order more <font size=-1>D</font>-marks, and fewer francs, to be issued. The crucial thing is that it would be willing, and perceived to be willing, to do this without limit--that is, until the entire stock of francs had been converted into <font size=-1>D</font>-marks. This prompts an obvious question: would Germany and its Bundesbank go along with this? Or do they regard the period between 1999 and 2002 as a last chance to change their minds about the whole idea? Any suspicion of the latter could give markets the incentive they need to test the system to destruction. As with the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, the expectation of a change of parities--and, with that, the end of this plan for monetary union-- would become self-fulfilling.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is the stability-pact zeal of the German government a sign of steely confidence that <font size=-1>EMU</font> will happen, and be done well? Or is it a sign of second thoughts, an intimation that things are not turning out as Mr Kohl hoped? He himself may not yet know the answer--but a lot depends on it. As the Red Queen warned Alice: "When you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences."<br>

<p><b>North-east politics</b></p>
<h1>Fog on the Tyne, Newcastle cut off</h1>

<font size=1>NEWCASTLE</font><p>
THE great iron lattice-work bridges arching across the River Tyne are Newcastle's most famous landmarks. Though outsiders do not much notice it, they also span the frontier between the city and its smaller and poorer cousin on the south bank-- Gateshead. And, lately, more than just commuters have been flowing across the bridges. Gateshead has been winning prestige projects in the north-east of England that in previous years would have gone to Newcastle as the regional capital. The divided Labour group that runs Newcastle seems incapable of putting up a united front to stop this drain.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest bout of irritation on the north bank has emerged with the realisation that Gateshead is inching ever closer to achieving what seemed a distant dream a few years back--creating the biggest exhibition and performance space for the contemporary arts outside London. If this happens, it will be because Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council has stepped in while Newcastle City Council dithers. Last month, Northern Arts struck a deal with the Gateshead council to build a &#163;35m music centre to house a music school, two concert halls, and the Northern Sinfonia orchestra.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Newcastle had turned down Northern Arts, balking at the prospect of having to cough up &#163;200,000 a year for the running costs of the centre. "We didn't get a formal business plan, and without one you could run into long-term revenue problems," explains Tony Flynn, leader of Newcastle City Council. Gateshead was not given a business plan either, but nevertheless reckoned it was worth the gamble.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The money to build the centre has yet to be awarded by the National Lottery, but the signs are that it will be handed out. It also looks likely to be forthcoming for a &#163;46m scheme to convert the disused Baltic Flour Mill, next door to the music centre site, into a contemporary-art gallery. The Arts Council has already spent &#163;480,000 on a study which suggests the plan is workable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But far from applauding these Gateshead initiatives which Newcastle's people will be able to use without paying any extra council tax, Newcastle councillors seem decidedly surly about them. Colin Gray, chairman of the finance committee, snorted in a letter to a local paper, the <i>Journal</i>, that the music centre was "the new sex symbol of the chattering classes" and that matters of "true regional significance", such as improvements to the <font size=-1>A</font>1, were being sacrificed. Other councillors have sniffed at Gateshead's plans for a footbridge to make it easier for Newcastle citizens to get to the arts centres as unnecessary and liable to damage the view of the Tyne Bridge.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Flynn protests that these comments caricature Newcastle council's official position, which supports the arts centres and the footbridge. It is simply, he says, that the council is worried about adding more burdens to its revenue budget, which had to be cut by &#163;8m this year.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other councillors, however, tell a different story, of how the ruling Labour group has split into different factions since Sir Jeremy Beecham quit in 1994 after 17 years as leader. East-end and west-end groups are fighting for more cash for their respective parts of the city, an old guard does not see eye-to-eye with new councillors, and all seem unable to unite over common interests. "There is still a power vacuum. Flynn cannot get things through the group," says one councillor. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The indecision is making life difficult for Sir John Hall, who is looking for a site to build a new stadium for Newcastle United Football Club. After various clandestine meetings between the club and different council factions, the council eventually agreed to ask Sir John to submit a plan for a stadium on part of the Town Moor, open ground to the north of the city centre.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has been vigorously criticised by people who live nearby. Sir John, aware that council politics might scupper this scheme, has let it be known that it is looking at other sites, including one in Gateshead. George Gill, leader of Gateshead council who has known Sir John since the football-club owner made his fortune out of the Metrocentre shopping complex in Gateshead, says the two have had only an informal chat. But, he adds, "We have got the facilities for them."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sir John may only be using the threat of Gateshead to goad Newcastle into making a decision. Building arts centres is bad enough, but the mere thought of having to cross the Tyne to watch Newcastle United is enough to make any city Magpie fan sick into his brown ale.<br>

<p><b>National Lottery</b></p>
<h1>Bookies raise the stakes</h1>

THOSE Britons not hoping for a share of the National Lottery's enormous winnings seem to have their eyes fixed on the enormous profits earned by the lottery's operator, Camelot. The Labour Party has announced that after Camelot's franchise runs out, it will either cap the next operator's profits or hand over the lottery to a non-profit-making outfit. The Virgin group has long offered to hand over a higher proportion of earnings to worthy causes in an effort to secure the franchise. Many charities argue that they deserve a bigger share. Now Britain's bookmakers have devised a scheme to win back the slice of the winnings they have lost to Camelot.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since it was launched two years ago, bookmakers have complained that the lottery lures their clients away with huge jackpots, reducing their profits. A study by the Henley Centre, a consultancy, calculated that the betting industry lost nearly 3,000 employees, 400 shops and &#163;47m in profits during the lottery's first year. A reduction in betting duty in the 1996 budget offset the worst of the downturn, but did not restore earlier profit levels. So in an effort to regain some of the lost ground, the three biggest bookmakers, Coral, William Hill, and Ladbroke's, will launch a daily rival to the National Lottery on December 16th.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doing so has not been easy. When the government devised the lottery, it took great pains to safeguard the monopoly of the franchisee. Apart from Camelot, only charities and private clubs are allowed to run lotteries. The former can sell a maximum of &#163;1m of tickets, while the latter can cater only to members. Prevented from running a lottery themselves, the bookmakers might ordinarily just take bets on the outcome of Camelot's, as they do on the result of the Irish national lottery. But the government closed that loophole too.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now bookmakers think they can get round these regulations (Camelot disagrees) with a new daily draw, called 49's. Although it follows the format of the National Lottery closely, with six winning numbers drawn from a pool of 49 (hence the name), it will not technically be a lottery, since betting shops will not sell any tickets. Instead, they will take fixed-odds bets on the outcome of the draw. This method seems to evade the side-betting ban too, because although the 49's draws may vividly resemble those of the National Lottery, they will be completely separate. Basically, bookmakers will take side bets on a lottery-style event of their own devising.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 49's draw comes with all the trimmings. <font size=-1>SIS</font>, a company which broadcasts racing to betting shops, will televise the daily draw. Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm, is monitoring the proceedings, while Group4 will handle security. Any betting shop can participate for a weekly fee of &#163;5; about 7,000 have already signed up. The organisers aim initially to capture 2% of the industry turnover, or roughly &#163;120m a year.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus, 49's does exactly what the government hoped it had prevented: it creates a non-charitable rival to the National Lottery. Unhampered by the financial burden of shelling out to charities, the betting-shops can offer bigger prizes than the National Lottery. They might therefore entice customers away from Camelot.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But bookies point out that many people placing side bets on the Irish lottery also buy tickets for the main event. Anyway, the British lottery is likely to dwarf 49's. Camelot brings in more revenue in two weeks than the bookmakers expect to in a year, and is starting a second weekly draw.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government might have prevented this challenge to the lottery if it had offered another cut in betting duty or simply caved in over side-betting. But 49's, once launched, is unlikely to disappear. Nor will the saga end there: as long as the National Lottery continues to make money, it will continue to attract competitors hoping to win their own jackpot.<br>

<p><b>Police powers</b></p>
<h1>Breeding bugs</h1>

THE government is full of new schemes to crack down on crime: handgun bans, stalking laws, mandatory sentencing, combat-knife regulation and so on. On top of all this, the Police bill currently making its way through Parliament will increase police powers to combat organized crime. Labour, keen to jump on the bandwagon, has lent its support. The police and public also seem to welcome all moves which promise greater security. But a handful of law lords are giving warning that the bill will hit civil liberties harder than it will criminals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most contentious clause deals with surveillance, especially bugging. Under the new law, chief constables could authorise bugging without needing to seek a judge's approval, if they thought it might help solve a "serious" crime. The person bugged need not be a suspected criminal--just someone who might reveal some useful information. The only external supervision would come from a senior judge, who would review buggings after the event to check that the police had not exceeded their powers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill's supporters argue that it does nothing more than give a legal footing to a common practice. In 1995 the police in England and Wales used such surveillance techniques 1,300 times, following Home Office guidelines in place since 1985. And regulating this practice is really just a precaution, they argue, since few complaints have been made against the police under the current system, and none upheld. <font size=-1>MI</font>5<t--mode> </t--mode> has similar powers, and nobody makes a fuss about that. To insist that the police get a warrant from a judge first would simply introduce an unnecessary complication into the procedure; anyway, there is always a trade-off between preserving freedoms and reducing crime.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the sceptical law lords put the opposite interpretation on the same facts. Just because bugging has gone on for a decade without any legal sanction, that is not a good reason to make it legal now. To them, 1,300 seems an alarmingly large figure, while the scarcity of complaints simply indicates how few people even realise they are being listened to. <font size=-1>MI</font>5 has to get permission from the home secretary to place a bug, whereas police officers will only need to go to their chief constable.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And on top of that inconsistency, an open police search of private property will still require a warrant, but a secret one now will not. As for the argument that applying to a judge would be too complicated, the law lords point out that the police manage to go to judges for certain warrants at the moment, and there is no reason why this should not be extended. Behind all this lies the value the objectors place on privacy, liberty and due process of law. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite these objections, the bill looks set to sail through Parliament, since both the government and opposition support it, and there is not enough cross-bench enthusiasm to scupper it in the Lords. But the issue may come back in a more embarrassing form. Liberty, a civil liberties advocacy group, believes the bill violates provisions on privacy and the right to judicial redress in the European Convention on Human Rights. So Labour, if it forms the next government, might find itself having supported a measure which violates a set of rules it has promised to incorporate into British law.<br>

<p><b>Privatisation</b></p>
<h1>Her Majesty's Shambles</h1>

THE National Audit Office, the watchdog of the nation's accounts, is about to announce that it will conduct an inquiry into the sale of Her Majesty's Stationery Office (<font size=-1>HMSO</font>), the government's 200-year-old publisher. Charges that its privatisation was a political fix are now being tossed around the City and Westminster.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These suspicions are fuelled by the eventual sale price--&#163;54m, which was at least &#163;10m lower than other final offers, and a third of the original forecast. Labour's civil-service spokesman, Derek Foster, describes the sale as "a sweetheart deal for their [the Tory government's] friends". Some disappointed bidders agree. The head of one of the consortia claims that he offered and is still prepared to pay more than double what the company was eventually sold for. "None of us felt this sale was evenly handled," he says.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The winning bid was put together by Electra, an investment trust, and Robert Fleming, an investment bank, and chaired by a former editor of <i>The Economist</i>, Rupert Pennant-Rea. It was not short of political friends. Lord King, a former cabinet minister, is on Electra's board. The investment company's deputy chairman, Lord Vinson, is a founding director of the Centre for Policy Studies, a Thatcherite think-tank. Robert Fleming employs a former Tory chief whip, Tim Renton, as a parliamentary consultant. The two companies have together donated nearly &#163;600,000 to the Conservatives in recent years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But proof of a political fix requires more than friends in high places. The evidence suggests not so much a conspiracy as an expensive cock-up.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the government put the company up for sale a year ago at the insistence of the deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine, the prospectus boasted that <font size=-1>HMSO</font> was "a modern business with a prestigious history" with sales in excess of &#163;375m, employing 2,900 staff in a network of offices, warehouses, print factories and bookshops. There were 14 indicative bids ranging up to &#163;175m. Four consortia were eventually shortlisted led by Mercury Asset Management, Hambros, Electra Fleming and NatWest Ventures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then things started to go wrong. A six-week round of site visits by the short-listed bidders revealed over-staffed offices and impenetrable accounts. The company had been divided into 14 separate business units, but its accounting systems had not kept pace. A &#163;19m hole was discovered in intra-company trading accounts. Despite the efforts of several teams of accountants, nobody could find the money. One of the bidders described the company's finances as "a bloody dog's dinner".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The disclosure in April that <font size=-1>HMSO</font> had lost &#163;3m on a contract with Uzbekistan because it had shipped goods without securing a letter of credit provided an early warning of problems. But the bidders were astonished at the scale of the chaos. A warehouse in Manchester was stuffed with 100m tax forms printed without changes that the Inland Revenue required. Personal computers were being stockpiled because too many had been ordered. Four properties turned up which were not even on the books. "The business was as badly run as any I have ever seen," said one of the bidders.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, the final offers were lower than the original ones. The eventual winner, Electra Fleming, is understood to have bid around &#163;70m, about &#163;5m-8m more than the consortia led by Mercury Asset Management and NatWest Ventures. But after Electra was declared the preferred bidder, a further round of negotiations led to another 20% being shaved off the price before a deal was finally struck on September 10th. This last-minute haggling has given rise to grumbles of preferential treatment. But given the state of <font size=-1>HMSO</font>'s accounts, it is likely that all of the bidders would have sought to renegotiate. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more serious charge is that the company should not have been sold in such an unsatisfactory condition. The minister handling the sale, Roger Freeman, defends the timing, pointing out that the company's financial position was deteriorating. <font size=-1>HMSO</font>, he says, urgently needed a massive change which only privatisation could provide. But the government could undoubtedly have got a lot more money if it had not allowed <font size=-1>HMSO</font> to get into such a shambles in the first place.<br>

<h1>Copywrongs</h1>

LIKE Chicken Little waiting for the sky to fall on his head, Internet enthusiasts wander around waiting for the death of the Net. The latest threat comes from the World Intellectual Property Organisation, which is in the middle of a three-week conference to replace the outdated Berne Convention on copyright. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three new treaties are being proposed--two about copyright of music and artistic works (which covers computer software) and one about databases. The supposed danger: the proposed changes will throttle the flow of information on the Internet, end the notion of "fair use" for educational and personal copies, and make companies that provide access to the Internet liable for copyright infringements.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So will the 156 delegates really have choked the Internet by the time they adjourn on December 20th? The answer is no. But the scaremongers include groups as diverse as the American Association for the Advancement of Science and some of America's biggest telephone companies. Most of them are frightened by the idea that temporary copies of documents--created ten-a-penny automatically during Web browsing--should, under the letter of the treaties, be treated as infringements of copyright. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Computer companies have a particular complaint. They are aghast at another article under negotiation, which proposes banning devices that might circumvent copyright-protection systems. As this could conceivably cover a typical multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font> with sufficient brainpower to manipulate sound and video information, it has enraged <font size=-1>IBM</font>, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A total ban on temporary copying is unlikely to survive in the treaty. "No one wants to stop use of the Internet," says Bruce Lehman, the assistant secretary of commerce who heads the American delegation. Some of the criticisms have been addressed: Norway and Israel have suggested amendments tackling temporary copies which (in their roundabout legalese) exclude the sort of incidental copying that occurs during Web browsing. But the central question remains unresolved: how to ensure that copyright is protected as more information travels upon computer networks without unnecessarily draconian measures?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The solution to that is unlikely to come out of Geneva. What may well emerge is a sensible framework around which future protection and exemptions to copyright can be created. The sky may, after all, stay up for a while longer.<br>

<p><b>Technopolist IBM</b></p>
<h1>Humbled, not hobbled</h1>

<p><b>The days when IBM ruled the computer world are gone, but it still dominates its rich traditional markets. So what happened to the complaints?</b></p><br>
IT WAS not long ago that the name of <font size=-1>IBM</font> was practically synonymous with the word "monopoly". The computer giant's dominance of the mainframe market it created made it one of America's most successful companies. By the early 1980s, pressure from trustbusters had forced it to split off its services arm to stop complaints that it was abusing its dominance. Yet, even as the lawyers were signing the final documents, <font size=-1>IBM</font> was losing its grip: it was being overtaken in the computing marketplace at large by the companies that grew up around the personal computer, a technology launched by <font size=-1>IBM</font> but no longer under its sway.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, the <font size=-1>PC</font> market is the empire of Microsoft and Intel. But the world mainframe market is still worth a tidy $8 billion a year, and is even growing again. There, <font size=-1>IBM</font> is still as dominant as ever. Despite decades of competition from two Japanese firms, Hitachi and Fujitsu, <font size=-1>IBM</font> has never had less than 70% of the world mainframe market. This year its share will be around 83%, according to Annex Research, a consultancy in Phoenix, Arizona. Its clout has more to do with the nature of the business than with any great technological superiority. Unlike <font size=-1>PC</font>s, mainframes cost millions of dollars each; so decisions, once taken, cost a fortune to reverse. Suppliers and customers therefore tend to mate for life. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dominant though <font size=-1>IBM</font> is in mainframe hardware, it is even more so in software. Indeed, were <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s software division a stand-alone company, it would be by far the biggest software firm in the world. Its mainframe software business is 50% larger than its hardware business, and had revenues of $9.6 billion in 1995 (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Overall, <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s software sales (including software for minicomputers and <font size=-1>PC</font>s) were worth $12.7 billion last year, almost 50% more than Microsoft's total (see <a href="wb2.gif">table</a>). <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although <font size=-1>IBM</font> is the market leader in most of the software markets it is in, from transaction processing to "groupware" (thanks to its purchase of Lotus and its "Notes" software), it has plenty of competition from other software firms such as Oracle (in databases) and Computer Associates (in system-management software). The one exception is the operating systems that run the machines. Here <font size=-1>IBM</font> has an almost total monopoly--more absolute, indeed, than Microsoft's monopoly on the <font size=-1>PC</font>. <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s <font size=-1>OS/390</font> operating system has almost all the market for <font size=-1>IBM</font>-compatible mainframes outside Japan, where Hitachi and Fujitsu sell their own operating systems.<br>
</p><p><b><b>True Blue</b></b><br>
The Microsoft comparison is apt in some ways. <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s <font size=-1>OS/390</font> business brings in $2 billion a year in annual sales--about the same as Microsoft brings in annually from its Windows family of operating systems for <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Yet there is one big difference between the two: for most of this decade Microsoft has endured almost constant antitrust investigations. <font size=-1>IBM</font>, on the other hand, has had little trouble from the trustbusters this decade: indeed, the 1983 restrictions quietly expired earlier this year. Nobody now seems to worry much about <font size=-1>IBM</font> the monopolist. Why not?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The simple answer is that the mainframe and <font size=-1>PC</font> markets are different. Microsoft's critics have accused it of modifying its Windows operating system to make its own application software look better, thus using its dominance in one market to grab another. True or not, the same accusation is rarely levelled at <font size=-1>IBM</font>. That is because <font size=-1>IBM</font> still sees itself primarily in the business of selling hardware. If it tinkered with its operating system to make it work less well with other firms' programs, its customers might simply stop buying <font size=-1>IBM</font> machines.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, <font size=-1>IBM</font> now has more competition than its market share reveals. This competition is not within the mainframe market, but outside it, in the increasing range of other machines that can do much of what a mainframe does. In the early 1980s, most big companies had little real choice. The <font size=-1>PC</font> was at best an unknown quantity, at worst an underpowered novelty. Minicomputers could not handle enough users. Yet today, top-of-the-range <font size=-1>PC</font>s, connected in "client-server" networks, can do better than both for many jobs. (These networks can even do the jobs of supercomputers: see <a href="st4096.html">page</a>)<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout the first half of the 1990s, this Lilliput-like attack by <font size=-1>PC</font>s drastically reduced demand for mainframes (today sales are at just half their 1989 peak). This drove <font size=-1>IBM</font> almost to bankruptcy. But the company responded by slashing prices and developing new mainframes that shared many of their components (such as memory) with <font size=-1>PC</font>s, thus benefiting from the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry's economies of scale. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These price cuts were felt most strongly in the operating-system market--the one area in which <font size=-1>IBM</font> had appeared to extract monopoly rents. Having first given away its operating-system software for free, <font size=-1>IBM</font> took to charging for it in the 1980s with a vengeance. Prices rose by more than 30% a year for much of the 1980s, says Annex's Bob Djurdjevic, rising 19-fold over the decade. Eventually they reached a point where the average large firm might be paying more than $20,000 a month per mainframe for a licence to use the software, which remained <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s property. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since 1990, when the mainframe market began to slide, this gouging has stopped. Prices have fallen slightly. One prompt came in 1993 when Louis Gerstner became the firm's chief executive: he ordered discounts to spur mainframe sales. But the real reason for the firm's newly competitive prices is the emergence of <font size=-1>PC</font> networks as a threat to the mainframe.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now the company is trying to turn the arrival of networked <font size=-1>PC</font>s to its advantage. The most important part of a networked system is the centralised server that holds collective data and programs. High-end <font size=-1>PC</font>s can serve several dozen users simultaneously within an office, but when companies apply the same principles to their Internet connection, they often find that they need more capacity: customers and sightseers are sure to outnumber employees. <font size=-1>IBM</font> has been quick to remind them that mainframes can accommodate hundreds or thousands of users. To make the point, it now calls its mainframes "superservers".<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to make a pitch for that market, <font size=-1>IBM</font> has had to make its machines talk to other machines more easily. Moving to "open interfaces" such as the Internet's communications standards can give mainframes a new life, but John Thompson, <font size=-1>IBM</font>'s software chief, argues that it also carries a risk. The better a mainframe fits into the rest of the computing world, the more the distinctions between types of machines blur, and the more easily any one can be replaced with another. This competition, argues Mr Thompson, helps keeps <font size=-1>IBM</font> honest: it cannot count on customer loyalty forever.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Mr Thompson puts it, "It's not illegal to be dominant. It's illegal to abuse your dominance." Today, <font size=-1>IBM</font> looks like a model citizen in that respect. It keeps its prices down and its standards largely open. But this kinder, gentler <font size=-1>IBM</font> is a creature of pragmatism, chastened by its brush with bankruptcy. The markets it dominates are blurring into markets where it has hardly any share at all. If <font size=-1>IBM</font> looks like a benevolent monopoly today, that may be because the company is seeing its dominant position being eroded from the outside. <br>

<p><b>Supercomputers</b></p>
<h1>Divide and conquer</h1>

<p><b>Might a network of personal computers prove to be as formidable a number- cruncher as a supercomputer?</b></p><br>
THE rapacious curve of Moore's Law (expounded by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel) states that the density of components on a silicon chip doubles every 18 months. Thus, today's <font size=-1>PC</font>s are faster and cheaper than last year's models and will, no doubt, look clunky and over-priced compared with next year's.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, some computing tasks will still stump tomorrow's desktop computers. The reason is simply one of speed. Some jobs (such as forecasting the weather and modelling nuclear explosions) require astronomical numbers of calculations. Performing them on a <font size=-1>PC</font> is possible in theory--but the result would arrive several million years after the weather it was intended to forecast or the war it was meant to forestall. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment these sorts of chores can be carried out only by giant supercomputers. These are far quicker, but also much more expensive. For instance, America's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (which, since the moratorium on real nuclear explosions, is restricted to testing bombs in cyberspace) recently ordered a new supercomputer from <font size=-1>IBM</font> that will be able to do 3 trillion numerical calculations per second. The best desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s can barely produce one ten-thousandth of that. But 10,000 desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s cost less than $20m. <font size=-1>IBM</font> is charging $93m for its machine.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ideal solution, then, would be to link lots of small <font size=-1>PC</font>s so that they can perform bigger tasks together (especially as many <font size=-1>PC</font>s are idle for much of the day). At first sight this seems a simple matter of replicating a machine that already has several brains. Many of the latest supercomputers are not the single-processor machines that Seymour Cray, the doyen of the subject, once made so famous. They are "parallel computers": linked arrays of microprocessors (or "nodes") similar to those that lie at the heart of humble desktop drudges.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, making a parallel computer out of linked <font size=-1>PC</font>s instead of nodes all linked inside the same box is tricky. To begin with, the number of nodes matters (regardless of whether they are housed in one box or spread out across a network). A calculation designed to run on a computer with, say, 64 nodes typically has to be rewritten for a computer with 128 nodes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficulty lies in the software. Breaking a problem into meaningful sub-problems, allocating them to different processors, co-ordinating the processors so that the answers come out in the correct order, and then stitching the sub-answers together to arrive at a conclusion, is a programming nightmare. Programming the largest of the modern parallel supercomputers, with up to 2,048 nodes, is ghastly. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Programmers, though, are rising to the challenge. In the summer of 1995 around 200 volunteers co-ordinated by Piete Brooks, at the University of Cambridge, deciphered a message encrypted using a secret code. They employed a motley assortment of machines, including Apple Macintoshes, "Windows"-based <font size=-1>PC</font>s and Hewlett-Packard workstations, to break the code in 32 hours. A single <font size=-1>PC</font> would have taken 200 times as long to do it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the problem solved by Dr Brooks and his crew was not that difficult. It was "loosely coupled": the crackers knew that the secret code had to be just one of 1,099,511,627,776 combinations. All they needed to do was work through each one until someone reached the answer. The more volunteers, the sooner the answer could be expected to arrive.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, dividing most problems into separate chunks is less easy: the result from one part of, say, a weather forecast affects the result in another part. This is why the programs used to solve such "tightly-coupled" problems have to know in advance how many processors are available, what they are, and how they speak to each other. And, in tightly-coupled problems, the speed (or lack of it) at which processors can communicate is a serious constraint--the networks connecting <font size=-1>PC</font>s can significantly slow down inter-processor chats.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Andrew Grimshaw reckons he is close to solving these difficulties. His system, Legion, is an attempt to build a "virtual" parallel computer across the Internet. Legion's particular strength is that it can co-ordinate several different types of computers, including old-style supercomputers, modern parallel computers, workstations and desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s. The existing system at the University of Virginia, for instance, uses more than 100 computers from several different manufacturers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Legion also looks like a single computer to its users. A set of programs, which Dr Grimshaw calls "metasystems software", hides the quirks of its constituent machines and the network connecting them. Instead, Legion works out where and when to perform particular calculations on its network. To reduce delays in communications between processors, Legion prefers its machines to have fast network connections (some of them use a proprietary system 80 times faster than a typical university network). If, however, such connections are not available, it will simply change the order in which it processes particular requests so as to minimise delays. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Grimshaw's approach does not produce a computer that is as well-designed for solving tightly-coupled problems as a normal parallel computer. All the same, Legion has been used successfully to solve fluid-dynamics calculations--classic examples of tightly-coupled problems--which are generally difficult for networks of workstations to manage. Biochemists at the University of Virginia have been able to enlist Legion's help to discover the structure of new proteins. And above all, unlike a real supercomputer, Legion can easily grow: each new <font size=-1>PC</font> adds a little bit more to its virtual power. Sometimes the best way to become faster is to grow slowly.<br>

<h1 align=center>Spoiling world trade</h1>


BY THE sorry standards of much of this century, world trade looks in rude health. In the 1930s,
protectionism helped poison the world economy. After the second world war, tariffs and other trade
barriers fell too slowly. However, over the past decade, many of the restrictions that stifle international
commerce have been relaxed--thanks in large part to the lengthy Uruguay round of <font
size=-1>GATT</font> talks, completed in 1993. Since 1990 world trade has grown by 6% a year,
compared with less than 4% a year in the 1980s. As if to confirm the importance that governments now
attach to the subject, there is now a World Trade Organisation (<font size=-1>WTO</font>), with 126
members, to police the new regime and to take the cause of free trade further into areas where there are
still far too many restrictions, such as agriculture, services and investment.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From this perspective, the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s first big
ministerial meeting, which starts on December 9th in Singapore, is going to seem disappointing. Ministers
are preparing to squabble publicly over all manner of things--from the pace of trade reform to the terms on
which China should be admitted to the <font size=-1>WTO</font> (see <a href="sf0797.html">pages</a>). On
the last day there will be a bland communiqu&eacute; of some sort, which will do nothing to beat back the
protectionists that lurk in America and Western Europe. However, the greatest damage in Singapore will not
be done by what is said, but what is left almost unmentioned: the threat that "regionalism" poses to global
trade.<br> </p><p><b><b>When the feasible is the enemy of the good</b></b><br> Thanks to the recent
explosion of regional trade arrangements, whose members agree to liberalise trade among themselves, the
<font size=-1>WTO</font> is just one cook among many stirring the free-trade broth. Only a handful of the
<font size=-1>WTO</font>'s members are not already part of some other local club. The European Union has
15 members and could soon have more. Some Americans are already looking for ways to meld together the
North American Free-Trade Agreement (<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>), which was formed with Mexico and
Canada, with Mercosur, a customs union formed by four South American countries. Free-trade areas are
planned in both South-East Asia and South Asia. And the 19-strong Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
(<font size=-1>APEC</font>) forum has a grand plan for "free trade in the Pacific" by 2020.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Put this way, it sounds like something to applaud. <i>The Economist
</i>has given qualified support to many of these agreements as and when they have appeared. What is it
about their cumulative effect that should give pause for thought?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most governments and many free traders believe that regional
free-trade areas are a step in the right direction. Their defence is usually a mixture of economic principle,
practical diplomacy and visionary politics. First, they ask, how can it be possible for countries to agree to
scrap tariffs among themselves and not make trade freer? Then they argue that it is often easier to make a
deal in a small group than in the unwieldy <font size=-1>WTO</font>. And, finally, trade agreements, they
say, are politically valuable: if countries are tied by commerce, they are less likely to start shooting at
each other.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first of these arguments, plausible as it
seems, is simply false. Regional "free-trade areas" need not make trade freer. By liberalising trade only
with their neighbours, countries are by definition discriminating against those not lucky enough to be in the
local club. Some goods will be imported from other members of the free-trade area at the expense of
producers elsewhere; and members will begin to specialise in industries in which they lack comparative
advantage.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus, the <font size=-1>EU</font> has a bloated
farming industry while many producers in poorer countries suffer from not being able to serve its markets;
and <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> has complicated "rules of origin" requirements, stipulating how much of a
car needs to be made in Mexico to qualify as "<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>n", and so enter America
tariff-free. It is always better to liberalise without discrimination than to open up only to neighbours;
sometimes, selective opening is worse than doing nothing at all.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument that, despite this danger, regional trade areas
represent a speedier, more practical way to proceed than does the <font size=-1>WTO</font>, is also open
to question. True, the Uruguay round lasted more than seven years, and even now governments are
struggling to finish off some outstanding negotiations, but slow progress bedevils regional arrangements,
too. Despite much talk about expansion, the membership of <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> is stuck at three.
<font size=-1>APEC</font> is moving at a glacial pace. Similarly, although the local clubs sometimes
broach subjects long before the <font size=-1>WTO</font> (for instance, <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> has
a treaty on foreign direct investment), they can also introduce possible bugbears (<font
size=-1>NAFTA</font> also contains worrying agreements on standards for labour and environmental
protection).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the standard against which each
regional trade pact needs to be measured has, mercifully, been raised. Back in the 1950s, the idea of a
customs union in Europe (even if it was linked to an idea as awful as the common agricultural policy) was
attractive because the alternative (no customs union at all) was plainly worse. Now, the emergence of the
<font size=-1>WTO</font> has raised the hurdle: the architects of regional agreements know they will have
to defend their plans against the charge of setting back liberal trade, and adjust their plans accordingly.
That is fine, but it raises a question: would it not be simpler, after all, to make these deals at the <font
size=-1>WTO</font>? <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That leaves the last "political"
argument--that bodies such as <font size=-1>APEC</font> and Mercosur have brought old enemies
together. So they have. Again, however, would this be any less true of broader multilateral agreements?
And there are limits to how far the goal of international amity, worthy as it is, should be used to justify
economic lunacy. Invoking France's post-war friendship with Germany seems an odd way to defend the <font
size=-1>EU</font>'s limits on imports of Argentine chocolate.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If governments paid more attention to the threat of regionalism,
that would be an excellent start. One excuse for their not doing so is that the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s
own system for policing regional trade agreements is a mess. At present, each new free-trade area or
customs union is appraised by a committee, open to all members and with extremely vague terms of
reference. Unsurprisingly, only six of the 70-odd committees formed since <font size=-1>GATT</font>
began have ever reached a firm conclusion. It would be much better if agreements were examined by a
smaller team of independent scrutineers with a precise mandate to assess the effect on world trade--and,
in particular, the way that the new agreement treats outsiders.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It can be hard to say whether any free-trade area is so restrictive
that its costs outweigh its benefits--though Mercosur, by some calculations, fails the test, and the case for
the new <font size=-1>ASEAN</font> agreement also looks weak. Most agreements are a mixture of good
and bad. The long-term challenge for the ministers about to meet in Singapore is thus twofold: to change the
worst details in their own regional deals; and, even more important, to press ahead with multilateral trade
liberalisation in the <font size=-1>WTO</font>. Governments now have a chance to make this new
institution the strong catalyst for liberal trade which they have long said they wanted. They should seize
the opportunity.<br>

<h2>Serbia represses</h2>
Crowds remained on the streets in Serbia after the government closed down the country's last two independent radio stations. They had been broadcasting reports on 16 days of widespread protest against the annulment of municipal elections won by opposition parties.<p>
A <b>bomb</b> on a Paris commuter train killed two people and injured more than 160, many seriously. Suspicion fell on extreme Islamists from Algeria.<p>
<b>Greek farmers</b> demanding cheaper fuel and better price supports blockaded roads and railways. A crippling 12-day strike by French <b>lorry drivers</b> ended after concessions by their employers and the government.<p>
Russia's defence minister, <b>Igor Rodionov</b>, tried to sack the army's commander, Vladimir Semyonov. President Yeltsin approved the dismissal order, which accused the general of dishonourable conduct, but then withheld<p>
a presidential decree needed to put the order into effect. The general denied the accusation.<p>
<b>Russian miners</b> declared a national strike to protest at non-payment of wages. Unions said 80% of the 400,000 miners had joined the strike.<p>
Petru Lucinschi was elected <b>Moldova's president</b>, defeating the incumbent, Mircea Snagur. He had campaigned on a platform of closer ties with Russia.<p>
European Union finance ministers could not agree on a <b>stability pact</b> to curb budget deficits after the start of economic and monetary union. Although they neared agreement on the size of fines to be imposed on countries with excessive deficits, most resisted German demands that exceptions be made only for countries whose economies shrink by 2% in a year.<p>
Swiss voters rejected a liberalisation of the country's <b>labour laws </b>in a referendum. In another vote they narrowly rejected proposals to make it more difficult for asylum-seekers to enter the country.<p>
<h2>Vetoes and votes</h2>
The Organisation of African Unity, accepting America's veto, dropped its exclusive support for the reappointment of <b>Boutros Boutros- Ghali</b> as <font size=-1>UN</font> secretary-general. Mr Boutros-Ghali himself "suspended" his candidacy. On the understanding that it is still Africa's "turn", other African candidates were encouraged to come forward. The president of the <font size=-1>UN</font> General Assembly has set December 17th as the deadline for a decision. <p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Some 85% of Algerian voters, said the country's rulers, approved changes to their constitution that banned<b> Islamist parties</b> and extended the president's powers. The regime's claim of a 79% turnout was considered implausible.<p>
Tutsi rebels in eastern <b>Zaire</b> pushed deeper into the country. They claimed to have seized Kisangani (formerly known as Stanleyville), an important town controlling the Zaire river. Hutu-Tutsi clashes increased in <b>Burundi</b>.<p>
<b>South Africa</b>'s Constitutional Court approved the final changes to the constitution.<p>
In <b>Sierra Leone</b>, government and rebels signed an agreement to end five years of savagery.<p>
<b>Israel's attorney-general</b>, Michael Ben-Yair, resigned. He had earlier questioned the use by police of physical force during interrogations of Palestinian suspects. The <b>Palestinian police</b> were accused in a report by Amnesty International of brutality to their own people.<p>
<h2>New faces</h2>
Madeleine Albright, America's ambassador to the United Nations, was set to be named as the next <b>secretary of state</b>, according to reports in Washington. The other members of Bill Clinton's new foreign-policy team were said to be William Cohen (a former senator from Maine) as secretary of defence, Tony Lake (at present national security adviser) as head of the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, and Sandy Berger as head of the National Security Council, where he is now number two.<p>
Hawaii became the first state in America to recognise <b>homosexual marriages </b>when a state judge found that its government had failed to establish "a compelling state interest" to justify its prohibition of same-sex marriages.<p>
In <b>Ecuador</b>, President Abdala Bucaram, elected as a populist, announced a plan of sober economic reform: fiscal balance, privatisation, easier labour laws, even a local version of Argentina's monetary straitjacket. <p>
<h2>Troops out</h2>
The United States agreed to close some of its <b>military bases in Okinawa </b>and return the land to the local people. A new base for American helicopters will be built on an artificial island to be constructed offshore.<p>
About 1,000 students took part in a protest in Yangon, the capital of <b>Myanmar</b>, demanding an independent union and other rights. It was the biggest demonstration of its type for eight years.<p>

an independent commission said it could not approve an offer from the Lagard&egrave;re Groupe because of
its plans to sell one part of the conglomerate, Thomson Multimedia, to Daewoo Electronics. With thousands
of workers at Thomson Multimedia in revolt at the prospect of a South Korean owner, and other labour
disputes flaring, the French government gave in.<p> Another South Korean firm, <b>Samsung
Electronics</b>, had better luck. In March the world's biggest supplier of personal-computer screens will
supply the first of 5m monitors to <b>IBM</b>, the American computer giant, in a three-year deal worth
$2 billion.<p> Two of America's biggest airlines, <b>Delta</b> and <b>Continental</b>, are discussing a
merger that would create America's biggest carrier--and probably prompt other takeovers in their
industry. If the deal goes ahead, one beneficiary could be Air France which has marketing alliances with
both carriers.<p> America's <b>Dow Corning</b>, a breast-implants maker which went bankrupt in 1995 to
limit its exposure to lawsuits claiming the implants were unsafe, produced a new settlement plan. A $600m
fund would be set up for women who settle out of court; a further $1.4 billion would be contingent on proof
that the implants are hazardous; and $1 billion would go to banks and other creditors.<p> Argentina's
growing supermarket sector attracted another outside investor. Exxel, a global investment fund, bought
<b>Supermercados Norte</b>, Argentina's second-largest supermarket chain by sales (of $1.2 billion), for
$440m and said it planned a public share offering.<p> <h2>Drink up</h2> <b>Bass</b>, a British
beer'n'leisure group, is to spend &#163;670m ($1.1 billion) creating 7,000 new jobs next year, much of it
in its pubs and restaurants, after declaring pre-tax profits up 12% to &#163;671m for 1996, a year in
which it spent another &#163;568m creating 6,000 jobs.<p> The Antique Wine Company in London sold 127
bottles of <b>Chateau d'Yquem</b>, a French dessert wine, which included every vintage produced from
1855 to 1990, to a Las Vegas hotel and casino for $1m.<p> Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a Saudi Arabian
investor whose eclectic portfolio includes both Canary Wharf, London's biggest property development, and
Euro Disney, a French theme park, announced he was buying the <b>George V</b> hotel in Paris. He is
paying Granada, a British leisure group, $172m for what he describes as "the best hotel in the world".<p>
Six officials at Japan's <b>Ministry of Trade and Industry</b> were reprimanded for failing to supervise
staff properly and accepting excessive favours from an oil broker.<p> </td><td

<b>General Motors </b>in sacking Jose Ignacio Lopez turned into more of a two-fingered salute when it
replaced him with another <font size=-1>GM</font> defector, Javier Garcia Sanz, and said that Mr Lopez
would remain as a consultant. <font size=-1>VW</font>'s share price dropped 5.7% on concerns that the
two car makers, at war since the defection of eight <font size=-1>GM</font> executives to <font
size=-1>VW</font> in 1993, would fail to reach an out-of-court settlement.<p> In what could be the first
step towards a broader alliance, on-off talks between America's two aerospace giants brought an
agreement to collaborate on a super-jumbo. Hundreds of underworked engineers from <b>McDonnell
Douglas</b>, which recently abandoned its own plans for such an aircraft, will move from Long Beach to
Seattle to help <b>Boeing</b>, snowed under with orders, develop two new versions of the Boeing 747.<p>
<b>Aeroflot</b>, Russia's state-controlled international airline, said it would buy 20 Russian-made
Ilyushin-96 long-range aircraft equipped with American jet-engines and avionics, in a deal worth $1.5
billion. The move appeased Russia's aircraft makers, which reacted angrily to Aeroflot's purchase of ten
Boeing 737 mid-range aircraft earlier this year. <p> Bowing to government pressure, <b>Avtovaz</b>,
Russia's biggest car maker, said it would double its share capital and offer the new shares to one or more
outside investors. Any proceeds would help the stricken firm meet its so-far-unpaid $500m tax bill.<p>
<b>Eurotunnel</b> won permission from health-and-safety officials to restore most passenger and car
services through the Channel tunnel. But a decision on resuming freight shuttles--one of which was the
source of a large fire which raged in the tunnel last month--will not be made until official inquiries are
completed.<p> <h2>Top dollar</h2> (See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The ebullient Dow Jones went
into reverse; the index fell 79 points on December 3rd. Most European <b>bourses </b> carried on rising
buoyed by a strong dollar. The dollar's strength, plus the British government's talk-down of the pound, put
the damper on sterling's extended rally.<p> Three former executives at <b>Archer Daniels Midland</b>
were indicted by a Chicago grand jury for conspiring to fix prices in the $600m market for lysine, an
animal-feed additive. Also indicted was an executive at Ajinomoto of Japan, one of <font

to fixing prices and to pay a $1.25m fine.<p> <b>Alan Bond</b>, currently serving a three-year sentence

<h1>All free traders now?</h1>

<p><b>In Singapore on December 9th, the two-year-old World Trade Organisation begins its first summit
meeting. Although governments profess to be committed free traders, their actions still fall short of their
words</b></p><br> "FREE trade", wrote Richard Cobden in 1857, "is God's diplomacy, and there is no
other certain way of uniting people in the bonds of peace." Few politicians since Cobden have thought of
themselves as missionaries for free trade. Yet now, an odd thing is happening: most of the world's
governments claim to be exactly that. In Singapore from December 9th to 13th, trade ministers will attend
the first ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation (<font size=-1>WTO</font>)--and will
surely take every opportunity to parade their free-trade credentials. How justified are their claims?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the credit side, in the past few years there have been four main
achievements for free traders to cheer. First, the Uruguay round of the the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s
predecessor, the <font size=-1>GATT</font>, went further than any previous global trade deal. Apart from
promising to cut tariffs on manufactures-- which are now down to an average of just 3.8% in rich
countries--governments agreed for the first time to some liberalisation of trade in agriculture and
services. They also forged new agreements to get rid of some non-tariff barriers to trade, such as the
spurious use of technical and health regulations to keep out imports. The round, which finished in 1993, also
established the <font size=-1>WTO</font> itself, and set up a new mechanism for settling trade
disputes.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This mechanism is the second recent cause for
celebration. Under the <font size=-1>GATT</font>, any member could veto the verdict of a panel set up to
rule on a quarrel--even if it was a party to the dispute. <font size=-1>WTO</font> panels are stricter.
They must report within nine months and their decisions can be overturned only by consensus. Countries
found to have broken <font size=-1>WTO</font> rules must either mend their ways or offer compensation;
if they do not, they may face trade sanctions. So far, the mechanism has worked well. More than 60 cases
have been brought. About a quarter have been completed. Ten of these disputes were settled without going
before a panel.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third encouraging sign is that more and
more countries are joining the world trade club. During the Uruguay round, many developing countries
realised that freer trade was not a confidence trick by rich countries, but would actually help their own
economies. The membership of the <font size=-1>GATT</font> rose from 92 in 1986, when the round
began, to 114 when negotiations ended (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). The
<font size=-1>WTO</font> now boasts 126 members; another 30 countries, including China and Russia,
want to join.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fourth, trade has been booming. The <font
size=-1>WTO</font> estimates that world trade in goods grew by 8% in volume terms last year, four
times the growth of world <font size=-1>GDP</font>. In fact, during the 1990s international trade has
grown far faster than world output, showing that national economies are becoming ever more closely linked
(<a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). Foreign direct investment, another gauge of international economic integration, is
also soaring: last year, estimates the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, cross-border
investment flows rose by 40%, to $315 billion.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against such
a background, it may seem churlish to doubt governments' professions of free-trade faith. Unfortunately,
there are good reasons for such doubt. Since the completion of the Uruguay round, governments have
frequently acted much as they did under the old <font size=-1>GATT</font>: as downright protectionists on
some occasions and as mercantilists almost as a matter of course. That is to say, the main purpose of their
trade diplomacy has not been to open up their own markets to imports but to prise open other people's
markets for exports. The opening of home markets is usually seen as a concession to others, not (as
economic logic dictates) as a good thing in itself because it benefits local consumers and makes both national
and global economies work more efficiently.<br> </p><p><b><b>The sin bin</b></b><br> The clearest
example of the mercantilist tendency is the conduct of the so-called "unfinished business" of the Uruguay
round. When the round ended, agreement had not been reached on the following areas of service trade:
financial services, shipping, "movement of natural persons" (trade-speak for letting in foreigners to supply
services on a temporary basis) and telecommunications.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In
financial services the Americans, displeased by the slow pace of liberalisation promised by some Asian
countries, walked away from an agreement just before a deadline in June 1995 (though several other
negotiators, including the European Union, have kept their offers open and talks are due to restart next
April). In shipping, America's highly protected and unionised maritime industry virtually sank the talks
before they left port. The issue of letting in foreigners temporarily has become entangled by political
reservations about immigration as a whole. Few governments anywhere are keen to welcome foreign
workers. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only with the telecoms deal is there any sign of
hope. After an earlier negotiation collapsed in April (with Europeans and Asians slow to commit themselves
to liberalisation and with America demanding better access to satellite-communications markets in
developing countries) a recent round of talks has found several groups, including the Americans and
Europeans, making more liberal offers. Negotiators reckon a deal can be reached by the new deadline of next
February.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Telecoms, though, is an exception. For the most
part, the grudging way in which some governments are keeping the promises they made during the Uruguay
round smacks of bad faith. In textiles and clothing, for example, trade has been governed for over 30 years
by a system of bilateral quotas. These quotas are supposed to be scrapped eventually and textile trade
gradually brought into line with <font size=-1>WTO</font> disciplines; meanwhile, the size of quotas is
being increased. But the process, which began in 1995, has been slow. Importing countries, which tend to be
rich, are allowed to keep quotas covering almost half their trade until 2005. Moreover, they have started
to bring under the <font size=-1>WTO</font> system only those products which are not subject to
quotas--thus delaying the effect of the deal. Not surprisingly, exporters, most of them developing
countries, are up in arms. Doing the bare minimum does not seem to be the behaviour of committed free
traders.<br> </p><p><b><b>Gauges of good faith</b></b><br> The problems left over from the past,
however, are modest compared with those which are to come. In the next few years the free-trading
commitment of the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s members will be tested by four daunting challenges, some
familiar, others new. Each will give governments the opportunity either to make trade freer, or to hobble
it<b>.</b><br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first challenge is to continue <b>liberalising
trade in goods and services.</b> The <font size=-1>WTO</font> is already committed to some negotiations
as part of its "built-in agenda"--ie, matters begun during the Uruguay round. Negotiations on further
liberalisation of agricultural trade are due to begin in 1999 and a fresh round of talks on services is due to
start in 2000. Although both these talks are some years away, if history is any guide it is already a fair
bet that they will be difficult. Agriculture provided one of the trickiest problems of the Uruguay-round
talks-- indeed, the round nearly foundered on it. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There may
be progress, though, in an area of business that was not in those talks. American trade negotiators have
been pushing hard for an "information-technology agreement" to reduce tariffs on computers,
semiconductors, software and so forth. During last month's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum (<font size=-1>APEC</font>) in Manila, the Americans won the backing of other <font
size=-1>APEC</font> countries for a <font size=-1>WTO</font> negotiation of the issue.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans have a chance of getting their way, but the hurdles
remain high. The highest, say American negotiators, is disagreement with the <font size=-1>EU</font> both
over how quickly the Europeans should reduce their tariffs and over the range of products any deal should
cover. In addition, some Asian countries are hesitant; in Manila, the endorsement of some <font
size=-1>APEC</font> members was lukewarm. So information-technology talks should provide a start for
the <font size=-1>WTO</font> in tackling its expanding agenda. But it is likely to be a slow one.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s second big challenge concerns
<b>China</b>: on what terms should it be brought into the trading organisation? China is the world's
eleventh-biggest exporter; without it, the <font size=-1>WTO</font> cannot claim to represent world
trade. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Incorporating China presents both technical and
political problems. On the technical side, the difficulty is to bring a vast, semi-planned, semi-market
economy into line with the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s more-or-less free-market principles. China has
been freeing up its trade regime for the past decade, cutting tariffs and allowing foreign companies to
invest through joint ventures with Chinese firms. But it still maintains a <font
size=-1>WTO</font>-infringing array of controls, including export taxes, import quotas, trade licenses and
import inspections. The Chinese are also determined to maintain a protective shroud around some
"strategic" industries, such as cars.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font
size=-1>WTO</font> members want China's government to set out a clear, and fairly short, timetable for
the removal of all this. They also want an end to the county's habit of altering its trade regime arbitrarily.
On this last point, China has at least promised to stop making matters worse. On November 1st, its trade
minister, Long Yongtu, promised to impose no further trade restrictions inconsistent with <font
size=-1>WTO</font> rules.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The politics of admitting China is,
if anything, trickier, especially in the United States. Chinese exports to America are subject to the same
tariffs as most <font size=-1>WTO</font> members, but this privilege has to be renewed annually. Strictly
speaking, renewal depends on China's meeting a relatively-narrow criterion of not restricting emigration. 
Politically, however, the annual renewal depends on China's broad human-rights record. The Chinese regime
seems unlikely to alter that fundamentally, so the chances of <font size=-1>WTO</font> admission actually
depend on both sides agreeing not to make a fuss about what is going on. Not making a fuss has recently got
harder because China's trade surplus with America has climbed to become as big as Japan's. The result is
that protectionists are finding common cause with human-rights activists in America to oppose the
extension of <font size=-1>WTO</font> privileges to China. As an example of the potential for trade
conflict, the Chinese and Americans are already in a fight over textiles. America cut the import quota for
Chinese goods in September, claiming China had been sending extra clothes through third countries. The
Chinese are threatening to retaliate.<br> </p><p><b><b>Slippery ground</b></b><br> The third challenge
facing the <font size=-1>WTO</font> is whether, or how, to extend its remit into the so-called <b>"new
issues"</b> of trade policy: foreign investment, competition policy and labour standards. (These issues are
not in fact new: they have been discussed since before the birth of the <font size=-1>GATT</font> in
1948.)<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of the issues can be resolved quickly. They
arouse deep disagreement-- and it is easy to see why. Consider rules on foreign investment first. These
would take the world's trading body directly into tricky areas of national policy. It may be understandable if
an international agreement prevents one country from slapping a big tariff on the goods exported by
another. But it is less immediately apparent why one country should not offer some of its own taxpayers'
money to a company from another in order to persuade it to build a spanking new factory in the first. Nor is
it obvious why the host country should not, say, require foreign investors to employ a certain number of
local managers. What's wrong with that?<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The answer is that
such shackles and sweeteners act like tariffs or export subsidies, distorting the pattern of trade which
would have prevailed had the measures not been in place. In theory, firms can sell in foreign markets either
by sending their wares abroad, or by setting up a factory in a foreign land and serving the locals directly.
In some industries, the second of these methods is far cheaper than the first. This is especially so of many
services, such as banking, insurance and retailing. But it is increasingly common in manufacturing, too. A
car, for instance, might contain an engine made in one country and axles from another, but be assembled in
a third. According to one estimate, transactions within firms now account for about one-third of world
trade.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet despite close links between investment and trade,
the <font size=-1>WTO</font> currently has little to say on the subject. Such rules as exist are patchy.
Governments may not, for instance, limit foreign-owned factories' imports to the value of their exports or
insist that foreign investors use local inputs. <font size=-1>WTO</font> copyright rules are supposed to
protect foreign investors' intellectual property. But countries can and do protect local banks or
stockbrokers, for example, by refusing to issue licences to foreigners. They can limit foreigners' stakes in
broadcasting firms or airlines. Governments may also insist that foreign investors produce goods for
export as well as for the domestic market.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is not
surprising that some people, led by the Europeans and Canadians, want to beef up the rules. America is
prepared to support them, though it wants an agreement among <font size=-1>OECD</font> countries first.
Some Latin American countries are also in favour, as is the <font size=-1>WTO</font>'s secretariat, its
civil service (this body, which usually stays neutral on such matters, issued a report in October backing
the idea of a <font size=-1>WTO</font> investment accord).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Equally unsurprisingly, many developing countries, led by India,
Malaysia and Tanzania, are viscerally opposed. They say they are eager for foreign investment but want to
keep the right to set the terms of entry for foreigners. They feel under no particular pressure to sign up.
Even without a <font size=-1>WTO</font> agreement, they are not short of investment: developing
countries attracted $100 billion-worth last year (see <a href="sf3.gif">chart</a>). China alone received $38 billion. So a deal hardly looks imminent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Prospects for an agreement covering competition policy look no
rosier. This, too, is an apparently domestic economic matter with trade implications. The <font
size=-1>WTO</font> is not out to ban all monopolies or create a universal competition policy. But some of
its members do want to apply trade principles to the regulation of monopolies and mergers: those principles
suggest monopoly policy should not discriminate against foreigners. Others think the <font
size=-1>WTO</font> should have a role because firms could run international monopolies or cartels, yet be
out of the reach of national competition watchdogs.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, as
these differing ideas suggest, countries cannot yet agree even what facet of competition policy to discuss.
The <font size=-1>EU</font> would like to start work on a common set of principles for national
competition policies (it is always keen on harmonisation). America thinks this would be largely pointless; it
reckons co-operation between national antitrust authorities will do for now.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The argument for the third new issue, bringing labour standards
into the <font size=-1>WTO</font>, is even weaker. The United States is keen that it should be discussed.
Ultimately, it would like the <font size=-1>WTO</font> to enshrine five "core" labour standards in its
rules. These include a ban on "exploitative" child labour and a guarantee of trade-union freedom.
(Incidentally, world labour standards already exist, drawn up by the International Labour Organisation:
America has ratified only one of the five in question.)<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not
surprisingly, developing countries want none of this. They fear that, if they promised to abolish child labour
and then failed to keep their word, they would be vulnerable to retaliation under the <font
size=-1>WTO</font>'s dispute-settlement mechanism.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So for
the time being, the United States is unlikely to get its way. That may be just as well, for the intellectual
case for a labour-standards agreement is weak. If forced to improve labour standards, developing countries
would increase their costs and they would export less. That would make them poorer still, and would surely
make labour standards even worse. Not by accident, however, it would help protect some firms and
workers in rich countries.<br> </p><p><b><b>The biggest test of all</b></b><br> The fourth big issue is the
spread of <b>regional trading agreements</b>. Almost every member of the <font size=-1>WTO</font> is
also a member of such a group, whose numbers are proliferating. The <font size=-1>WTO</font> lists no
fewer than 76 free-trade areas or customs unions set up or modified since 1948. Of these, more than half
have come in the 1990s (see <a href="sf4.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidence of zeal for freer trade? It would seem so, especially
since regional deals sometimes cover aspects of trade that the <font size=-1>WTO</font> does not, such as
investment and competition policy. For instance, the North American Free-Trade Agreement (<font
size=-1>NAFTA</font>) has an investment code; <font size=-1>APEC</font> has some "non-binding
principles". The <font size=-1>EU</font> and an agreement between Australia and New Zealand contain
common regional competition policies.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The truth, however, is
more mixed. Yes, scrapping trade barriers within a region can encourage trade and investment among
countries within the club. But it can also divert trade and investment away from other countries. Japanese
car plants have been attracted to Britain, for example, by the thought that they can bypass the <font
size=-1>EU</font>'s restrictions on imports of Japanese cars. And while investment in Mexico has no doubt
been boosted by the thought of tariff-free entry to the United States, some of this will have been at the
expense of countries outside <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No
less troubling is the danger that, just as regional deals can divert trade from one part of the world to
another, so the agreements can have the same sort of impact on trade diplomats' energies, diverting them
away from the more important business of continuing to liberalise world trade. There is still plenty to do:
on conventional trade, on new issues and on the admission of China. God's diplomats? One day, maybe; but
not yet.<br> <br>

<h1>Statistical guessing games</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
A REPORT by economists on the shortcomings of statistics would not normally send politicians' pulses racing. But when it promises to cut billions of dollars from the budget deficit, statistical detail becomes big politics. The findings of a commission set up by the Senate Finance Committee to study the calculation of America's consumer price index (<font size=-1>CPI</font>), released this week, do just that. A group of five eminent academics led by Michael Boskin, a professor at Stanford University, has concluded that the <font size=-1>CPI</font> probably exaggerates true increases in the cost of living by something like 1.1% a year, although the exact figure could be anywhere from 0.8% to 1.6%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A correction of this magnitude would have enormous implications for the budget. Around a third of federal spending, mostly in retirement programmes, is directly indexed to changes in consumer prices. Through the indexing of individual income-tax brackets, a change in the <font size=-1>CPI</font> affects federal revenues, too. The Boskin commission reckons that correcting the 1.1% overstatement would save the government around $1 trillion over the next 12 years. By 2002, the target year for balancing the budget, around $200 billion could have been saved. Small wonder, then, that many politicians hope to prune public spending by simply improving statistics.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among economists, the notion that inflation may be mismeasured is nothing new. Zvi Griliches and Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University and Robert Gordon of Northwestern University--all members of the commission--have spent years estimating the size and cause of the bias. Nor does the impact of mismeasurement affect the budget alone. Revising the <font size=-1>CPI</font> would substantially raise official measures of America's growth rate and hence of Americans' economic prosperity. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What are the problems? The basic difficulty is that the <font size=-1>CPI</font> is not really a measure of changes in the whole cost of living, but rather a gauge of price rises in a fixed basket of goods. This means that the <font size=-1>CPI</font> does not keep up with changes in the products consumers buy, or in how and where they buy them. According to the Boskin report, about a third of the mismeasurement (0.4%) is due to the fact that the official price index fails to capture important changes in consumer spending patterns. If the price of hardback books increases, for instance, people may buy more paperbacks. Or if bananas become more expensive, they may switch to apples. These switches do not make consumers feel worse off; but the <font size=-1>CPI</font> records a price increase.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A further 0.1% bias is due to the fact that Americans now do more shopping at discount outlets. But the biggest effect (0.6%) comes because the <font size=-1>CPI</font> underestimates the benefits shoppers gain from improvements in product quality and from the plethora of new products. Cellular telephones, for instance, are not yet included in the <font size=-1>CPI</font>, although 40m Americans now own one. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Boskin report makes a host of suggestions as to how some of these inaccuracies could be corrected. The main message is that the Bureau of Labour Statistics (<font size=-1>BLS</font>), the federal agency that works out the <font size=-1>CPI</font>, should explicitly try to build a cost-of-living measure. No one is exactly sure how big an improvement such a change would make, although the commission's boffins reckon 0.4% a year could be achieved fairly quickly. That would bring budget savings of around $80 billion by 2002. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the <font size=-1>BLS</font>, a fiercely independent if rather stodgy outfit, may not want to rush into dramatic changes. It is already trying hard to improve the numbers: a correction earlier this year shaved about 0.2% from the <font size=-1>CPI</font>. When the system's weights are next updated in January 1988, a further 0.1-0.2% may be won, although the updated index will still reflect only the buying patterns of 1993. And the <font size=-1>BLS</font> is introducing a new index, somewhat similar to the one the Boskin commission proposes, on an experimental basis early next year, although the agency's economists are quick to point out that the new index has drawbacks too. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Assume, for a moment, that the <font size=-1>BLS</font> is prodded into introducing such changes. Cost-of-living rises will still be overstated. And, although the report has some ideas about how to account better for quality improvements, they are likely to pare at most 0.2% from the <font size=-1>CPI</font> over the medium term. The problem is that the economy is changing too quickly for the statisticians to keep up. However much the statistics are improved, the <font size=-1>CPI</font> will still overstate true increases in the cost of living.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This leads to the bigger political point. If the <font size=-1>CPI</font>, however revised, is not an accurate guide to changes in the cost of living, should it be the index to which retirement benefits are linked? The Boskin report makes the point explicitly: Congress and the president, it suggests, must decide whether they wish to continue widespread, substantial over-indexing of benefits. In other words, if politicians are looking for budget savings, this report gives them intellectual backing for proposing that retirement benefits should be indexed to something less than the <font size=-1>CPI</font>. They could pass a law, for instance, that set future benefit indexation at a rate lower than the <font size=-1>CPI</font>, perhaps as part of a budget package. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Legislating for such a change in benefits, however, is politically perilous. Neither the administration nor Republicans in Congress wants to be seen as initiating a proposal that directly hurts America's swelling ranks of retired folk. And, given the uncertainties even now among the experts, the decision on how much to trim from the <font size=-1>CPI</font> will remain arbitrary.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although administration officials are now more willing to review the issue, they are unlikely to make a big proposal. Nor are the Republicans in Congress. William Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, promised hearings on the <font size=-1>CPI</font> early next year. But he was quick to add that "reform will not be successful without President Clinton's leadership."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, the idea already has momentum. The "Blue Dogs", a group of conservative Democrats, proposed reducing benefit indexation by 0.5% as part of last year's budget negotiations, as did a bipartisan group of centrist senators. They are likely to press the issue again this year. As budget negotiations develop, it is just possible that some such measure could become part of the final package.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would be excellent news. Reducing the rate at which pensions are indexed would not only alleviate short-term budget squeezes, but would be a small step towards that Great Untouchable of American politics--Social Security reform. By boosting the politicians' boldness, Mr Boskin's report could prove enormously useful. But it has not, and will not, save them from the need to make some tough political choices. <br>

<h1>The real slick Willie</h1>

IN THE middle of November, Willie Brown apologised. It made headlines. The mayor of San Francisco had called Elvis Grbac, a quarterback in the 49ers football team, "an embarrassment to humankind" for the way he was playing, ignoring the fact that Mr Grbac had problems at home that were distracting him. San Franciscans were appalled at the mayor's disloyalty to the home team, and the mayor--hot back from a trip to Paris-- went to the practice field to say he was sorry in person. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was uncharacteristic. Ever since he became mayor in January this year, Mr Brown has been so lionised that his occasionally brutal remarks have gone almost unnoticed. Nobody much minded when he accused California's attorney-general of "Gestapo tactics" for busting a marijuana shop on Market Street, or when he cancelled a conference on the homeless at the last minute on the ground that homeless activists were going to try to steamroller him. Certainly no apology was needed. His approval ratings in San Francisco have been consistently higher than 70%. He has been on the cover of <i>Newsweek</i>, together with Rudolph Giuliani of New York, as one of "the 25 most dynamic mayors in America"; and he has been in a fashion advertisement in <i>Esquire</i>, confidently perched on a motorbike. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why has Mr Brown been getting all this national attention and local affection? A one-word answer: style. Mr Brown has bags of it, and he knows how to put it on public display. Whereas Mr Giuliani is racked by jealousy, and Richard Daley of Chicago is about as interesting as a city budget, Mr Brown is everybody's favourite dinner companion. He dresses impeccably, in $400 shoes, starched shirts and $3,000 Armani or Brioni suits. (A local joke has it that San Franciscans think Brioni is Italian for brown.) "Da Mayor", as he likes to call himself, is an incessant socialiser, moving easily between black-tie functions on Nob Hill and block parties in the Tenderloin; he is also a regular feature of the city's night clubs and restaurants, with a table permanently reserved at the Top of the Mark. In a city that thinks of itself as the embodiment of style, all this goes down like a dream. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Brown has a raffish side to him too, which also matches San Francisco's image of itself. He was recently given the Cancer Society's Humanitarian of the Year award, despite having received more money in campaign contributions from cigarette companies than any other politician in America, including Jesse Helms. He squires a succession of beautiful women around town, despite being married with three children. On becoming mayor he complained that it was impossible to live on his salary of $140,000 a year, and the parties he throws are fabulous. For his inauguration he invited 100,000 people, sweet-talked 70 restaurants into donating food, set up soup kitchens all over the city, and hired Huey Lewis and Santana to play. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Above all, Mr Brown is an American success story. He was born into a chaotic family in a segregated town in Texas and started work as a shoe-shine boy; yet he rose to become speaker of the Assembly in the nation's most populous state and then mayor of its most beautiful city. He also has luck on his side. Just as term limits were about to end his career in the state legislature, the job of mayor of San Francisco fell vacant. When it looked as if San Francisco was having second thoughts about embracing a flashy political boss as its mayor, his chief opponent, Frank Jordan, decided to liven up his image by appearing naked in a shower with two disc-jockeys, killing his campaign dead. San Francisco's recent economic recovery has also meant that Mr Brown has been able to avoid bringing in the job cuts and tax increases that had become routine in recent years. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet luck and style are not all the city needs. San Francisco has the highest proportion of <font size=-1>HIV</font>-positive people in the country, a dismally visible homeless problem, and a chaotic transport system. Culturally, the city is an island of 1960s liberalism in an increasingly conservative country. Mr Brown seems to represent the most irresponsible side of his city: San Franciscans, having realised that their problems are intractable, have decided to have a party. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the surface, that charge may seem hard. Mr Brown has attacked the jobs-for-life system that clogs up the city's bureaucracy; he has got rid of several notoriously incompetent officials, some of them black; he has handed over the running of the housing department and the probation service to the federal government (though without much choice), and he has improved safety on the buses by using reformed gang members as guardian angels. Above all, he has inspired a new enthusiasm for civic affairs. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Brown clearly relishes the process of politics far more than the humdrum business of administration. He loves playing interest groups off against each other and brokering deals between them. (This is, after all, the man whom Bill Clinton complimented as being "the real slick Willie".) Boasting better national connections than most other mayors, he has brought a cavalcade of Clinton cabinet members through the city; he is also hand in glove with Diane Feinstein, one of the state's senators. He understands the importance of projecting a positive image of the city, and this is good; but the running of any city cannot be simply a process of cocky salesmanship.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A year into his term, Mr Brown's plans to reform the city's management are little more than clich&eacute;s. He has neither Mr Giuliani's ability to think the unthinkable--that the tide of crime and casual lawlessness that was engulfing New York could be reversed--nor Mr Daley's relentless appetite for detail. Part of him still clearly dismisses his job as nothing but "street lights, dog doo and parking meters". A little more appetite for the daily realities of city life would do Mr Brown no harm. And a little humility, as seen unexpectedly on the 49ers' practice field, might make a good basis on which to start.<br>

<h1>Push, pull and paralysis in India</h1>

<font size=1>DELHI</font><p>
THE United Front government in India has lasted seven months. Many are betting that it will not last seven more. Its main foe is an old man in a hurry, Sitaram Kesri, who at the age of 78 has recently taken over the presidency of Congress, the largest opposition party. Mr Kesri wants to be prime minister and, at his age, he does not want to wait too long.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The coalition government, a rag-tag collection of 13 leftist, regional and minor parties, came to power soon after the general election in May. The biggest winner in the election was a group of Hindu-nationalist parties, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (<font size=-1>BJP</font>), which took 195 of the 543 seats in Parliament. The <font size=-1>BJP</font> formed a minority government, but was isolated by the secular parties and quickly lost. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress, which had ruled India almost continuously since the country's independence, came second, but with only 140 seats, compared with 232 in the previous parliament, so it was seen as the big loser. Accordingly, it was left to 13 other parties with 178 seats between them to cobble together a "United Front" government, the unifying cement being their shared determination to keep the <font size=-1>BJP</font> out. With similar feelings about the <font size=-1>BJP</font>, Congress agreed to support the minority government.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Quarrels have divided the United Front from day one. The leftist parties oppose privatisation and think that Deve Gowda, the prime minister, has been too soft on Narasimha Rao, his Congress predecessor, who faces a variety of corruption charges. But these quarrels, though noisy, are unlikely in themselves to cause the government's collapse. The four left-wing parties, which are the most fractious, have only 52 seats and none of the regional parties in the coalition has more than 20. The government could survive defections from the leftist or the regional groupings, so long as Congress continues to vote with it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the big if. Before Mr Kesri came on the scene, Congress leaders seemed prepared to bide their time, since they saw little prospect of improving their fortunes in a fresh election. But after Mr Rao was charged with corruption, he resigned as president of the Congress party. In September, he was succeeded by Mr Kesri, who does not disguise his desire to become prime minister. He has a four-stage plan to manipulate himself into power.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, he needs to reunite all the splinters of Congress, making it the largest single party in Parliament, with 165 seats (the <font size=-1>BJP</font> has only 160). Second, he needs to replace Mr Rao as leader of the Congress parliamentary party. After this, he plans to withdraw support from the United Front, and wait for the president to ask him, as head of the largest party, to form the next government. Lastly, he hopes to seduce most regional and minor parties from the United Front and so win a majority.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this will be as easy as it sounds. Mr Kesri has won back two Congress splinter groups, but what really matters, because it holds 20 seats in Parliament, is the splinter in the state of Tamil Nadu. The trouble is that this lot owes its success there to its conversion into a regional party. It would lose much of its support if it rejoined Congress. Moreover, it already holds two cabinet posts, including the finance minister's, and Mr Kesri cannot offer it much more. But, without it, Congress cannot become the largest party in Parliament.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor will Mr Kesri find it easy to dislodge Mr Rao from his remaining job, as leader of the parliamentary party. Although Mr Rao has led Congress to defeat and has now been charged with corruption, his party has no tradition of removing a sitting leader. He will not go quietly, and Mr Kesri dare not push things to a split, which would ruin his chances of inheriting a united party.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the first three stages of Mr Kesri's scheme went according to plan, it is by no means certain that the regional and minor parties would give their support to him. Why should they, when Congress is their main rival in their states?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the fall of the United Front could lead to parliamentary deadlock and a fresh election, in which the <font size=-1>BJP</font> would probably make the biggest gains. Nonetheless, many in Congress expect Mr Kesri to make his move in mid-1997. However small his chance of making the history books, it is his only chance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the government, all this is proving paralysing. No big economic changes have taken place, or are in prospect. But that does not mean that all is well, especially on the budget front. The central government's budget deficit was 5.9% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> last year. Add the borrowing of state governments and public-sector corporations, and the combined deficit was close to 10% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. The finance minister has promised to cut the central deficit to 5%, but is getting no co-operation from other ministers. He wants to raise oil prices (which are government-controlled) in line with world prices, but his coalition partners have said no, because it would make them unpopular. In consequence, state oil companies will be in debt to the tune of almost $3 billion (1.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>) by the end of the fiscal year in March.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In India, any government under threat puts off hard decisions and tries to buy popularity. The finance minister is trying to limit giveaways, but without much success. The railway and telecoms ministers have granted additional bonus payments to their employees, and state governments are likely to follow suit. Fertiliser and food subsidies are certain to be above budget. Economic liberalisation is not under threat, but fiscal discipline certainly is.<br>

<h1>All quiet on the eastern front</h1>

<font size=1>DELHI</font><p> SOME called it weak-kneed, most said it was pragmatic statesmanship. India
has many complaints about China-- that it has occupied Indian territory, given missiles and nuclear
technology to Pakistan, and supported the Pakistani position on Kashmir.
Yet the Indian government rolled out the red carpet for Jiang Zemin, the president of China, when he visited
Delhi on November 28th and signed an agreement for confidence-building measures which could lead to the
partial demilitarisation of their disputed border.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two
countries agreed not to attack one another; to limit or reduce troops and weapons in a zone to be worked out
on both sides of the "line of actual control" (<font size=-1>LAC</font>); and to ban combat aircraft within
ten kilometres (six miles) of the <font size=-1>LAC</font> except with prior notice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Below the surface, this is an agreement to disagree. Both sides
have territorial claims on the other. China has offered to make the <font size=-1>LAC</font> the official
border, which means it would give up its claims in the eastern sector in return for India giving up its claims
in the western sector. But no Indian government could agree to a deal like that; it would be accused of
treason by all opposition parties. So demilitarising the <font size=-1>LAC</font> is an interim measure to
reduce tension, the chances of a military clash, and defence spending, without any surrender of
territory.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two sides disagree even on where the <font
size=-1>LAC</font> runs, though they have not pursued their disagreement violently since an ugly military
clash in 1987. The current aim is to avoid any further fighting till the <font size=-1>LAC</font> is
formally demarcated, a task that has so far proved elusive. Troop reductions have also been discussed in
the past, but without success. The Chinese side of the border is a plateau on which troops can be quickly
moved, whereas the Indian side is steep, landslide-prone mountainside. China would like both sides to
withdraw an equal distance, but India says that would enable the Chinese to reach the border faster. The
issue is unlikely to be resolved quickly.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Indians argued
that their government should have refused to receive the head of a country it accuses of supplying <font
size=-1>M-11</font> missiles and nuclear-weapons technology to Pakistan. But the government, though it
stridently accuses Pakistan of threatening Indian security, has chosen not to make an issue of China's role.
It has decided to live with China's weapons sales, which it thinks are motivated by commercial rather than
strategic considerations.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though some Indians worry that
China may be trying to "contain" India by fostering ties with Pakistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh, the Indian
government is less suspicious. The Chinese attack of 1962 is now a distant memory in India. Deng Xiaoping's
China looks less threatening than Mao's. Indeed, an invasion by Chinese businessmen now seems more likely
than an invasion by Chinese troops. Trade between the two countries is a mere $1 billion, but growing at
30% each year. India will back China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, and China will back India's
entry into the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. Modest beginnings, but not to be sneered at in a
region where international tensions still run high.<br>

<p><b>Litigation</b></p>
<h1>Reading, writing and writs</h1>

IF LITTLE Johnny flunked his exams, his parents used to send him to his room in disgrace. Now they send for the lawyers. As two 17-year-olds who got lousy <font size=-1>GCSE</font> results began proceedings against their school, teachers trembled at the thought of a flood of litigation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the British public, after years of pooh-poohing the Americans for demanding millions of dollars for being scalded by a cup of coffee, seems to think it is not such a bad idea. Despite the government's efforts to restrict legal aid for personal-injury actions, the gross bill in England and Wales for such suits rose from &#163;77m in 1991-92 to &#163;200m in 1994-95. However, damages are not yet American-style: judges, who try most British actions, do not award the astronomic sums handed out by American juries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government is partly responsible for this development. By promoting the Citizens' Charters and pushing public services to publish performance records, it has supported the idea that those who do not meet measurable standards, such as school league tables, should pay compensation. In the exam case, the lawyer, Jack Rabinowicz, will draw on inspection reports which said their two schools had failed to provide an acceptable standard of education.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The exam case is also the consequence of judgments by the House of Lords. In July 1995, in three cases concerning the special needs of dyslexic children, their lordships decided that schools and local education authorities could be sued for failing to carry out their duty of care. Mr Rabinowicz subsequently won a &#163;30,000 out-of-court settlement last month for an ex-pupil bullied for three years at a school in London.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where does this trend lead? Litigation leads to insurance, which risks driving some businesses to the wall. Parts of America, for instance, are short of obstetricians because the risks of litigation have made delivering babies prohibitively expensive. But in moderate doses, it may be beneficial. So, anyway, argues Peter Watson, a Glasgow lawyer who acted for the relatives of victims of the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster and the Lockerbie air disaster. He says that American-style lawsuits are an effective force for change. "The traditional British method of forming a committee, passing a few health and safety regulations which fine a defaulting company tuppence-halfpenny, is a waste of time," he says. In both cases, he says, the companies ignored regulations and safety procedures.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The threat of litigation is raising the costs of bad decision-making, but it does not necessarily make it clearer how people should do their jobs. Environmental health officials delayed publishing lists of shops selling meat which caused the current food poisoning outbreak in Lanarkshire, fearing legal action by a wrongly-identified shop. Health officials, more concerned to stop the death toll (seven by December 5th) from the <i>E. coli</i> 0157 bug, over-ruled them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The courts may eventually decide who was right. On December 4th, lawyers acting for seven children in Stoke-on-Trent poisoned by <i>E. coli</i> in a separate incident said they were going to sue the government for not properly publicising information about the bug.<br>

<h1>Working miracles</h1>

BRITAIN'S "flexible" labour markets are increasingly held up as a model for the inflexible rest of Europe to
follow. Research published in December's issue of <i>Labour Market Trends</i> was claimed in support of
this conclusion by Tory ministers. But on closer inspection it raised as many questions as it answered.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, unemployment has fallen more quickly during the
economic recovery of the 1990s than it did in that of the 1980s. Nor has this triggered a rise in
wage-inflation. This suggests that Tory reforms to weaken employment rights such as job protection and to
curb trade-union power, thus encouraging employers to hire new workers sooner as demand increases,
have paid off.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, says the new research, that is not the
whole story. Several other factors contributed to the change. In the 1990s more people opted out of the
workforce--into higher education, early retirement, or invalidity--than in the 1980s. Job growth was
spread more evenly across the country, so it took longer for shortages to occur in any one area, making it
easier to contain wage pressures.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As our <a
href="br1.gif">chart</a> shows, Britain's job creation record was better in the 1990s than in the 1980s, both in
absolute terms and in comparison with America and Germany. Of all the Group of Seven rich countries, only
France had a similar improvement. Yet Britain's record still only matched Germany's. That was better than
in the 1980s, but hardly justifies Tory boasts about Britain's superior labour-market policies. For
American-style jobs-growth, Britain, and the rest of Europe, need more than flexibility: they need better
education and a social-security system that does not actually discourage working, for a start.<br>

<p><b>Disability law</b></p>
<h1>Crippling?</h1>

WHEN America passed the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, sceptics said it should really be called the lawyers' retirement act. The language was a lawyers' dream: it included such notions as common sense, reasonable accommodation, essential functions, undue hardship and readily achievable goals. Businessmen predicted a litigation nightmare.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's Disability Discrimination Act has come into force this week, and many British businessmen have similar fears. Some disability campaigners, meanwhile, have been protesting that it does not go far enough. The American experience suggests that the disabled will end up better off than they were, though not completely satisfied, and the new regulations will not prove too burdensome to business.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both the American law and the British one prohibit discrimination against disabled people in hiring, firing and promotion. This in effect extends civil rights protections to the disabled. The laws also require restaurants, shops, libraries and so on to make efforts to serve the disabled-- perhaps by reading out the menu to blind diners. Both laws are intentionally vague: the idea was to establish broad principles.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem, say American businessmen, is that they don't know how they are required to respond until they are hit with a complaint. A survey in 1995 of 35,000 employers by the National Federation of Independent Business found that two-thirds wanted the law clarified. For instance, the definition of disability remains murky. Some 49m Americans--or more than one in six--are considered disabled under the act, an implausible figure. Among those included are former drug addicts, a categorisation employers dispute, and there is worry that the obese and smell-sensitive will litigate their way in as well.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second complaint is that some regulations are too broad. The Los Angeles school district, for example, hesitated to fire a teacher who had killed a woman and spent ten years in a hospital for the criminally insane: under the law, former mental illness is not a ground for firing. There is also concern that the "reasonable accommodation" standard can be unreasonably applied. A self-serve car wash in Michigan had to install a $12,000 lavatory for the handicapped, even though the site is visited by employees for only half an hour a week.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the feared litigation frenzy has simply not happened; the Department of Labour records 650 suits nationwide in the first five years. Moreover, the experience has been that much "reasonable accommodation" is cheap and easy--putting a desk up on bricks, perhaps, or installing large-print software. Employment rates in America among disabled people have been increasing. The act can probably take some credit for that.<br>

<p><b>Rail privatisation</b></p>
<h1>New rail barons</h1>

THREE more passenger rail franchises were awarded to private companies this week--Great Eastern to FirstBus, Anglia to <font size=-1>GB</font> Railways, and West Anglia and Great Northern to Prism Rail. Only a third of the original 25 franchises remain unsold. Unless an election intervenes, they will be sold within the next four months.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet already the government's blueprint for the industry is in the bin. The government had hoped that by splitting British Rail into more than 100 different companies it would promote competition. But the lesson of other utility privatisations--that what ministers split, the market reassembles--is being repeated.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Seurat of Symonds Travers Morgan, a transport consultancy, says that rail is likely to follow the pattern of the bus industry. Deregulation of buses led to the appearance, and then the disappearance, of 500 separate companies. The industry is now dominated by a handful of operators--three of which (Stagecoach, National Express and FirstBus) are among the leading contenders for rail franchises.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stagecoach has already got two franchises, South West Trains and the Island Line, and is one of three preferred bidders for the Inter City West Coast line. It is now bidding to take over Porterbrook, one of three leasing companies. This move, if approved, will be the first step towards the vertical integration of the rail industry.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is worried about whether to allow bus companies to dominate the rail industry. It is therefore looking attentively at bids by Stagecoach for ScotRail and by National Express for Midland Main Line; but both are likely to be approved.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other key players in the franchise race are Connex, owned by the Compagnie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux, Sea Containers, a ferry and container operator, and Virgin, part of the consortium which runs the Eurostar passenger trains. Between them, the five companies already control nearly half of all rail passenger revenues, a proportion likely to increase in coming months. Industry sources also expect that the three franchises awarded to management buy-outs-- <font size=-1>M</font>40 Trains, Victory Railways and Great Western--will also attract bids.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The City, not surprisingly, has contracted rail fever. Porterbrook was privatised for &#163;527m and bought from its managers by Stagecoach for &#163;825m seven months later. Shares in Prism Rail, a small train operating company which has the London-Tilbury-Southend franchise, have quintupled in six months from the &#163;1 offering price. Railtrack's shares, which were floated earlier this year at 190p, have also nearly doubled in value. Its first pre-tax statement after the flotation reported that profits had leapt by 77%, to &#163;173m.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The expectation of big profits lies behind this stockmarket performance. The new operators are promising new rolling stock, smaller subsidies and even lower fares. Their confidence is based partly on the belief that increasing road congestion will drive people on to trains.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are some signs that their optimism may be justified. Most franchisees are reporting a sharp rise in passenger volumes, maybe because even travellers seem to be benefiting. According to the first performance figures from eight privatised routes, seven were more punctual than they had been before privatisation, and all eight were more reliable in running scheduled services.<br>

<p><b>London's development</b></p> <h1>Jubilation?</h1>

WHEN the Docklands development crashed in the early 1990s, investors
blamed the lack of proper infrastructure. Narrow roads, the tiny
capacity of the Docklands Light Railway (<font size=-1>DLR</font>) and
the encircling Thames had, developers said, left large-scale commercial
or residential complexes too inaccessible to be attractive. The
government's response, along with an upgrade for the <font
size=-1>DLR</font> and a revamping of the roads, was a rambling
extension of London Underground's Jubilee line from the West End to
south and east London.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The
construction of the Jubilee line extension, the biggest development in
the capital's transport system for over two decades, has clogged
London's traffic for a year and maddened Londoners. Now that it is
nearing completion, however, things seem to be looking up for the
Docklands.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Office occupancy has risen
from 62% in 1993 to 75% this year. In the riverside area of Southwark,
where four of the 11 new Jubilee line stops will be located, the number
of planning permissions granted has tripled since 1992. Housing sales
have hit their highest level since the 1980s. Chic waterside apartments
now routinely sell a year before their scheduled completion. Citibank
and <i>Readers</i>' <i>Digest </i>are moving to Canary Wharf. Add the
extra impetus of the Jubilee's arrival in March 1998 to falling
unemployment and rising rents, and it looks as though Docklands is
poised for a second 1980s-style boom.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Docklands today is not the wasteland
it was in the early 1980s, when Tower Hamlets had a higher proportion of
residents in public housing than did the Soviet Union. The London
Docklands Development Corporation (<font size=-1>LDDC</font>), set up by
the government to by-pass left-wing councils and promote private-sector
development, once owned swathes of derelict land. Now, the only large
vacant tracts are in the remote Royal Docks (see <a
href="br2.gif">map</a>).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the
Victoria line came to Brixton in 1971, the increased accessibility sent
property prices soaring. But along the Jubilee's route through Southwark
a sea of dilapidated council estates rubs shoulders with cheap and
cheerful low-cost housing built by the <font size=-1>LDDC</font> as a
sop to local objections that it was doing nothing for the poor. It is
not the stuff of estate agents' fantasies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Surely, if property prices soar, all this
could be replaced by higher-value housing? It could, except that
planning authority in Docklands will soon revert from the <font
size=-1>LDDC</font> to the local borough councils. Southwark takes over
Surrey Quays later this month, and Tower Hamlets regains the Isle of
Dogs next year.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the local councils
are Labour. The hard left has mostly gone; and council officials,
between enthusiastic references to "housing choice", "efficiency" and
plans to eliminate 95% of unnecessary bollards, privately welcome any
scheme which will bring wealthier residents to areas which are still
among the poorest in London. But indigenous Docklanders have always been
suspicious of East London's gentrification. One popular grafitto
rechristens the <font size=-1>LDDC</font> "Locals Don't Dig Cobbles".
Local politicians cannot publicly support replacing poor people's
housing with houses and offices for the rich.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, local residents will benefit
from better transport. Local businesses are less certain to. Good
transport can bring people into an area; but, as Brixton learned, it can
also free them to do their shopping elsewhere. Brixton's shopping centre
died once the Victoria line shipped people off to Oxford Circus.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The one sure winner from the Jubilee line
extension is Canary Wharf. The new station there will handle over 15,000
people every hour at peak times, with capacity for many more. The
current owner of the Canary Wharf development, International Property
Corporation, not only stands to see the value of the existing complex
increase; roughly 8m of the 10m square feet of office space in the area
with planning permission are in two further planned towers on the
development.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seeing Canary Wharf's
huge potential profit from the Tube access, the government insisted in
1993 that the then owners pay &#163;398m towards the projected &#163;1.2
billion cost of construction. But although Canary Wharf's contribution,
spread out over 25 years from 1998, will be hugely discounted by
inflation, the cost of the extension has risen to &#163;2.6 billion in
today's money. It has proved an expensive way of remedying an
embarrassing failure.<br> <br>

<p><b>The other technopolists</b></p> <h1>Bigger, faster, better ears</h1>

<p><b>Internet folk are famously opposed to the proprietary standards that made Microsoft and Intel so
dominant. So how did Cisco Systems win 85% of the Internet's richest market--and become worth the same
as General Motors?</b></p><br> ALL this year the computer industry has been hotly debating which
company, Microsoft or Netscape, will win the Internet software market. But there has been no such debate
on the hardware side, because there is no contest. The undisputed leader in this market is Cisco Systems, a
maker of network equipment. Thanks to its soaring share price, Cisco has a market capitalisation of over
$40 billion (much the same as General Motors), yet the firm has barely attracted the notice of the average
computer user, much less the antitrust authorities. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of
the reason is that the Californian firm's market is as obscure as it is fast-growing. Cisco makes computer
networking equipment of all sorts, but most of its profits come from selling specialised computers called
"routers" that direct traffic at the intersections of the Internet's many routes. These are machines that the
ordinary user never sees, nor much cares about. Like the switches of a telephone network, these devices,
provided they are doing their job properly, are in effect invisible. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each e-mail message or transmitted Web <dest="makes"
ref="page"> its way from sender to receiver by being automatically bounced, pinball-like, from one router
to the next. The wires that connect the Internet's routers are just dumb pipes; all the magic of the network
lies in the routers. It is they that enable the Internet to weave together seamlessly thousands of smaller
networks, or send a message around the world without specifying anything more than a few characters. As
the Internet doubles in size each year, so does the demand for ever more, ever faster routers. And 85% of
these are made by Cisco.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This dominance of one of the hottest
high-tech markets has lifted Cisco into the ranks of the computer industry's most successful firms. The
company is big (sales in the past financial year exceeded $4 billion, and this year are expected to pass $6
billion) and highly profitable (net profits were nearly $1 billion last year), and it has been almost doubling
in size each year for most of this decade (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Yet while Cisco may share
with Microsoft and Intel some of the financial rewards of market domination, it got there in a very
different way.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most quasi-monopolies in technology markets
owe their position to their ownership of a standard. Because so much of technology is about one gizmo
connecting to or working with another gizmo, they usually need a common language for talking to each
other. Sometimes that language is open and free for all to use; but often such standards were created and
are owned by one company which, either through might or luck, has managed to persuade the rest of the
industry to do things its way.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Owning such a de facto standard
is the surest way to become a technopolist, as Microsoft proved with its <font size=-1>PC</font> system
software, and Intel with its <font size=-1>PC</font> processor chips. But the Internet has, since its start,
been a creature of open, non-proprietary standards. Part of the reason for this is that communications
technologies need ubiquity for maximum impact; the more people you can communicate with, the more
useful the technology becomes. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No company owns an accepted
Internet standard. Cisco can use every trick and secret in the book to make its routers faster than the
competition or easier to use, but where they connect with the rest of the Internet they must stick largely
to open Internet standards. Even when Cisco invents a way to improve upon those standards, it must submit
it to an independent standards committee and make it available to other firms before customers will accept
it. Networking companies expect equipment to be "interoperable", so they can unplug a Cisco router and plug
in one from a competing firm, such as Bay Networks or Ascend Communications, in its place. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The consequence of this devotion to open standards is that network
operators enjoy what economists call low switching costs: changing suppliers is relatively easy. It is this
that makes Cisco's dominance so surprising. Much of Microsoft's hold on the software market is due to high
switching costs. If you abandon Microsoft's Windows for another company's system, many of your other
programs, which cost a packet and took weeks to learn, may well stop working, or you may be cut off from
the next hot software innovation. Likewise, Intel dominates the microprocessor market because it sets the
standard and enjoys a monopoly on its newest chips for years before competitors figure out how to clone
them.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike them, Cisco keeps its dominance the
old-fashioned way: it simply makes routers that are better than the competition's. It created the router
market in 1984, when Sandy Lerner and Leonard Bosack, a husband-and-wife team of Stanford academics,
set up the firm to market machines they had cobbled together at their university. And it has managed to
stay ahead of its competition ever since by running faster.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the beginning, Cisco distinguished itself from bigger
companies by retaining its local connections and listening to its customers. Firms such as <font
size=-1>IBM</font>, <font size=-1>AT&T</font> and Proteon were already in the network-equipment
business, but missed the significance of routers--and router-based networks such as the Internet. "The
number of companies that gave away this business is remarkable," says Mike O'Dell, head of technical
operations for <font size=-1>UUN</font>et, which uses Cisco routers to run much of its global Internet
network. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With its close ties to the universities and companies
developing the Internet, Cisco could evolve along with it. But, as the company grew, it found that it
sometimes had to choose between its own technical goals and the wish-lists of its customers. On one side
was Ms Lerner, who put herself in charge of a "customer advocacy" group. On the other were the
professional managers the firm had brought in. In 1990, after the firm went public, its two founders
left.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite that clash, and despite its tremendous growth
since then, Cisco has managed to keep its reputation for knowing its customers better than the competition.
That allowed Cisco to foresee how the market would develop, because the staid corporate networking
market tends to trail Internet trend-setters by a few years. And its customer focus helped Cisco to sell a
lot of boxes without much promotion. It did not buy its first advertisement until 1992, when it already had
more than $300m in annual revenues. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet service
companies have a close interest in telling Cisco what they need, because the very fabric of the Internet
depends on the company being able to come up with faster routers quickly enough to keep up with the
network's soaring traffic-demands. This information flow helps the firm to stay a technology hop ahead of
its competition. The Internet is, in effect, Cisco's research and development laboratory.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Only as good as your last byte</b></b><br> What could go wrong? In fact, Cisco's
quasi-monopoly may be more fragile than its admirers on Wall Street believe. The company's position rests
on little more than its ability to listen better, innovate faster and employ better people than its competition.
If another rival starts to do all of these things a little bit better, or too many brainy people leave Cisco, the
advantage could disappear overnight. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And, naturally, Cisco is
facing the usual risks of domination: complacency, conservatism and excessive concentration on the most
profitable markets. Already some customers are mumbling that other firms seem to have more compelling
technologies for the next generation of even faster routers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cisco's usual reaction to having missed a beat in this fast-moving
market is to buy a company with the necessary technology-- since 1994, it has spent more than $5 billion
on such acquisitions. But such takeovers have their administrative costs. Other hardware firms have often
got into trouble because they have bitten off something bigger than they could chew. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Internet's booming market, where service providers are
constantly upgrading to better routers to stay ahead of demand, Cisco cannot count on customer loyalty
alone to sustain its lead. Switching suppliers is never easy, but it is certainly easier for Cisco's customers
than, say, Microsoft's. A dominance based simply on being better at guessing the way forward than other
firms and getting there faster is never as safe as one built on owning an industry standard. Even the best
legs eventually get tired, and the best hearing grows faint.<br>

<h1>Germany's Herr Handy</h1>

<p><b>Is a pinch of telecoms enough to spice up an old-fashioned, feudal European conglomerate? Georg
Obermeier hopes so</b></p><br> ONE of the more fashionable things to do if you are a slightly stodgy but
rich European utility is to branch out into telecoms of one sort or another. It is not just that the phone
market seems to be growing whilst most other public services look a little sluggish. It is also a question of
sex appeal: who wants to be in the boring old business of delivering electricity, pumping water or bringing
commuters to work when there are things like satellite telephony and multimedia in the air? And, even if it
takes a little time to make money, there is always the hope that some of that snazzy new culture will infect
the more dowdy parts of your organisation.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this explains
why Britain's regional electricity companies have got together to form Energis, a telecoms firm that uses
their lines. A group of the continent's national railways have set up Hermes, a telecoms consortium.
Compagnie G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux, a French water company, is also now in the telecoms
business. But few are pushing in as aggressively as Georg Obermeier, the irascible 55-year-old Bavarian
who runs <font size=-1>VIAG</font>.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many ways <font
size=-1>VIAG</font> is a caricature of a regional monopoly. Although it was privatised in 1986, its largest
shareholder is the Bavarian state government, and it makes most of its money from electricity generation
in that state. Now it is run very much as a personal fief by Mr Obermeier (his latest "disagreement" was
with his finance director, whom he has not yet replaced). Mr Obermeier has helped tighten up <font
size=-1>VIAG</font>'s finances (its head office has only 100 people); but it is still a sprawling group with
interests in businesses like packaging and freight. The performance of <font size=-1>VIAG</font>'s shares
has lagged behind those of both <font size=-1>RWE</font> and Veba, two other utility-based German
conglomerates that have been more aggressive about reshuffling their business (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Mr Obermeier scents salvation in his country's notoriously
poorly-served telecoms market, which is still largely monopolised by Deutsche Telekom. Although Germans
flocked to buy shares in the company when it was partially privatised last month, they are disenchanted
customers. Many would switch to another telephone company, especially one offering lower prices and
greater flexibility. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>VIAG</font> hopes to woo
them through mobile telephony. Germany's internationally minded businessfolk have given their favourite
gadget an English name: <i>das Handy</i> is the German for mobile phone. Handy they may be, cheap they
are not. A talkative business user can expect to pay around DM487 ($311) a month, according to Analysys,
a consultancy; his British counterpart would shell out only &#163;85 ($140). Mr Obermeier wants to
change this. He aims to make the gadget into a <i>Volkshandy</i>--cheap enough to tempt millions of
households to abandon conventional phone lines altogether.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>VIAG</font> is set to get its mobile phone licence in
February, in a joint venture with Britain's <font size=-1>BT</font>. It will begin operating in early 1998,
just when Germany's telephone market is due to be liberalised. Its strategy should give it a head start:
while other new entrants are having to use Deutsche Telekom's local circuits, at great expense--or, even
more expensively, dig up the streets to put in new lines--<font size=-1>VIAG</font> will avoid all this
trouble by using wireless transmission rather than cables. Even better, it will be using a higher radio
frequency than its mobile competitors, meaning better-quality sound and greater capacity (which will be
useful for customers using modems and other gadgets). And whereas its rivals are putting their main effort
into setting up new long-distance networks, <font size=-1>VIAG</font> will save money by renting what it
needs.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But <font size=-1>VIAG</font>'s advantages may look
more slender as the months go by. Belatedly, a price war is now raging in mobile phones, between
Mannesmann, a big engineering company which has already thrashed Deutsche Telekom to become market
leader, and the third network, <font size=-1>E</font>-Plus, which has several owners including Veba. By
early 1998, <font size=-1>VIAG</font>'s promised cut-price rates will probably look less spectacular.
Meanwhile, the price of ordinary telephony will also probably fall, as Deutsche Telekom comes under
pressure from <font size=-1>RWE</font> and Veba. Much will depend on the expertise of <font
size=-1>VIAG</font>'s British partner and on how Mr Obermeier's somewhat feudal management style
adapts to the task.<br> </p><p><b><b>A sideshow with a meaning</b></b><br> Mr Obermeier's advance
into telecoms has all the makings of an exciting tussle. But <font size=-1>VIAG</font> shareholders might
wonder whether he is putting too much effort into the project. In five years' time, telecoms are expected to
contribute sales of only DM2 billion, rising to DM5.5 billion by 2008. By contrast, group sales for 1996 are
forecast at some DM43.8 billion, most of which comes from electricity. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From this perspective, the foray into telecoms might indeed help
spice up some of <font size=-1>VIAG</font>'s other businesses (trying to wrest the cellular telephony
business from Mannesmann will be a far more cut-throat affair than, say, selling nuclear power in
Bavaria). But <font size=-1>VIAG</font> is in so many businesses that it is hard to see how all of them can
be infused with this entrepreneurial spirit. And the telecoms fuss may prove a distraction to the harsher
matter of selling off its more lacklustre businesses and, perhaps (whisper it very quietly), making <font
size=-1>VIAG</font>'s boss a little more accountable. The leonine Mr Obermeier's eyes glint dangerously
as the topic of his management style is raised. "Very fast decisions are the key to our success," he purrs.
The telecoms battle will be a good test of that.<br>

<h1>Hail to the mighty pound</h1>

<p><b>Sterling was the strongest of the world's major currencies until it dipped this week. Is this the end
of its rise, or just the beginning?</b></p><br> THESE are halcyon days for the British pound. Between
August and early December, sterling soared from $1.54 to $1.68, &#165;164 to &#165;193, and DM2.28
to DM2.64. Its trade-weighted value (which reflects the pattern of Britain's trade with different countries)
was over 14% up on a year earlier (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). This is heady stuff indeed for a
currency which has been falling in value for most of the past 50 years. And it is only four years since
sterling was pushed into a withdrawal from Europe's exchange-rate mechanism (<font size=-1>ERM</font>)
that deeply embarrassed the government. But what happens next to the pound--and with it, the British
economy-- is now in the balance. Is the strong pound back for good? <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To many Britons, the pound's long-term fall from global reserve
currency to small change symbolised their country's broader decline from industrial superpower to an
also-ran struggling to keep up with the likes of Singapore and Italy. That is why some British nationalists
oppose joining the planned single European currency, the "abolition of the pound" being, for them, a final
admission of economic defeat. Yet sterling's recent revival has not led the average Briton to walk taller. It
seems to have been greeted with a mixture of indifference and ambivalence.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Soon after winning the 1992 British general election, John Major,
the prime minister, said that his goal was for sterling to replace the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark as
Europe's strong, stable currency. But now, with sterling still some way beneath the exchange rate it had
with the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark then, Mr Major's government seems uncertain about what to make
of the pound's new-found strength. Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, has argued that the
rising pound will dampen inflationary pressures, so reducing the need for him to raise interest rates before
next year's general election. But, more recently, he has echoed the fears of "large numbers of British
industries" that sterling is getting too strong.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sterling's exit
from the <font size=-1>ERM</font> soon after Mr Major pledged to out-muscle the <font
size=-1>D</font>-mark sharply changed British attitudes towards a strong pound. Instead of pushing up
inflation and thus prolonging recession, as was predicted, the weaker pound boosted the international
competitiveness of British firms, helping exports to soar. Britain became a cheap place to visit and to do
business. Huge amounts of foreign investment poured in, reviving bits of the economy as moribund as the
film industry, which has been inundated with work from Hollywood studios attracted by its low production
costs. And all this coincided with huge problems in the big continental economies, especially France, whose
politicians complained endlessly about Britain's "unfair advantage" of cheap sterling.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The stronger pound seems to threaten all this. Will
<i>Newsweek</i> still call London the "world's coolest city" if its high prices, in dollars, scare off
American tourists? Might foreign investors divert their cash elsewhere? According to the British Screen
Advisory Council, Britain is now less expensive than America in only two of the seven main elements of
film-making, compared with five in August. And who will buy British? The Confederation of British Industry
claims that the strong pound is hurting exports. Some analysts in the City of London recently cut their 1996
profit forecasts for leading British exporters by two percentage points.<br> </p><p><b><b>Revaluation or
aberration?</b></b><br> For now, such fears are overdone. It is easy to exaggerate how important cheap
sterling has been to the economy since 1992. The recession of the early 1990s was already over when the
pound left the <font size=-1>ERM</font>. Foreign investors come to Britain as much for its access to
Europe's single market, its flexible labour laws and its English-speaking workers as its weak currency.
Also, although cheap sterling helped exporters, many took the opportunity to pad their profit margins
rather than increase the volume of export sales; their sales need not suffer now if they trim margins again.
Britain's main export markets are likely to grow faster during the next few years than in the recent past,
and this extra demand should make up for any sales lost because of a strong pound.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even after this year's surge the pound seems pretty fairly valued.
Economists disagree greatly about what a "right" exchange rate is. But most estimates suggest that the
pound's trade-weighted value is roughly right. Britain's current account is almost in balance: a far cry
from 1988, when sterling was too strong, hitting exports and boosting imports. The pound's real exchange
rate (the nominal rate adjusted for differences in inflation between countries) is still below its average
over the past 15 years.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Britain's economy, the central
question is whether the pound's rise is a short-term aberration or a fundamental revaluation. Predicting the
foreign-exchange markets is hazardous. Economic theory sheds some light on long-term exchange-rate
movements, but is useless in forecasting either the direction or timing of short-term changes. No one is
absolutely sure why the pound has been so strong this year, which makes it hard to say whether it is still
rising, on a plateau or riding for a fall.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is Britain's growing
inflationary pressures that most probably explain the rise of sterling, reckons David Mackie, an economist
at J.P. Morgan, an investment bank. Investors, including the notorious hedge-fund speculators, have been
buying the pound like hot cakes because Britain is one of the few countries where interest rates are
expected to go up reasonably soon. The currency markets seem to be pricing in a rise of one percentage
point. Meanwhile, rates in America and Japan look stable, and continental Europe's may be ready to fall.
That greater-than-expected differential in interest rates means greater returns for investors who own
pounds. <br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One alternative explanation pins the pound's rise on
expectations that Britain will, after all, join in the single European currency that may start in 1998. That
interpretation looks misguided, since both Britain's main political parties are increasingly lukewarm about
abandoning sterling-- and British voters overwhelmingly oppose doing so. Yet another story in the markets
has sterling in much demand, along with the Swiss franc, as a haven for investors who think the new single
currency will prove inflation-prone. That explanation also strains belief: the money markets expect
inflation to be higher in Britain than in most of the countries likely to join monetary union, so investors
would be more likely to dump sterling than to hold it.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of
this technical stuff will trouble ordinary Britons, few of whom have yet noticed that the pound in their
pocket is for once going up. They will soon catch on to the pleasures of cheap imports and affordable foreign
travel. But those who puff that the pound's recent strength is a long-term "reward" for Britain's improved
economic fundamentals may end up disappointed.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main
reason for long-term changes in exchange rates is differences in inflation rates. British inflation is at its
lowest in decades, but is still higher than in America, Japan and much of continental Europe. There are signs
it will soon rise--particularly if the British government repeats the errors of the late 1980s by using a
strong pound to excuse lax monetary policy. Keeping the pound mighty may take more hard work than
Britain is willing to put in.<br> <br>

<h1>Trade and wages</h1>

<p><b>What effect does freer trade have on the gap between skilled and unskilled workers'
pay?</b></p><br> TRADE is frequently blamed for fuelling wage inequality in rich countries. As tariff
barriers fall and imports rise, goods produced by cheap labour in poor countries compete with those made
by better-paid workers in wealthy ones. Some factories close, others slim their payrolls to cut costs. At
the same time, however, liberal trade causes exports to increase: new factories open, others increase
their payrolls to expand production. Working out the net effect on the pay of different workers is a subtle
problem.<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A theory first developed in the 1940s is frequently
applied to the question. Known as the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, it is a cornerstone of modern thinking
about trade. Paul Samuelson and Wolfgang Stolper predicted that removing trade barriers would have
different effects in different countries. If a country has lots of skilled labour, its exports will tend to be
intensive in skilled labour, and skilled workers will gain from more trade. But if unskilled labour is more
abundant, its exports will be intensive in unskilled labour, so workers with skills will lose.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rich countries have relatively more skilled labour, so freer trade
should raise the wages of skilled workers and lower the wages of the unskilled. Accordingly, many
economists argue that trade accounts for at least some of the growing wage disparity between high-and
low-skilled workers in America, Britain and other advanced economies.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The changing distribution of income in rich countries, especially in
America and Britain, has been widely noted. Less well known is the fact that similar changes have occurred
in some developing countries. Pay differentials between skilled and unskilled workers are often high (see <a
href="fn2.gif">chart</a>); a skilled industrial worker in Thailand, for example,
earned around $7,100 in 1995, according to <font size=-1>UBS</font>, a Swiss bank, while an unskilled
building labourer earned barely one-quarter as much. Since tariffs have been lowered, the gap has widened
in some countries. In Mexico, for instance, the difference between a typical university-educated worker's
pay and that of an unskilled worker rose by a third between 1987 and 1993.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What makes these figures intriguing is that, on the face of it, they
contradict the evidence from rich countries and refute the Stolper-Samuelson theorem. Why? Because the
theory suggests that freer trade should reduce inequality in poorer countries, just as it increases it in rich
ones. In effect, the theory says that whatever sort of labour is most abundant in the economy before
liberalising is the one that prospers most as a result of trade. Poor countries have lots of unskilled labour.
They should therefore export goods that are intensive in unskilled labour, pushing up its wages.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Adding to the puzzle, if the Stolper-Samuelson theory works
anywhere, it should work in the third world. Trade often plays a much more important role in many
developing economies than it does in rich ones, and many poor countries have recently undertaken radical
trade liberalisations. The average tariff in Latin America, for example, has fallen from 45% in 1985 to
13%. Yet Donald Robbins, of Harvard University, finds that wage disparities increased after trade
liberalisation in Chile, Uruguay, Colombia and Costa Rica, as well as Mexico*.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be rash to draw firm conclusions from this handful of
countries. (Unfortunately, few others publish the detailed information on individual workers that is required
to track wage inequalities.) Nonetheless, Mr Robbins's findings demand an explanation. What has gone wrong
with the theory? There are three possible answers:<br> <font size=-1><li></font> <b>Other factors drive
wages</b>. In every case, much else will have changed during the span of time over which wage inequality
is being compared--a change in the trade regime is only one of many differences. In general, growth is going
on. This means that countries are accumulating capital and new technologies, a process that will itself have
a big effect on the distribution of income. Many other disturbances may play a part. In Latin America, for
instance, countries have wrestled with high inflation, deep recessions and huge swings in foreign-capital
flows. Any of these shocks could have influenced wages and overshadowed the direct impact of trade.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Trade raises the demand for skills.</b> Traditional trade theory makes two
big assumptions--that both rich and poor countries use the same kind of technology, and that capital is
internationally immobile. The question is not whether these assumptions are false: they obviously are. The
question is how much it matters. By reducing its trade barriers, a country may be able to import more new
capital equipment. This will bring new technology, which will raise the demand for higher-skilled workers
to use it. Thus freer trade will raise the premium paid to skilled workers in a way not envisaged by
Stolper-Samuelson.<br> <font size=-1><li></font> <b>The China effect.</b> Trade theory traditionally
lumps all developing countries together as having relatively unskilled workforces. But there are substantial
differences among them. China, for example, has hundreds of millions of unskilled workers and relatively
few with skills. Many middle-income developing countries that compete with China in world trade
(Colombia, say, or Chile) have relatively high average skill levels. In such countries, trade liberalisation
might be expected to cause the wage gap to rise in the same way as in rich countries.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The evidence on wage inequality in the third world will be greeted
by many as "further confirmation" that trade hurts the poor. That would be wrong. Greater inequality may
mean only that higher incomes are rising faster than lower ones, not that lower ones are falling. Beyond
that, far from confirming anything, the results only deepen a mystery. They challenge the theory which
seemed, to some, to explain why trade harmed low-income workers in rich countries. If that theory does
not fully explain wage changes in the third world, it may also be deficient when applied to rich countries.
The main explanation for widening wage inequality in rich and poor countries may lie not with trade, but
elsewhere.<br> </p><a name="foot"><br></a><font size=-1>*"Evidence on Trade and Wages in the

<p><b>Water on the moon</b></p>
<h1>In a cavern, in a canyon . . .</h1>

WHEN astronomers first turned their telescopes towards the moon they saw what they thought was a familiar pattern. The light, mountainous regions were obviously land. The dark, smooth ones were clearly water. And so they were named: Ocean of Storms; Bay of Rainbows; Sea of Tranquillity. Unfortunately, when Apollo <font size=-1>11</font> landed in the latter, it confirmed what had, by then, been known for a long time--that these "seas" are actually just dusty deserts. Apart from a flutter of excitement at the discovery of some orange soil during Apollo <font size=-1>17</font>'s visit (it might have been water-containing rust, but turned out to be little beads of glass), there has never been the slightest indication of water on the moon.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those romantics who would like to set up lunar colonies, this has always been something of a disappointment. Having a bit of water around would mean that much less in the way of raw materials need be lugged up from the earth. Such romantics have always hoped against hope that there might be some corner of the moon where water--or, at least, ice--did linger. Their best chance was that it might be found in some deep crater where the sun never shines and the temperature is therefore so low that ice would not evaporate. Now, a paper published in <i>Science</i> suggests that this fantasy may, just possibly, prove to be true.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The crater in question is the Aitkin basin, at the moon's south pole. This has long been regarded as the most likely place to find ice because, at the poles, the sun is so low in the sky that the bottom of a deep hole might well be in permanent shadow. And the Aitkin basin is, indeed, deep-- about 13km (8 miles) at its lowest point. Some 15,500 square kilometres of its floor is reckoned to be in perpetual darkness.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994 this area was probed with radar by <i>Clementine</i>, a scientific spacecraft unusual in that she was built by America's Department of Defence, rather than the civilian National Aeronautics and Space Administration (though <font size=-1>NASA</font> scientists have been heavily involved). <i>Clementine'</i>s  mission was to test a set of optical instruments developed for the "Star Wars" strategic defence initiative of the 1980s. These instruments had, by the 1990s, found themselves more or less redundant for their original purpose, but the defence department was still anxious to try them out, and a mission to the moon seemed a publicity-friendly way of doing it.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, the ice was detected not by one of these flashy cameras, but by an experiment dreamed up as an afterthought. Since <i>Clementine</i> was not actually fitted with a proper radar (or any other instrument that could have probed for ice in the unlit polar regions), a group led by Stewart Nozette, of the American Air Force's Phillips Laboratory in Alexandria, Virginia, thought of using the craft's radio transmitter as a makeshift.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After assessing which areas seemed to be in permanent shade, Dr Nozette and his colleagues pointed the beam from the transmitter towards the moon's surface at such an angle that the reflection could be picked up on earth by one of <font size=-1>NASA</font>'s Deep Space Network radio telescopes. Ice and rock reflect radio waves differently. Rock is as opaque to radio as it is to light. The reflection is therefore fairly clean. Ice, however, is partly transparent. Some of the radio waves are reflected straight back while others bounce around inside it a bit first. This smears the signal.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a smeared signal was detected only from the part of the zone in permanent shadow. Nearby areas exposed to the sun's rays, and similar areas at the moon's north pole, looked, as expected, like bare rock. On the other hand, the smeared signal looks very like that from icy comets, and like that from similarly unilluminated areas of the planet Mercury, which are also thought to contain pockets of ice. Dr Nozette's results suggest that about 1% of the unilluminated area in the Aitkin basin is covered by ice--possibly to a depth of several metres.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where such ice (if ice it be) might have come from is unclear. It almost certainly did not leak out of the moon itself--the rocks brought back by the Apollo missions suggest that the moon has always been bone dry. Most probably it was plastered on to the surface by collisions with comets, and has simply stayed there.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This opens up an interesting possibility. If the moon has stayed put in its orbit, the ice could have been building up at the bottom of the Aitkin basin since its formation, about 4 billion years ago. Each comet that landed nearby would have added a new layer to this particular ice-cream sundae. Examining the area with a drill, then, could yield a valuable record of how comets may have changed during the history of the solar system.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the noises emanating from the publicists at <font size=-1>NASA</font> and the defence department, though, the discovery is not of much use in any plan to build manned bases on the moon. To be useful, such bases would best be sited at the moon's equator, where the maximum amount of sunlight is available to power them. Dragging snow balls from the pole to feed them would not be much easier than making water from the local rocks, or even bringing it from earth. It is one of nature's many little jokes that the only place on the moon where there could possibly be any water is the one place where it is of almost no use at all.<br>

<h1>The philosophers thatSophie skipped</h1>

<p><b>In a world without ideology, people's appetite for philosophy is growing. But the English-language variety is attacked for being scholastic, over-technical and abstruse. Is it?</b></p><br>
"SOPHIE'S WORLD", a history of philosophy written in the form of a novel, has sold at least 9m copies in 36 languages by offering philosophy without tears. What its Norwegian author, Jostein Gaarder, also offers is philosophy without the 20th century. His tour begins 2,600 years ago, and ends, in effect, in the late 1800s. The past century is reduced to a few cups of caf&eacute;-philosophy distilled from Jean-Paul Sartre, a dose of pop physics and one passing reference to a remark by Bertrand Russell about a doomed chicken. Perhaps this was wise. There is, after all, a widespread belief that today's philosophy is bunk. Many people say that "analytical" philosophy--which dominates English-speaking universities, and which has become the main philosophical movement in the West--is a mixture of trifling semantics and impenetrable mathematical squiggles. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet here is a funny thing. Who was it who complained about "the over-refined linguistic quibbling of some philosophers"? And who whinged that "mathematics has come to be the whole of philosophy for modern thinkers"? The first complaint is from Galen, a doctor who wrote long before the fall of the Roman Empire. The second is even older: it comes from Aristotle. The fact is that such criticisms are as ancient as philosophy itself. They are the sort of thing which thinkers in every century have tended to say about the philosophers of their own times. Maybe the 20th century is not so very different from what came before. Philosophy is always liable to look trivial and misguided until it is old and seen through spectacles fogged by nostalgia for some past age of intellectual greatness. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But an even larger obstacle to any proper appraisal of present-day thinking in the English-speaking world is often sheer unfamiliarity. Today's philosophy is much abused but little understood. For a fairer view, it may help to take a closer look at the thinkers with whom 20th-century philosophy began. The story opens as a tale of two cities: Cambridge and Vienna. In 1898, a Cambridge mathematician, Bertrand Russell, fell under the sway of a classicist, G.E.Moore. Both men had turned to philosophy, and Moore was aghast at what he found. He could barely believe that the Hegelians who then dominated the British scene meant what they said. Like the honest boy in Hans Christian Andersen's tale, Moore came to the conclusion that the emperor had no clothes. "What <i>on earth </i>do you mean by that?", he would gasp incredulously in discussions. He wrote that the disagreements which had dogged philosophy "are mainly due to a very simple cause: namely to the attempt to answer questions without first discovering precisely what question it is which you desire to answer." What philosophy needed, according to Moore, was more careful analysis and fewer ridiculous statements.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russell agreed that philosophy required a firmer footing, and when he went to a mathematical conference in Paris in 1900, he thought he had found it. There he met an Italian, Giuseppe Peano, whose work set new standards of logical rigour. Russell thought that Peano had uncovered the true nature of mathematics and had thus answered a puzzle which had baffled philosophers for centuries. This gave Russell an idea. It seemed to him that 19th-century mathematicians had resolved "many of the topics which used to be placed among the great mysteries--for example, the natures of infinity, of continuity, of space, time and motion." Perhaps philosophy could borrow their methods of analysis and finally start to make progress.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This idea was worked up in a vast tome, "The Principles of Mathematics" (1903). While writing it, Russell discovered the work of Gottlob Frege, a German mathematician, who had taken Peano's sort of work even farther. Frege tried to show that part of mathematics was really a branch of logic (and in doing so developed the mathematical logic from which today's computer languages come). Though Frege had no interest in applying his methods outside mathematics, Russell thought they could be the model for a revolution in philosophy as a whole. The "logical-analytical method", he said, amounted to "the same kind of advance as was introduced into physics by Galileo: the substitution of piecemeal, detailed and verifiable results for large untested generalities recommended only by a certain appeal to imagination." Here at last was the sort of philosophy that would not arouse Moore's incredulous gasps. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The Principles of Mathematics" unveiled key methods and tools that shaped 20th-century philosophy. One was the "theory of descriptions", which purported to solve a problem that Plato had wrestled with, namely how one can think and speak of non-existent things. The theory showed how various tricky propositions could be translated into something more perspicuous and less puzzling; it soon came to be seen as a model of how to philosophise. Even more important was the "doctrine of types", which was designed by Russell to deal with some mathematical paradoxes. It proposed a "definite set of rules for deciding whether a given series of words was or was not significant." By specifying a technical criterion of meaningfulness which mathematics had to satisfy, it eliminated the paradoxes. To some philosophers it also suggested the possibility of something broader. Perhaps there could be a general criterion of meaningfulness, which would eliminate not only mathematical paradoxes but a whole host of philosophical problems. This idea was enthusiastically taken up in Vienna. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Logical negativism</b></b><br>
In the 19th century there was a tradition in the German-speaking world of mixing physics and philosophy. Ernst Mach, one of the main influences on Einstein, was an early example. This tradition was the foreign soil in which Russell's "logical-analytical method" grew most impressively; and it was one of the later occupants of Mach's chair in Vienna, Moritz Schlick, who did the most to tend the seedlings. Schlick earned his <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font> in physics under Max Planck, one of the founders of quantum theory; then he turned to more philosophical matters. In 1918 he published a study of knowledge which aimed at "correctly interpreting the achievements of the sciences". It sought not only to analyse scientific results, but also to philosophise in accordance with a scientific method. This was philosophy in Russell's style, and with many references to Russell. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Schlick and his colleagues soon added a twist of their own. In 1924 Schlick founded "the Vienna Circle for the Dissemination of the Scientific Outlook", a discussion group whose members were mainly scientists and mathematicians. By the early 1930s, the group had formed alliances with like-minded thinkers in Berlin, Poland, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. They called their approach to knowledge "logical positivism", though in fact it was rather negative as far as philosophy was concerned. "All real problems are scientific ones," wrote Schlick, "there are no others". What used to be called "philosophical problems" were fated to disappear. Some of them would be "shown to be mistakes and misunderstandings of our language and the others will be found to be ordinary scientific questions in disguise."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to the positivists, there was to be a strict division between all-conquering science and the dwindling ancillary discipline of philosophy. Philosophy could talk about the meanings of statements, but it was up to science to decide if these statements were true. The most useful thing philosophers could do was pack up awkward bits of intellectual furniture so that the scientific removal-men could come and take them away.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russell disagreed. Philosophy was "more critical and more general" than science, but not radically different from it. He wanted to apply scientific methods of analysis to some of the ancient problems of philosophy, not to abolish that venerable discipline. As we shall see, Russell's approach won out in the end. But several other things happened first.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspired partly by the success of Russell's "doctrine of types" in mathematics, the positivists tried to wield a mighty axe called the Verification Principle. This was supposed to provide a general criterion of meaningfulness for all statements of fact, and any which did not meet it were condemned as nonsense. Whatever was empirically unverifiable had to go, so it was farewell to most of traditional philosophy--and much else. This negative aspect of the Vienna Circle's doctrine owed much to their reading of the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus", which had been published by Ludwig Wittgenstein, a former pupil of Russell's, in 1921.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Bewitched-genstein</b></b><br>
In fact, Wittgenstein had less in common with the positivists than they thought. Russell, too, interpreted Wittgenstein's work in his own slanted way. Everyone had his own version of Wittgenstein in those days, and the only point of agreement was that Wittgenstein was a genius.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wittgenstein was the offspring of one of Europe's mightiest industrial barons. In 1908 he left his native Austria to fly kites in Derbyshire, for aeronautical research, and then went to Manchester to study engineering. He became interested in the work of Frege and Russell and came to Cambridge to study under Russell in 1911. After a short period during which he thought that Wittgenstein was mad, Russell soon came to the conclusion that he would shortly be eclipsed by his pupil. Wittgenstein's criticisms of some of Russell's work on mathematical logic were brilliantly penetrating; his views on logic were powerfully original. Russell and Moore thought that the next breakthroughs in philosophy would come from Wittgenstein. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither of them realised just how unusual Wittgenstein's agenda was. Russell and Moore held that the job of philosophy was to analyse the world, but Wittgenstein believed that its job was to analyse language. Most philosophy, he maintained, is fuelled by a dangerous temptation to transgress the limits of language and say the unsayable. Proper philosophy should instead offer a "critique of language", which would reveal these limits and then maintain a dignified silence.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, Wittgenstein was vehemently opposed to the optimism and scientific spirit of Russell. "I have no sympathy for the current of European civilisation and do not understand its goals," he later wrote. It was a delusion, Wittgenstein believed, to think that science and industry could solve man's problems. To philosophise in a scientific spirit--as Russell and the positivists did in their various ways--was a symptom of this delusion. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wittgenstein left Cambridge in 1913 and returned 16 years later. In between, he fought in the first world war, wrote his "Tractatus", gave away his fortune, spent six years as a village school-teacher, designed a house for his sister and met a few members of the Vienna Circle. By the time he came back to Cambridge in 1929, he was evolving a new, therapeutic conception of his "critique of language". The Oxford movement that came to be called "ordinary-language philosophy", and had its heyday from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, was influenced by this new approach.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to Wittgenstein's revised outlook, philosophical problems are to be solved "by looking into the workings of our language . . . not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have always known. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence . . ." The main cause of this alleged bewitchment was language, though it was not the only cause. Another was people's "craving for generality". A third was scientism--that is, a misplaced confidence in purely scientific ways of thinking. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new therapy was supposed to work by examining what people say and thereby revealing the rich diversity of linguistic behaviour. Appreciating this diversity would prevent us from falsely assimilating one "language-game" to another. Wittgenstein had read very little of the philosophy of previous centuries, but he was convinced that this sort of thing was relevant to it. For example, his linguistic therapy showed (or so he thought) that it was a mistake to look for some sort of proof of the existence of physical objects, as many philosophers since Descartes had done. To try and provide such a proof revealed a misunderstanding of how we use words such as "know". We cannot meaningfully question the existence of physical objects, so we should not speak of "demonstrating" their existence either. The language-game of "proof" could not be played in this context.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much of Wittgenstein's therapy concerned the way people talk about mental states. It was this topic which produced some of the best-known work of the Oxford school. Gilbert Ryle's "The Concept of Mind", which sought to exorcise "Descartes's myth" of "the ghost in the machine", is one example. It argued that to talk about human intelligence and consciousness was, in effect, to talk about publicly observable behaviour, not ghostly, inner events. The book's contents and approach are broadly Wittgensteinean.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wittgenstein acknowledged that his way of doing philosophy was a radical departure. But this seemed to him to be entirely appropriate: "Why", he asked, "should philosophy in the age of airplanes and automobiles be the same as in the age when people travelled by coach or on foot?" Russell was not convinced. He accused Wittgenstein and the Oxford school of having abandoned serious intellectual work. He was not the only critic to do so.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the Oxford men officially denied that the analysis of language provided the last word on any philosophical subject, it did seem to take up much of their time. They sometimes substituted an obsession with language for the much-derided obsession with science. (Most were trained as classicists, so they were simply doing what they knew best.) One pupil recalled handing a draft of his thesis to J.L. Austin, a leader of the school, whereupon Austin opened the file at the <dest="of" ref="page"> contents and "proceeded to spend the next three hours discussing the differences between 'contents', 'list', 'index', 'table', etc." The pupil experienced "a Zen-like illumination". But it faded in minutes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Vienna Circle had broken up just before the second world war, and most of the top positivists from the continent emigrated to America. They had mellowed somewhat; the harsh Verification Principle had been largely abandoned by 1950. But they retained their focus on science and mathematical logic. Their continuing work had an enormous impact on American philosophy, and eventually succeeded in reinstating Russell's original conception of philosophy as a partner of science.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Russell's revenge</b></b><br>
From about the mid-1970s, the transatlantic trade in philosophy began to reverse its flow, and America became the great exporter of ideas. British philosophers went as pilgrims to America rather than vice versa. Willard Quine, a Harvard philosopher who had visited the Vienna Circle as a student, and who had worked closely with positivists and ex-positivists ever since, became the most-discussed figure among English-speaking philosophers. Quine propounded a crucial argument that helped to combat the influence of Wittgenstein and to bring philosophy and science closer together. Many people, on both sides of the Atlantic, disagree with the argument, but philosophy is now largely pursued as if it were correct.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Quine argued that the difference between matters of fact and matters of meaning is a difference of degree, not a difference of kind. "All bachelors are unmarried" is true in virtue of its meaning; "Bill Clinton is married" is true in virtue of fact. Quine developed a "holistic" philosophy of language according to which truths of fact blend into truths of meaning, so that there is no absolute distinction between the two. Because Wittgenstein, the early positivists and the Oxford analysts had all asserted that philosophy was concerned with meanings, whereas science was concerned with facts, the barriers which they erected between philosophy and science began to crumble.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As if to reflect this change, many philosophers have been mingling with psychologists, biologists, computer scientists and theoretical physicists, especially in America. Insofar as their work remains distinctively philosophical, it is so largely in Russell's sense of being "more critical and more general" than everyday scientific work. It is more likely to look askance at fundamental presuppositions and to try to relate work in different fields.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, this is a blurring of the boundaries, not a wholesale merger, and by no means all of today's philosophers specialise in questions that have much connection with any scientific research. Nevertheless, most branches of philosophy now have closer links with other subjects--political theory, economics, jurisprudence, for instance-- than they had in Wittgenstein's time. Very few philosophers now think of their subject as entirely cut off from all others. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other big change in philosophy since Wittgenstein's day is that there is much more of it. This too has affected how it is done, and in ways that Russell would largely have approved of. According to a forthcoming study by Tom Baldwin of York University, there are now about 480 professional philosophers in Britain, compared with 122 in 1947. There are about 8,500 in America, according to the Philosophy Documentation Centre (<font size=-1>PDC</font>) in Ohio, and the number of philosophy <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font>s granted in America grew from 83 in 1949-50 to 255 in 1988-89. The result is increased specialisation and the division of labour. The replacement of "large untested generalities" by detailed piecemeal results, which Russell called for, have now been delivered, partly because of changes in academic life.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But are there perhaps now too many detailed piecemeal results? The <font size=-1>PDC</font> records no fewer than 320 philosophical journals currently published in English, of which 184 are American. Privately, and unsurprisingly, many philosophers confess that not all of these outpourings are worthwhile. Yet something similar is true of all academic disciplines. The "logical-analytical method" which Russell advocated, and which the majority of English-speaking philosophers still practise in some form, has become a professional tool like any other. This is presumably what Russell would have wanted. If "analytical" philosophy really is very different from more traditional varieties, it is largely in virtue of being more professional.<br>

<h1 align=center>Latin America's backlash</h1>


AMALAISE is abroad in Latin America. In Mexico, guerrilla groups pop up in dirt-poor rural parts. Argentina's trade-unionists take to the streets against plans to cut welfare and ease labour laws. Brazil's landless clash with its trigger-happy police. Peruvians lose faith in their tough and reforming president; Ecuadoreans elect a proclaimed populist as theirs. Almost everywhere both rich and poor feel less secure, as drugs, guns and violent crime take an ever-stronger hold on the shanty towns that ring so many cities.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all these troubles share a common cause: Colombia's guerrillas, far more numerous and nasty than Mexico's, have been active for 40 years. Yet one thread runs through them all (see <a href="sf0784.html">page</a>). A decade of democratic regimes broadly committed to low inflation, free economies and open trade has not, except in Chile, brought sustained growth; and, while laying the groundwork for that, it has both made old woes more visible and added some new ones. The region stuck to its chosen path through the buffeting of Mexico's 1994-95 currency crisis. But the rewards are still fairly meagre: it may grow by only 3% this year, and, with luck, by 4-5% next. And little of such growth as there is finds its way to the poor. For many, the wrenching changes brought by privatisation, trade opening, and monetary and fiscal prudence have meant bankruptcy, unemployment or the loss of state handouts. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So is the region on the brink of a populist or authoritarian upheaval? Probably not. There is growth, after all: both Mexico and Argentina are recovering from recession. Income distribution has improved a bit--not before time--in Brazil, with the defeat of hyper-inflation. Ecuador's president, once elected, is forgetting some of his wilder promises. In Paraguay an attempted army coup last April was quashed. A recent poll region-wide found only 27% of respondents judging their own country's democracy as working well; yet 61% still see that as the best form of government. The voices of discontent have been unable to articulate more persuasive ways forward.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet they cannot be ignored. Discontent springs from huge social needs. Sustained growth will in time do much to meet these. That means sticking firmly to market-opening. But there is much else to do on the long road from here to there. <br>
</p><p><b><b>The ways ahead</b></b><br>
The challenge is to make both governments and markets more efficient. Beneath the impressive technocrats now managing most Latin American economies, most government agencies remain what they were before: overstaffed and undercompetent bureaucratic disaster-zones. In the creation of wealth, businessmen--and especially would-be businessmen, until they too learn who best to bribe--face networks of red tape. Over-regulation of labour markets hits job-seekers. Employment taxes hit employers, workers and would-be workers alike. Speedy, honest and open civil justice is needed both to ensure the enforcement of contracts and so--perhaps even more important--the confidence that they can be enforced; in practice, nearly all courts are slow-moving and too many corrupt.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the communal use of wealth, the bureaucrats' work would often be better handled by the private sector: pensions, say, or the upgrading of infrastructure. Outright privatisation has brought a rush of capital into telecoms; private concessions can--and in some countries do--improve ports, railways and (though Mexico mishandled its attempt) busy parts of the road system. But in poor countries most of such core areas as education, health care, water and drainage will remain, unavoidably, government's job. The trouble usually is not that it spends too much, but that it provides little value for money. Many tasks now done centrally should be devolved to lower levels of government (provided, notably in Argentina and Brazil, that these are subject to fiscal discipline). Devolution can go far: some Brazilian states have handed budgets directly to schools and parents--and got better education. In partnership with government, the region's multiplying self-help community groups can improve anything from primary health care to housing to environmental protection.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alongside such practical matters, Latin America badly needs to build confidence in the institutions of public life. It is trying to combine democracy with market economics in deeply unequal societies. That can never be easy. It is made harder still by widespread, and often justified, cynicism. The immediate winners from privatisation are usually the well-off; bad enough, in the public eye, but still worse if they are also the president's cronies. Police forces and law courts will seldom be popular; much worse if everyone knows that crime will go unpunished (or be committed) because their officials can be bought. The world, rightly, will never believe in the purity of politics; but at least parties and politicians need not be left free to prove blatantly how right that cynicism is. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Habits and institutions cannot be transformed overnight: look at the opposition Mexico's president has faced in his steps away from one-party rule. Some countries' rigid constitutions, born as they rediscovered democracy but not yet market forces, make change even harder: Brazil's almost dictates bureaucratic inefficiency and fiscal laxity, while encouraging an anarchic party system that leaves law-making easy prey to special interests. But politicians and the powerful can be subjected to independent scrutiny. Outside Mexico, autonomous electoral bodies and free media have made most Latin American voting surprisingly fraud-free. The appointment of judges, enforcement of human rights, auditing of public accounts, conduct of privatisations and subsequent regulation--all can be improved by similar means. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A populist reversal of Latin America's course is far from imminent, but the malaise is real. It should put governments and politicians under notice: they must complete their macroeconomic revolution, and complement it with speedy microeconomic and institutional reform, or risk seeing their hard-won gains eroded by cynicism and discontent.<br>

<h2>Unsettling move</h2>
While Palestinians--later joined by the French government--condemned Israel's planned <b>expansions of existing settlements</b>, Binyamin Netanyahu paid a visit to one. "Not constructive," said even the State Department. Responding to Yasser Arafat's recent claim that he would proclaim a state when the "interim" stage of the peace process is due to be over, Israel's communications minister said that, if so, he himself would propose annexation of the land concerned.<p><p>
The United Nations and <b>Iraq</b> came close to agreement on activation of a deal allowing Iraq to export oil and buy food. The United States said it would not object. Iraq said it would be ready to start pumping 0.8m barrels a day. Oil prices stayed high. <p>
<b>Algerians </b>voted on November 28th on a new draft constitution. It would ban Islamist parties. They boycotted the vote and Islamist terrorist groups threatened to kill anyone who voted.<p>
Argument over military intervention in <b>Zaire</b> went on. Rwanda said its territory could not be used. Uganda said its Entebbe airport could. Canada talked of an airdrop of relief supplies; a "last resort" said <font size=-1>UNHCR</font>, the <font size=-1>UN</font> refugee agency.<p>
An <b>Ethiopian Airlines jet </b> which ran out of fuel after being hijacked, crashed in the sea off the Comoros Islands, killing 127 of the 175 people on board. Doubt remained whether the three hijackers were alive or dead.<p>
<h2>Higher and higher</h2>
A magistrate in Rome asked for Italy's centre-left prime minister, <b>Romano Prodi</b>, to stand trial for alleged abuse of office when he was chairman of a state company, <font size=-1>IRI</font>, in 1993. Italy's right-wing opposition leader, Silvio Berlusconi, also faces corruption charges.<p>
<b>French lorry drivers </b>continued their strike, and their blockades, paralysing many of the main roads in France. Neighbouring countries began to feel the effects. Danish lorry drivers protesting at a tax ruling, blockaded ports and border crossings, causing chaos in their own country.<p>
Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, signed a decree ordering all Russian troops still in <b>Chechnya </b>to withdraw before January 27th. Communists and nationalists in parliament denounced the move and threatened a no-confidence vote.<p>
Ignoring a Russian-brokered compromise between himself and members of his parliament, <b>Belarus</b>'s authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenka, won a referendum to extend his term of office and have more power over parliament and courts.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Croatia's president, <b>Franjo  Tudjman, </b>faced mounting pressure from his own ill-health and from demonstrators in the capital, Zagreb, who protested against the muzzling of an independent radio station.<p>
Big demonstrations in Belgrade are undermining Serbia's president, <b>Slobodan  Milosevic</b>, who had persuaded courts to overturn opposition victories in local elections. <p>
<b>Cuba </b>refused to accept a new ambassador from <b>Spain</b>, which has become less friendly to Fidel Castro since a conservative government led by Jose Maria Aznar came to power in Madrid.<p>
A reform-minded economist, <b>Gediminas Vagnorius</b>, has become prime minister of Lithuania, after the defeat of ex-communists in a general election earlier this month.<p>
<h2>APEC agrees</h2>
The 18 leaders of the <b>Asia-Pa cific Economic Co-opera tion</b> forum, meeting in the Philippines, endorsed a proposed agreement that will "substantially" free trade in information technology by the end of the decadeSouth Africa said it is to end its diplomatic ties with <b>Tai wan </b>and recognise China instead. President Mandela said recently that it would be "immoral" to drop Taiwan, which helped to pay for his election campaign, and has invested heavily in the country. But South Africa is keen to improve its trade with ChinaThe <b>Hong Kong </b>government proposed to introduce an anti-subversion law, in the hope of deterring China from passing a harsher one when it takes over the British colony in July 1997Despite protests about the contest from India's feminists, Marxists and Hindu nationalists, Miss Greece, Irene Skliva, was elected <b>Miss  World </b>in Bangalore<h2>Juice squeezed<p><p><p><p><p></h2>
<b>O.J. Simpson</b>, on the stand for the first time in his civil trial, denied "absolutely" that he killed his ex-wife, Nicole, or her friend, Ronald Goldman, in 1994. He could not, however, account for his and Nicole's blood in the Ford Bronco in which he fled from his house. <p>
The Justice Department decided that <font size=-1>FBI</font> agents should interview contributors to the Democratic National Committee in connection with <b>questionable donations</b> to this year's election campaigns.<p>
<b>Canada's </b>native peoples may get a fairer deal. In a huge report, a royal commission proposed many economic and political steps, including recognition of them as a "third order of government".<p>

<h2>A single step</h2>
The <b>Italian lira</b> re-entered Europe's exchange-rate mechanism. Finance ministers insisted on a strongish central rate of 990 lire to the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark; in subsequent trading the lira strengthened. Keen to adopt the single currency at the first stage, Italy must keep the lira in the <font size=-1>ERM</font> for two years.<p>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>The pound </b>rose to its highest level in four years against the dollar, driven by hopes that British interest rates would rise. This week's pre-election budget reinforced these expectations.<p>
The Russian government showed its confidence in maintaining the value of <b>the  rouble </b>by setting an annual range for the currency against the dollar instead of the usual six-monthly band. The rouble will start 1997 in a range of 5,500-6,100 roubles to the dollar and decline to 5,750-6,350 roubles.<p>
<h2>Taking stock</h2>
<b>Union Bank of Switzer land</b>, beset by bad loans, will report its first full-year loss since the second world war and take a one-off charge of SFr3 billion ($2.3 billion), leaving it with a loss for 1996 of about SFr500m. Standard & Poor's, an American credit-rating agency, put a watch on its <font size=-1>AAA</font> rating. Like other banks hurt by Switzerland's prolonged recession, <font size=-1>UBS</font> will also restructure its domestic operations.<p>
A Detroit judge ruled that <b>General Motors </b>could pursue racketeering charges against Jose Ignacio Lopez, who is accused of taking secret documents with him when he left <font size=-1>GM</font> to join <b>Volkswagen</b>. Opel, <font size=-1>GM</font>'s subsidiary in Germany, denied reports that it was in talks with <font size=-1>VW</font> over an out-of-court settlement. Any deal, it said, would require the firing of Mr Lopez, payment for damages, and a public apology.<p>
American shares soared, taking the <b>Dow Jones </b>above 6,500 for the first time and helping seven European markets to reach new records before dropping back. Bond prices rose.<p>
<b>ABN Amro</b>, the Netherlands' largest bank, bolstered its position as the biggest foreign bank in America with a $1.95 billion purchase of Standard Federal, the mid-west's biggest savings bank.<p>
Germany unveiled a bill to improve <b>shareholders'  rights</b>. Among the proposals: companies will be allowed to buy back up to 10% of their shares; supervisory boards will be limited to 12 members; and schemes limiting shareholders' voting rights will be banned.<p>
Malaysia's overcrowded banking sector is being shaken up by a complex deal to form a huge Malaysian financial-services company. <b>Rashid Hussain</b>, a big stockbroking firm and property developer, paid M$2.16 billion ($855m) for a 75% share of Kwong Yik Bank, which will later merge with <font size=-1>DCB</font> Holdings, Rashid Hussain's banking operations.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<b>Skandia</b>, a Swedish insurance company, and <b>Stadshypotek</b>, Sweden's biggest mortgage bank, are to merge, creating a financial-services group with a market value of SKr45 billion ($6.7 billion). An angry government, whose proposed sale of its 34% stake in Stadshypotek triggered the talks (of which it was not aware), insisted its stake would go to auction.<p>
Following the lead of Japan's biggest stockbroker, Nomura Securities, which recently bailed out its lending unit, <b>Daiwa Securities</b>, the second biggest, will inject &#165;120 billion ($1.1 billion) of capital into Daiwa Finance to write off bad property loans. Other Japanese stockbrokers are likely to follow suit.<p>
Russia raised $1 billion from a debut Eurobond--twice as much as originally planned. It also agreed with the French government to pay $400m to French holders of <b>Imperial  Russian bonds</b> in default since 1917--a deal derided by the bondholders, who had claimed $30 billion.<p>
<h2>Smoke damage</h2>
<b>Eurotunnel</b> shares dived on news that the damage caused by a fire in the Channel tunnel could delay the resumption of a full rail service for months. They recovered when the company said that this would not affect its restructuring.<p>
In America's biggest gas-and-utility merger, <b>Duke Power</b>, a North Carolina electricity utility, agreed to buy <b>PanEnergy</b>, a Texan natural-gas concern, for $7.7 billion.<p>
<b>Olivetti</b>'s new boss said that his struggling company's plan to sell assets might be delayed. He gave a warning that a proposed investigation by parliament could precipitate Olivetti's closure.<p>
The <b>Suez Canal</b> will give some ships discounts ranging from 5% to 35% to combat competition from oil and gas pipelines and from other shipping routes.<p>
The Russian government dismissed a consortium of western banks that was to have led a $1 billion initial public offering of <b>Russia's telecoms  holdings</b>; it also combined its stakes in the country's two largest telecoms operators. A group led by two domestic banks, with close connections to Boris Yeltsin's presidential campaign, are likely to become not only the new advisers but big shareholders too. The government threatened a large car maker, Avtovaz, with bankruptcy. <p>
France said it would sell at least another 5% of <b>Groupe  Bull</b> in the next few weeks to take its stake in the computer maker below 50%. The government also fired the boss of Groupe des Assurances Nationales two weeks after opposition from within the state-owned firm had forced the postponement of its banking subsidiary.<p>
Representatives from America's television and computer industries reached agreement on technical standards for transmitting <b>digital-televi sion signals</b>.<p>

<h1>Gestures against reform</h1>

<p><b>In dribs and drabs, a populist reaction is gathering pace against the bold free- market reforms of Latin America</b></p><br>
BEFORE Eastern Europe, Latin America was the region that first saw the ascendancy of free-market democrats over authoritarian protectionists. In just a decade, well-educated, market-minded civilians arrived in power everywhere (bar Cuba), shoving aside the protectionists and brass-hats who had long run the place. In some countries radical free-marketeers have been in charge (Argentina, Mexico); others have been run by more gradualist reformers (Brazil, recently Chile). But everywhere, the direction of policy has been the same: to chop back the over-mighty state. And everywhere, the results have been similar: inflation is down; foreign investment is up; dictatorships are out.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet (as in much of Eastern Europe) the liberal ascendancy stopped short of triumph. And now a backlash is appearing. From the rugged sierras outside the Mexican resort of Acapulco, the People's Revolutionary Army (<font size=-1>EPR</font>) has been running a vicious bombing campaign in half a dozen states. Maximo Gomez, the priest of Atoyac de Alvarez, a scrubby town in rebel country, thinks that "90% support the guerrillas in their heart . . . if the government does not act soon, this place will explode."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rise of the <font size=-1>EPR</font> is a small but worrying part of wider regional reaction against the new generation of free-market reformers. The great expectations that accompanied their bold reforms have come crashing down. Unemployed and angry voters have looked to populists--only to find the easy solutions they profferred also disappear. The resulting disgust with all politics is coinciding with rising violence of all kinds, from guerrilla action to crime.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This rising discontent represents the greatest challenge yet faced by the continent's reformers. Chile's President Eduardo Frei seems to have got the message. Earlier this month, he got the annual summit meeting of Latin American and Iberian leaders to focus on "governability for efficient and participatory democracy". In plain English, rulers too are frustrated by the pace of reform. They are looking for new ways to encourage growth and speed up the delivery of its social benefits. Time does not seem to be on their side.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the sweeping nature of the reforms, that is hardly surprising. For decades, Latin America was mired in state controls, bouts of hyperinflation and slump. Hope dawned in the late 1980s, when a new generation of brash, foreign-educated leaders embraced the so-called "Washington consensus", a heady mix of privatisation, financial liberalisation and trade reform which sought to balance the books and end the power of a corrupt and paternalistic state.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite bumps along the way--most notably Mexico's currency and banking troubles of 1994-95--the gains are undeniable. One is the slaying of inflation, that most insidious of taxes on the poor, which fell from a regional mean of 196% in 1991 to just 19% last year. Fiscal discipline has slashed the average budget deficit by two-thirds, from 5.5% of <font size=-1>GDP </font>in 1988 to 1.8% in 1995.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most impressive has been the embrace of freer trade. Protectionist barriers have tumbled unilaterally or as part of accords which doubled intra-regional exports to $32 billion in the five years to 1994. <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>, the North American Free-Trade Agreement, has linked Mexico with the giants to its north. In South America, Mercosur is edging Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil the same way. In December 1994, Latin leaders pushed the United States and Canada to agree to negotiate a Free-Trade Area of the Americas by 2005. The opening of the region's economies has spurred exports; they grew 6% a year during the early 1990s, up from 1.8% a year during the mid-1980s.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This first wave of reform was popular, as liberalisation boosted growth. Along came an expansion of credit and a flood of cheap imports, which pleased consumers, and propelled reformers such as Peru's Alberto Fujimori and Argentina's Carlos Menem to re-election. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the reforms' popularity was based partly on unrealistic expectations. They were liked not because they laid a foundation for a far brighter future than had seemed possible during the "lost decade" of the 1980s. Rather, voters liked reform because it was accompanied by spurts of growth. Alas, these boomlets were not "the pay-off for reform", as Ricardo Hausmann of the Inter-American Development Bank (<font size=-1>IDB</font>) argues. Rather, many of them were fuelled partly or largely by one-off inflows that resulted from the return of stability. In Mexico and Venezuela short-lived booms ended in banking crises; Brazil's boom escaped that, but not by much; Argentina's was killed by sudden monetary contraction after the Mexican crisis.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fundamental economic outlook is favourable. But the poor cannot eat "fundamentals". What they see is that the region's traditionally wide gap between incomes is widening further. The reforms of the early 1990s did reduce the percentage in poverty, but population growth ensured that the absolute number soared (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart 1</a>). Real wages have fallen. Unemployment in most countries is now higher than in 1990. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reforms have not yet delivered the kind of sustained growth needed to wipe out poverty. True, the region's <font size=-1>GDP</font> grew 3.5% in 1991 after the reforms started. But growth fell to 0.8% last year after Mexico's crash. From about 3% this year, it may reach 4% next year. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not bad, but it may not be enough. Many economists reckon growth of 6% will be needed to reduce poverty as populations continue to rise. A year ago, Shahid Burki, until recently the World Bank's top Latin America man, thought regional growth might reach 6% soon. No longer. In a candid and controversial assessment, he argued that the ripple effects of the Mexican crisis have exposed the fragility of banks from Mexico to Argentina. He worries that it will take another decade to achieve a stable growth rate of 6% or so. Will voters wait that long?<br>
</p><p><b><b>Abajo neoliberalismo!</b></b><br>
The answer may be no. In recent months, the golden boys of reform--Messrs Menem and Fujimori--have seen their popularity plummet. Everywhere, polls show citizens have an exceptionally low opinion of politicians and parties (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart 2</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What seems to be happening is that middle-class folk are joining the backlash of the poor. A remarkable revolt took place at a recent assembly of Mexico's ever-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (<font size=-1>PRI</font>). Furious that unpopular market reforms had resulted in electoral defeats, hardliners rebelled. "Down with neo-liberalism!" rang the cries as they voted to stop privatisation and ban technocrats from high office. The public cheered the rebellion. Middle-class anger at cuts in utility and energy subsidies helped drive Venezuela's Carlos Andres Perez from office in 1993. And Nicaraguans were so disgusted with six years of <font size=-1>IMF</font>-encouraged reform that nearly 40% (on the official count) voted for the ex-Marxist Sandinists in the recent election. The Sandinists did not win the election, but the warning was plain.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This backlash may, however, bring disappointment and frustration. In Mexico, the reaction against reform was led by the dinosaurs of the <font size=-1>PRI</font>, who, if their record in office in the 1960s and 1970s is any guide, are more likely to stuff their pockets once in power than to help the poor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In more pluralistic countries, the backlash is no more likely to lead to leftward policy shifts. By and large, the Latin left has failed in opposition. Alvaro Vargas Llosa, the son of Mario Vargas Llosa, a Peruvian writer and defeated presidential candidate in 1990, explains why in a controversial book, "The Idiot's Guide to Latin America". The left, he says, blames the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, multinational companies and the <font size=-1>IMF</font> for the region's woes. Leftist leaders have not come up with any coherent alternative to the prevailing free-market agenda.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old-style populists are no better at defusing voters' discontent, though for a different reason. Venezuela's Rafael Caldera portrayed himself as an outsider who would end unpopular reforms; he won in 1993. In Ecuador, the populist to end all populists, Abdala Bucaram, swept into office last July with a campaign featuring rock <font size=-1>CD</font>s, strippers and pork-barrel politics. Yet in office both returned to their senses. Mr Caldera is now implementing <font size=-1>IMF</font>-style reforms, while Mr Bucaram has taken advice from Domingo Cavallo, the architect of Argentina's reforms. Presidents Menem and Fujimori both traversed a similar path. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Enter the caveman</b></b><br>
The resulting victory of sound policies over populism is good news for the economy. It may give the policy reforms a little more time to work. But if so, the extra time may be bought at the expense of further political disillusion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Guerrilla insurgencies, which many thought would subside with the Central American civil wars of the 1980s, are back. Colombia, where peace had seemed not far out of reach a year ago, has seen guerrillas unleash attacks of such fury that some compare the past few months to the early days of <i>la violencia</i>, the terrible civil war of the 1950s which claimed nearly 300,000 lives. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Colombia is the worst case but not the only one. Peru's Shining Path has shown, through recent horrific attacks, that the capture of Abimael Guzman, its mastermind, has not dealt it a death blow. Mexico has both the telegenic masked Zapatists and the <font size=-1>EPR</font>, the "cavemen of the left", as Denise Dresser, a Mexican political scientist calls them, roaming the countryside.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is easy to dismiss this--as some officials do--as merely a tale of bandits in remote regions. Certainly, guerrilla violence is nothing like as bad as it was in the 1960s and 1970s. Nor are guerrillas any longer the proxy warriors of a cold war fought in Uncle Sam's backyard. Yet if their ideology does not amount to much, their willingness to resort to violence does. For guerrilla activity is just part of a much broader escalation of violence. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nearly every city in Latin America is more dangerous today than it was ten years ago, before the reforms began. The region's murder rate, already six times the world average, is surging (see <a href="sf3.gif">chart 3</a>). Kidnappings are rife; half of all the world's abductions take place in Colombia, where rich and poor pay a combined total ransom of $100m a year to get their loved ones back. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The root causes of violence are complex, ranging from drug trafficking and consumption to income inequality, mega-cities without services, and corrupt police and courts. But, according to Luis Ratinoff of the <font size=-1>IDB</font>, discontent with the political order has contributed to the recent spurt in violence. He thinks that the demise of traditional purveyors of hope--from radical clergymen to Utopian parties and trade unions-- means that those frustrated by the reforms may be more willing to resort to violence. Even in Mexico, traditionally one of the region's more peaceful countries, a poll by a daily newspaper, <i>Reforma</i>, showed that nearly a third of the population believes armed violence is justified.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Institutional breakdown</b></b><br>
Contributing to this strain on the rule of law is the weakness of institutions. With few exceptions, courts are inefficient and corrupt; in many countries, policemen and former policemen engage in murder.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The spiral of violence has produced a spiral of spending on private security, which often contributes to more crime, as private armies turn into paramilitary squads. All told, the region spends an astonishing 13-15% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> on security expenses (both private and public). That is more than total welfare spending. It represents a crippling burden on the economy. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rich and the middle classes may be able to afford this for a while. But the poor cannot. They are turning to mob justice. In the past few months, there have been televised lynchings of suspected criminals by villagers in Ecuador, Mexico and Guatemala.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Frightened by the violence, governments are calling in the military. The army has been given special powers in chunks of Colombia. Several Mexican states have a heavy military presence. Over a dozen of Peru's departments have been under army rule for years. One of Mr Bucaram's first acts as president was to give the Ecuadorian army a role in public security. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One worry is that these armies may not be under full civilian control. In Chile, General Augusto Pinochet today cannot be sacked by the civilian president. In Venezuela, the soldiers who launched two bloody coup attempts in 1992 have been granted a pardon. In Paraguay, a seditious general nearly toppled the civilian government earlier this year. By and large, though, the threat is not (at least, not now) the old Latin American one of the <i>caudillo</i>, the army strongman. It is that, in dealing with security problems, too many armies think they can do more or less as they like.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Civilian rulers, in short, are failing to strike a balance between democracy and efficiency--and the answer, some people think, is to have less democracy. "Right or wrong," says Peter Hakim of Inter-American Dialogue, a think-tank, "the public blames democracy for the current outbreaks of criminal violence." Some technocrats are beginning to wonder whether too much democracy is a reason why reforms have been so slow to bear fruit.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Peru and Argentina, presidents have got the constitution changed to allow themselves immediate re-election. The presidents of Brazil and Ecuador are thinking about following suit. There are arguments for this trend, which is anyway very different from the old military authoritarianism. Civilians are still in charge and are still submitting themselves to the test of electoral opinion. Nevertheless, in the context of widespread discontent, growing violence, and military rule in some areas, there are risks. The consequence may well be to shift attention away from the painstaking business of building up institutional democratic bulwarks (political parties, the courts, an accountable civil service) and towards the personalisation of power.<br>
</p><p><b><b>A Santiago consensus</b></b><br>
If that danger is to be avoided, some policy shifts may well be needed. John Williamson, formerly of the Institute for International Economics, muses that a powerful president may be best for governability and growth. That is remarkable coming from the father of the Washington consensus, whose followers have tried to get the state out of almost everything. He now says: "Policy needs to shift from cutting back a state that had become bloated to strengthening a number of key state institutions whose efficient functioning is important for rapid and/or equitable growth." Call this policy shift the Santiago consensus:<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Strengthen the state.</b> In their zeal to end the overbearing state, some reformers fear they went too far. Devolution of central power can allow local elites to derail reform. It is clear that tackling profligate state governors in Brazil and Argentina, or drug barons in Mexico or Colombia, requires a strong president. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Heighten supervision</b>. Privatisation and deregulation have sometimes ended in corruption or corporate crisis. Mr Williamson recommends the setting up of institutions similar to America's Securities and Exchange Commission to improve supervision. Many argue for independent central banks. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Bolster institutions</b>. Disregard for the law has made reform of the judiciary and police essential. Already, America's <font size=-1>US AID</font> is helping train new police forces in Haiti and El Salvador. The World Bank is helping overhaul Venezuela's secretive and inefficient judicial system. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Target social spending where it is  most needed.</b> Latin America spends more of its <font size=-1>GDP </font>on social services than the Asian tigers, but lags behind in standards of primary education and basic public health. A main reason, suggests the <font size=-1>IDB</font> in its new annual report, is that social spending is run by centralised bureaucracies which are corrupt. It argues that local governments and non-governmental agencies should be permitted to provide social services. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the populist backlash, the authoritarian temptations and the economic obstacles ahead, can Latin America stick with market reforms and democracy? Paul Krugman, an eminent American economist, argued last year that the zeal for reform "may usefully be thought of as a sort of speculative bubble" and that Mexico's crisis marked the beginning of its deflation.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may be too pessimistic. Latin American leaders, at any rate, seem determined to stay the course, if only because their room for manoeuvre is restricted both by financial markets and the glare of publicity (in Mexico, <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> and the American television spotlight it throws on the country was a big reason why the army did not try to crush the Zapatists).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the most likely outcome of the strains and stresses of reform remains a long, hard slog towards stable growth. A shift towards new ways of maintaining a social safety net could help calm the violent backlash and recoup some of the support for reform free-marketeers once enjoyed. Even then, it will not be easy. Sebastian Edwards of the University of California, Los Angeles puts it this way: being a reformer in Latin America is rather like running up a down escalator: you have to keep running to stand still.<br>

<h1>The great O.J. replay</h1>

<font size=1>LOS ANGELES</font><p>
TWO and a half years after the murder, and 13 months after an extraordinarily protracted criminal trial had found him not guilty, O.J. Simpson finally took the witness stand on November 22nd. His testimony was the central act in a civil case brought against Mr Simpson by the victims' families for the "wrongful deaths" of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman outside Nicole's house. Deeply familiar as the story is, the case has lost none of its power to transfix, divide and unite Americans. Even though the judge has barred cameras from the courtroom, Mr Simpson is once again the talk of every bar-room and dinner-table in the country. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Simpson case touches on three great American obsessions: celebrity, crime and, above all, race. Johnnie Cochran, Mr Simpson's leading lawyer in the criminal case, deliberately made race, rather than murder, the subject of that trial. He made sure that the majority of jurors were black women, since it had been suggested that black women were even more likely than black men to believe that Mr Simpson was innocent. And he painted Mr Simpson, who had hitherto moved almost exclusively in white society, as a victim of racial oppression.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Cochran's tactics even included redecorating Mr Simpson's house before a visit by the jury, substituting pictures of his relatives for those of his white girlfriends and hanging a copy of Norman Rockwell's painting, "The Problem We All Live With", in which a black girl walks to school surrounded by federal marshals, outside his bedroom. And he accused the Los Angeles Police Department of a large-scale conspiracy to frame a black hero. The result was that, when the verdict came, the nation was sharply divided on racial grounds, with blacks regarding the outcome as a vindication and whites seeing it as a travesty of justice.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The civil trial differs from the criminal trial in four important ways. Mr Simpson will lose his fortune rather than his freedom if he is found guilty. The proceedings are less skewed towards the defendant: the burden of proof is not quite so heavy, and the judge does not have to bend quite so far to protect his rights. The majority of the jury are white rather than black women. And Mr Simpson (who exercised his constitutional right not to testify in the previous trial) has no choice but to take the stand.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His appearance there sent the media into a frenzy. The big news networks employed teams of tame academics and lawyers and produced regular updates throughout the day. The E! channel (which specialises in celebrity trivia) tried to make up for the ban on cameras in court by putting on nightly dramatisations of the proceedings. On talk radio, the talk is of little else; newspapers and magazines are once again filling up with details about Ford Broncos, bloodied gloves and Italian shoes. The media have virtually mounted an assault on the Santa Monica courthouse, masterminded from a mass of news-trucks nicknamed "Camp O.J.", and would-be spectators arrive at four in the morning to compete in a lottery for courtroom seats. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the three days he had him on the stand, Daniel Petrocelli, the plaintiffs' leading lawyer, subjected Mr Simpson to a blitz of scornful, rapid-fire questions, intended as much to rile him into losing his temper as to expose weaknesses in his argument. Addressing him as "sir", but in a voice tinged with contempt, he once got so close to Mr Simpson that he had to be asked to step back. Mr Simpson stood up well to this barrage, keeping his temper under control, speaking in a clear, emphatic voice and, after a shifty start, making eye-contact with the jury. Yet after three days of questioning his position was weakened.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Simpson admitted he had no idea how the victims' blood ended up in his car and house, or how his own blood turned up at the crime scene. (His lawyers will no doubt offer some explanation as the trial progresses.) He also admitted that he had no idea how he got a deep gouge on his hand on the day of the murders. He swore that he had never hit, struck or slapped his ex-wife. But Mr Petrocelli placed an enlarged photograph of Nicole's bruised and beaten face on the wall behind Mr Simpson, and reminded him that he had entered a plea of no contest to a charge of battering her in 1989. Mr Simpson denied retrieving a "Dear John" telephone message from a girlfriend on the night of the murder. But Mr Petrocelli produced telephone bills proving that he had listened to the message.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Petrocelli's aim is, first, to persuade the jury that if Mr Simpson can lie about hitting his wife or receiving telephone calls from his mistress, he can also lie about murder; and, second, to provide an explanation of why he acted as he did. He is trying to present him as a jealous and abusive husband who finally cracked in May 1994, when Nicole made it clear that she no longer wanted to see him and returned a $6,000 birthday present.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Petrocelli succeeded in introducing three new pieces of evidence. The first was the fact that, shortly after his arrest, Mr Simpson's defence team had given him a polygraph test and produced a score so dismal as to suggest "extreme deception". The second was a telephone conversation with the police during the famous slow-motion car chase in 1994. Mr Simpson told the police (whom he later accused of framing him) that "I know you're doing a good job" and said that "No one's going to be hurt. I'm the only one that deserves it." The third was a photograph of Mr Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes--the type of rare, expensive shoes that left footprints at the scene of the crime. Mr Simpson has always denied owning such "ugly-ass shoes" and maintains that the photograph is a fake.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dynamics of the civil trial are turning out to be very different from those of its predecessor. The plaintiffs have learned the importance of keeping things concise and focused: they are likely to make their case in six weeks, compared with the six months the prosecution took in the criminal trial. The judge, Hiroshi Fujisaki, has added to this businesslike atmosphere. Nicknamed the "anti-Ito" because he is as intolerant of rambling as his predecessor was indulgent of it, he dismissed a juror on November 26th because she passed a favourable comment on a tie worn by a member of the prosecution team.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More important still, he has done his best to keep the race card out of the trial. He has forbidden the defence to harp on about the testimony of Mark Fuhrman, a former detective whose unrelated remarks about "niggers" did much to scupper the criminal trial, or to indulge in "far-fetched hypothesising" about racist conspiracies. This will make it hard for the defence to argue, as it did in the criminal case, that Mr Simpson is the victim of an anti-black plot. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest worry about the trial is not that the judge is ruling out important evidence, but that Mr Simpson is being subjected to double jeopardy. Critics argue that, after two and a half years of non-stop commentary on the subject, no jury will be able to come to a fair verdict on Mr Simpson, particularly as so many of the leading commentators have proclaimed that the criminal trial was a travesty of justice. But against the fear of double jeopardy should be set the fact that a growing number of high-profile cases are now going to a second trial, simply because the first trials were ruined by a mixture of racial politics, media pressure and courtroom charisma.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Rodney King case, four police officers were acquitted of beating up a black motorist because the case was tried before an all-white jury, and because one of the accused policemen, Stacey Koon, put up a compelling performance. A jury failed to convict the Menendez twins of murdering their parents--despite the fact that they admitted to killing them--because their lawyer selected the jurors carefully and played on their emotions like a master. But charismatic performances are difficult to repeat, and moving a trial to another district can make it harder to play the race card. In a legal system that is being distorted by race and celebrity, perhaps it takes a little double jeopardy to remind Americans that judicial procedure is a serious thing.<br>

<h1>Where are they now?</h1>

<font size=1>LOS ANGELES</font><p>
AS THE second Simpson trial gathers pace, we catch up on the careers of the leading players in the first: <ul><p>
<b>The "dream team" of defence lawyers</b> has broken up.<b> Johnnie Cochran </b>thrives, trotting the world giving lectures on civil rights and appearing endlessly on radio and television. He is the author of "Journey to Justice", and his legal career booms. <b>Robert Shapiro </b>has tried to reintegrate himself into the white world of west Los Angeles. His recent book, "The Search for Justice", elaborates his thesis that "not only did we play the race card, we dealt it from the bottom of the deck." The two men no longer talk.<p>
<b>Marcia Clark</b>, the leading prosecutor, received a $4m advance for a book on the trial. This is believed to be the third-biggest non-fiction advance in publishing. <br>
<b> </b><br>
<b>Lance Ito, </b>the judge, continues to try cases. His second most famous case also ended in disaster: a federal judge overturned the conviction in California of Charles Keating, a financier involved in the S & L debacle of the 1980s, because Judge Ito instructed the jury erroneously.<p>
<b>Kato Kaelin</b>, the house-guest whose name became synonymous with freeloading, has acquired a fan club and become a talk-show star. To judge from his evidence in the current trial, he has also learned how to use verbs. <p>
The <b>Ford Bronco</b> has been put up for auction, but was priced too high and attracted no bidders.</ul><br>

<p><b>The economy</b></p>
<h1>Consuming passion</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p>
THE Thanksgiving turkey digested, Americans perform a favourite rite: they go shopping. The day after Thanksgiving marks the beginning of the retailers' holiday season, the busiest shopping day of the year. But are Americans today in the mood to consume?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Much hangs on the answer to this question. After spending furiously during the first half of the year, consumers suddenly held back over the summer. Since consumer spending--on everything from cars to haircuts--makes up around two-thirds of overall demand, the result was a sharp slowing in the economy's pace. According to the Commerce Department's latest estimate, released on November 27th, America's <font size=-1>GDP</font> rose by an annualised 2% between July and September, well below the booming 4.7% of the second quarter. Were it not for a sizeable rise in business inventories, the growth rate would have slipped further. Whether this was simply a much-needed moderation of pace or the beginning of a more marked slowdown depends a great deal on what American consumers do over the next few months. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are several reasons to expect consumption to recover. Unemployment remains extraordinarily low, and real incomes are rising strongly. Wall Street is also behaving spectacularly: the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 8% since the election alone, and is up 70% since the beginning of last year (see <a href="fn6502.html">page</a>). Higher share prices make shareholders feel richer, and perhaps inclined to spend more. In the past two years the soaring stockmarket has added more than $2.3 trillion to household portfolios. Although most of these shares are held by the richest, millions of ordinary Americans now have mutual funds and retirement accounts. A boom on Wall Street could therefore affect consumption more than it used to.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, people say they are confident. The two indices of consumer confidence most closely watched by economists both show Americans feeling bouncy. The Michigan index of consumer sentiment, released earlier in November, has hit its highest level since 1986. The Conference Board survey on consumer confidence (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>) shows that Americans are more upbeat about current business conditions than at any time in the 1990s, although they are slightly more worried about the future. Put these factors together, the optimists argue, and you will get exactly the kind of moderate rise in consumption the economy needs for "Goldilocks growth"--not too fast and not too slow. Although the actual fourth-quarter <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth figures may look anaemic as firms reduce some unwanted inventory, the stage will be set for the expansion to continue into the indefinite future.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not everyone shares that view. Pessimists point to the fact that consumers are heavily indebted and the growth of new consumer credit has been slowing. Both factors might suggest that Americans will save rather than spend more. This analysis is right, to a point. Total household debt (including mortgages and other consumer credit) now amounts to 84 cents out of every dollar of after-tax personal income, the highest level ever. More important than the stock of debt is the burden of servicing it. Measured correctly this, too, is high. For example, many Americans now lease their cars rather than buying them. Including car-lease payments as well as car-loan instalments brings total household debt service to 18 cents out of every dollar of income, about the same as it was at its peak in 1989. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Less clear, however, is how far all this debt will weaken consumption. Debts have been rising for some time, but did little to dampen demand earlier this year. A greater risk is that consumption may rebound too strongly, pushing the economy to grow too quickly. Any sign of rapid acceleration or whiff of inflation might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, a move some people had expected in September. That is something that financial markets and most Americans have stopped worrying about. They may come to regret that.<br>

<h1>The ghosts at the EMU feast</h1>

<font size=1>BRUSSELS</font><p>
<p><b>The lira's re-entry into the exchange-rate mechanism has increased the  chances that most of the European Union's countries may join a single cur rency on January 1st 1999. But pitfalls still strew the path</b></p><br>
IT WAS just like old times. A Saturday summons of monetary officials to Brussels, a row, then a tortured finance ministers' negotiation that ran almost until the markets reopened on Monday. It could have been any of the myriad realignments of Europe's exchange-rate mechanism in the 1980s and 1990s. This time, however, it was a case of readmitting, not devaluing, a currency: the Italian lira, which was ejected by the system, along with the British pound, in September 1992. Surely this should have been a matter for celebration. So why the row?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the answers to that question are to be found some hard truths, not about the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, but about Europe's prospective passage towards its single currency, the euro. The ostensible argument over the weekend of November 23rd-24th concerned the lira's parity. Italy, whose economy has flourished since its currency fell from its old <font size=-1>ERM</font> central rate of 802 lire to the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, wanted the new parity to be fixed no stronger than 1,000. It expected the French, who say they have suffered badly from what they call Italy's earlier "competitive devaluation", to fight for a stronger lira. In the event, it was the Germans who fought harder--but settled for a central rate of 990.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since <font size=-1>ERM</font> currencies can now fluctuate by as much as 15% either side of their central rates, this will make little practical difference--which is why the French were quite relaxed. The Germans, however, had a different agenda. They wanted to stress publicly how strict they would be, not just about the <font size=-1>ERM</font> but, more importantly, about the single currency. After the deal was done, the president of Germany's Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, swiftly made plain that although Italy had now rejoined the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, its qualification for the single currency was far from assured.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Tietmeyer has reasons to worry. When the Maastricht treaty was negotiated in 1991, the Germans insisted on tough criteria to ensure that countries seeking to join the new currency should have low inflation rates, low long-term interest rates, stable exchange rates within the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, and low public-sector deficits and debt. For a while, it seemed that such rules would narrow the starting cluster to the Benelux countries, Austria, Germany, France and perhaps Ireland--and even that would have required a flexible interpretation of the debt criterion for the Irish and the Belgians.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More recently the picture has changed. Earlier this month the European Commission forecast that no fewer than 12 of the Union's 15 countries--that is, all except Britain, Italy and Greece--might, broadly, meet the Maastricht criteria in 1997 (see <a href="eu1.gif">chart</a>), including the toughest one of all, the ceiling for budget deficits at 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Since then both Italy and, this week, Britain have put forward budgets that they claim will bring them below the 3% ceiling. With Finland and Italy both now inside the <font size=-1>ERM</font>, only Sweden, Britain and Greece could be said not to comply with the exchange-rate criterion.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a rapid change has seemed incredible to many, notably the Germans, who dismissed the commission's forecasts as over-optimistic and complained that the 1997 budgets of several countries included a host of one-off measures and dodgy accounting fiddles. Most striking are: France's plan to count a one-time transfer of cash from France T&eacute;l&eacute;com to the government, which in turn will take on the company's pension liabilities; Spain's tactic of using privatisation receipts to pay for losses in other state-owned industries; and Italy's planned "euro tax", which is to be partially refunded in future years.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sums involved are significant: the France T&eacute;l&eacute;com ploy is worth 0.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> and the euro tax 0.6%. Sceptics also point to a report of the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of a European central bank, which was published the same day as the commission forecasts and asserted that "progress in fiscal consolidation has generally been too slow." The <font size=-1>EMI</font>, much less bullish than the commission, noted that in 1996 only four countries' budget deficits were below the 3% limit.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the commissioner for monetary affairs, shrugs off such criticisms. The reason that so many countries' figures cluster conveniently close to the 3% ceiling, he says, is that governments have made heroic efforts to get them there. As for the one-off measures, controversial ones have to be approved by the independent European statistical office (run by a Frenchman). In any case, when it comes to its evaluation early in 1998, the commission will, he promises, look not just at actual figures for 1997 but also at forecasts for 1998 before opining on which countries have "durably converged" and should thus qualify for the currency.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the same, the process of choosing, in early 1998, which countries should join the new currency will be fraught. The Maastricht treaty provides that a European Council of heads of government must decide, country by country. The council may be guided by the treaty criteria, by the commission's recommendations or even by the opinions of the European Parliament; but in the end each decision will be taken by qualified majority vote. With Britain, which may well opt out of the single currency, in the chair, the task of assembling the necessary majorities will be delicate. The whole exercise could degenerate into ugly political horse-trading, with a risk of court challenges to follow. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the uncertainties of all this, and in particular the risk (as they see it) that Italy and Spain might be let in, it is not surprising that the Germans are insisting so fiercely on a "stability pact" that would, they hope, prevent participants in the single currency from borrowing excessively. They want the pact to provide for sanctions, including fines of up to 0.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, to be applied automatically; and they want "exceptional circumstances" that could justify a temporary deficit of more than 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> to be tightly defined in advance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission and most other member states, though they accept the principle of a stability pact, want it to be less rigorous. This argument looks unlikely to be resolved before next month's European Council meeting in Dublin, and maybe not even then. It has been complicated by a row in Britain over parliamentary scrutiny of pact documents--even though the pact will apply only to members of the new currency, and the council has agreed that countries not in the single currency do not have to rejoin a revamped <font size=-1>ERM</font>.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But other ghosts loom. Many people in many <font size=-1>EU</font> countries are still queasy about the whole project. A recent opinion poll in Germany found only 21% favouring a single currency as soon as 1999. The French are a bit keener than the Germans, but worries linger and the franc is under pessure again. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Watch that franc</b></b><br>
Recently Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing, a former president, called for a weaker franc to help fight unemployment. In fact, the franc is probably not overvalued. Over the past eight years, French unit labour costs have risen more slowly than those in the rest of Europe. French unemployment, as elsewhere in Europe, owes more to excessive labour-market regulation than to a strong franc. More arguable are fears that the euro itself could become overvalued against the dollar, especially if central banks around the world switch some of their reserves out of dollars and into euros.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet, as Mr de Silguy observes, the strength of the euro will depend largely on financial markets, not government intervention. Indeed, there may yet be concerns about the confidence of the markets in the single currency--and in the untried European central bank. This week the European Parliament endorsed the choice of Wim Duisenberg, who has won a good name as boss of the Dutch central bank, as the new bank's prospective head. But even he may find it hard to cope with the long transition from 1999 to 2002, when the euro will exist alongside national currencies--giving the markets plenty of time to test the commitment of governments, especially Germany's, to the single currency.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a speech in Dublin this week, Jacques Santer, the commission's president, declared that the single currency was now an irreversible project and that the euro would definitely begin on January 1st 1999. He denounced scares about the euro--such as claims that some countries in the single currency might be forced to pay for others' unfunded pension liabilities--as so many "ghosts" that should not be believed in.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The betting is getting stronger that the euro will be born on time, little more than two years from now. But, despite Italy's <font size=-1>ERM</font> move this week, it is still questionable whether the new currency will manage to embrace the lira or the peseta in the first round. And enough genuine spectres still lurk that might spoil the currency feast.<br>

<h1>Fissiparous fortunes and  family feuds</h1>

<font size=1>HONG KONG</font><p>
<p><b>As Asia's business empires have grown and diversified, many have begun to  hit the limits of the founding family's ability to manage. But for the moment,  family squabbles are just as likely to split them as business logic</b></p><br>
FAMILIES are the bedrock of Asian business. Paternalistic firms have carefully cultivated their personal connections, darted into every business opportunity and amassed some of the world's largest fortunes by assembling some of the world's most convoluted conglomerates. But as competition increases, the pressures for change are growing. From South Korea to Indonesia, Asian families are now thinking about restructuring their empires. Some have already begun.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A spate of listings on Hong Kong's roaring stockmarket has shown that some of the region's businessmen are now willing to split up their conglomerates. In October New World Development, a listed property, hotels and telecoms giant controlled by the Cheng family, floated off a separate company called New World Infrastructure. Its shares have soared and the Chengs are now considering listings for a construction firm and also for their property business in China.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Are the Chengs simply cashing in on a bull market? No, says Henry Cheng, the group's managing director. The intention is to give subsidiaries managerial and financial independence, allowing New World Development to concentrate on what he describes as its "core activity", investing in the Hong Kong property market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other Hong Kong tycoons are thinking in this way. On November 29th Citybus, one of the more profitable bus companies in the colony, will be spun off from <font size=-1>CNT</font>, a listed firm controlled by the Tsui family, who aim to concentrate more on expanding their large but loss-making paint business. In December, the family owners of Tem Fat Hing Fung, a big listed jewellery maker and property developer, will obtain a separate listing for their gold-bullion business. They believe that splitting the company will make it simpler for investors to understand (see <a href="wb8480.html">page</a>).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Interest in restructuring and reducing the portfolio of family businesses has spread to Taiwan, too, according to Chu Tian-cho of the Hong Kong office of McKinsey, a firm of management consultants. One reason companies hesitate, says Mr Chu, is that they dread making workers redundant. In a family-run firm, both workers and owners tend to assume that jobs are guaranteed for life. Families hate being seen to abandon that guarantee. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even South Korea's conglomerates, known as the <i>chaebol</i>, have begun spinning off subsidiaries. On November 20th Hyundai listed its electronics division, one of the world's biggest producers of memory chips. It followed a similar listing by the electronics division of the <font size=-1>LG</font> group. The subsidiaries of many other South Korean firms are starting to lead lives increasingly independent of their parent companies-- and even of their founding families.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the moment, though, most Asian businessmen believe the conglomerate is well suited to the region. A big group, they reckon, has more clout with governments, which in Asia still dole out many lucrative business concessions. Diversification, they add, permits a firm to take risks (and gain rewards) it might not otherwise have been able to afford. Could Samsung, they ask, have gone into the car business if it had not already been one of South Korea's biggest groups? Or could Charoen Pokphand, an enormous company from Bangkok, have become one of China's biggest foreign investors if the family-run firm had not previously diversified from chicken feed into myriad activities ranging from pot noodles to motorcycles?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scepticism about the value of core businesses is particularly rife among the ethnic Chinese who migrated to East Asia from the mainland. They founded most of the region's largest conglomerates, and many still run the companies they created. These so-called "overseas Chinese" dominate the ranks of the region's billionaires. They control eight out of ten of Indonesia's top companies, for instance; a similar proportion of Thailand's leading firms; and numerous corporate giants in the Philippines. They are also the biggest investors in China. <br>
</p><p><b><b>Bamboo network</b></b><br>
In these businesses, the family is particularly strong. There may be a veneer of modern corporate governance, but contracts can be sealed by a handshake without a lawyer, accountant or consultant in sight. And even though parts of the family group may be listed on one or more of the region's stockmarkets, most of the really lucrative bits are still closely held. Assets are shuffled at will. Published sets of consolidated accounts are as rare as rickshaws. Harvard Business School gurus may preach that Asian conglomerates are doomed to become bit-players in the global marketplace unless they specialise in a core activity. Chinese patriarchs ignore them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The dominance of the family endures because, whatever the gurus say, the system works--up to a point. Even the most patriarchal overseas-Chinese firm is a "fast and extremely efficient opportunity-seeking machine," says Gordon Redding, a professor of management studies at the University of Hong Kong. The firms are not burdened with bureaucracy. They have fast and inexpensive access to market intelligence and investment cash through a "bamboo network" of relatives and business contacts. Yet the limits to the family conglomerate are the size and complexity of the business it can manage. Those limits are starting to matter more.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of Asia's business empires have begun to outgrow the ability of their founder to manage them, as they become ever more complicated to run. The need to delegate is urgent, but the patriarch is often unwilling or unable to do so; and even the largest family has only so many sons and cousins capable of managing, and only so many management slots they can usefully fill.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, it is because Chinese businesses find it so hard to separate management from ownership that they tend to avoid industries that require the complex integration of many different skills, such as car making or aerospace. These businesses require a great deal of delegation in order to encourage the talent needed to research and develop new products, organise large numbers of subcontractors and plan international marketing campaigns. There are simply too many important decisions for family members to take on their own. Although some South Korean, Malaysian and Indonesian groups have ventured into such industries (well protected by import barriers), Chinese entrepreneurs would rather stick to what Professor Redding calls "machine bureaucracies": businesses such as property, shipping, hotels, and telecoms which are easier to run.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even here, though, many of Asia's family-run conglomerates are building an internal lobby for change, as they acquire a cadre of professional, western-educated managers. More and more Asian managers, including the sons (and occasionally daughters) of the owners, have been to American business schools. South Korea's <i>chaebol</i> have recently been energetically recruiting business-school graduates, whatever their nationality. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in the end, the main threat to Asia's family-run conglomerates may be something much more old-fashioned: succession squabbles. Sometimes, the handover goes smoothly: Anthony Salim, the youngest son of 79-year-old Liem Sioe Liong, a Chinese migrant who built Indonesia's Salim group into one of the region's biggest conglomerates, is taking charge of that empire. And in Hong Kong, even 68-year-old Mr Li Ka-shing, the colony's best-known tycoon, is talking of retiring in 1988 and handing on his flagship company, Cheung Kong, to his eldest son, Victor.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet even Asia's supposedly strong "family values" cannot guarantee that a business will survive in the same family beyond the third generation. Some may not get even that far. In Taiwan, the family that controls the country's biggest company, Formosa Plastics, is embroiled in a vicious feud. It began a year ago when the firm's elderly founder, Wang Yung-ching, banished Winston, his eldest son and heir apparent, from the company for 12 months for allegedly having an extramarital affair. The thrice-married Wang <i>p&egrave;re</i> now seems intent on extending the ban, even if it tears the firm apart. Family feuds are not something management gurus know much about.<br>

<h1>Glittering prizes</h1>

<font size=1>HONG KONG</font><p>
ONE day in 1946 Chan Muk-tim, a merchant sailor, visited a gold mine while on shore leave in South Africa. Ignoring the order to extinguish cigarettes, Chan held his cigarette, cupped, worker's style, in his palm. It took so long to reach the bottom of the shaft that the cigarette had burnt down to his fingers. If people went to such lengths to mine such small amounts of gold, he thought, it must be a commodity worth having. Three years later, he started a gold business that is now one of Asia's biggest. That business, Tem Fat Hing Fung, has been the best-performing share on Hong Kong's roaring stockmarket this year, rising fourfold in price.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now run by Chan Muk-tim's two sons, the company has thrived in the confluence of two trends. People in Asia have developed a seemingly insatiable desire to possess ever more gold. At the same time, the world's central banks are keeping more of their reserves in interest-bearing bonds. As they have dumped their unwanted gold on the market, dealers such as Tem Fat Hing Fung (the name means Bountiful Increase) have been snapping them up. "Gold", says Tem Fat's chairman, Raymond Chan, "has gone from being a trading commodity to becoming a consumer product."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Chan's ambitions do not stop at metal. Like many Hong Kong companies, Tem Fat is involved in property. A state-owned Shanghai copper company asked Tem Fat to invest in its plant. Mr Chan refused, but offered $10m for its site, bang next to a smart hotel. The copper firm used the proceeds to build a new plant on Shanghai's outskirts, and Tem Fat developed 26,000 square metres (279,860 sq feet) of prime downtown property. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That deal may partly explain the prodigious rise in the company's share price this year. Tem Fat shares are selling for 22 times current earnings, compared with around seven times earnings at the start of the year. That is hardly explained by post-tax profits, which in the year to April were flat, at HK$106m ($13.7m). Instead, the shares have been variously seen as a hedge against inflation and a cheap bet on Shanghai's property market.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Chinese property connection has worried bankers who lend to gold-bullion dealers. That is one reason its gold-bullion operations are to be floated on the Hong Kong stockmarket on December 2nd.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet with a faith that has accompanied a dozen earlier bull markets in Hong Kong, Mr Chan sees only rosy times ahead. What with Christmas and Chinese New Year sales running briskly, gold stocks in Hong Kong are reckoned to be down to just two weeks' worth of demand. And Hong Kong's return to China next year will bring a stream of new customers. But what most excites Mr Chan is the prospect of access to millions of tons of scrap jewellery lying, unused and unsold, in China. "Imagine: 50 years' worth of supply, and they don't even have a refinery."<br>

<p><b>Intel and microchips</b></p>
<h1>Squeeze, gently</h1>

<p><b>Nobody needs reminding that Microsoft dominates its markets. But it is far  from unique in that. In the first of a series on other firms that dominate differ ent parts of the high-technology business, we look at Intel</b></p><br>
INTEL, the world's largest semiconductor company, and Microsoft, the world's largest software firm, each have an extraordinary grip on the market for personal computers. Microsoft's Windows accounts for some 90% of the market for operating-system software. Thanks to the Pentium chip and its siblings, Intel accounts for about the same share of <font size=-1>PC</font> microprocessors. The two firms' core products account for the single largest chunk of the cost of most <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Combined, they sell some $25 billion-worth of their wares a year, making nearly $6 billion profit in the process.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some people lump the two companies together, dubbing them the "Wintel monopoly" (see <a href="wb1.gif">table</a>). Yet, in one crucial respect, the firms are different. For most of this decade Microsoft has been under investigation by trustbusters in America and Europe. In 1994 it settled one complaint by America's Justice Department, only to find the agency weighing in again the following year to stop it from buying Intuit, a financial-software firm. Hardly a day goes by without new calls from competitors to stop the firm's march to global domination.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel, on the other hand, was briefly investigated by America's Federal Trade Commission in 1992 and given a clean bill of health the next year. The trustbusters still watch it, but show no sign of intervening. Its two main competitors, Advanced Micro Devices (<font size=-1>AMD</font>) and Cyrix, dropped some lawsuits against the firm (in the face of huge legal bills) nearly two years ago, and now seem content to live on scraps from the giant's table. "We've made our peace with Intel," says an <font size=-1>AMD</font> spokesman. Most of the "Wintel" grousing is aimed at Microsoft, which is feared and loathed by many in Silicon Valley. Intel, on the other hand, is more admired than despised.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why? Intel claims that it is careful to, for example, train salesmen not to tie the sale of one generation of chip to a promise of preferred treatment with the next. But such practices are only the most obvious form of monopolistic abuse.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more subtle concern arises when a firm with a dominant position in one market uses it to "leverage" its way into adjacent markets. Microsoft has expanded greatly from making operating systems into more general software, from its word processors and spreadsheets to entertainment and education programs. Its critics claim its success in such markets is largely due to the advantages in technology, marketing and financial clout that it gains from its dominance of operating-systems. Their constant griping is one reason why America's antitrust investigators continue to hover over the firm. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel, too, has spread its tentacles from its core market. Improving technology means that each new generation of chips includes many more transistors (the building blocks of digital electronics) than the previous one. To put them usefully to work, Intel has gradually folded the work of other chips into the processor. In its next-generation chips, it is building in 57 "multimedia extension" functions, which will let the processor take on other jobs, from video processing to the communications work of a modem. This will inevitably take some business away from firms that sell stand-alone chips that do the same thing.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the same time as Intel has been expanding the definition of a processor, it has also been reaching outside the chip. Three years ago it started selling its processor as part of an entire "motherboard", the guts of a <font size=-1>PC</font> (and something that <font size=-1>PC</font> makers used to produce themselves). Intel now leads the market in such boards, and even makes some complete <font size=-1>PC</font>s for other firms.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Just a chip shop</b></b><br>
So why, if Intel mimics some of Microsoft's tactics, is it not seen as such a threat to its rivals? One answer is simply that it has fewer rivals to make complaints. Software is a much easier business to enter than semiconductors. All it takes is a <font size=-1>PC</font> and a few programming skills. In contrast, making a microprocessor to rival Intel's can be a billion-dollar proposition; its competitors in this market number fewer than a dozen. Nevertheless, higher barriers to entry is normally a reason for worrying more about market dominance, not less.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So a better explanation of why competitors seem less concerned about Intel than about Microsoft boils down to ambition and motivation. Microsoft's ambitions are boundless: it has a finger in everything from office software to joysticks and keyboards, and from financial programs to games. Recently it has started a cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> news channel, a network of regional news and entertainment sites on the Internet, a virtual travel agency, and even an on-line magazine that will be printed out and distributed in coffee shops (the company, after all, is based near Seattle).<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel, on the other hand, is still content to stick to chips, and mostly to the relatively costly processors used in <font size=-1>PC</font>s rather than the cheaper components used in video-players or other consumer-electronics devices. One reason for this caution, reckons Alex Balkansky, head of C-Cube, another semiconductor firm, is that Intel has stumbled badly before, whereas Microsoft has not. Intel started out making commodity memory chips, but was driven out of the market in the 1980s by Japanese competitors. By 1986, it was losing money. Since then, it has concentrated on top-of-the-range processors, where margins are fatter. Such other chips as it makes are used more to find work for its older manufacturing plants than to find new markets.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second difference is that Intel has largely chosen to grow not by fighting its rivals for a bigger chunk of the <font size=-1>PC</font> pie, but by expanding the pie itself. It reckons that anything it can do to help the industry sell more <font size=-1>PC</font>s will be of greater benefit to it than conquering that last sliver of the microprocessor market it does not already control. And if rivals gain more than it does from the growth, then so be it. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft, in contrast, is frequently perceived as more domineering. In a recent interview in <i>Red Herring</i>, a technology magazine, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, a software firm locked in a bitter battle with Microsoft, claimed that its giant rival "would rather eliminate a 10% market share competitor than grow the market by 50%". <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first glance, Intel's foray into motherboards invites the same sort of complaints. In 1993, the firm was worried that <font size=-1>PC</font> makers were dragging their heels in adopting its new Pentium chips, which were by far its most profitable ones. So it started shipping them on cheap motherboards it designed to exploit every speed advantage the Pentium had over its competition. <font size=-1>PC</font> makers had little choice but to use them; if they waited to design their own boards, someone else would beat them to market with Intel's. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Initially, this infuriated <font size=-1>PC</font> makers. They feared that Intel was trying to steal the last bit part of their business that did not involve simply assembling other firms' parts. But most of those complaints have now died down, in part because Intel has scaled back production of motherboards between new generations of processors, returning more of that market to other firms. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Intel can afford such restraint because it makes so much money from its core processor business. While other parts get cheaper, Intel's processors are getting more expensive: from $50 for an average 286 chip in 1985 to $200 for today's much more powerful Pentium. Given that the price of memory chips--the other expensive part of a <font size=-1>PC</font>--has plummeted, Intel can now push up its processor prices again without raising the overall cost of a computer. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, reckons that the average price of Intel's processors will rise to $300 over the next two years: with 80m <font size=-1>PC</font>s expected to be sold a year by 1998, that extra $100 per chip could add $8 billion to the firm's sales. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may seem like unimaginable wealth, but it pales beside the potential riches of the media and services markets Microsoft has in its sights. Intel's decision to stick to its knitting keeps it out of trouble with regulators, but also limits its ambitions. Microsoft is willing to risk antitrust suits (and $1 billion in investments) in its quest for domination of more markets. But with that risk comes the chance for greater returns--one reason why the software firm's price-to-earnings ratio is almost twice Intel's. In the rapacious computer industry, "finite greed" (a term Microsoft's boss, Bill Gates, once used to explain a competitor's hesitation) has its price.<br>

<h1>Now, bondmania</h1>

<p><b>Fast-rising stockmarkets are eye-catching. But bond markets around the  world are also enjoying heady times. Too heady, perhaps</b></p><br>
WALL STREET'S rise has been mesmerising. It took the Dow Jones Industrial Average a mere 30 trading days to rise from 6,000 to more than 6,500, a mark it reached on November 25th. The market has risen by 8% since the presidential election. So it was only natural that investors should focus most of their attention on sky-high share prices. Other stockmarkets have been dragged to records by America's bullish lead. Seven European markets, as well as Hong Kong, touched new highs along with the Dow.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But another bull market is equally deserving of attention. With few exceptions (Britain a notable one), bond markets around the world are enjoying an astonishing boom (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). In their exuberance, investors are signalling that there is a strong consensus. Interest rates will stay the same or continue to fall almost everywhere, the markets are saying, and there is almost no risk that they will rise. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This euphoria is widespread. The yield on America's 30-year Treasury bond has fallen to around 6.4%, more than three-quarters of a percentage point lower than its level in July. Canada, still worried by fears of secession in Quebec and mired in economic gloom, has seen interest rates on ten-year bonds drop below their American equivalents, a phenomenon last witnessed nearly two decades ago. Spanish short-term bonds are at 6%, a record low. On November 21st post-communist Russia's first ever bond issue was wildly oversubscribed. Even Japanese bonds have managed a small rally, fooling those who doubted that investors would go for ten-year government bonds yielding less than 2.7%.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This global case of fixed-income fever rests on three main assumptions. Should any of them prove wrong, today's bond rally will become tomorrow's bear market. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>Steady growth, low inflation.</b> The markets are assuming that the world economy will continue on its current, even keel. The evidence: in many countries, long-term bonds now yield little more than short-term bonds, an indication that investors expect inflation to remain quiescent.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, points out that current bond prices will not be justified should growth in leading industrial countries pick up sharply next year. If that happens, interest rates in big markets, such as America and Japan, are more likely to rise than to fall, sending bond prices tumbling. That happened as recently as 1994, when a sharp rise in interest rates knocked $1 trillion off American bond values over a few months.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is a revival of growth likely? Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, thinks it is. Several industrialised countries, notably Britain, Germany and Sweden, are showing signs of new strength, while emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are likely to grow faster in 1997 than they have this year. True, the third-quarter <font size=-1>GDP</font> figures in America have just been revised downwards. All the same, that slowdown may not continue and consumer spending looks strong (see <a href="am3148.html">page</a>). If growth around the world proves stronger than bond markets expect, that would suck money away from bonds. <br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>EMU goes ahead.</b> Confidence that Europe's economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>) will start, as planned, on January 1st 1999 has contributed to the bond rally. Italy's re-entry on November 25th into the exchange-rate mechanism, something that is essential if it is to qualify for <font size=-1>EMU</font>, drove that country's short-term bond yield below Britain's. There has been a remarkable narrowing of the gap between bonds issued by Europe's traditionally more spendthrift countries, such as Spain and Italy, and those of famously prudent countries, notably Germany. A year ago, the spread between Italian bonds and German ones was greater than five percentage points. Now, the gap is less than two points.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The markets seem to be expecting a wave of economic conservatism. Qualifying for <font size=-1>EMU</font> will require Italy and Spain to slash spending and bring down inflation. So far, they seem willing to do it. Italy's inflation has fallen to a 27-year low of 3%, barely half the level of a year ago. In Spain, the inflation rate has dropped by one-third, to 3.5%, since April 1995. Budget deficits in both countries have fallen sharply.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such improvements lend weight to the idea that a combination of steady growth and fiscal tightening leave little scope for inflation in Europe. Indeed, a virtuous circle operates: falling interest rates slash debt-servicing costs for indebted governments, reducing budget deficits further.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet things could easily go wrong. Several countries may be massaging their budget numbers to meet the Maastricht criteria. If Germany insists that those criteria are observed strictly, then investors might lose confidence in budget projections that they are willing to endorse at the moment. Italy's 1997 budget purports to reduce the deficit by 63 trillion lire ($42 billion), for example, but 60% of this reduction is due to come from "new revenues" which include a partially refundable one-off tax. In a less bond-friendly climate, such legerdemain could go wrong. But if Italy were kept out, then the tensions over <font size=-1>EMU</font> membership would rise sharply.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For bondholders this is a minefield. If only France, Germany and a few other nations constitute the initial core of <font size=-1>EMU</font>, Spanish and Italian bonds will quickly lose their lustre. But if entry criteria are fudged to bring Italy (and Spain) aboard, the bonds of less deficit-ridden countries may well suffer from fears that Europe's single currency will begin life as a weakling.<br>
<font size=-1><li></font> <b>No more business cycles.</b> This is the least tangible, but perhaps most profound of the assumptions made by today's bond enthusiasts. Thanks in equal parts to America's prolonged expansion and to the quiescence of inflation, it has become accepted wisdom in some circles that rich countries have entered a near-permanent condition of low-inflationary growth. Central banks merely have to remain vigilant in order to maintain Nirvana.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Proclamations that the business cycle is dead fly in the face of economic history. It is true that there have been important structural changes in economies around the world, partly driven by the spread of information technology. But at best the economic effects of such changes are poorly understood. And the chances that the world economy could be disrupted by, say, governmental economic mismanagement or a rise in oil prices, have not diminished simply because businesses now manage their affairs with computers.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will bonds nosedive tomorrow? No one can know. But rarely has so much money come flooding into the bond markets so quickly. And rarely have investors been so ready to play down risks that their predecessors would have taken for granted. Amid America's bear market in the early 1980s, almost any piece of economic news was automatically deemed bad for bonds. Today, investors seem intent on finding only good news.<br>

<h1>Alger Hiss</h1>

WITHOUT Alger Hiss, would there have been a Joe McCarthy? It is a fair question. The investigation, trial and conviction of Alger Hiss--and surely there was never a better name for a spy--provoked Senator McCarthy's charge a month later that the American State Department was "infested" with communists. After all, where there was one commie rascal, there were bound to be more-- say, 205. That accusation launched the red scare that deadened American cultural life for a decade and turned the perfectly defensible goal of prosecuting communist spies into a national disgrace. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the process, anti-communism became seen as mean-spirited and tacky--a reputation that lingered until the Berlin wall fell. To a degree, it deserved this reputation. Cool intellectuals such as Mr Hiss drove rougher sorts like McCarthy to distraction, a distrust that later found memorable expression in George Wallace's contempt for "pointy-headed intellectuals". In effect, the trial of Mr Hiss drew the line between anti-communism and anti-anti-communism that became so strong a feature of American life.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This divide was, from the beginning, as much aesthetic as ideological. Take a look at Whittaker Chambers, who in 1948 told Congress that Mr Hiss had spied for the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Chambers had terrible teeth, bad suits and a paunch; radio listeners could almost hear the gravy stains on his tie. Lean and sauve, Mr Hiss carried himself like an aristocrat. He wasn't, at least not by birth. But through diligence and a capacity to impress the great and the good, he had led a gilded life. After a brilliant academic career, he became a clerk at the Supreme Court. At the State Department, he was an adviser at the Yalta conference that in 1945 divided Europe between the Soviet Union and the West, and organiser of the conferences that sculpted the United Nations.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Enter Richard Nixon</b></b><br>
Alger Hiss cut so impressive a figure that when he first testified to deny Chambers's charges, Congress gave him a standing ovation. Unfortunately for him, an ambitious new congressman, Richard Nixon, insisted that the claims be investigated. The tide turned. In 1950, Mr Hiss was convicted of perjury (under the statute of limitations he was not tried for spying). After 44 months in prison, he was freed to begin his lifelong effort at vindication.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this, he had many sympathisers; the Hiss trial became an ideological litmus test (liberals for him, conservatives against). Again, the judgment seemed partly aesthetic. Defenders of the British spy Kim Philby felt disbelief, until he took up residence in Moscow, that "one of us" could be "one of them". So it was with defenders of Mr Hiss. Add the fact that Nixon had a key role in the investigation: clearly, Alger Hiss must be innocent. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two men loathed each other, but their destinies were entwined. Mr Hiss's confrontation with Chambers was the first televised congressional hearing. This was the same forum later used to force Nixon out of the presidency--an office he admitted he never could have won without the Hiss investigation to launch his career. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Hiss used Nixon's downfall in 1974 to attempt his rehabilitation, with some success. The Massachusetts bar re-admitted him to practice in 1975. On the lecture circuit he offered himself as a modern Dreyfus, a French army officer wrongly convicted of treason. Then came the publication in 1978 of "Perjury", which concluded that Mr Hiss was guilty. The author, Allen Weinstein, was so clearly "one of us"--a liberal academic who had set out to prove that Mr Hiss was framed--that the 700-page book made a great impact. Mr Hiss lost the support of much of liberal America; his defenders are a dwindling band.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the evidence has never been quite conclusive enough to clinch the case in the public mind. The end of the cold war has not lessened the ambiguity of Alger Hiss. In 1992, General Dmitri Volkogonov, chairman of the Soviet archives, said he had found nothing to indicate that Mr Hiss had been a spy. But he later back-pedalled, noting that many files were destroyed after Stalin's death, that he had not searched very hard, and that he did not have access to military intelligence archives. The case for the prosecution was bolstered by the release this year of Russian cables intercepted by the National Security Agency that seemed to refer to Mr Hiss; scraps from Hungarian archives suggested that he was a spy well into the 1940s. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now that he is dead and communism has lost, the question of Mr Hiss's guilt or innocence is of less importance. What is still remembered is the stunning effect his trial had on America, bringing the cold war into the home. In an irony he would hate, Mr Hiss can take much of the credit for bringing Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon to prominence. And in an irony he might appreciate, the excesses in the pursuit of communist spies that his trial launched did much to make anti-communism anathema in the West. In this sense, at least, Alger Hiss surely served the interests of the Soviet Union.<br>

<html><head><title>A foreign policy for America</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width="78" height="39" alt="The Economist" border=0></p>

<h1 align=center>A foreign policy for America</h1>


ONCE upon a time, the world viewed from Washington seemed a simple place: there were good guys, and bad guys, and the rest. The good guys were America's friends, the bad guys were communists, and the rest were unimportant. Then, after the Berlin Wall came down, the world looked even simpler. Suddenly, there was only one superpower, which, freed of all constraints, was now able to set about creating a "new world order", swatting flies like Iraq as it did so. The illusion lasted only a moment, but it was replaced neither by a new, more complex view of the world nor by any sense of urgency about the need to find one. For the past four years, America has juggled a variety of different (and sometimes inconsistent) foreign policies, each reflecting a different (and sometimes inconsistent) view of the world. Fortunately, the price paid has not been great. But in his second term, Bill Clinton may not be so lucky.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortune has smiled on Mr Clinton partly because the world remains relatively quiet. The American troops now preparing for a stint in Bosnia or central Africa may question that. Yet relatively quiet it is, despite the ethnic squabbles that afflict the Balkans and many parts of Africa besides Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire. Some of these disputes, and others from Chechnya to Sri Lanka, are a consequence of the triumph of democracy. Where communists once sat on national aspirations, people now feel free to burst forth. Where tribes and nations long resented colonial borders or dominance by other groups, they can now assert their independence, invoking as they do so the tenets of self-determination.<b><br>
</p><p><b>Attend and co-operate</b></b><br>
These rows will not go away for a while. They will need to be managed, and managed better than Yugoslavia was during Mr Clinton's first 1,000 days. But the record of the past year in Bosnia shows that, when the administration gives its full attention to a foreign-policy question, and works with its allies, not against them, it can produce results.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That has been apparent from the outset with the most immediate set of issues arising out of communism's collapse: how to ease the transition to democracy and market economics in Eastern Europe and, most importantly, in Russia. Here the policy has been coherent: offer conditional financial help to governments anxious to reform their economies, and security help--at first through <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s Partnerships for Peace--to those who fear their neighbours; meanwhile, cajole and subsidise to control arms, especially nuclear arms. The administration has done this well. But note that luck, too, has played a part: Russia today might well look frightening had Boris Yeltsin not managed, against most expectations six months earlier, to win re-election last July.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's policy towards Asia has shown less coherence: the administration sees the region variously as trading opportunity, trading threat, security worry and human-rights abuser. At the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in the Philippines next week, Mr Clinton will, if he is wise, be publicly talking trade and privately reassuring nervous Asians that America will stay around in their region--so long as they are welcoming. Meanwhile, in Beijing this week, his outgoing secretary of state, Warren Christopher, has been trying to tell China that America wishes to engage it economically, without uncritically backing its bid to join the World Trade Organisation. The Chinese, however, well know that at the start of his term Mr Clinton wanted to link China's most-favoured-nation trade status to human rights. Though the link was eventually abandoned, they remain mistrustful, all the more so in the light of America's subsequent friendliness towards Taiwan: first the granting of a visa to its president, then the show of naval force in March during China's attempts to force Taiwan to toe the one-China line.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other problems inevitably absorb the energies of America's policymakers. The Middle East still soaks up a lot of diplomatic effort. Iran and international terror remain a worry. So does North Korea, Iraq and other states that may be acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Haiti and Cuba, thanks to proximity and electoral pressure, loom large in the view from Capitol Hill, if not from Foggy Bottom. Still, most of these places remain low on the list of Washington priorities until a crisis--a threat, a bomb, an invasion--puts them on the front pages. Then, panic past, they are allowed to slip away again.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b></b>This approach to foreign policy is unlikely to be adequate for long. The world is still in an unnatural post-cold-war condition. America remains the only superpower but, despite the boys in Bosnia and the battleships in the Taiwan Strait, suspicions remain that it is gun-shy. Soon the challenges will come not from Somali warlords but from full-fledged countries, growing in economic might and maybe military bravado.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is safe to assume, for instance, that Russia's external ambitions are not satisfied, merely temporarily suppressed. Other countries will surely try to secure the gamut of weapons Saddam Hussein had failed to acquire when he snatched Kuwait. In many places, Islam seems to offer the only ideology to challenge the new orthodoxies of liberal politics and economics. And it is far from clear whether an ever-richer China will be a benign or a belligerent actor on the world stage.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the new foreign-policy team in Washington--and it had better be a team, not a group of rivals--needs to keep Russia, proliferation, Islam and China constantly in mind. On none of these issues does it need a radical change of policy. On Russia, the elements are all in place, so long as <font size=-1>NATO</font> enlargement goes ahead sensitively but firmly. On proliferation, the problem is to keep up the pressure on would-be renegades and others tempted to help them. Islam requires coolness, not panic, a readiness to see that the religion in itself poses no threat and that different Islamists therefore need to be treated discriminatingly. And on China, perhaps the most difficult issue, America at last seems to have discovered the right mix of engagement and containment. But the Chinese should be left in no doubt that America will not tolerate aggression.<b><br>
</p><p><b>Invest in allies</b></b><br>
Rather than design new policies, America needs now to apply its existing ones consistently and in concert with others. Consistency is needed because oscillations suggest weakness (China) and undermine allies (Bosnia). Co-operation is needed because America cannot always act alone, even if it sometimes thinks it wants to, and it certainly does not want to pay alone. In fact, though allies can be awkward, it is very much in America's interests to put alliances in place to deal with difficulties when they crop up, as they will. That is why Mr Clinton is foolish to waste so much goodwill by pursuing a vendetta against the current <font size=-1>UN</font> secretary-general and by persisting with the Helms-Burton law on trade with Cuba.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where is America to find its allies? Where it can, of course, among democracies old and new, especially in Asia, where Chinese expansionism is already being felt. But the friendship likeliest to prove useful is the old one with Europe, often tested but always liable to be taken for granted. Four times this century--in two world wars, Korea and the Gulf--America has fought alongside Europeans. They know that undeterred aggression means war and, if they stop to think, that deterred aggression means peace: the big war they did not fight was the nuclear one with Russia. If the next 50 years are to be as relatively unbloody as the past 50, America will have to be just as resolute as it was with Soviet communism. And it will need every bit as much help from its friends.<br>

<h2>Going home</h2>
At least 500,000 <b>Rwandan refugees </b>in eastern Zaire went home after their camps were attacked by rebels. But former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu militiamen fled further into Zaire. Plans for outside military intervention were thrown into confusion when Rwanda said none was needed and America scaled back its commitment.<p>
At the <b>United Nations</b>, 14 Security Council members backed a second term as secretary-general for Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The United States vetoed him.<p>
President Frederick Chiluba of <b>Zambia</b> easily won re-election. A leading rival, ex-president Kenneth Kaunda, had been banned from standing. His party and some others boycotted the poll.<p>
<b>Israeli </b>television showed an amateur video of border police beating Palestinians. Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, called the beatings "unpardonable". Palestinians talked of "racism".<p>
<h2>Tough customers</h2>
Opposition members of Belarus's parliament threatened to impeach the country's president, <b>Alexander Lukashenka</b>, if he went ahead with a referendum that would lengthen his term and extend his powers. But both sides hinted that compromise was possible.<p>
Romania's president, Ion Iliescu, a former communist, lost his bid for a third term, marking the country's first peaceful democratic shift of power. The new president will be <b>Emil Constantinescu</b>, a centrist academic.<p>
Six ministers from the junior partner in <b>Estonia's</b> governing coalition quit to protest a co-operation agreement signed by the prime minister, Tiit Vaehi, and the leading opposition party.<p>
An alliance opposed to Serbia's government won the mayorality of the country's capital, <b>Belgrade</b>. It accused the government of suppressing the results of elections in other municipalities.<p>
In <b>Moldova</b>, the incumbent, Mircea Snegur, took the lead in the first round of voting for president. But he faces a tough fight in the second round against Petru Lucinschi, the speaker of parliament.<p>
At least 68 people were killed by an <b>explosion</b> in a block of flats in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan. Most were border guards and their families, prompting speculation that local gangs might have taken revenge for a crackdown on arms-and caviar-smuggling.<p>
A parliamentary commission recommended that Belgium's highest court investigate allegations that a deputy prime minister, Elio di Rupo, has engaged in <b>paedophile activities</b>. Mr di Rupo denies the allegations.<p>
Italy's public-works minister, <b>Antonio Di Pietro</b>, the driving force behind the "clean hands" anti-corruption campaign, resigned. He complained of being victimised after becoming a target of investigation himself.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Italy and Greece approved measures designed to help them qualify for Europe's <b>single currency</b>. Italy's parliament passed a tight budget and the government spelled out details of a "tax for Europe". Greece's cabinet approved a series of new taxes, including levies on banks and state securities.<p>
An unmanned Russian space vehicle, intended to reach <b>Mars</b>, fell into the South Pacific after a booster rocket failed to carry it clear of its Earth orbit. The rocket was carrying scientific equipment for 20 other countries. <p>
A fire in the <b>Channel tunnel</b> between Britain and France sent eight people to hospital and disrupted service.<p>
<h2>Old blood</h2>
Thailand's general election produced a <b>new prime minister</b>,<b> </b>Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, a former general, but the coalition government he is putting together looks a lot like the failed previous one.<p>
The <font size=-1>IMF</font> cancelled a $20m loan to Cambodia because of the country's failure to control <b>loggers </b>who are destroying forests.<p>
A fire in an office block in <b>Hong Kong</b> killed about 40 people and injured about 80.<p>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees suspended most of the agency's activities in <b>Kabul </b>because four of its staff had been arrested by the Taliban, which captured the Afghan capital in September.<p>
<h2>Close encounters</h2>
Two <b>unlikely visits </b>were announced for 1997. The pope met Fidel Castro in Rome and is to visit Cuba. Bill Clinton is to go to Brazil, his first presidential visit to Latin America.<p>
In <b>Mexico's </b>Congress, the <font size=-1>PRI</font>, President Ernesto Zedillo's party, rammed through legislation on electoral reform--shorn of key points that had been accepted in all-party talks inspired by Mr Zedillo. <p>
In <b>Colombia</b>, despite pressure from President Ernesto Samper, congressional committees yet again dawdled over legislation rendering drug-traffickers' profits liable to forfeiture.<p>
A former <font size=-1>CIA</font> station chief, Harold Nicholson, was charged with selling <b>secrets</b> <b>to Russia</b> for the past two years. He is the highest-ranking <font size=-1>CIA </font> officer to be charged with spying. His lawyer says he will plead not guilty.<p>
<b>John Huang</b>, the Democratic Party fund-raiser at the heart of the controversy over solicitation of foreign funds, lost his job at the Democratic National Committee. A spokesman said he was simply one of 105 people who were laid off after the election.<p>

<h2>Well-connected</h2>
(See <a href="bw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Shares in <b>Deutsche Telekom</b> were floated in the second-largest initial public offering ever. The price of the shares, which attracted 2m German investors, leapt from DM28.5 ($19) to over DM33 in the first few hours of hectic trading. Germany's government confirmed plans to sell its 35.7% stake in<b> </b>the national airline, <b>Lufthansa</b>, worth nearly DM3 billion.<p>
American banking regulations were eased further, increasing the <b>powers of commercial banks </b>to expand into selling insurance and underwriting securities.<p>
<b>Unocal</b> agreed to sell its petroleum-refining and marketing business to Tosco, another American oil firm, in a deal worth around $2 billion. Unocal will use the proceeds to pay debts and expand exploration and production, particularly in Asia.<p>
Yasuo Hamanaka, the trader who lost $2.6 billion for Japan's<b> Sumitomo Corporation</b> through unauthorised copper dealing, claimed through his lawyer that his former boss had been involved in dodgy trading. Sumitomo posted a net loss of &#165;212.1 billion ($2 billion) for the half-year to September.<p>
The French government fired the head of<b> Groupe des Assurances Nationales </b>(<font size=-1>GAN</font>), a big state-controlled insurance group. The sacking of Jean-Jacques Bonnaud came less than a week after the privatisation of <font size=-1>GAN</font>'s banking subsidiary, <font size=-1>CIC</font>, had been halted after meeting resistance from within. Mr Bonnaud refused to go.<p>
<b>Russia</b> made ready for its long-planned debut Eurobond issue. It also confirmed plans to merge two state-run telecoms firms, Rostelecom and Svyazinvest, possibly in preparation for privatisation.<p>
As the Bank for International Settlements warned that the introduction of electronic money could shave billions of dollars off central banks' note-and-coin-issuing revenues, MasterCard, a payment-card group, said it had agreed to take control of<b> Mondex</b>, an electronic-cash firm.<p>
<h2>Pipes and drums</h2>
A group of ten international oil companies and the governments of Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman settled their remaining differences over the construction of a $1.5 billion <b>pipeline</b> that will help western oil ventures in Kazakhstan to export their crude. An agreement should be signed early next month.<p>
Russia's largest company is to shake itself up.<b> Gazprom</b> said it will sell peripheral activities (eg, farms) to focus on gas, moving further into distribution and appointing a new finance director.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
America's Pentagon picked Lockheed Martin and Boeing to design and build prototypes for the <b>Joint Strike Fighter</b>, the biggest-ever military-aircraft contract. The two will together get $2.2 billion and four years to produce the final design. The decision dealt a blow to McDonnell Douglas, which had teamed up with British Aerospace and Northrop Grumman.<p>
Despite its good news,<b> Lockheed Martin</b> said it will close eight American plants and lay off 1,600 workers. The move was prompted by a reduction in American defence spending and Lockheed's recent purchase of Loral, a defence-electronics firm.<p>
The committee overseeing the investigation into<b> </b>Swiss banks' holdings of <b>assets deposited by holocaust victims</b> picked three accountancy firms--Arthur Andersen, <font size=-1>KPMG</font> and Price Waterhouse--to conduct the search. Swiss bankers and politicians said they might create a fund for victims of Nazism.<p>
American Airlines was poised to announce an order for several hundred<b> Boeing</b> jets worth around $6 billion. Boeing confirmed an order for ten 777 aircraft from Air France.<p>
The World Trade Organisation agreed to the European Union's request to set up a panel that will decide whether America's<b> Helms-Burton law</b> (which penalises foreign firms that invest in Cuba) violates trade rules.<p>
Sources within Sony said that the Japanese group's president, Nobuyuki Idei, plans to float its troubled American film studio, <b>Sony Pictures</b>, which owns Columbia and TriStar Pictures.<p>
<h2>Black gold</h2>
Oil giant Texaco ended a 2.5-year-long <b>racial discrimination case </b>by agreeing to pay $175m to 1,400 black employees, some of whom had complained of being passed over for promotion and pay rises. The company still faces a federal investigation. A Texaco official was charged with obstruction of justice.<p>
Chiroscience, one of Britain's largest <b>biotechnology</b> firms, announced a $200m takeover of Darwin Molecular, a Seattle-based firm of which Bill Gates owned 14%. <p>
Thousands of savers flocked to withdraw their money from <b>Bulgaria</b>'s State Savings Bank after it emerged that the bank had been using deposits to finance the government's hefty debts.<p>
Japan's ministry of finance shut down <b>Hanwa Bank</b>, a small regional bank--the first government-ordered bank closure in post-war Japan.<p>
There were smiling faces at <b>Euro Disney</b>. The Paris-based theme-park operator made net profits of FFr202m ($40m) in the year to September 30th. Reduced entry prices helped produce a 9% rise in visitors, to 11.7m.<p>

<h1>Good intentions</h1>

<p><b>Bill Clinton has another four years to set the world to rights--if only he can keep his concentration</b></p><br>
"IN AN increasingly interdependent world Americans have a growing stake in how other countries govern, or misgovern, themselves. The larger and more close-knit the community of nations that choose democratic forms of government, the safer and more prosperous Americans will be, since democracies are demonstrably more likely to maintain their international commitments, less likely to engage in terrorism or wreak environmental damage, and less likely to make war on each other." <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those fine, even provocative, words come from Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state (and President Clinton's chief adviser on Russia), in the latest issue of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>. But will they define a "Clinton doctrine" by which the rest of the world will temper its behaviour over the next few years? Or will they be soon forgotten, as a second-term presidency continues the ad hoc habits ("photo-op foreign policy" and "foreign policy as social work" are among the biting, if facile, criticisms) of the past four years?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The questions matter because America is so obviously the world's leader--its biggest economy, its most powerful warrior and, thanks to the demise of the Soviet Union (President Reagan's "evil empire")--its only remaining superpower. Whatever the crisis, America, it seems, must play the decisive role. In the past year it has brokered a sort of peace in the Balkans; kept Arabs talking with Israelis; and sent its navy to support Taiwan against the bluster of China (see <a href="sf1.gif">map</a>). Even France, whose Gaullist tradition presumes more than a <i>soup</i><i>&ccedil;on</i> of anti-Americanism, acknowledges if not America's leadership at least the need for its help: this month's offer of French troops for Zaire was contingent on the presence of Americans, too. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difficulty is to be sure of the answer. Just as foreigners are ambivalent about America, often relying on its power while also resenting it, so is America about the rest of the world.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, historically, America's attitude has always been one of deliberate distance. It should, said Thomas Jefferson, seek honest friendship with all nations, but "entangling alliances with none". Hence, before the second world war, America's every entrance on the the global stage was followed, sooner or later, by its withdrawal. For all the 1960s' talk of American imperialism, fostered by covert action round the world and overt war in Vietnam, the truth is that America has had no territorial ambitions since the end of the 19th century. Only Latin America, "Uncle Sam's backyard", has real cause to see the United States as a menacing quasi-imperialist, meddling either to protect its trade or to repel the alleged threat of communism.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Seen against that background America's role in Bosnia conforms to a pattern begun in the French Revolution and continued in the first and second world wars: Europe in a crisis looks to the United States for help--and has to wait. The difference is that the pattern is now interwoven with so many others. Count the value of America's proliferating foreign investment, or the ethnic links of its citizens to other countries, or its obligations under various international treaties: the truth, <i>pace </i>Jefferson, is that America's isolationist instincts must henceforth be limited; for better or worse, the country is permanently entangled. In which case, can non-Americans hope for the better from a second-term Bill Clinton?<br>
</p><p><b><b>Backyard blues</b></b><br>
Start with America's backyard. For decades its complaint was that the United States interfered too much in affairs south of the border (witness the downfall of Salvador Allende in Chile or Manuel Noriega in Panama). Now the grouse is the opposite: not only do Latin Americans feel misunderstood, they also feel ignored.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They have a point. Two years ago in Miami, Mr Clinton, still reasonably fresh from winning approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (<font size=-1>NAFTA</font>), played host to the first "hemispheric" summit with all the region's leaders bar Cuba's Fidel Castro (a perennial pariah). They set the goal of a hemispheric free trade agreement by 2005; and Mr Clinton agreed to support a broader <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>, together with the spread of similar accords to the Caribbean and Central America. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So much for good intentions. The first disappointment stemmed from the Mexican currency crash of 1994. Though Mr Clinton braved domestic opposition to put together a financial rescue package, he was unable to win approval from a protectionist-inclined Congress for more trade deals.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second setback was the hijacking of the administration's Latin American policy (such as it was) by Mr Clinton's need to get re-elected. He approved the Helms-Burton law, which imposes sanctions against foreign companies "trafficking" (ie, investing) in Cuban assets seized by Castro from American citizens, in order to win votes in Florida, and sought to neutralise criticism that he was "soft" on drugs by hounding Colombia's President Ernesto Samper, who was alleged to have received election money from the Cali cocaine cartel. Mr Samper's American visa was cancelled and the administration refused the certification, necessary to qualify for American aid, that Colombia was co-operating in the war against narcotics. How sad for Colombia. All America's vendetta has really achieved is to destabilise Colombia's central authority to the benefit of narcotics-linked guerrillas.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, putting their complaints aside, what do the Latin Americans really want from Uncle Sam? The less-than-simple answer is some positive understanding: let America adopt a policy of "constructive engagement" towards Cuba, encouraging the foreign investment that would ensure economic liberalisation, and with it political reform. Similarly, in terms of the drugs war, let America recognise that the problem is a shared one, with the consumers as guilty as the suppliers. Most of all, let Mr Clinton seek "fast track" approval from Congress to extend <font size=-1>NAFTA</font><t--mode> </t--mode>to Chile and to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas for 34 countries in the hemisphere. Not everyone in the region wants such a deal; but "fast track" would signal America's involvement, and help stop the inclination of Mercosur, the trade-group led by Brazil, to go down a protectionist route.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the Latin wish-list will come true. But the optimists are few. After all, in his first term of office Mr Clinton travelled the globe--and never once set foot in Latin America (belatedly, a visit to the region is now scheduled for next year).<br>
</p><p><b><b>Misleading Asia</b></b><br>
To neglect Asia, with three-fifths of the world's people and several of its potential nuclear flashpoints (think of North and South Korea, India and Pakistan, China and India or Russia and China), would clearly be a mistake of a much greater order. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Couple security concerns with America's trading relationships with both Japan and China, and it is hardly surprising that Mr Clinton began his presidency by emphasising Asia with a fervour that alarmed America's hitherto complacent allies in Europe. The Seattle meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (<font size=-1>APEC</font>) in November 1993 was upgraded, at Mr Clinton's prompting, into a summit of heads of state; and the following May China was informed that its most-favoured-nation trade status would no longer be held hostage to its human-rights record. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But where, Asia wonders, was the follow-up? America's secretary of state, Warren Christopher, quickly became obsessed with the Middle East (critics note his visit to Beijing this week was his first for two years), and the crucial relationships with Japan and China were soon soured by trade rows, with America aggressively insisting on greater market access. The low point came in November last year, when Mr Clinton cancelled his trip to the <font size=-1>APEC</font> summit in Osaka. Admittedly Mr Clinton had a good excuse--a budget crisis had shut down his government--but Asia's leaders were beginning to ask how much they could rely on an apparently inconsistent America.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton, of course, says their reliance can be absolute. This week, while visiting Australia, he used his first big foreign-policy speech since the election to promise the continued presence of American troops in the region. Moreover, he had reassuring words for China: "The United States has no interest in containing China. That is a negative strategy. What the United States wants is to sustain an engagement with China . . . in a way that will increase the chances that there will be more liberty and more prosperity."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Clinton's latest message to China only serves to highlight the problems of his Asia policy. Earlier this year, mixed messages from America about wanting to engage, not contain, China played their part in the China-Taiwan crisis. Miffed by Taiwan's determination to hold its first fully democratic presidential election, and led to believe, from all the talk of engagement, that America would turn a blind eye, China set out to intimidate Taiwan, even firing missiles close to its busy shipping lanes. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To its credit, America's response, orchestrated from the Pentagon, not the State Department, was swift: two aircraft-carrier battle groups sent to "observe" China's actions and to ensure that Taiwan came to no harm. Shortly thereafter, America and Japan agreed to reinforce their bilateral security treaty.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though neither America nor Japan says it publicly, one of the future "risks" facing East Asia is precisely that a more muscular China will continue to refuse to play by the rules. Like it or not, America's role in constraining China will be crucial. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In which case, the administration might consider a change of tone. The Clinton team came to power saying America's economic interests would be at the centre of its foreign policy. The result was to advance the Commerce Department at the expense of the State Department--and to allow trade-dispute brinkmanship to endanger carefully balanced security relations. When he goes to Manila for next week's <font size=-1>APEC</font> summit, Mr Clinton will need to promise consistency as well as friendship if he is to reassure his Asian counterparts.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Old faithfuls</b></b><br>
Ironically, given Mr Clinton's initial preference for the transpacific rather than the transatlantic, Europe now needs little reassurance. In part this is a "better the devil you know" reaction; in part it is because most European governments reckon Mr Clinton has improved over time. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it is also because Europeans have had to recognise their own failings: the Dayton accords on Bosnia, for example, would not have happened without Mr Clinton's special envoy, the bullying Richard Holbrooke. It was the same Mr Holbrooke, bluntly accusing the Europeans of literally sleeping through the night at a time of crisis, who this summer defused a dispute over some rocks in the Aegean that threatened to propel Greece and Turkey-- <font size=-1>NATO</font> "allies"--into armed conflict. Whatever the European Union's ambitions for a common foreign and security policy, in the meantime it clearly benefits from having America on hand--and an America that supports the idea of European integration.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That idea means different things to different people, and affects the way they view America's support. France has always tended to think of an integrated Europe as a counterweight to America. Indeed, its government spokesman, Alain Lamassoure, greeted Mr Clinton's victory with the comment: "It makes progress toward European unity more necessary than ever, so as not to leave American power alone like some kind of gendarme or judge over the affairs of the world." Hence France's determination to secure a European role in the Middle East peace process, or in the reordering of Africa. Yet at the same time France is deeply nervous at the idea of an American withdrawal from the world. President Chirac was not simply flattering his audience when he told Congress in February: "Today, as yesterday, the world needs the United States."<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Germany has no such contradictory feelings: European integration and the transatlantic alliance are mutually reinforcing in Chancellor Kohl's mind. Indeed, he puts Germany's rapport with America almost on a par with the Franco-German alliance.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By contrast, feelings in Britain, obsessed by its internal debate over Europe, are confused: Eurosceptics, hankering hopelessly for the old "special relationship", see the <font size=-1>EU</font> as the enemy of transatlantic friendship-- to which the Europhiles reply by pointing out that Britain alone, without Europe, is no longer worthy of America's attention.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Designing the architecture</b></b><br>
In the end, be it in trade or security, America and Europe are mutually dependent, and the task is to ensure the relationship has as few irritations as possible. At the moment there are several: the Helms-Burton legislation; the squabble over Boutros Boutros-Ghali's tenure as <font size=-1>UN</font> secretary-general; differing views on how to deal with Iraq; the flagging momentum of the Middle East peace process; and so on.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The true challenge will be to manage two much bigger, and interconnected, issues: the expansion of <font size=-1>NATO</font> and the relationship of the West with Russia. In many ways America has handled <font size=-1>NATO</font> with diplomatic deftness, ensuring its survival after the end of the cold war had removed its original <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> and agreeing with the Europeans on the "combined joint task force" concept to allow Europe to use <font size=-1>NATO</font> assets without America's involvement. One litmus test for the future, however, certainly for France, will be America's willingness to cede <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s southern command, with its headquarters in Naples, to a European.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans have been similarly deft in ensuring approval for the notion that <font size=-1>NATO</font> must expand its membership both to promote Europe's security (not least by giving Germany a buffer between it and the old enemy, Russia) and to reward Central and Eastern Europeans for their rejection of communism. Putting notion into practice, however, will not be easy--and the European Union is not impressed by the idea that difficult cases such as the Baltic states (militarily indefensible) could find an alternative home in the <font size=-1>EU</font>. Why, mutter some southern Europeans, provoke Russia with ill-judged measures, be they for <font size=-1>NATO</font> or the <font size=-1>EU</font>?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One plausible answer is that Russia, at least for the time being an incapacitated country, no longer needs to be handled with kid gloves. Indeed, cynics say that all Russia really wants from America is large amounts of money with no strings attached. <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may be true, but America's agenda with a Russia that has nuclear arms and unstable borders can hardly be dismissed so lightly. The original agreement after the collapse of the Soviet Union was that all its nuclear warheads should be repatriated to Russia. So far Kazakhstan has obliged, as has Ukraine. By contrast, Belarus has not-- and its present political unrest could end with it rejoining Russia. That would not be a tragedy unless Russia used it as a precedent for recovering Ukraine, a country which if threatened should definitely receive America's support.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton's real priority in Russian policy, fortified by last year's extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the near-global agreement this year on the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, is to push on with arms control.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The American-funded programme for the dismantling and safe storage of Russia's nuclear weapons needs to be accelerated-- possibly by a president-to-president prod. So, too, the effort to eliminate Russia's chemical warfare stocks and its (illegal) biological weapons programme. To show good faith, however, America's Senate had first better approve the Chemical Weapons Convention. Meanwhile, to encourage the Russian Duma finally to ratify the <font size=-1>START II</font> agreement on reducing strategic weapons, perhaps America might dangle the carrot of a <font size=-1>START III</font>--one in which the Americans humour the Russians by scrapping good weapons while the Russians junk bad ones.<br>
</p><p><b><b>Towards engagement</b></b><br>
Assume all of the above happens, from Latin America to the Far East; assume, too, an American-inspired breakthrough in the Middle East; imagine, improbably, that America will allow its trade rows to be solved through the World Trade Organisation rather than by threats of unilateral retaliation. That will still, for some critics, not add up to a consistent and comprehensive foreign policy.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps they are right. But they should remember that America's foreign-affairs budget has halved in real terms since 1984, and is unlikely to increase with the penny-pinching and jingoistic Mr Helms back in his place as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Maybe that is why some Clintonites like to stress "transnational" issues, where America has a role because no other country will take the lead: not just arms control but also the environment; or terrorism; or international crime, from drugs to computer-fraud.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the most important quality America brings to the world scene is its sheer capacity to get things done. Americans might often wish to be respected for moral fervour in foreign policy; but recent history has shown that, as in Somalia, moral impulses are dangerous if not accompanied by a sense of pragmatic self-interest. Besides, a capacity to make things happen--to bang heads together, convene summits, apply pressure, provide a forum for enemies to shake hands--should not be underestimated. If America only engages, there is no limit to what it might get done. Engagement is all.<br>
