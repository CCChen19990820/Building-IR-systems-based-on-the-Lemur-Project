MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight's <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at an issue surrounding our
personal mortality: life, death, and euthanasia.  Do we want
an America in which doctors have the authority to kill
ailing patients?

<p>

Just yesterday, Dr. Jack Kevorkian was acquitted
for the third time of charges involving his role in yet
another death.  These acquittals, along with several liberal
court rulings, are sending a message loud and clear to the
nation's elderly, our disabled, terminally ill, and in fact,
our entire population.  The message:  be healthy or beware.
Who will decide which of us are too sick to take up so-called 
valuable resources, and should we give that authority 
to physicians?  Tonight we will discuss whether euthanasia 
serves the population compassionately or acts as a means of 
coldly eliminating expense and our own humanity.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Robert Knight, FRC's
Director of Cultural Studies.  Bob speaks about an issue 
heatedly discussed just this morning on the House floor, the 
homosexual activist Cherry Jubilee Celebration, a gay-sponsored 
party, that took place in taxpayer-supported federal buildings.

<p>

Yesterday, Steve Gunderson, the gay representative 
from Wisconsin, talked about this issue for an hour on the 
House floor.  Today, Bob Knight gives his insight, and he 
shares an FRC exclusive video about the homosexuals' use --
possibly misuse -- of federal buildings.  Trust me, you will 
not see this on local broadcasts or read about it in many
newspapers. So <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes you Behind the
Headlines.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You know, a lot of
people may have heard in the news about a party called
Cherry Jubilee.  It has been a bit controversial, and in
terms of Behind the Headlines, we would like to understand
what exactly does that mean?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, every spring, we have the 
cherry blossom festival, and the cherry trees bloom around 
the Tidal Basin, and they are beautiful, and increasingly in 
recent years homosexual activists have held various events 
around the city, and they call it the Cherry Jubilee.  This 
year they staged events in two federal buildings, and we got 
wind of this not through some great spy network; they 
advertised it in their publications.

<p>

So we thought, well, this is curious that federal 
buildings, one of them the Andrew W. Mellon Library, which 
is an old august building right on Constitution Avenue 
across from the Smithsonian, was going to be used for a big 
party, an all night long party, and then there would be a 
recovery brunch -- they call it recovery, I guess from the 
party the night before -- in the Rayburn House Office 
Building, which is the largest office building housing 
congressional offices.  We thought, is there something wrong 
with this picture? We'd better take a closer look.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think people would be very 
surprised that this kind of party would have taken place in 
a taxpayer supported federal office building.  How were the 
homosexual activists able to get access to these rooms?
They are kind of tough to book.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Now we have placed many calls to the 
Andrew Mellon Auditorium and the General Services 
Administration, and they will not return our calls.  I think 
they are starting to circle the wagons about this, because 
people are wondering how could they commandeer these 
premises for a party that really got out of control?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we were taking a look at some of 
the different homosexual literature talking about the Cherry 
Jubilee party, they said that it was a certain kind of 
party.  Could you help us understand what kind of a party 
Cherry Jubilee was?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, that is what caught our 
attention.  In a local publication, they said it would be 
like a circuit party, which is something you will see in New 
York and other major cities in which thousands of homosexual 
men gather and have an all-night party, and usually you will 
see drugs present at parties and sexual acts being 
committed, and just basically an orgy, to not think of a 
better word for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is rather amazing to imagine that 
there were parties in federal office buildings where sex 
acts were taking place.  You know, frankly in Washington, 
DC, that kind of thing has always been very controversial, 
you know, whether it is people jumping in the Tidal Pool or 
different things that people said they did in offices.
Every time it has come up, it has been very controversial.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, and other things.  I wonder if 
you could have a prayer meeting, you know, at the Rayburn 
House Office Building.  Maybe you could, maybe you cannot, 
but I know of at least one instance in which a group was 
denied use of a federal facility.  That was Anthony 
Falzarano's[?] Transformation ex-gay ministry.  He asked the 
Museum of Women in the Arts, a federal building, if he could 
have a conference there, because outside groups can rent 
rooms, and he was just flat-out refused, and he was never 
told why, and I have to suspect it is because of the nature 
of his group.  He helps people out of homosexuality, and 
that is not politically correct.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, Bob, my understanding is there 
is some video of this event.  How did that come about?
Where did that come from?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, we contacted a photographer who 
is famous for getting into events and taking footage, and he 
agreed to go into this event, and he stayed the whole 
evening, and he had a camera, and he went in with a 
companion, and they took shots of each other.  So they were 
just celebrants along with everyone else.  Then he swung the 
camera around and took footage of the dance floor and other 
areas, and some of the footage is so dark you cannot see it, 
but he provided a narration for us and told us, look, I will 
tell you what was really going on in the corners, things you 
do not really want to know about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What surprises you the most about
this kind of activity in a federal building?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I think the lack of oversight by 
Congress and by the Clinton administration as to what is 
going on in the federal buildings.  I mean, these are 
government buildings.  They are paid for with taxpayer 
money.  The stamp of approval of the U.S. government and 
thereby the American people comes about when you stage an 
event in one of these buildings.  The government is saying 
we think this is fine; this is okay.  But, in fact, it is 
not okay.  Our representative Bob Dornan said on the floor 
of the House that this is an outrage that federal buildings 
can be used for events like this, and I hope more comes out 
of this.  I hope they actually have an investigation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is very likely that there will be 
an investigation of this party and of who may have set it up 
and where the federal money may or may not have gone.  What 
is the most likely scenario for bringing this about?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I would think that would be at the 
core of the investigation, how it came about, because 
outside people like us are not getting any help out of the 
government in determining how this was able to happen.  So I 
think we need congressional help to do it, and I hope that 
is something that occurs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Bob, you were able to get some 
videotape of this particular activity.  How did you get that 
tape, and could you explain to us a little bit about what we 
will be seeing?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Okay, yes, I think seeing is believing, and a 
picture is worth 1,000 words.

<p>

[Cherry Jubilee segment follows.]

<p>

NARRATOR:  Washington, DC, the nation's capital.
Every year during April, thousands of tourists come here to 
see the cherry blossoms.  They also come to see Washington's
magnificent architecture and monuments to the nation's
leaders of government, industry, and the arts.

<p>

On the weekend of April 13 and 14, 1996, two 
federal buildings were sites of two celebrations of which 
few Americans were aware.  The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium 
is named after industrialist and art collector Andrew 
Mellon, who donated much of his fortune to help found the 
National Gallery of Art.  On the afternoon of Saturday, 
April 13, preparations were underway for what was advertised 
in homosexual publications as the Cherry Jubilee Main Event 
Party to be held in the Mellon Auditorium across the street 
from the Smithsonian Museum of American History.

<p>

That evening, the dignified auditorium, which was 
built in 1935 and has played host to presidential events, 
took on a different cast.  It was bathed in colored lights 
to create a rainbow flag, the symbol of the homosexual 
activist movement.  Inside, thousands of half-naked men 
danced and writhed on the main floor of the auditorium.  
Then event, sponsored by two AIDS activist organizations, as 
well as several local businesses, also had support from 
major corporations:  American Airlines, Snapple, American 
Express, Starbucks Coffee, and Miller Beer.  The party 
lasted from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

<p>

Throughout the evening, limousines dropped off 
many of the participants.  As the evening wore on, the 
dancing became more lewd and suggestive, with some dancers 
simulating sexual acts and others shedding clothing.

<p>

Just off the dance floor, at least one couple 
appeared to be having oral sex.  In the darker corners and 
in the restrooms, men met to have sex with one another.  
Restroom stalls were occupied almost continuously with two 
men at a time, and the sounds coming from them indicated 
that cocaine was being snorted and sex acts were occurring.  
Outside, in an alley next door, men disappeared into the 
darkness in pairs.  So many men were using the area, 
security people finally closed it off.  Public urination was 
common, even in front of the building facing Constitution 
Avenue.

<p>

The next day, Cherry Jubilee ended with the 
Capitol Hill Recovery Brunch at the Rayburn House Office 
Building.  Inside the foyer of this historic building which 
houses the offices of many congressmen, drinks were served 
at an open bar while a disk jockey played music.  Cameras 
were forbidden at the event, whose location was arranged by 
openly homosexual Republican congressman Steve Gunderson of 
Wisconsin.

<p>

According to a homosexual publication, the weekend 
events raised $50,000 for two Washington-based AIDS groups:  
Food and Friends and the Whitman-Walker Clinic.  Whitman-Walker 
Clinic, which treats people with AIDS, also hosts 
meetings for gay political activists and promotes such 
causes as lesbian parenting.

<p>

The clinic, which is supposed to discourage 
unhealthy activities such as occurred during the Cherry 
Jubilee party in and around the Mellon Auditorium, 
advertises routinely in the Washington Blade's Lights Out 
section, a supplement that features ads for strip clubs, 
bathhouses, phone sex, prostitution, and orgies, in short, 
the type of unsafe sex that has led to the tragic epidemic 
of AIDS among homosexual men.

<p>

The Cherry Jubilee was not the first time that the 
Andrew Mellon Auditorium has been used for a homosexual 
activist event.  In 1993, during the homosexual march on 
Washington, the auditorium hosted the National S&M Leather 
Fetish Conference.  The event celebrated sadomasochistic sex 
and featured virtually naked men being led around in dog 
collars by their dominant partners.  Pornography and sexual 
paraphernalia was sold, including several publications that 
promote pedophilia, the sexual use of children by adults.
Inside the auditorium, a slide show depicted graphic sexual 
acts.

<p>

SPEAKER: Sadism and masochism. S&M is an 
absolutely wonderful part of, well, sexual life. This
building has the S&M leather fetish contingent for the march 
on Washington.  The S&M Leather coalition of organizations 
from around the country picked up some money, and it is a 
government building.  The Federal Government provided this 
building with just a few applications and permits and some 
money.

<p>

NARRATOR: Americans who have become aware of 
these events have these questions:  how could taxpayer 
supported federal buildings be commandeered by homosexual 
activists for their activities, why did the activists choose 
the federal buildings when they could have rented any number 
of other places to hold these events, and why have political 
leaders done nothing when apprised ahead of time of the 
Cherry Jubilee events in the Rayburn House Office Building 
and the Mellon Auditorium?

<p>

It is time that people knew how their federal
buildings are being used for celebrations of homosexuality,
dangerous sexual activities, and the taking of illicit
drugs.  It is also time to ask why corporations are lending
their good names to this radical agenda and why America's
political leaders are standing by doing nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, if people would like to get a
copy of this video and of some of the materials that go with 
it, how could they do that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, they can call our 800 number --
that is 800-225-4008 -- and obtain a copy of the video.  We 
are asking a $7.50 donation just to cover the costs, and 
that is not much for a video, let's face it.  But we did 
incur some expenses in making it, but we are more interested 
in getting it out there so people can see how far the 
homosexual agenda has gone in this city, that they can 
countenance basically an orgy on federal premises and most 
people do not bat an eye.

<p>

It is that bad, folks, and I think this video 
would be a great tool to convince friends who are wavering 
on the issue and think, oh, it is not that big a deal.
Don't worry about it. It's just a matter of tolerance.
Well, if it were just a matter of tolerance, it would be
simple, but it is not.  We are talking about people who are
trying to commandeer governmental power, governmental
buildings, and basically force the homosexual agenda on the
rest of us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being with us on 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, thanks for having me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break,
<i>Straight Talk</i> speaks to those fighting against the
legalization of euthanasia.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape segment follows.]

<p>

NARRATOR: A new pro-life movement is quickly
emerging across the nation. These cries for life not only 
echo for unborn children who cannot speak for themselves but 
also for the elderly in response to a chilling trend that 
currently is sweeping courtrooms nationwide, the litigation 
of the so-called right to die.  Physician-assisted suicide 
has become the politically correct term for euthanasia, 
which on March 6, 1996, a federal court of appeals ruled a 
constitutional right.

<p>

At present, the very essence of human life and 
existence appears to be at odds with a growing belief that a 
doctor can help a patient die in the name of humanity.  In 
ancient Greece and Rome, patients never knew if their 
doctors would heal them or kill them.  From those troubling 
times emerged the Hippocratic oath in which doctors pledged 
to do no harm.  Are we on a slippery slope to the same fate 
ancient Greeks and Romans faced?

<p>

DR. KEVORKIAN:  The first thing you do is check
the morality of a law, and if it is immoral, you disobey it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do that.  You pass any law against
assisted suicide and euthanasia and I will disobey it, I
state it openly, because it is immoral medically.

<p>

NARRATOR:  Soon, the right to die could become the 
duty to die.  Patients with high cost health care or lack of 
family support could feel pressured to end their lives 
prematurely out of fear and loneliness.  Masked in the name 
of humanity is a threat too great to be ignored, doctors and 
health care providers literally snuffing out innocent lives 
in the hour of their greatest need for compassion and 
healing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To help explain what euthanasia 
advocates mean when they talk about compassion, I am joined 
by Dr. David Stevens, Executive Director of the Christian 
Medical and Dental Society, who recently testified before 
the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee in opposition to 
euthanasia.  Also joining me is David Morrison, a researcher 
and writer for the Human Life International, which has 
researched euthanasia internationally, and its impact on our 
nation today, and Gracie Hsu, an FRC policy analyst whose 
work deals with the impact of so-called mercy killings.

<p>

Welcome.  It is good to talk to such an esteemed 
group of people.

<p>

Doctor, as our only official doctor here, I guess 
the thing that I would like to ask is, judging from your 
experience in the medical profession in school and the 
reading of the journals and certainly in your professional 
acquaintances, how comfortable are you with your colleagues 
and peers making life and death decisions for other people?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think most doctors are very 
uncomfortable with it.  I think that is why the AMA has come 
out so powerfully against this, which some people doubted 
they would.  This is not about the right to die.  This is 
about the right for doctors to kill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  And that is taking medicine into a 
whole level than it has ever been before.  It is giving an 
enormous amount of power to doctors to literally decide 
whether people should die or live.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gracie, you have a degree, a 
master's in public health, and did some extensive studies at 
Johns Hopkins.  Where do you see this trend going in terms 
of empowering physicians, not to save life but to kill when 
it is cost-effective?

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, as we all know, two years ago, 
when Clinton came out with his health care reform plan, one 
of the biggest things that we talked about was the rationing 
of health care resources.  There is only so much money to go 
around, and so where is it best suited, and obviously people 
in the latter stages of life who have terminal illnesses use 
a lot more of those health care dollars than anyone else 
does.  But is that to say, then, that they are somehow less 
suitable to receive those monies simply because they would 
die anyway, and I think really that is the crux of this.

<p>

Doctors are so pressured now, because of HMOs and 
because of other constraints with money, to cut their health
care spending, and this is one way that I see the movement
going, and I think that is the most troubling, especially
for doctors, because it is not necessarily their own
decisions any more, but it is the AMA's or it is the HMO
that they work for or some other type of cost containment
kind of structure that is bearing down on them.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think the key thing is this is
dangerous.  It is dangerous for people.  It is dangerous for 
you.  It is dangerous for me.  It is dangerous for my 
mother.  The way this law is being formatted and what they 
are trying to do is that this will be a personal choice 
between the doctor and their patient.  Can you imagine going 
to the hospital to visit your mother who is very ill, and 
you get there and she is not there, and you ask what 
happened?  Well, my doctor, the doctor that has been taking 
care of her, helped her kill herself last night.  She 
thought that she was too much a burden on the family.  She 
thought that the inheritance was being eaten up. She
thought that you were tired of coming to see her, because
you had not come as often. Can you imagine the guilt that 
that is going to bring on people?

<p>

Then, we need to understand something.  All of us 
escaped the abortion issue.  We are here.  We are not going 
to escape this issue.  This issue is going to face every one 
of us personally.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  David, you have been writing about 
that.  I mean, in some ways euthanasia and the discussion on 
physician-assisted suicide is, in your writings, you are 
seeing it as an extension of the abortion issue.  How do you 
see that being connected?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  In the fact that both the recent 
9th Circuit decision and the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision had as 
part of their foundation the notion that people can define 
their own reality, that people can define their own notion 
of what is objectively right and wrong, that human life is 
not kind of a universal standard.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What would the standard be then?  If 
you look at what the 9th Circuit said and the 2nd Circuit 
said, and you were very critical of the thinking in their 
decisions, what would be the standard to decide whether life 
had value?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, people need to go back to the 
universal standard which has been in place for 400 years, 
which is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary 
care, that if, heaven forbid, a person gets cancer and 
begins to die and comes to a point where really all medical 
science has for them is pretty much exhausted, they should 
have an option to say no more extraordinary means, which 
means experimental treatment, whatever, should be used to 
save them.  The disease will take its course, and they 
should be kept comfortable, fed, turned, I mean, all the 
palliative care, but that in terms of having a doctor come 
in and kill them is wrong.

<p>

I mean, what the doctor was saying is absolutely 
true, because the Royal Dutch Medical Society came out 
earlier this year with agreement with the Dutch government 
to back away from physician-assisted suicide in Holland 
because of the doctor stress.  Now they want the situation 
to be where a doctor does not actually do it, that he is 
providing the mechanism for doing it; the person does it 
themselves.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Dave makes a really good 
point in some of his writings in ordinary versus 
extraordinary care that I would like you all to comment on.  
I think one thing that is confusing for people when they 
hear about the so-called right to die is what does that 
mean?  Does that mean I have cancer and I am not going to 
get better and I am merely going to be made comfortable and 
allowed to die?  Is that the right to die?  Because that is 
not what you all are talking about.

<p>

DR. STEVENS: There is a lot of confusion.  I 
think that is one reason that 75 percent of the people in 
the United States right now think that physician-assisted 
suicide is a good thing.  There is so much confusion about 
somebody is going to force me to stay alive against my will, 
and there are laws on the books across this country that 
prevent that from happening.  That is not what we are 
talking about.  What we are talking about is someone helping 
you decide and assisting you in killing yourself, and that 
is a world of difference.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And the thing is, you see, the 
Hemlock Society and all these pro-euthanasia groups that are 
really pro-patient-killing groups, they are coming in and 
making hay off of that confusion.  They are coming in and 
putting a videotape of someone like the guy in Canada, 
Austin Bastable[?], who the Canadian Right to Die Society 
had on DeathNet[?], they had him on the Internet with a 
video and everything, and it was a courageous battle to die.
People look at that and they think, my gosh, that should not
happen to me. Heaven forbid.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they do not understand.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  They do not understand.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to clarify this 
a little further in just a moment.  Join us after the 
commercial break as <i>Straight Talk</i> continues our discussion 
of euthanasia.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. It is hard to believe that 
euthanasia has even made it to our nation's courts, and here 
tonight to explain why is Dr. David Stevens, Executive 
Director of the Christian Medical and Dental Society; David 
Morrison, researcher and writer for Human Life 
International; and Gracie Hsu, an FRC policy analyst.

<p>

Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Gracie, we were talking a little before about the 
pressures, why people would feel a need to have a family 
member killed, and you had a point to make.

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, if we look at abortion as an 
example, what we find is that women, because they have now 
this choice whether to have an abortion or not, we find that 
many fathers of their children say, look, I am not going to 
take care of your child, because you have that choice.  You 
chose to bear this child to full term, and now it is your 
responsibility.  In that same way, we can expect to see a 
diminished quality of care for the elderly in hospices and 
nursing homes everywhere, because they will be saying to 
them, well, you should be taking your own life; why do I 
need to help you?

<p>

We have this whole perverse understanding of 
compassion.  No longer is it to talk somebody out of their 
depression and to make them feel better about themselves and 
to feel better about life; it is, look, you have no life 
worth living, you might as well kill yourself.  I remember 
as a student health advocate at UCLA, we were told that if 
there was somebody who was thinking about committing suicide 
and you felt that their thinking was -- that they had 
actions planned, that you had a requirement to report that 
to the police because their life was worth saving, and it 
was not because of privacy or anything else.  You had to 
breach that barrier, and you had to say that person's life 
was more important than any breach of privacy or
confidentiality that I may have promised that person.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is an interesting philosophical 
shift where before if someone is talking of killing 
themselves, we have a duty as human beings to care for them 
and to talk them out of it and help them understand the 
value their life has, and now, what?  We have a duty to make 
an appointment so that we can point you to the tallest 
building so you can get the job done?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  One of the things that Gracie said, 
one of the things that I wanted to comment on is that 
palliative care, which is caring for people in the last 
stages of life when medical technology for cures has run 
out, is very low or to non-existent in countries that have 
active patient killing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you are saying that in the Netherlands, for 
example --

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Right, in the Netherlands palliative care is no 
where near what it is in the United States, even, or other 
countries in Europe.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Doctor, do you think there are 
physicians that would embrace assisted suicide?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think there are a lot.  Maybe not 
as many as some think, but we only have to look at the 
abortion issue; a little over 2,000 doctors do the vast 
majority of abortions in this country.  I think more will 
get involved in this.

<p>

I think this whole thing is driven by a perversion 
of language.  You know, you talked about suicide.  They use
the word rational suicide.  That is an oxymoron.  There is
no such thing as a rational suicide.  If you are suicidal,
you are not rational.  It is like somebody standing on a
bridge.  You walk up to them, and they explain to you why
they want to kill themselves, and you say, okay, I know it
is hard to jump; let me give you a push.  That is what we
are doing with this issue.  Your doctor will ease it.  It
will not be such a hard decision.  We will make it pleasant,
as you jump.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  The thing is when we as a society 
begin to define death as a good, okay, then it is only 
natural that if we define it as a good, we want to give it 
to other people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now one of the distinctions you make 
in your writings, David, is you say it is understandable 
that at some point a cancer patient, for example, there may 
be nothing else that they can do, and we make them 
comfortable in the death process.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  There may be nothing else that we 
can do to reverse the cancer, that may be true, right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right, and so we make them 
comfortable.  But you make a distinction between medical 
care, that we may be at the end of our medical options, and 
depriving people of water and food.  Why do you make that 
distinction?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Because in my view, depriving 
people of water or food is the same type of the thing as 
patient killing.  It is a slower -- I mean, obviously, there 
can be instances, very limited numbers of instances, where 
to actually give food causes more pain, in which case you 
could make an argument that if you are going to give 
painkilling drugs, you should also withhold food, because it 
has caused the pain, as part of the drugs, but that is not 
the standard.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you see in the medical 
community on that, Doctor?  I think a lot of people -- they 
are afraid that physician-assisted suicide means that if I 
am dying of cancer, my doctor will give me a painkiller so 
that I can proceed in that process.  Does the medical 
community draw lines between ending care and stopping food 
and water?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, there is a lot of debate on 
that issue.  Personally, I think, right along with David, 
that is cruel and unusual punishment.  I mean, we send 
millions overseas to take care of starving children and then 
turn around and starve a relative to death to kill them?  
This was the circuit court ruling in New York.  That is what 
they based -- they said it was discriminatory.  If you are 
willing to do that, then how can you say that you will not 
give someone a handful of pills to kill themselves?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Which is ironic, because we are 
going to justify giving them a handful of pills because we 
are in favor of starvation?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Yes, because we are starving them to 
death. Let's be more humane; let's give them a handful of 
pills.  I mean, this circuitous reasoning that is going on 
in the courts is baffling to me in the profession and, I 
think, a lot of other doctors.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And what I would stress here is 
that each one of these cases is an enormous failure of 
compassion, of real compassion, which is drawing close to 
someone and being with them in their pain, because one of 
the people who sued in the New York case, the 2nd Circuit 
case, was a man dying of HIV/AIDS, and one of the things he 
said in his suit was that my friends have -- my condition 
has progressed to the point that my friends will not come 
visit me.  They say that seeing me gives them nightmares.
So he is going through this terrible experience.  He is
entirely by himself.  His family has forsaken him.  So in
that circumstance, suicide can seem like a much more
appealing prospect.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So instead of us feeling indicted by 
the fact that this gentleman needs love and we are not 
giving him love, we are as a society to feel indicted 
because we do not kill him?  It seems extremely illogical.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  It is not true compassion.  It is false compassion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I wanted to ask you, Doctor, though, 
because one of the reasons why a lot of people are going to 
be talked into killing themselves is going to be money, and 
what do the numbers show us about the costs of our medical 
care at the end of life?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, people say there is not a 
slippery slope on this issue, but I think it is not only 
slippery, I think it is greased in the United States, 
because 50 percent of health care costs occur in the last 
three months of life.  There is going to be enormous 
pressures on doctors, hospitals.  Insurers are going to be 
putting these pressures, the government, to limit cost, and 
because of that, it is going to drive this into new realms, 
not just the patient who is willing to do it, but the 
comatose person, the disabled person, the elderly person, 
and what was the option or choice to die is going to become 
the duty to die.  You have an obligation to society to do 
this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Especially for, I think, the 
comatose patient and some of the people who are not as able 
to speak, we are going to run into a real abortion quandary 
where we are killing our friends and relatives.

<p>

I want to talk about this further.  When <i>Straight
Talk</i> returns, we will share more insights into the effects 
of euthanasia on our nation.  You will not want to miss it.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are delving 
into the topic of euthanasia with Dr. David Stevens, David 
Morrison, and Gracie Hsu.  Welcome back.

<p>

Doctor, you had just given us the chilling figure 
that 50 percent of health care costs normally comes in the 
last 3 months of life, which is going to pressure a lot of 
relatives, not to mention HMOs, into convincing people to 
die.

<p>

Gracie, do you think that the money argument is 
going to play well in the public health field, or will they 
be patient advocates?

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, unfortunately the public health 
industry has been very well known to say that quality of 
life matters much more than the sanctity of human life, and 
so whether it be abortion or euthanasia, they are very much 
in favor of seeing if the quality of life is not there, then 
abortion before they are born and euthanasia after they are 
elderly is a good thing, and unfortunately, the economic 
costs are very large, and they loom greatly in public health 
and in medical circles.

<p>

In fact, in December, when I was with the American 
Medical Association and some of their delegates, talking 
about what are the biggest issues that you see, and I was 
trying to bring to them a pro-life perspective.  They said, 
you know, honestly, the biggest issue right now is economic 
costs and how much it costs to sustain life and especially 
in the last years of care.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But quality of life, I mean, that is 
really in the eye of the beholder sometimes, and I think we 
all -- David, you have written about it, too -- hearken back 
to the quality of life conversations that Nazi Germany had, 
and in the Dr. Kevorkian trial, it has been interesting.  We 
were just talking about that at the break.  The quality of 
life discussion has even infiltrated there.

<p>

Tell us what you saw, Doctor.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, the quality of life discussion 
is all about whether this life is worth living, and that 
means somebody has to make that decision.  Somebody sits 
back, and today it can be one place, and tomorrow it could 
be another group of people, that all of a sudden they do not 
have that quality.

<p>

It was interesting.  Today the prosecutor at the 
Kevorkian trial held up a newspaper from 1933.  Headlines 
blaring said "Suffering to be Ended." That was the Germans 
stating that they were going to begin killing those that 
were disabled, that were retarded, that they were suffering, 
that we were going to relieve their suffering by killing 
them, and we see where that door once it was opened led, and 
I think the same thing is going to happen here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: David, I would like you to address 
that point, because clearly if we start talking about 
quality of life, then we are talking about not the sanctity 
of life, not even -- I mean, it is very much going to be 
subjective.  Who is going to make that decision?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, in Holland, for example, more 
and more it is doctors, but it is also relatives.  The Dutch 
government did a survey or a report on the practice of 
patient killing, or euthanasia, in Holland.  It was called 
the Remalich[?] Report.  The third reason listed for 
involuntary euthanasia, which is where the person involved 
in being killed does not say yes, please or no, don't, or 
whatever; they are just killed -- the third reason is the 
family could not take it any more.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I mean, that is just ridiculous. The family cannot 
take it any more, so we are going to get rid of our problem.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, because when euthanasia came 
into Holland, it came in not even as a law.  It is still 
technically against the law, but there have been a series of 
judicial agreements, arrangements, understandings over time 
which has made the practice of patient killing, in fact, not 
prosecutable, and what has happened is it started out with 
very narrowly defined -- you had to be very sick, you had to 
be terminally ill, almost the last stages, all these 
qualifications.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You had to ask for it.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  You had to ask for it.  Well, it 
has just been broader and broader and broader.  Again, if 
you define it as a good, the tendency is to give it to more 
people.  So now you have people who are merely depressed.  A 
doctor was brought up on charges in Holland last year 
because he had administered -- he killed a patient who had 
been just mentally -- you know, both of her sons had died, 
she was very depressed, and he had killed her, and they 
brought him up on charges, and they acquitted him.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  It is interesting, too.  Another 
most infamous case was a 27-year-old ballet dancer, and she 
had arthritis in her toes and could not dance any longer, 
became depressed, and her doctor helped kill her.  I mean, 
is that all life is worth?  I cannot dance any more, I 
cannot do another vocation, I cannot go help kids in some 
part of the world?  I mean, there is where life has gone, 
and that is where it will go here, if we are not careful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think we have been schizophrenic 
in our thinking about this.  If you think recently about 
Christopher Reeves, for example, who very sadly broke his 
neck not 10 miles from where we are right now, and I think 
has received very positive public response to his very 
courageous fight, and I remember him being interviewed, and 
he said that he was at that point that he wanted to die and 
his wife and his children said we need you, and that was a 
turnaround for him, and I can imagine the same situation 
where, what, the wife and the children say you’re expensive?  
I mean, we are really losing the fact that life brings an 
intangible quality, and I fear we will not see a lot of 
those stories if this keeps up.

<p>

DR. STEVENS: I have treated thousands of patients 
that have been terminally ill.  Almost every one of them 
sometime during the course becomes depressed and despondent.  
Do you know they are scared of?  They are scared of two or 
three things.  They are scared of being a burden.  They are 
scared of loss of control.  They are scared of death itself.  
They are scared of pain.  What they are really wanting -- 
they are sitting out there signaling, saying do you still 
care for me?  Do you still love me?  What we are turning to 
is to say, no, you are right, maybe it would be better if 
you were not here.

<p>

What a message we are sending to people.  When 
they need us the most, we turn around and say, now, here is 
a handful of pills, here is a canister of carbon monoxide.  
We have diagnosed the problem right.  I would be the first 
one to say health care in this country is not perfect, okay, 
and it can be done better, especially at the end of life, 
but we may have the right diagnosis, but this is the wrong 
treatment.  We need to deal with the depression.  We need to 
deal with the cost concerns.  We need to deal with a loving 
atmosphere.  We need to deal with pain control.  But we do 
not need to kill the sufferer to eliminate the suffering.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And the thing is, too, that there 
is a witness now.  There is a growing witness, I think, for 
the truth in this, which is coming from Mother Teresa’s 
whole order, from the Houses of Love she runs for people 
with AIDS around the country.  People do not know that there 
is an organization called LARGE[?], which is a series of 
communities around the world for people who are 
developmentally disabled and people who are not, and they 
all live together, and there are powerful voices there about 
the value of life, the value of living with, quote, unquote, 
a disability.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a slippery slope, isn't it? I
mean, in abortion what we have said is that life is as 
valuable as it is to me.  I have an interesting -- reading 
feminist literature, there was an interesting thing in the 
New York Times Magazine not too long ago -- Gracie and I had 
some long conversations about it -- where the woman came to 
the conclusion after having her own child that it wasn't a
person until she had decided to have the baby and accepted 
its humanity, and until then it was merely a decision, and I 
wonder what kind of leaps of logic we are going to see in 
the end of life.  So you were a person, you were my father, 
until now.  You have a health problem, and so now you are -- 
what? -- not a person.  You are plant life.

<p>

I would like to ask you all in terms of the 
slippery slope, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
and other very radical pro-animal groups have argued that, 
you know, animals have their own sort of humanity, and it 
would be better for us to experiment, for example, on 
comatose patients than it would be for us to ever use animal 
tests.  Do you see this kind of euthanasia discussion 
leading to that, because, again, I think, if you look at 
euthanasia, in Germany that that is exactly what happened in 
the death camps, that we saw experiments on humans.

<p>

We actually do not have a lot of time left. Doctor, let me have 
you answer that.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, I think we are moving to that, 
and all we have to do is look at Kevorkian, you know, the 
physician-assisted suicide poster child.  He back in the 
1960s was going around with an ophthalmoscope and looking 
into people's eyes and retinas as they were dying to try to 
see the exact moment.  He has proposed that we harvest 
organs from prisoners that are going to be killed.  I mean, 
this whole thinking that there is no sacredness to human 
life, we can do whatever we want to people once they are no 
longer declared to be human.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a powerfully dangerous slippery slope.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares insights from 
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer.  Please stay 
tuned, and thank you to my guests.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. FRC President Gary Bauer had 
the opportunity to speak at the 1996 National Day of Prayer 
event and provided his insight into the current plight of 
our nation and its families. Let's hear what Gary had to 
say as we share some Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER:  For about 10 years now, two-thirds of 
the American people have been saying that America is headed 
in the wrong direction.  They said that when George Bush was 
in the White House and the Democrats controlled the 
Congress, and they are saying it now with Bill Clinton in 
the White House and the Republicans controlling the 
Congress, and I do not believe it has anything to do with 
the ebb and flow of politics or who happens to be sitting in 
the Oval Office.

<p>

I think the American people are pondering the soul 
of America.  I think they are thinking about a mother in 
North Carolina who straps her children in the back seat of a 
car and sends it to the bottom of a lake, or about a family 
in Los Angeles that makes one wrong turn and before they can 
get off that street of killers, their 3-year-old child is 
dead of sniper fire, or the incredible headlines a few weeks 
ago of a 1-month-old baby almost being kicked to death by a 
6-year-old in a robbery, and the politicians read the 
headlines, and they have no idea what to do.

<p>

My friends, there are many, many ways to measure a 
great nation.  You can measure it by the size of its 
economy, the strength of its military, and the gleam of its 
cities, and by those measurements the United States is a 
great, great nation.

<p>

But you can also measure a nation by how many of 
its families are broken, how big its virtue deficit is, how 
many of its children will cry themselves to sleep, and the 
fact of the matter is that tonight in Washington, DC and in 
the suburbs and all over this country, too many of our 
children will cry themselves to sleep, too many children 
without a father's arms to comfort them, too many children 
exploited by drugs or pornography, too many children who 
have bought into the siren song of the culture that says if 
it feels good, do it, and by that measurement, we are in 
danger of becoming something much less than a great nation.

<p>

Now all the politicians are asking why?  What 
happened?  What is the government program we need?  I don't 
think there is a government program.  I don't think there is 
any number of bureaucrats that can make it right.  I believe 
that what happened is that we forgot God, and having 
forgotten God, we have unleashed the hounds of hell on our 
streets and our neighborhoods and our communities, and 
unless we are willing to deal with that, then all the 
politicians in the world will not be able to put America 
back together again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we will share our conversation
with a true American hero.  Almost 1 year ago, on June 2, 
1995, U.S. Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady's life changed 
forever.  On that June afternoon, Captain O'Grady flew 
his F-16 over hostile Bosnian territory enforcing the 
United Nations no-fly zone, when suddenly an anti-aircraft 
missile hit his plane.  From then, miracle after 
miracle led to his rescue, which occurred almost 6 days 
after Captain O'Grady found himself hiding in hostile 
territory without food or water.

<p>

The successful Marine rescue mission brought 
home a brave new hero, and we will find out how Captain 
O'Grady's experience shaped what he is doing today and 
shapes his future.  You will not want to miss this 
exclusive <i>Straight Talk</i> interview.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Robert Knight, the 
Family Research Council's director of cultural studies.
Bob enlightens us on a crucial social and policy change
which threatens to redefine marriage as we know it now
and have known it since even before recorded history.
The courts in Hawaii are toying with redefining marriage 
to mean two men or two women or fill in the blank,
instead of protecting the relationship at the core of all 
civilized societies, marriage between a man and a woman.

<p>

Bob shares important information regarding the 
ramifications of this change that you probably will not 
hear on the broadcast or print news coverage as we take 
you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You know, it may 
seem strange to a lot of our viewers, but we are actually 
going to have a conversation about what is marriage, and 
why do we even care what it is?  Why are we talking about
marriage today?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has been forced upon us.
This is not an issue that we raised, because we have been 
for marriage all along and want it to stay the way it is:
the social, legal, spiritual, and economic union of a man 
and a woman.  That is what it has been for centuries.  In 
fact, if you just reduce it to the bringing together of 
the two sexes to form families, that is the way it has 
always been across cultures around the world for 
thousands of years.

<p>

So the only reason we are even discussing it is 
because of a court case in Hawaii.  Three years ago,
three same sex couples sued to get a marriage license.
They were denied by the state of Hawaii because there is 
an opposite sex missing in each couple, and so they took 
their case all the way to the Hawaiian Supreme Court.
That court told the state:  find a compelling interest in 
maintaining this definition of marriage, or we are going 
to legalize homosexual marriage under the state's gay 
rights law.

<p>

So right now that court case is simmering.  It 
is supposed to be heard in August, 1996, and because of 
the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, if Hawaii legalizes gay marriage -- that is 
an oxymoron -- then all the other states would see their 
laws threatened, because a couple from California or 
Illinois or North Carolina could fly to Honolulu, get a 
bogus marriage certificate, come back and say under the 
Constitution, you have to recognize our license.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, I think we almost have to 
explain that a little further, because that is the clause 
through which all contracts in all of the states are 
accepted, such as drivers' licenses or marriage licenses 
or even business agreements.  Would the full faith and 
credit clause sweep this nationwide?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it would.  There is one little 
-- well, a lot of rays of hope here.  For one thing, 
states are moving very rapidly to protect themselves.  At 
least nine states have enacted laws saying, look, we mean 
by marriage one man and one woman and that is it, and we 
are not going to recognize any licenses from anywhere 
that say otherwise, and this is continuing.  I expect 
more and more states will adopt these kinds of laws.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there precedent for one state 
to say that for us we will restrict agreements from other 
states in certain areas?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, yes.  The Congress had to 
take this up because of child custody proceedings.  There 
were different varying definitions of what a child is and 
that sort of thing.  So Congress stepped in and said, 
well, look, we will amend the U.S. code and make national 
definitions that everybody can use, and that is what is 
happening now at the federal level on the marriage issue.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act, introduced in the 
House and the Senate, does precisely that.  It says that 
no state can be forced to renounce its own definition 
just because another state has taken up a radical 
redefinition, and it also defines marriage as one man/one 
woman for the federal government, which is no small 
thing, unfortunately.  Government is too big.  You are 
talking Social Security, the military, the welfare 
agencies.  The use of the term marriage and spouse is 
everywhere in the federal code.  So this would make a 
major dent in the drive to redefine marriage if the 
entire federal government goes on record as supporting 
the traditional definition of marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It seems obvious, Bob, that the 
Hawaii case could have drastic social consequences, but I 
think the question that most people would really like to 
hear you answer is what does it matter if two men or two 
women decide to go through a legalized ceremony for their 
relationship?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, that is the problem, and that 
is what we hear all the time.  Hey, how are you 
threatened?  Barney Frank says it all the time.  How are 
you threatened if I and a lover live together?  Well, you 
are threatened any time the moral order is shaken by 
activities that are immoral and hurt people.
Homosexuality by its essence hurts people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How does it hurt people?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because it is a breakdown of 
the moral code.  When sexuality is not channeled into 
marriage -- and we are talking about premarital sex, 
adultery, homosexuality, anything short of marriage -- 
and historical precedents show that it breaks down the 
moral order.  It breaks down the way we live.  It hurts 
the kinship structure.

<p>

Marriage was not invented to oppress 
homosexuals.  It was invented because it is the way to 
form families, and it is the building block of 
civilization, and when you have any sex outside marriage, 
you run the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, 
breaking down support for marriage within the culture, 
which has already happened in this country with no-fault 
divorce and the whole push for premarital sex.  Marriage 
has already been cheapened to the point where now 
homosexual activists think they can deal the final blow 
by expanding the definition so far that marriage will not 
mean anything any more.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the conversation on this 
issue of marriage being redefined for homosexuals has 
surrounded the point that marriage tames men.  So if we 
had marriage for gay men, they would be tamed.  But don't 
women really tame men in the context of a committed 
relationship?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I think women help a lot, because 
men have something else to live for other than their own 
appetites and desires when they have families.  So I 
would not dismiss that out of hand, but the claim that if 
we let homosexuals marry they will suddenly behave 
themselves is bogus.  In areas where they have de facto 
gay marriage, like San Francisco, where they really 
recognize the union, the social pathologies are still 
soaring, and the gays are very clear in their literature 
that what they mean by marriage is different from what 
other people mean.  They have outside relationships.

<p>

Andrew Sullivan, the editor of the <i>New Republic</i>,
said that gay male relationships may even be superior to
marriage, because they understand the need for outside 
sexual contacts.  So they are not even talking about
monogamy.  Furthermore, other gay activists have been
even more candid, like Michelangelo Signarilli[?], who
said we need to get marriage because it is the final tool
to ram through the rest of the homosexual agenda:
teaching homosexuality to children in schools, forcing
businesses to provide benefits to subsidize
homosexuality, the whole gay agenda.  He also said, look,
we want marriage, not to live by society's moral code but 
to help destroy an archaic institution.  I mean, this guy 
is priceless, because he is actually saying out loud what 
the gay activists have been planning all along.  So in 
the name of tolerance, we are supposed to accept 
something that really will destroy marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, on <i>This Week with David
Brinkley</i>, California Attorney General Dan Lundgren made 
an interesting defense of marriage, where he said that 
one reason why we protected marriage, that union of 
man/woman and then the family that came from it, was 
because of the implications for that on social breakdown 
and that increased crime, in particular, was a real 
problem for societies where men and women did not work 
together consistently for the raising of children.  Would 
homosexual marriage of any kind create some kind of 
safety net against crime?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, no, it would do the opposite, 
because it would reduce the support for marriage within 
the cultural and legal codes.  Once you redefine marriage 
so that it is not even the bringing together of the two 
sexes, then the sky is the limit.  You could have three 
people, four people.  Unmarried heterosexual couples have 
piggybacked on the gay rights agenda to demand that they 
be treated the same as married couples.  If that happens, 
then the support for marriage disintegrates, and when 
marriage disintegrates, commitment is lessened.  You do 
not have the ties between the generations.

<p>

I do not think the average person really -- 
well, maybe average people do.  They are smarter than all 
the activists put together.  They know marriage is the 
glue that holds society together.  It ensures kinship 
passing from generation to generation.  We talk of our 
grandparents and our children yet to be, and there is a 
linkage there.

<p>

When sex goes outside marriage, you break that 
linkage, or if it goes into a phony homosexual type 
marriage.  I mean, you do not have that generational 
intimacy and passing on of property, names.  I mean, 
think of what a society would be with widespread so-called 
homosexual marriage.  It would be in utter chaos.
So why would we want to introduce a chaotic element into 
a society that already needs to bolster marriage?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Really at the heart of this 
controversy over redefining marriage is the traumatic 
social change of making children available for adoption 
into households with two men or two women and then the 
very powerful social message that children do not need a 
mother and a father, that as long as two guys care about 
you, or two women, that a whole lot of social 
relationships are insignificant.  Are you concerned about 
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Children are desperate for clues as 
to how to grow up, to be either men or women, and they 
look to both sexes for clues.  Boys look to their dads 
for how to grow up to be men, and they look to their 
mothers and their fathers for how women and men interact, 
how husbands and wives interact, how mothers and fathers 
interact.  They have to learn how to treat the opposite 
sex and be treated by the opposite sex.

<p>

The same for little girls.  You know, without a 
dad, they are not sure how men should be treating women, 
or without a mom -- that is their role model.  That is 
their security in developing their femininity.  If you 
take that away, you are trying to create an artificial 
gender identity by theory basically rather than by 
experience.  So when you have a household in which you 
have mom and dad replaced by just two men or two women, 
you are leaving out such an important element that the 
child knows it.  We are experimenting on children.  This 
is wrong.

<p>

Again, nobody knows this better than single 
parents, who are struggling mightily to try to replace 
that void in the child's life that they know is there, 
and a lot of parents are heroically trying to fill that 
void.  But in a homosexual household, now you are talking 
about having one sex missing entirely and a distorted 
version of sexuality and relationships presented to the 
child on a daily basis.  This is putting children at 
risk.  It is not reasonable to assume this will have no 
impact on children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The homosexual activists have 
talked a lot about the fact that they need to redefine 
marriage under the law so that they can give property 
through wills, so that they can visit loved ones in the 
hospital, but do we really need that kind of huge social 
change to accomplish those two goals?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, most of the activists greatly 
exaggerate any legal problems they already have.  You can 
leave anything you want to anybody in a will.
Homosexuals already do that routinely.  What they want is 
that family should not have an advantage in any legal 
challenge to a will, and to do that you would have to 
devalue family entirely.  You know, children coming out 
of a marriage, even if it is sundered, should have 
certain rights in an inheritance proceeding.  What the 
gay activists are saying is they should not have any more 
standing than, say, a string of gay lovers, and that is 
wrong.

<p>

As far as hospital visitation, that is not a 
federal issue.  It is not even a state issue.  That is 
between the hospital administrators and their patients, 
and there is no reason that gays should seize marriage, 
completely radically redefine it, just to have a change 
in hospital visitation rules.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It seems a bit extreme.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it is the most compelling 
argument they have, that, oh, I can't even visit my lover 
in the hospital; isn't that unfair?  Maybe it is, but you 
do not seize marriage and radically redefine it to 
correct that one problem, if it is a problem.  You know, 
there is a reason family members have been given priority 
in visitation of loved ones.  Friends cannot make the 
same claims that family members can.  The same with 
homosexual lovers.  No matter how close they are, it is 
still not family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, as we take a look at some of 
the serious possible changes in our culture that could 
come from redefining marriage, I think it is interesting 
to remember that the family is defined as that unit bound 
by blood, by birth, by adoption, and by marriage.  What 
do you think the most serious social consequence is if we 
change what marriage means?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, already, marriage has been 
severely weakened by many forces:  pornography, no-fault 
divorce, sex education that omits marriage as a central 
element and talks about partners.  I mean, marriage is 
already, as the author Maggie Gallagher says, on the outs 
in the society.  She calls it a post-marital culture, and 
we are reaping a whirlwind from it.  Certainly crime is 
one of the greatest aspects of that, but if we go the 
final route and say that men and women are not different 
and homosexual marriage is the equivalent of a man and a 
woman together, then we have embraced a lie.  We have 
embraced something that is so toxic that it will spoil 
the whole culture, because you cannot lie about something 
as basic as nature and get away with it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thanks so much for being with 
us today, and we are going to watch very closely what 
happens through your work on the Defense of Marriage Act.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for having me, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares my conversation with Captain Scott 
O'Grady.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I recently had the 
opportunity to speak with Captain Scott O'Grady, the Air 
Force pilot who survived 6 days and nights in hostile 
Bosnian territory before his miraculous rescue.  This 
life-changing experience occurred almost 1 year ago, and 
Captain O'Grady's life has not been the same since.

<p>

Let's hear what he has to say about life as an American hero.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Scott, thank you so much for 
joining us on <i>Straight Talk</i>. I do not think there are 
too many people who have not heard your story by now, and 
we do want to hear your story, too, but your life has 
changed a lot since you were rescued.  How is it 
different?  I mean, all your life, you are training to be 
a pilot, and suddenly you are a pilot plus more, 
something philosophical for America.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, it is something that I 
thought was just going to go away, actually, and when I 
moved out to Hill Air Force Base, Salt Lake City area, 
where I am now assigned, flying the F-16, I pretty much 
thought that a lot of the requests in the mail would come 
to an end, and they have not, and I was trying to decide, 
you know, what can I do with all of this, and I am 
working hard on trying to fulfill all the requests a lot 
of people have of me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What kind of requests do people have?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Oh, there are a lot of 
different charity organizations that would like to have 
me stop by or community organizations and schools.  That 
is what I do now is I fly the F-16 half the month, but 
the other half of the month I travel a lot, and I do 
speaking engagements; I do the schools, or just as an 
example, I will go to a fund-raiser for a charity.

<p>

I am deciding now that I need to get some 
organization.  I have some help from people that are 
helping me with all the requests, and I am going to 
narrow it down to where I am going to concentrate on two 
charities.  I am going to concentrate on still visiting 
schools and doing things for community organizations, but 
people have to realize that I am only one person, but I 
do tell them that if they would be patient, that I will 
live a long life --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And you will get there some day.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  I will get there some day.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  In a way, you have become the 
ambassador for the military to the rest of the America.  
I think the military in some ways is at a time, 
especially in the media, of a lot of criticism, and you 
have presented a symbol of what the military is proud of.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: See, I am not a spokesman for the military.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, I understand.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: And I do not even recruit for 
the military.  I do not do that.  But I will tell people 
all the time how happy I am to be serving in the military 
and how fantastic it is to have worked with all the great 
people that are in the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines, 
the Army, and the Coast Guard.  People have to realize 
that we are just like everyone else in America.  We are 
the same people.  We have the same feelings.  But yet we 
are also doing a job that does not ask the normal demands 
that a job in the civilian sector would.  We are in a job 
that could ask for you to put your life on the line to 
defend freedom, and people are dedicated enough and 
believe in their cause that if that is the call, then 
they are going to go ahead and do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have a friend right now that is 
in Korea.  Obviously there are some tensions there, North 
Korea talking about going into the demilitarized zones, 
and there are a lot of hot spots around the world.  He 
told me that the thing that was most impressive to him 
about your experience was that you went by the book.  You 
know, you were sitting there following all these 
procedures and that this was successful.

<p>

How did your training prepare you for what you experienced?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, training is something 
that we have in the military, and it prepares us not only 
just how to run things on a day-to-day operational basis, 
but also we prepare for emergencies.  We prepare for the 
unexpected.  It is all training that is based on previous 
successes and previous failures, because you always learn 
from your experiences to be able to benefit those in the 
future, and that just does not go with military training; 
it goes with day-to-day living.

<p>

But it was a foundation for me to grab hold of, 
something that was real and tangible when everything was 
going crazy all at once in just brief short periods of 
time, but it also does not give you the motivation to get 
through a time like that.  You have to derive your 
strength from somewhere else, and the inspiration I got 
was definitely from people that I know that have gone 
through worse situations, those who have been prisoners 
of war, those who have been in survival situations, maybe 
not even in combat, and I knew that they had gone through 
hard times and could get through.

<p>

So they gave me inspiration, but really it came 
down to, for me, getting the strength to get through it 
came from faith, came from love of family, came from love 
of country.  And that is really where, when you get down 
to the bottom basics of going through a situation like I 
went through, you have to have somewhere deep inside you 
the will to live, love of life, and that is where it 
comes from.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the President 
of the United States, accompanied by General John M. 
Shalikashvili, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 
Honorable William J. Perry, and Captain Scott O'Grady.

<p>

GENERAL SHALIKASHVILI:  Mr. President, Secretary
Perry, members of Congress, other distinguished guests,
members of the Armed Forces.  Thank you for coming, even
in this rain, and for helping us welcome home this very 
special young man, Captain Scott O'Grady, and to extend a
warm welcome to his father, Dr. O'Grady, his mother, Mrs.
Scardapane[?], her husband, Mr. Scardapane, Scott's
brother Paul and his sister Stacy, and his grandparents.
We are delighted you could all be here today, for surely
this is a very proud and a very happy moment for us all.
Welcome.

<p>

Ten days ago, like thousands of other men and 
women in uniform, performing dangerous missions in 
difficult and demanding circumstances all over the world, 
Captain O'Grady was flying over Bosnia, doing his part to 
deny the skies to those who would rain death and 
destruction upon that war-torn land below, but as we all 
now know, in the early morning hours of 2 June, the 
course of Captain O'Grady's life took a dramatic turn, 
and the next 6 days put to test every bit of his 
knowledge, every fiber of his courage, every bit of skill 
and determination, and every ounce of faith that he could 
muster, and for 6 long days, people around the world, his 
family, his friends, every American, waited impatiently 
for news of his fate, and while they were 6 long days for 
us to wait, they must have seemed like an eternity for 
Scott O'Grady.

<p>

Then, on the 7th of June, out of the darkness in 
the hills of Bosnia came that voice; this is Badger 52.
At last we had our opportunity, and so a remarkable team
that had been praying for that call sprang into action.
NATO's combined air operation center in Vicenza, Italy -- 
Americans, Italians, Dutch, French, Spanish -- under the 
direction of U.S. Air Force Major General Hal 
Hornberg[?], quickly took control and started issuing 
orders.

<p>

At Avigliano[?], Colonel Chuck Wald[?] began to 
launch air defense suppression aircraft and those that 
would provide close air support, if needed.  Others made 
sure that air refueling aircraft were in station, to 
include a French KC-135.  Still others double-checked 
that NATO AWACs and the French E-3M with Major 
L'Enfant[?] on board, were ready to provide airborne 
control and radar data, and off the deck of the USS 
Kiresarge[?], under the command of Colonel Marty Burn[?], 
into the dark foggy night rose those who would this day 
do the heavy lifting, the Stallion helos, the Cobra 
gunships, the Harriers, and the Marines of the 24th 
Expeditionary Unit, and 2 hours and 5 minutes later, 
Colonel Marty Burn reached out his hand and pulled Scott 
aboard the rescue helicopter.

<p>

Although they still had to dodge bullets and 
shoulder-fired rockets, Scott was at last on his way 
home, and the professionalism, the courage, the inner 
strength of Captain O'Grady and every member of the team 
that brought him home are vivid reminders, if reminders 
we need, that our greatest strength and the source of our 
deepest pride are our men and women in uniform, and the 
deeds of courage that we are here to salute and applaud 
are reminders, as well, of our responsibility to take 
care of them and of their families.

<p>

Scott, today is an especially great day to wear 
America's uniform, and you and the rest of your team have 
made it so.  For that I thank you and I salute you, and 
with a great deal of happiness, I welcome you home.
Welcome home, Scott.  Welcome home.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more from 
Captain Scott O'Grady after this commercial break.  Don't
go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are sharing our 
conversation with Captain Scott O'Grady as he discusses 
memories of the fateful events which changed his life 
forever.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  The first thing I want to do is thank God, thank 
God for His love.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you remember most about 
your experience?  We have heard a lot.  You were 
obviously shot down, you were behind enemy lines, and 
they were looking to kill you, and eventually you were 
rescued.  What do you remember most about that 
experience?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, if I would have come 
home and nobody would have paid attention to the story 
and I just would have returned to my family, it still 
would have been the most positive experience of my life.
The thing that people have to realize is that I do not
recommend, you know, life-threatening situations as being
something that everybody should explore, but it was 
definitely something that I was able to, like I said 
before, look inside myself and see what is really 
important in life, and the relationship you have with 
your faith, and it is not just so much having a faith as 
having trust, and then love of family.

<p>

I would have given up everything I own to be 
able to return to my family, and you realize that that is 
what is really important, those relationships, because 
materialistic things are things that you are not going to 
take with you, and it isn’t until your health is 
threatened that -- you forget all the time in your day-to-day 
living how valuable your health and your well-being is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How has it changed you now, now 
that you have had this experience, really a crystallizing 
moment where you could have lost everything including 
your life?  So how do you live differently?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Oh, I still have the problems 
as everybody else, but you just keep on constantly 
remembering what is important in life and where your 
priorities should lie, and with that, though, try to 
simplify your life to where then you can have the room 
and the space and the time to be able to concentrate on 
those relationships that are the most important thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What kind of advice would you give 
somebody from that?  I mean, what kind of tool to help 
them understand?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  I think the biggest thing is 
people have to realize that myself and other individuals 
who have gone through a situation like this, we did not 
ask for it, and we also of course prior to this would 
say, oh, gee, I could never get through something like 
that, because even now I have people who come up to me 
and say I never could have done what you did, and that is 
not true.

<p>

You would be surprised what kind of strength you 
have inside you when you are faced with an adverse 
situation, and you have to just concentrate hopefully on 
what is really important in life.  I know that everybody 
gets wrapped up in the day-to-day living, and there is 
always this to worry about and that to worry about, but 
if you take a step back and kind of look at the big 
picture, you realize that most of the things you are 
dealing with and most of your worries in life really are 
not that important.

<p>

MR. PERRY:  We are here today to celebrate true 
grit, great training, superior technology, and 
outstanding leadership.  The true grit is obvious to the 
entire country.  It was the courage and skill 
demonstrated by Captain O'Grady.  They shot down his 
plane but not his spirit.  The true grit was also evident 
in the courage and skill of Colonel Burn and the Marine 
Corps search and rescue team.  They proved that the 
Marines have landed and the situation is well in hand.

<p>

The great training was evident in the efficiency 
of the operation, reflected in Captain O'Grady's training 
and survival techniques, and the Marines' training in 
search and rescue operations.  Training is the key to 
ready effective forces, because the more you sweat in 
peace, the less you bleed in war.

<p>

Normally, the technology of greatest importance 
in search and rescue operations is our night vision 
devices.  These allow us to operate at night and give us 
the benefit of stealth.  As the Army says, we own the 
night.

<p>

However, this search and rescue operation had to 
be conducted in daylight.  So we lost the advantage of 
operating at night.  But fortunately, we had the 
advantage of another piece of technology, the Global 
Positioning Satellite, or GPS.  Captain O'Grady used the 
GPS receiver in his survival kit to determine his exact 
location to within 100 feet, and the search and rescue 
team, using its own GPS receiver, was able to set down 
virtually at the pilot's position. This allowed them to 
keep their time on the ground, the time of greatest risk, 
to only 2 minutes.  This was an amazing performance for a 
search and rescue operation.

<p>

I want also to note the outstanding leadership 
of General Jawin[?], Admiral Smith, Lieutenant General 
Ryan, and, yes, General Shalikashvili.  They were faced 
with a really tough decision.  They had planned a night 
operation to take advantage of our night vision 
technology, but Captain O'Grady's radio signal was 
confirmed just 3 hours before dawn.

<p>

So they had to make a choice, either to wait 
another 18 hours until the next nightfall to rescue him, 
and that would risk that the pilot would be captured 
during the day, or to go immediately, even without the 
advantage of operating at night.  They chose to go.  It 
was a gutsy decision.

<p>

It turned out to be the right decision, and it 
was in the best military tradition, exemplified in a 
famous letter that was pointed out to me by General 
Sullivan, Chief of Staff of the Army, the letter that 
General Sherman wrote to General Grant.  He said:  I knew 
wherever I was that you thought of me, and if I got in a 
tight place, you would come.  To Captain O'Grady, Colonel 
Burn and the Marine search and rescue team, General 
Jawin, Admiral Smith, and General Ryan, you should be 
very proud of your performance.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we 
will hear more about Captain Scott O'Grady's heroic 
experience and miraculous rescue.  Join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. We are sharing 
with you my visit with an American hero, Captain Scott 
O'Grady, as we hear some of his memories and trials and 
triumph.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Could you describe for us your 
darkest moment and your brightest moment during that 
experience?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: The darkest moment was 
actually when I was on the ground for the first couple of 
hours and the people were walking very close to my 
proximity, and I heard approximately five or six 
gunshots, and they were all carrying rifles, and the way 
it was sporadically done, along with the different 
locations, the only thing I could conclude was that they 
saw something or heard something that they heard was me 
and shot at it, and that scared me, because now I am 
thinking that the probability of getting caught is going 
to be very high, but I also was anticipating the fact 
that I would be mistreated, but now, because of that 
occurrence, I thought instead of being mistreated, they 
would probably just kill me.  So that was actually the 
time of a very heightened state of fear.

<p>

Prior to that, a lot of things happened to me, 
but I just did not have time to be afraid.  Afterwards, I 
really was not afraid when I was out there.

<p>

As far as the greatest moment, it was definitely 
when I finally could hear Tio Hanford[?] come up on the 
radio and respond to my voice.  That was like being 
reborn.  It was like a bolt of energy that ran through me 
that I had never had before, because you wanted to let 
loose on every emotion possible; you wanted to laugh, you 
wanted to scream, you wanted to cry, and that was a 
fantastic and phenomenal moment in my life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Then when you returned to base and 
you got to see men and women who you knew well and who 
had really prayed for your return, what was that like?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  That was unexpected and a very 
emotional time, too.  In fact, when I got off the 
airplane and I saw everybody in the hangar, I had to go 
and get cleaned up, because, again, I was very emotional.  
So we went off, and I took a little bit of a breather, 
and then we came back and said hello to everybody, and 
that was a fantastic time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you have any momentos from that 
experience, either a mental momento or even a physical 
momento?  Do you have anything that you can hold in your 
hand and you remember?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, I always have my cross 
on, and that was with me, and I had my Swiss army knife 
that got me through, and then my watch.  But as far as 
momentos, the biggest thing is just the memory of the 
event, and it has actually become a story to me, because 
I have been able to tell a lot of people about it, and 
there are no nightmares.  It is actually the most 
positive thing that has ever happened to me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It changed your life.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  It definitely did.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, I know you are going to work with St. Jude's.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, I am going to try to 
start a relationship with two charities.  We have not 
done anything yet.  I am trying to organize all these 
things that are coming up in my life that I never 
expected, and one of the two charities I really want to 
set up a relationship with is St. Jude's Children's 
Hospital, also the Make A Wish Foundation.  Both 
concentrate on children which are going through adverse 
times, trying to overcome diseases that are life-threatening, 
and if that does not tug at your heart, I do not know what will.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we close, Scott, your 
experience really can relate to what these kids are 
facing.  They are going to be asked to deal with pain and 
suffering that they are pretty unprepared for.  What do 
you think you can tell them when they are looking to 
something that seems very dark to them?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, the biggest thing I 
learned is you never quit, and you never even think about 
anything but a good outcome.  You always keep a positive 
mental attitude.  But for me, the reason why those two 
hit home so well is the fact that these are children that 
do not have the normal lifestyle that I had when I was 
growing up.  They do not have a normal childhood.  Here 
they are inflicted with something that they did not ask 
for, just like I did not ask for what happened to me, and 
yet have also such great life and spirit inside of them.  
It is really a treat to be able to go and be able to do 
something for those children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And their tragedies can be a great triumph for 
them, as well.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: Oh, yes. Yes, it is definitely character-building.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Scott, thank you so much for being with us on 
<i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Thanks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares how policy makers and communities can make a 
difference in stopping the breakdown of marriages in 
America.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you a portion 
of a recent panel discussion at the Heritage Foundation, 
which tackled the collapse of marriage and its economic 
and social consequences.  Bill Mattox, the Vice President 
for Family Research Council's Policy Division, provided 
his expertise regarding this important issue.  So let's
hear some of Bill's insight on tonight's Homefront News.

<p>

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  There are many implications for 
policy makers and others for the collapse of marriage, 
and I want to take just a minute to outline a couple.  
For public policy makers, I think it is going to be 
extremely important for public policy makers to be 
cautious about making divorce law distinctions between 
couples with children and couples without.

<p>

Bill Galston[?] did all of us a tremendous favor 
several years back when he and Elaine Kaymark[?] 
presented a paper from the Progressive Policy Institute 
called "Putting Children First," which argued that on 
many of these kinds of questions, the first question we 
should be asking ourselves is how will children fare, how 
do children fare, and what ought we do to meet the needs 
of children?

<p>

I think that is a very important question for us 
to consider when it comes to marriage, for all of the 
reasons that have been cited about the negative effects 
of divorce and out of wedlock childbearing on children, 
but I guess when it comes to public policy, I am a bit 
disturbed about the possibility of making distinctions on 
this basis, considering those marriages in which a child 
is present somehow different from those in which a child 
is not, and the reason is just because I think, though it 
is clear that a child's well-being is more adversely 
affected by the break-up of his own parents' marriage, I 
think it is nevertheless true that a child is going to be 
affected by the failure of other marriages in the 
community, most especially marriages of their neighbors, 
their extended family members, their grandparents, and 
other role models in the community.

<p>

I also think, by the way, that we need to look 
at the whole question of affirmative action, of all 
things, and how it may be contributing inadvertently to 
problems of marriage breakdown in the black community, 
and there is a dramatic difference in the way in which 
minority women and minority men are being assimilated 
into the current labor force.

<p>

What you see is that minority women are much 
more likely to move into positions of promotions and get 
higher salaries than are minority men, and I think part 
of the reason for this may in fact be that with the 
current affirmative action policies dealing with both the 
subject of race and gender, that what has happened is 
that a minority woman is in a sense a two-bagger for an 
employer.  If he hires or she hires a minority woman, 
that both improves the race makeup and improves the 
gender makeup, whereas a minority male is kind of a mixed 
bag.  He improves the race mix, but it comes at the 
expense of the gender mix, and I think for that reason 
there is a subtle inclination or pressure or tendency for 
some employers to favor minority women over minority men.

<p>

Lastly, let me say that as much as we might want 
to try to tackle this through public policy, I am not 
convinced that the problem can be turned around 
significantly by public policy means.  In fact, I am 
increasingly convinced that it is going to be churches 
and other community-based institutions that will help to 
turn this around.

<p>

We need to be encouraging leaders in religious 
institutions to deal with what I believe to be a rather 
casual attitude about divorce and remarriage in both 
their doctrinal teaching, as well as in their premarital 
counseling practices, whether or not they conduct those.  
I am extremely encouraged by this idea of having 
community marriage policies where all the ministers in a 
community agree that they will not marry someone until 
they have gone through premarital counseling.

<p>

I also think there needs to be greater emphasis, 
of course, at the practical level with marriage 
enrichment programs, and I think that there needs to be 
an emphasis on relationship building across generations.  
This is something that I think can be facilitated to a 
great extent by the church.

<p>

The couples that succeed are those who learn to 
resolve conflict.  It is not that they do not experience 
the same ups and downs and have the same sort of problems 
as everybody else.  It is that they manage to somehow 
work through their difficulties, to persevere, and to 
quite often come out on the other side of those problems 
with a stronger marriage, and I think in many ways some 
of the older couples in our communities and in our 
country have the opportunity to share with younger folks 
that sense of, hey, you can make it, stick it out, work 
through these things, and can perhaps strike that balance 
that is so needed where we hang onto our romantic ideals 
about what we want marriage to be while at the same time 
confronting the sober realities of how difficult it quite 
often is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight
on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are looking at the drug crisis which
has crippled our nation, destroying communities and shattering
families.  Illicit drug use strangles the life out of many people,
and America desperately seeks solutions.  One of the newest answers
comes in the form of needle exchange programs in which drug users
who shoot up exchange used, often AIDS-tainted needles for sterile
needles.  Needle exchange programs claim to curb the spread of
the AIDS virus without encouraging drug abuse, but is that true?
Tonight, we will investigate.  You will want to hear what some
experts have to say about our continuing battle against drugs
and for lives.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Family Research Council's president,
Gary Bauer.  The political implications of character are news
this week, as analysts discuss what the Whitewater convictions
of Bill Clinton's friends will mean for his presidency.  With
years of political experience, Gary Bauer brings a special insight
into the power of the values and character issues.

<p>

Polls indicate that most Americans believe that our country
is on a downward spiral and that politicians are poor role models,
especially on moral issues.  Let's hear Gary's predictions on
where America's values are headed as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are here today on Behind the Headlines.
Thank you, Gary Bauer, very much for being with us.

<p>

Gary, we are talking about whether there is a future for
character and values issues today with the current political climate,
and you have been a champion of values issues for the last 20
years, but some people think that character and values issues
today are waning.

<p>

Do you agree?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I don't know.  There is good news and bad news.
I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming that the overwhelming
majority of the American people are worried about values related
issues.  I mean, that shows up in just about every poll you have.
You have two thirds of the country saying that we are headed
in the wrong direction, and when you press them on it, it usually
ends up being value related or issues related to virtue.

<p>

The bad news, however, is that there seems to be a disconnect
between that public concern and the political process.  The most
disturbing poll I have seen of all has just come out in the last
couple days by, I believe, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and it showed
that only 22 percent of the American people think that electing
someone of high moral character to the presidency is important.
Now I wonder whether that is an accurate poll or not.  If it
is accurate, that is a pretty disturbing sign in a country that
in the past grew up talking about George Washington cutting down
the cherry tree and Lincoln walking miles to return a library
book, and so forth, and it may be a sign of the fact that we have
really drifted a great deal in recent years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, it would appear that some of the cynicism
could be created by the media.  If you look back at Watergate
and at that as being a time in our nation where we said all our
politicians are crooks and liars, and now people are really taking
a lot of the attitudes that politicians are lying anyway.  Do
you see that as you go across the country, that people are assuming:
well, they are all liars, so I want to get the best liar I can
get.

<p>

MR. BAUER: That may be exactly what is at the heart of that
polling result.  I do go around the country a lot, and there is
incredible cynicism among the public.  Many times people are just
throwing up their hands and saying I give up; I have tried election
after election to find somebody that will represent my values;
I am always disappointed; it doesn't make any difference; I'm
just going to do the best I can in my home town in my neighborhood
and forget all these guys that are making all the promises to
me.

<p>

I think there is a sense in the public, too, that all politicians
do have a problem with the truth, and so why hold them up to an
unnaturally high standard by insinuating that you are only going
to elect people of high moral character?  I tend to become cynical
about these things, too, but I actually believe that there is
a difference in many races in the candidates.  I think you can
find people in both parties that have high moral character, and
I would urge my fellow Americans to not give up looking, because
it is too important to do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In past elections, personal character was a
powerful issue, and in fact, if you look at the Eisenhower race,
Eisenhower basically ran as I am the one who is the good guy,
who helped you all in World War II, so vote for me because of
who I am, not for what I stand for.  Character has really been
powerful, and yet today it seems that policy is all that counts.
We do not even look at character at all.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, yes, Eisenhower was the ultimate character
campaign, and I think Americans very distinctly and very intentionally
voted for somebody that they thought would bring a certain set
of character values into the Oval Office.  Today, I don't know,
there seems to be this disconnect.  In my view, for example --
I am not speaking about any particular politician; I'm just making
a general point -- if there is evidence that a politician can't
keep his promises to his own spouse, then the question that comes
to my mind is why in the world would I trust that politician to
keep their promises to me, somebody that the politician doesn't
even know?  He's made no legal or faith-based commitments to me
as a voter.  I think all those things about how a man or a woman
running for office, all the things in their personal life, do
end up sending us signals about what we can expect from them in
office.  There is a fine line about how much of this you actually
bring up in a campaign.  I don't think most Americans want their
personal lives debated, but on the other hand, I think we do want
to know the character of the individual that we are electing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You mentioned earlier, Gary, two stories that
really have marked the nation's psyche, stories about George Washington
saying I cannot tell a lie, or Abraham Lincoln and his tremendous
honesty and a character that we have all nationally admired, and
it seems that a lot of these stories have marked who we are as
a people, but are they still being taught to our children?  Are
they still having an impact on our national psyche?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, this may be one of the things right at
the heart of the problem.  When I was Undersecretary of Education
under Bill Bennett, one of the things we did was go back and look
at the textbooks in use in America's schools around the country,
and much to our shock, we found that those stories that you and
I grew up with and I would suspect most of our viewers grew up
with, are not in the textbooks anymore.  You can't find elementary
school textbooks that tell the George Washington story.  These
stories are now in some ways mocked and are considered to be a
part of legend, and the character-forming role that they played
with young people has been abandoned.  In fact, we went back and
looked for a couple of dozen things, things like the great sayings
from America's past -- I regret I have but one life to give for
my country, things like that.  Those all have been taken out of
American textbooks, and I think much to our detriment.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The character issue has played a very large
role with President Clinton in the various campaigns that have
been run against him, and it was interesting over Memorial Day
Weekend that some Medal of Honor winners took out full page advertising
chastising him for trying to hide behind his symbolic title of
commander in chief to get away from a sexual harassment suit,
and as one columnist said, he takes one character flaw, dodging
the draft, and highlights it in his attempts to dodge a second
character flaw, which would be alleged sexual proclivity.  Yet,
the character issue does not seem to stick to Bill Clinton.  A
lot of people are urging Bob Dole to make it an issue.  Do you
think that it is going to work?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, this is the question that George
Bush asked himself during an entire campaign.  The character issue
was a major focus of the Bush/Clinton campaign, and as we all
know, it did not work.  Bill Clinton won.  I can understand why
the Dole campaign wants to try to use the character issue now,
and maybe they will have more success with it, but I am afraid
there is not a lot of evidence, at least as of now, that this
is going to be a cutting edge issue for people.  I think character
is important.  I think politicians ought to talk about it and
continue to bring it up, but I think the Dole campaign is going
to have to find more than that if they hope to take care of the
rather large lead that Bill Clinton has opened up as of now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At one point in our nation's history, adultery
would in and of itself be a sufficient character issue to knock
you out.

<p>

MR. BAUER: No question about it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But today what would do that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I don't know. I mean, I am not sure there
is one single character issue that by itself would doom a candidate.
Certainly, people still get upset about financial matters, evidence
that a candidate has cheated on his income taxes or has played
fast and loose with the public's money.  Those things still seem
to strike a responsive chord.  But in matters of sexual mores
and in marriage and those kinds of issues, the country seems to
have gone pretty far down the road as being willing to ignore
those things in making judgments about who to elect to high public
office.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When it comes to candidate Dole, it is pretty
universally believed that he has phenomenal character, and obviously
he is scarred in the service for his country, and people do think
that he has character, but when it comes to the values issues,
people sometimes question whether he will really be a fighter
for them.  Do you think that his vice presidential candidate will
be a very key factor for him, because a lot of people are looking
to that appointment to send a statement about whether he will
be a fighter for values issues.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, first of all, let me just say about Senator
Dole that he is a dying breed in America, I think.  That is my
father's generation, and they were unique in their commitment
to their country, the sacrifices they were willing to make.  People
will have political disagreements with Senator Dole, but I think
they have to concede that there was a time when men like Senator
Dole were in the majority, and now as time passes, there seem
to be fewer and fewer people that would fit the description that
one comes up with when you look at Senator Dole's career.

<p>

On the other hand, you raise an interesting point. Senator
Dole has a reputation of being a grand compromiser and of cutting
the differences between the two sides.  Right now, I think what
Americans are looking for is somebody who will stick to their
guns and will be predictable on the kind of values they are willing
to speak up for, and because of that, I think the vice presidential
choice really is important.  I think Senator Dole needs to pick
somebody who has the same values and the same philosophy as he
does.  Otherwise, he is going to send the signal that he really
does not care that deeply about these issues; why else would you
pick someone as your running mate that disagreed with you on major
things.  So this is going to be an important decision for Senator
Dole, and I hope that he will defy the inside the beltway wisdom
on this and pick another solid conservative to be his running
mate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What values issues have a future in this election
in your estimation?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think where the values issues really
reach critical mass is when they touch on young people and what
it is we are teaching our children.  I think that any time that
Senator Dole can bring up America's youth, can talk about the
concern that I think Americans feel about where our children are
headed, the statistical evidence that something has gone seriously
wrong with how we are raising young people in the country -- those
are issues that I think are very important in the public mind.
I think it is why Bill Clinton tries to picture himself as often
as he can with children, why he has talked about getting tougher
on discipline in the schools.  He knows these issues strike a
bell with the American people, and this could be an issue that
would end up being very important before the election is over.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you once again for being with us
on <i>Straight Talk</i>'s Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: My pleasure, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight
Talk</i> begins our discussion about America's drug problem and
the validity of needle exchange programs as a solution.  Please
stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape following.]

<p>

MAN: I think there definitely is a drug problem in the United
States, basically because of the irresponsibility.  People want
to use them and want to use them how they want to do it, and it
basically just gets really out of control.

<p>

MAN: Drugs are just ruining our country.  I mean, the economic
structures behind drugs that I know of is astronomical.

<p>

WOMAN: See, I think there are a lot of problems with drugs
now that they are illegal.  I think a lot of people would take
it to an extreme if they were available.  I mean, people take
alcohol to an extreme right now, and I just think it would cause
more problems.  It is much more dangerous.

<p>

MAN: I just think legalizing drugs is going to maybe take
away the demand for it, but the violence is going to be there,
and it is just going to turn our society -- it is going to keep
going downhill.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: America's war on drugs has entered a new battleground,
with some using a deadly virus as their sword, and they are winning
some ground.  Needle exchange programs are cropping up in cities
across the nation.  Currently 75 needle exchange programs reside
in 55 U.S. cities, and these programs claim to save lives.  According
to a 1995 government-commissioned study, providing clean needles
to intravenous drug users slows the spread of the HIV virus. 
Yet, many experts, government officials, and addicts themselves
question these findings, and many of those questions arise from
the examples of other countries such as Switzerland, where needle
exchange programs were implemented, along with easy access to
clean intravenous drug paraphernalia through vending machines.

<p>

In Zurich, drug users were provided a safe haven in which
to obtain needles, known as needle park, which soon became a drug
orgy of sorts for addicts, providing 12,000 needles per day before
the park closed in 1992, because of the social decay it was causing
in the community.

<p>

The addicts then sought refuge in an abandoned railway station,
where 15,000 clean needles were exchanged daily.  In that environment,
attitudes toward drug use grew lax, making it easier for drugs
to become mainstream via legalization.

<p>

Yet problems with the drug culture did not go away.  Switzerland's
30,000 heroin addicts are the highest per capita rate in Europe,
and the Swiss have the second highest HIV infection rate.

<p>

It seems America has not learned from nations' experiments.
Will we pursue policies that make drug use easy, or will we build
successful rehabilitation programs?  Do drug overdoses with clean
needles justify so far failed attempts at reducing the spread
of the HIV virus?  Will federally funded needle exchange programs
pave the way for drug legalization?  These questions must be answered
before the drug war claims more lives, some of them even today.

<p>

MAN: We are losing the battle, and until the government
switches its playing ground and switches what it is really targeting,
we are going to continue to lose and eventually lose our children,
which is going to be the biggest loss.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: No one can ignore America's battle for lives,
and tonight I am joined by some real warriors:  Shepherd Smith,
the president and founder of Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy,
who researches effective AIDS treatment and compassionate care
for those infected with the virus; also here is Lieutenant Colonel
Robert Maginnis who serves as the Family Research Council's policy
expert on America's drug problems; and we are joined by Dr. Sally
Satel, who is a psychiatrist at the District of Columbia's Pretrial
Drug Treatment Program.  Welcome to all of you.

<p>

It is certainly a dark setup piece, but I think the question
that a lot of people are asking is is there a growing drug problem
in America, because you are seeing some nightly news reports to
indicate that it is not really the issue that we all thought.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, since 1979 we have cut the number
of people in this country that are routinely abusing drugs in
half, but now since 1990 and 1991, the number of especially marijuana
users is up, and we are not really sure if that is going to lead
to an increase in heroin.  The heroin numbers are up, too, but
we are still waiting to find out if that is going to be a long-term
effect.  So we really need to come back and reexamine the things
we did well in the early 1980s to begin to turn this around. 
Clearly there is a problem, and it is an ongoing problem.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Shepherd, you have been working with this for
a while.  You know, in terms of evaluating what was successful,
what do you think was successful?

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, one reason numbers are down, HIV has claimed
a lot of lives of IV drug users.  The area of concern is young
people is where we are seeing the greatest growth today in new
drug use.  Programs that are successful are ones that show individuals
who are addicted to drugs that someone cares about them, that
there is an opportunity for them in the future if they make corrections
in their life today.  Programs that simply support the behavior
and affirm that behavior really have not shown to be effective
that we have seen.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You are working with pretrial drug treatment,
Dr. Satel.  What are you finding about drug use?  Is it going
down, and if not, why not?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, we have a waiting list that is as long
as you can imagine.  I happen to work with patients who are in
the inner city, so I believe in that group there probably has
not been much of a decline ever in the last decade or so.  The
people I work with are those who come from backgrounds where parents
were addicted.  Often they do not know their father, and their
mother was involved with drugs.  When you have patients who will
tell you, no, I don't do cocaine -- a lot of those people do marijuana,
PCP, and some heroin, but when their reason for not doing cocaine
is because they saw what it did to their mother, you know you
are dealing with a very, very compromised group of people here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that it is the loss of life that
has resulted in slightly lower numbers, or do you think that it
is the loss of maybe yuppie users, because you are saying the
inner city is staying the same.

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, I am saying in my population, yes, it has
stayed the same.  So I do not see any particular influence in
terms of drug use as a whole.  I do think that the crack epidemic
may actually be waning a bit in the inner city; again, you could
say there is almost a self-limiting effect, when one generation
sees how the previous generation has been devastated.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, but as the crack epidemic wanes,
we are finding a growth in the methamphetamine epidemic that is
moving from the West Coast here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And for people who do not know what that is, Bob?

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: That is speed, basically.  You know,
it is manufactured here in the United States, so you don't really
have to ship it in like you do from Columbia cocaine. So there
is a very serious problem.

<p>

But going back, the mixture that we saw on the setup where
you have AIDS, an emotionally charged virus that is impacting
throughout the country, and we mix that with heroin or needle
users, you know, just a complex issue but a very frightening issue,
and we saw the situation in Switzerland, and there they were giving
out needles.  They were giving 15,000 needles a day in Latin Park[?]
there in Zurich before they shut the place down.  It was a madhouse.
I mean, there were murders.  The police would come in.  They
would turn over the cars.  There were all sorts of problems. 
Well, in this country today there is a movement to try to place
needle exchange programs in virtually every city where there is
a problem with AIDS and needle exchange.  After all, where do
most of these programs take place?  They take place in the inner
city that Sally is talking about.  They take place where you have
a high incidence of HIV.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. But why not?  Why not needle exchange?
I mean, what the needle exchange people are arguing is that if
I am exchanging dirty needles with people who already do drugs
-- I am not encouraging drug use, but what I am doing is at least
cutting down the risk of AIDS.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, that is what they are going to
tell you, but the evidence -- you know, we have gone through the
studies.  In the National Academy of Science, they acknowledge
-- a couple of physicians; there are only two, two of the three
MDs on the study -- they say, look, it is not the panacea that
it is being made out to be.  There are problems.  The best solution
for this problem is to provide treatment for people who are on
drugs.  If we get them off drugs, they are not going to come down
with HIV because they have been using dirty needles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So at the very least, needle exchange is not
an anti-drug program.  I mean, at the very least, it is not trying
to stop drug use.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Not at all, and in fact, you can give a clean
needle to an addict, and it really does not stop the transmission
of HIV if they go out and share that with another infected individual.
The message has to be don't share your works, and you do not
need to give out any equipment to give that message.  But where
the programs probably have an effect is establishing a relationship
with people who use drugs, and they feel that someone cares about
them, and they are more inclined to listen to what they say about
not having sex with somebody who is infected, not sharing needles,
and in that context they have a value, but it is really independent
of the fact that they give out clean needles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Shepherd, you have been working with AIDS and
HIV for years.  You are well-known for this issue.  Do you see
any reason to read needle exchange programs as successful in terms
of decreasing actual AIDS/HIV, and following up your comment about
death?

<p>

MR. SMITH: We really have not seen evidence that is substantive
in respect to the value of needle exchange programs and reducing
HIV infection rates.  What we are concerned about is there is
a basic logic or illogic, if you will, in the AIDS community that
says affirm people where they are, meaning don't say anything
negative about their behavior, if they are having multiple sexual
partners or if they are using drugs or they are into all sorts
of different sexual activities.  You know, affirm them where they
are.  So what needle exchange does is it does not warn the individual
that the behaviors they are participating in are very harmful
to them, and we think that honesty is a good policy, that you
ought to, you know, lay the cards on the table and say this is
your life, you can have a good future, but what you are doing
is destructive and you need to eliminate that activity if you
really want to have a fulfilling life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is not just the needles.

<p>

MR. SMITH: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to talk about this more. <i>Straight
Talk</i> brings you more after this commercial break.  Don't go
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing two of America's
tragedies:  drug addiction and AIDS.  Here to explain whether
needle exchange programs can positively affect these problems
is Shepherd Smith, president of Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV
Policy; Lieutenant Colonel Robert Maginnis, a senior policy analyst
at the Family Research Council; and Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist
who works for effective treatment with drug addicts.  Welcome
back.

<p>

We were discussing needle exchange programs before, and there
are a lot of things that people are attempting to get better behavior.
Like there is crime attached to drugs, and there is AIDS attached
to drugs, and yet some people argue that we are moving toward
legalization by some of these programs.  Do you see needle exchange
programs as being positive in terms of legalizing drugs?

<p>

MR. SMITH: They certainly contribute to the idea that drug
use is okay.  I mean, if the government is going to sponsor programs
to help addicts participate in this destructive behavior, then
it can't be all that bad.  Unfortunately for young people, we
haven't heard from this administration, we haven't heard from
any leaders, that these behaviors are harmful, and we are seeing
just dramatic increases, not just in marijuana use but smoking,
as well, tobacco.  They all interrelate.  Fortunately, in respect
to sexual activity among young people, we have seen maybe a peak.
It can't get much higher, but maybe we are going to turn the
corner soon.  But clearly the message of needle exchange is detrimental
to young people and their attitudes about drug usage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see, Doctor, in your program?
People come in and they are obviously addicts.  Are you attempting
in terms of treatment to say drug use has got to stop, or are
we talking about facilitating them and making them better drug
users, like better alcohol users or better smokers?

<p>

DR. SATEL: No, we are saying drug use has got to stop.
Now remember, the population that I am working with are people
who have committed crimes.  So they are in a drug court, and actually
they have been given a choice by the judge.  You go to jail or
you go to treatment.  Believe it or not, some of them actually
choose jail, but of those who come to treatment, no, they get
urine tested twice, three times a week.  We are very strict about
an abstinence policy, and actually we are seeking in these people
for more than just stopping drug use.  We really want to resocialize
them.  We want to make them into citizens again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In terms of some of the other gateway programs
related to AIDS and drugs, some people -- needle exchange and
also giving people drugs so that they won't commit crimes, so
here are free drugs three times a day; we are seeing that in Sweden.
Do you see any reason to believe from your population that giving
needles or giving free drugs will have any positive social effects?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Kristi, we give drugs in a sense.  We give methadone.
That is a substitute for heroin, and while I think those programs
can do a lot of good, they do reduce the commission of crime by
people who are in methadone programs, there is less AIDS transmission
of people who are in methadone programs, but about 60 percent
of people in methadone programs in New York City use cocaine,
and I actually think -- I would like to know your impression of
this, but a methadone program that I once worked at in Connecticut,
I thought that they had a fairly high threshold for dismissing
people from the program when they broke the rules, the rules being
that they used other drugs or they committed crime, and I think
the reason that the threshold was higher was because they wanted
to protect them from transmitting HIV and from contracting it.
So I think it has actually changed the profile of methadone programs,
HIV.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As in encouraging methadone use or crack cocaine
use or cocaine use?

<p>

DR. SATEL: I think it has changed the standards of acceptable
behavior in methadone programs where a patient might be dismissed,
might be said, listen, you have to leave our program if you are
going to commit crimes or use other drugs, but I think now there
may be less momentum to do that because the programs are concerned
about having people on the street now using dirty needles.  At
least before they were using the methadone and there was some
degree of safety and supervision.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like, Bob, we are substituting one
pathology for another in many ways.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, I certainly agree with that assessment.
You started off by asking about what is happening in our culture
in regard to maybe legalization.  The analogous situation that
we saw in Switzerland, this year they have an election to decide
whether or not to legalize drugs.  Now they did not start off
with that.  They started off incrementally with needle exchange
programs, with heroin programs.  They give some methadone, but
they have heroin programs, with people in jail, they give them
heroin, with people in the streets that they come in every day
and up to nine times a day they get their free heroin shots. 
And those types of programs have really facilitated a change of
attitude in the culture about drugs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In what way, Bob?  Explain that.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, they look at the problem, they
say it is out of our control, we might as well facilitate this.
You know, now they want to put drug addicts, heroin addicts,
repairing cars.  One company bragged a couple months ago that
this is the way we ought to go.  There were 94 executives of the
largest Swiss companies that came out in a public statement and
said, look, we give up on this.  We want drugs legalized.  We
think the government ought to be involved in facilitating this.
We want to reintegrate drug addicts back into the culture.  Then
companies stood up and said this is what we need to do.  So our
concern with needle exchange programs, which have yet to demonstrate
that they truly reduce HIV contraction and at the same time do
not increase drug abuse, is that if we open up the floodgates
that we will never be able to put the genie back in the bottle.
It is a scary situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that I have noticed is that often
the people talking about legalizing drugs ironically and even
sadly have drug problems in their own families.  I mean, Surgeon
General Joycelyn Elders is a good and sad example of that, her
own son being convicted of drug use.  Are you seeing that that
is one of the realities of the legalization discussion, that it
is people saying, look, so much is out of control, forget it.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, when you find one pathology, you
are liable to find another.  You know, where there are drug problems,
there are also crime problems, there are also out-of-wedlock birth
problems.  You know, all sorts of problems kind of rotate around
the same types of issues.  I don't know.  It is one of the most
gripping problems we are faced with.  I was with Senator Thompson
just a week ago, and we were trying to figure out -- you know,
the senator from Tennessee -- we were trying to figure out what
to do about the juvenile problem in this country, and we are about
to explode with violence that we have never seen before.  It is
tied into the drug issue.  It is tied into a lot of the things
that are going on in the culture.  Frankly, we are not sure, but
what we do know, based so far on these studies, is that this is
not the panacea that it has been made out to be.  We do not need
to expand the horizons of needle exchange programs and follow
a course where the Swiss have already tread.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about one minute left.  Dr. Satel,
could you address that really quickly?  Are we seeing that tracking
with family histories, that drug use is a family problem that
goes generation to generation?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Again, the patients that I am seeing, very much
so.  In fact, sadly in many cases the whole family is involved
with drugs at some time, but I should also add that sometimes
having a history of substance abuse in one's family accounts for
some very passionate advocacy, as well.  So I think it cuts both
ways, often to our advantage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is really powerful, especially in some
of the new public service announcements out.  There are some very
vocal advocates.

<p>

We are going to talk more about this when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns.  We will hear more about America's drug problem and the
possible solutions.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking to experts in
the fields of drugs and HIV/AIDS policies.  Here tonight are Shepherd
Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Maginnis, and Dr. Sally Satel.
Welcome back.

<p>

Shepherd, you were talking earlier that these experts that
have been giving us sometimes bad drug policy advice or AIDS advice,
they have a lot of factors working in their own lives.  Maybe
you could explain that a little.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, the curious thing that I have found going
to international AIDS conferences and national HIV conferences
and so on is that the experts really do not want to address fundamental
problems, because they participate in a lot of the behaviors that
put people at risk in the first place.  For example, the biggest
predictor of a sexually-transmitted disease -- and HIV is an STD
-- is numbers of partners.  Yet, you cannot say at an AIDS meeting
that promiscuity is a bad thing, that having lots of partners
is a harmful behavior.  You would be ridiculed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why?  I mean, that seems obvious.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Because all of the experts have participated
in that behavior.  The same thing with the use of drugs.  Many
of these people are the product of the drug and sex revolutions
of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  They experimented with drugs.
They did not become addicted themselves.  So they really don't
see any negative side to the use of drugs, particularly recreational
use.

<p>

Consequently, we often go back to affirming people where
they are.  It is okay to participate in that behavior as long
as you do it safely.  So that is why clean needles, condoms, and
dental dams are the answers that these folks have to this epidemic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than giving our youth a clear message
about sex, about drugs, and maybe even about alcohol.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Sure, absolutely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let me ask you then, following up on that,
Dr. Satel, we are saying that some people have used drugs and
haven't had a bad experience, and so they are not appreciating
that others can't deal with it.  I mean, are you finding that,
that drugs and alcohol are more parallel than we thought?

<p>

DR. SATEL: I think there is an enormous arrogance, actually,
among people who have managed to use these drugs and luckily for
them, in a sense, haven't succumbed.  They are highly dangerous,
as you know, and I see firsthand people who have just abdicated
their life to this.  I mean, when you have a mother who abandons
their child in a car because of crack cocaine, I mean, a maternal
instinct is a pretty hard thing to break, but somehow a drug can
saw its way through that.  I mean, this is not recreational use,
and it is certainly not a romanticized addiction to heroin.  This
is devastating.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And yet people aren't willing to treat it in
a devastating way.

<p>

Why do you think, Bob?  I mean, why have we got this disconnect
between playful drugs and the fact that people will sell their
own children, as we saw recently in the news, a woman who sold
her children to a drug dealer to pay off a debt?

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, there are tragic situations all
over.  The general perception is that the risk associated with
marijuana or alcohol or any of the other drugs is not that bad,
and if you track the national surveys of mostly teenagers, you
find that the risk assessment just keeps going down.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Their attitudes toward the risk.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, their attitude about the risk associated
with consuming these things.  Why?  Because our leaders in our
country have not been beating the drums that this is bad for you,
and the parents have in many cases come out of the 1960s where
they have been abusers themselves, and they have a guilty conscience
about it, and they just are not going to stand up there and tell
that young man or young woman that this is going to kill you,
it is going to ruin your life, and this is my experience.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Clinton Administration has come under criticism
for weakening the message on drugs, for firing a lot of people
in the Office of Drug Policy, and Just Say No might have been
simple -- it wasn't the only part of the program, but it certainly
was a clear signal.

<p>

Shepherd, do you see some of these changes?

<p>

MR. SMITH: Absolutely. The Clinton Administration deserves
all the criticism on this issue it can get.  It devastated the
National AIDS Policy Office.  It has not spoken out to say that
these behaviors are harmful.  You know, it is so politically correct.
One of the words you cannot use in PC is normal, because that
implies that there is abnormal behavior, and so we can't say anything
negative then about behaviors that are harmful, and with our hands
tied under political correctness, we have not been able to talk
about values in respect to how children, young people, should
live.  We haven't been able to articulate relationships, what
I am obligated to you in a community to do and what obligations
you have to me, to help each other, to pick each other up, to
point out failures and to then correct our ways.  We can't do
any of those things.  So we are letting young people make decisions
that adults have difficulty making.  I mean, it is a horrible
situation, and this administration bears a great deal of the 
responsibility of where we are today.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This administration, Dr. Satel, has focused
a lot on things like considering needle exchange and considering
any garden variety of segue program, rather than strictly dealing
with how do we get out.  You are an expert in that.  What programs
work in terms of getting people out?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, speaking of the administration for a second,
I would like to note that they also cut the budget for treatment
programs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So they cut the policy arm and the treatment
arm both.

<p>

DR. SATEL: Yes, they did.  Meanwhile, we may be regulating
tobacco, which gives a very bizarre message.  That is a potent
irony.  But there are programs that do work, programs that frankly
I think could work better.  For example, actually, the program
that I am involved in, which is tied in with the court system,
I think is very powerful, because it has real sanctions and a
real accountability for the individuals that are going through
it.  As I mentioned, we get urine tests, and then there are other
kinds of consequences if patients do not comply.  But there are
other kinds of treatment, and they depend on the severity of use.
I do wish we had more residential treatment programs.  There
are only about 15,000 beds in the country, and according to ONDCP,
we have something like 2 million hard-core addicts.  Now admittedly
I don't think every one of them needs a bed in a residential treatment
program, but I would say a good proportion of them do, and those
programs are long-term.  They are 18 to 24 months.  Phoenix House
is an excellent model.  It really rebuilds people.  It does not
see addiction so much as a disease but as a symptom of a disordered
life that needs --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Let's just have you comment on that quickly,
the idea that addictions are diseases versus maybe disorder or
lack of self-control or whatever.  Has that affected this problem?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, I think there is a lot of rhetoric about
addiction being a brain disease in fact, and while I concur wholeheartedly
that of course a drug is a toxic substance and it works on the
substrate of one's brain, so of course there are neurobiological
components to addiction, especially of course tolerance, where
you need more drug to get the same effect, and withdrawal.  Those
are clearly mediated through the central nervous system, but why
people start to use drugs in the first place and why they relapse
after months, sometimes years in fact, of being clean, that is
not something that is neurobiologically motivated.  That is a
much more complicated psychological process, and I think we underestimate
that by calling this a brain disease.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You get the last word, Shepherd.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, personal responsibility has to come back
into the vocabulary, and good programs need a spiritual element
to them to really show people that there is hope, that there is
a greater being that can help them through this, and that they
do have a future.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank you all for being with
us.  As always, Bob has been a kingpin in bringing a great team
together.

ANNOUNCER: If you are weeding through the record store this
weekend, you might want to check out Hempilation[?].  It is a
new tribute album of sorts to the joys of pot smoking.  Some talented
musicians participated in the project.  Ron Tagg[?] reports their
work has ignited quite a controversy.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: At a New York party, Capricorn Records launches
the controversial new album, Hempilation, a CD that celebrates
the use of marijuana.  Groups such as the Black Crows, Blues Traveler,
and Cypress Hill sing the praises of pot on this new compilation
album.  Royalties from the sale of the CD will benefit NORMAL,
the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.  The
group wants to decriminalize marijuana for medical, recreational,
and industrial purposes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are discussing one of the latest
in technological advancements, the Internet.  You have
probably heard about your home computer as a link to all the
information in the world's databases, but we will be taking
a look at how cyberspace allows pornography to enter your
home and reach your children through just a few strikes on
the keyboard.

<p>

Pro-family groups found some solace in the 
Communications Decency Act which made it more difficult for 
children to come across indecent material in cyberspace.
Yet, just a few weeks ago, a Pennsylvania federal court
blocked enforcement of that law, saying that it limits First 
Amendment protection of the Net.

<p>

Tonight, we will be talking to those who work 
closely with this case and continue to do battle for your 
children.

<p>

But first, let's get the inside scoop on Capitol 
Hill.  Marty Dannenfelser runs the Family Research Council's
Government Relations shop after years on the Hill.  He works 
daily with congressmen and senators, staying up to the 
minute on the issues affecting your family.  We will hear 
about the key issues that the House and the Senate are 
attempting to highlight and to avoid as we near the election 
and as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You have worked on 
the Hill for a lot of years and had a chance to see a lot of 
Congress sessions come to a close, and in particular to see 
the session transition into an election, most particularly a 
Presidential election.

<p>

What does that mean about the importance of the 
issues at play now, given that the session is ending, but we 
are going into a Presidential election?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it makes the whole 
dynamic very politically charged, and there is a lot of 
activity that takes place that seems to advance the agenda 
of either candidate by the members of the party of that 
candidate, and it is producing quite a conflict from issues 
like health care and welfare and the whole spending process, 
the appropriations process.  All of this, I think, really is 
being worked out against the backdrop of the impending 
Presidential election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In a Presidential election cycle, it 
seems that some of the issues are brought up more 
philosophically, just to argue about the issues that either 
candidate cares about, rather than really substantively.
Are these issues at play really significant?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  There is some of that. You 
certainly see that in this whole debate about whether or not 
we are going to have medical savings accounts in the health 
care bill and whether or not we are going to link welfare 
reform and Medicaid reform and so on.  So much of that is 
tied to the arguments that the various candidates have made.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What issues are still at play that affect families?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, one of the big issues 
that is still at play is the Defense of Marriage Act, and 
people may be aware of the situation in Hawaii where the 
Hawaiian courts are expected to mandate that the state has 
to recognize same sex marriages as legitimate marriages, and 
under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, the other states, all 49 of them, may have to 
recognize those marriages.

<p>

So Congress has a bill to protect states who 
choose not to recognize those marriages and also defines 
marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman for 
federal purposes for the impact that would have on federal 
benefits and so on.  So that is a very important thing.  The 
President has said that he would sign the bill.

<p>

We now have a situation where Senator Ted Kennedy 
is trying to introduce another issue into the mix, what is 
called the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, and he has 
indicated that he will try to attach that to the Defense of 
Marriage Act, which could muddy the waters, and our hope is 
that those two issues would be kept separate and that we 
will get that bill, the Defense of Marriage Act, passed this 
year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bill Clinton, as we know, has been 
very pro-homosexual in the agenda that he has embraced, and 
yet he came forward in favor of the Defense of Marriage, as 
did Bob Dole.  It would have seemed like the right thing to 
do would have been to force the Defense of Marriage Act 
through quickly and have them put their electoral votes 
where their mouth is.  Why didn't that happen?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  It has been partly complicated 
by the legislative schedule.  There is a desire in the House 
to move the appropriation bills.  They have to pass 13 
appropriation bills, and they had hoped to get most of them 
done before this July 4 recess, and I think they have about 
seven or eight of them done.  So that has been pushed off.
So we do hope to see some movement on the bill in the month 
of July.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there a lot of sentiment in 
support of the Defense of Marriage Act?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  We sense that it is very 
strongly supported by people across the board.  There is 
some activity by the Human Rights Campaign Fund and some 
other pro-homosexual groups to try to derail it and try to 
suggest that it is political, but it is very necessary, 
because we do feel that this court decision in Hawaii could 
come down as early as September, and in the absence of this 
bill, we could see all kinds of executive action by the 
administration to start implementing this and forcing the 
states to recognize these marriages and forcing federal 
programs to pay benefits to the so-called spouses of these 
individuals.  So it is very important that this legislation 
be enacted before Congress leaves town.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Another of the issues at play has 
been the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act which was to deal 
with a very limited late term abortion procedure that we 
know from the doctor that invented has been used against 
healthy viable children 7, 8, and 9 months of gestation.
When it first went through, it went through by wide margins, 
and Bill Clinton vetoed it.  There has been talk about 
bringing it back, possibly for a veto override before the 
end of the summer.  Is this a possibility?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes, the timing is not nailed 
in concrete just now, but we do expect possibly by the end 
of the summer that that will come up, and there are efforts 
to educate the public, because there is a need to turn 
around some votes in the Senate and also to hold onto those 
votes in the House.

<p>

There were two-thirds margins in the House in the 
two votes that they have taken on this legislation, but 
there will be a lot of pressure, particularly on Democratic 
members, to defend the President and to argue that his 
position regarding this health exception, which we would 
argue would make it abortion on demand, that those type of 
issues are already accounted for in the bill to protect the 
life of the mother when her life is threatened by some 
serious health complication.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There have been some recent 
developments on the partial birth abortion ban sentiment 
come up in the military, and something very unusual has 
happened. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes, a directive went out from 
the Pentagon to the military chaplains, telling them that 
they could not participate in the distribution of postcards 
that have been prepared by the Catholic bishops, and there 
is going to be a massive distribution of these postcards at 
Catholic churches throughout the country this weekend, and 
they have been told that in the military churches that they 
cannot distribute these postcards because they suggest that 
this is political, and it is interesting that the people who 
are the top decision makers at the Pentagon are, in fact, 
political appointees.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They are appointed by the President.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They are ultimately appointed 
by the President.  So that raises some real questions.  The 
whole idea of separation of church and state is interesting 
in this discussion, too, because the ACLU and many liberal 
activists are constantly invoking this mantra about church 
and state.

<p>

What the founding fathers meant in that area was 
that the state should stay out of religion, and this seems 
to be a classic example of the state interfering in 
religious expression and in free speech expression, as well.
So we are very disturbed about this action and really feel 
that it has the appearance of being politically motivated 
when, in fact, the postcard campaign is really geared 
towards protecting innocent life, and churches often speak 
out on public policy issues, and to try to gag them in this 
particular case is really a very troubling action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At the grassroots level, there is a 
lot of support for the Defense of Marriage Act and the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, and another issue that has 
brought a lot of attention by average Americans has been the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.  What is the 
status on that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, that has had hearings in 
both the House and Senate and has a good number -- I think 
over 160 co-sponsors in the House.  There is quite a 
coalition amassed against it, largely teachers unions, child 
welfare advocates, and the like.  We believe that they see 
this as really threatening their agenda and their control 
over the agenda, and they argue that this is somehow going 
to protect parents who would abuse their children when, in 
fact, the legislation has specific language in it to make 
clear that it does not provide any protection for child 
abusers.

<p>

The education lobby, the National Education 
Association and some of the other school boards and parent 
teacher groups, are arguing that this could somehow disrupt 
the day-to-day activities in the classroom, but we feel that 
is a red herring, that the National Education Association 
and others have had a history of usurping parents’ rights, 
and they want to continue business as usual.

<p>

So this is the type of issue where there is a good 
deal of public support, very strong support, for the 
principle that parents' rights should take precedence over 
the state.  Now certainly there are instances where parents 
neglect their responsibilities, and then someone has to step 
in on behalf of the children, but in those cases where 
parents are exercising their responsibility, the state 
should not be interfering with the day-to-day guidance that 
parents are trying to give their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In an election year, one of the 
topics that every politician wants to discuss is tax relief, 
and of course, they are always for that.  Yet, despite a lot 
of support, the $500 per child tax credit has not happened.  
Is that going to come up again before the election?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  It may come up in some form.
Of course, it has already passed the Congress and has been 
vetoed by the President.  There has been some discussion of 
linking it with welfare and Medicaid reform, although that 
is starting to look less likely.  They might just do welfare 
by itself or Medicaid by itself.

<p>

Our concern is if they do not put it in a package 
that they are not going to have the savings in terms of how 
they calculate the budget numbers to get the $500 per child 
tax credit done, but there is still talk about them perhaps 
doing it as a freestanding bill, but the President has this 
situation where he does not like the Medicaid reform, and he 
would argue, I think, that if they do not get both of them 
done, well, we do not have the savings.  So I think it is 
something of a Catch-22 situation that is in front of us on 
that unfortunately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  In all the issues that the grassroots has really been 
tracking, how would you order them for their importance in this cycle?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I think the partial birth 
abortion issue really shows people how far we have come in 
the extreme abortion policy in this country.  I think many 
people have had the impression -- and some of the polls bear 
this out -- that abortion is only legal in the early stages 
of pregnancy for hard case situations, when in fact it is 
allowed virtually at any time for any reason, and to see a 
child going through the birth process, to be four-fifths of 
the way born and then stabbed in the back of the head and 
killed, that shocks people.

<p>

They had no idea that that was going on in this 
country and that that is the nature of the abortion license 
in this country that it has become that extreme.  So I think 
it is very important for people to realize how far this has 
gone, and I think that will shake them up and start to focus 
on what are we going to do about this type of policy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Glad to be here.  Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> begins our discussion of cyberporn.  How can 
we battle the lucrative pornography industry?  Stay tuned to 
hear how our guests answer that crucial question.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  In February, the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996 was signed into law by President Clinton.  Part 
of that act included the Communications Decency Act, which 
is simply a law that says adults have no right to knowingly 
give pornography to children over computer systems.  Well, 
the ACLU and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit saying 
that this is going to ruin our cherished freedom of free 
speech, and we have this drama played out in a federal court 
in Philadelphia.

<p>

The Supreme Court has said that we do not have to 
have that, that pornography is not a measure of our freedom.  
Rather, it is a sort of low-level type of speech that we 
need to tolerate at some levels, but certainly we do not 
need to have our children tolerate it.  Every time a new 
technology develops, first of all, pornographers rush in and 
exploit that technology, sometimes drive it, and then, 
secondly, the porn defenders come in and say, well, 
pornography law cannot apply in this technology certainly.  
Videos are different than magazines, and certainly 
pornography laws should not apply to videos.  That is what 
we heard in the early 1980s.

<p>

Well, that argument failed, and we have seen that 
with television, telephone, cable, and now we are seeing it 
with the computer and with the Internet.  So I believe that 
the challenges that are going on across the country are just 
the same challenges we have always seen and that our side 
will be successful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Although success seems thwarted due 
to some Pennsylvania judges, our guests tonight continue 
their fight.  I would like to introduce Colby May, who is 
senior counsel in the Office of Governmental Affairs for the 
American Center for Law and Justice.  I would also like to 
welcome Bruce Taylor, who is president and chief counsel of 
the National Law Center for Children and Families.  Also 
with us is Cathy Cleaver, who is Director of Legal Studies 
for the Family Research Council and a frequent guest.
Welcome to all of you.

<p>

Let me start with a question that we asked right 
at the bump.  What can people do to protect their children 
from pornography on the Internet, given some of the recent 
court rulings?  Is there any help from government, or is it 
going to be kind of a go fish world where you have to get 
your own kind of technology?

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, at this point in time, it is kind 
of a go fish world.  I think this court relied very much on 
the idea that there were computer programs, software 
programs, available to protect or empower parents, and based 
upon that, they believe that that is the appropriate remedy, 
at least at this level.  Now, of course, I think you will 
find everybody here today probably disagrees with that and 
believes that certainly this ought to be appealed and is 
being appealed and ought to be reversed, but right now it is 
parents go out, get familiar with what programs are 
available, Surf Watch, et cetera, to protect your children, 
because right now the government is not going to step in and 
do that.

<p>

One of the things that they said in the case was 
that if industry had to help protect children from 
pornography that it would be a terrible barrier to overcome 
and an impossible barrier to overcome, and Cathy, you were 
writing about that recently.  Is this a barrier, a 
technological barrier, that the industry could not achieve, 
protecting children from pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Not at all.  We know that there is 
simply a lack of will on the part of the industry, not a 
lack of ability, in coming up with ways to screen people, to 
decide whether they are an adult or a child, before you let 
them into a pornographic site.  We think that that will 
become increasingly clear as time passes that there are ways 
to protect consumers in cyberspace, there are new ways to 
protect amateur musicians who want to share their songs but 
not have their copyrights violated.  There ought to be a way 
with all this technology to put barriers up to protect 
children, and we believe there is a way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What kind of things would happen?  I 
have heard things like photocopy your driver's license and 
mail it in for some kind of password so that you could prove 
your age.  What kind of barriers could be put up?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Well, the CDA, the law passed by 
Congress, anticipated that the industry could come up with a 
lot of different ways, that even users could come up with 
ways to protect themselves.  The law specifically allows for 
taking credit cards or adult PIN numbers.  But beyond that, 
there are a lot of new technologies being developed like 
digital IDs and smart cards.

<p>

There are protocols being written for the next 
generation of the Internet operating system that could 
include a code that says you are an adult, or I am an A and 
my kid is a C.  So anytime anyone showed up electronically 
at a Web page or at an Internet site, they would 
automatically be known to that site as an adult or a child, 
and pictures that are inappropriate for children could be 
blocked, and adults could get right in.

<p>

So there are a lot of ways that technically they 
could do it with just a tweaking of the program, and that is 
what the CDA gave immunity for the industry to develop, and 
the industry said we want to be good Samaritans; give us the 
immunity to help parents and help children, and Congress 
gave it to them.

<p>

Now they are challenging the law because they say 
they do not want to go through that extra -- although we 
think the industry is going to fight among themselves to 
come up with certain kinds of technological abilities to 
comply with this, so whether the industry likes it or not, 
somebody is going to develop a way to comply with the CDA, 
and when they do, they are going to get rich, and that is 
going to be the incentive to do it, whether America Online 
or Prodigy and CompuServe like it or not, and it is going to 
be easy to comply with the CDA, and then I think the courts 
will like the law.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  The important thing right now, 
though, is there is nothing in place.  Parents have to fend 
for themselves, and interestingly, shockingly, in 
Philadelphia the leading software blocking system admitted 
in court -- this is Surf Watch -- that they miss 800 
pornographic sites per month.  Those are 800 adult 
bookstores on-line that your child can get into without any 
barrier whatsoever, and that is with a protective software 
device.  So parents, we cannot overemphasize how important 
it is for parents to either decide not to let their children 
on this new great technology, which is an awfully high price 
to pay for pornography.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And as you know, Kristi, the whole 
purpose of the lawsuit by the ACLU and the American Library 
Association and some of the big companies was to not have 
any obligations that they would have to fight about free 
speech.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is a really good point, because 
they are saying it is too much money.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  It is self-interest.  It is too much 
problem.  But they did offer to the court, they said, you do 
not need to have a law, because we have all these software 
programs.  They offered the court Surf Watch, which they 
just started developing last year.  They dug it out of the 
dustbin.  It did not work when they played it for Congress.
It failed when they tried it in the court in Philadelphia.
It failed in New York.  It is the worst of the programs.
The second generations, we hope, are going to be better. As 
Colby mentioned, these software screening things and the Net 
Nannies and the Cyberpatrol and Rated PG and Library Safe 
and some of the newer generations are much more --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Much more effective.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Yes, they are going to be more 
effective, but parents are still at the mercy of somebody 
else who has found this pornography or who can block your 
kid, but that does not keep from finding it next door or at 
the school or at the library where they do not put these 
blocks on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Or at another child's home whose parent is unaware.

<p>

MR. MAY:  And what is interesting is that the 
debate, it seems to me, needs to be on the responsibilities 
that people have that want to use this new technology.  We 
as a society and as a people have no problem in putting 
certain restrictions on in terms of responsibilities when 
you use cable systems, broadcast facilities, when you use 
common carriers through your phone lines and the like, and 
the idea that that same sense of balance and responsibility 
cannot apply by virtue of there being something so unique or 
so mysterious about the cyberworld that we cannot apply 
these same kind of restrictions, I find to be utterly 
unsupportable.

<p>

Frankly, I believe the Supreme Court will 
eventually reverse that and correct what this panel has done 
in Philadelphia, because quite honestly, while we all revere 
and love the First Amendment, we all recognize that as a 
people we care about ordered liberty and we care about 
people being responsible for the freedoms that they are 
given, and right now, for the court to have sort of usurped 
its judgment for the collective judgment of Congress and the 
President on this matter, if I were uninitiated to the 
ambiguities and confusions of the law, which unfortunately I 
am not -- I wish I was more innocent of it -- I would be 
wondering what in heaven's name is this court doing and why 
is it that the people cannot have an interest in protecting 
children that goes beyond the parent being responsible to go 
out and buy the software, become educated about how to apply 
it, how to install it, how to use it, and how to then 
monitor it to make sure your child or his friends have not 
gotten around it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a tough thing.  I think for 
people who are watching, they may not understand it.  What 
we are in essence saying is that we are free to pollute our 
cultural environment, and parents have to buy the gas masks.  
You know, we are not surprised about seat belt laws.  We are 
not surprised that there are scrubbers on a coal mine.  We 
are not surprised that the FDA says, oh, by the way, this 
has a poisonous side effect.  But somehow with something 
like pornography, we say let the buyer beware, and parents 
must stand at armed gates.

<p>

There is a lot of weight been placed on parents 
and on the technology, but this is not going to touch on the 
chat room phenomenon, is it?  There are limits to even the 
best of technology, aren't there?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Absolutely, and a key thing that I 
think people should understand about this recent ruling is 
that what this court has said in Philadelphia is that we are 
not even allowed to enact a law that says adults should not 
send pornography by email directly to a specific child.
That is how radical this decision is.  The court says it is 
unconstitutional to even try to do that.  We are sure the 
Supreme Court is going to overturn that portion of this 
court's ruling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To ask you one quick question before 
we go to the break, so things that you could not send the 
child in the mail, you can email?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Correct.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  You can go to jail under any state 
law -- and state laws still apply, too.  I mean, this court 
just struck down parts of a federal statute, but state 
prosecutors can use state harmful to minors laws and state 
obscenity laws, and they should be doing that more often.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the Internet is a haven for pedophiles.

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more after this 
commercial break.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing 
pornography on the Internet, and I am joined by attorneys 
who filed briefs in the most recent cyberporn case out in 
Philadelphia:  Colby May, senior counsel in the Office of 
Governmental Affairs for the American Center for Law and 
Justice, Bruce Taylor, president and chief counsel of the 
National Law Center for Children and Families, and Cathy 
Cleaver, who is director of legal studies for the Family 
Research Council.  Welcome back.

<p>

You all have some impressive titles.  We were 
talking before about the world in which pedophiles now can 
operate on the computer system, and I think that is the 
thing that parents are most concerned about.  I mean, it is 
one thing if you are an adult and you click across something 
and you are offended and you can kill it, but as we were 
saying before, if you are a pedophile, you can email 
pornography to children that you could not mail through what 
email people call snail mail.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That is correct, and what is equally 
disturbing is that, look, we know that pedophiles 
traditionally stalk kids in playgrounds.  Well, we know that 
computers are the child's playground of the 1990s.  That is 
where children play these days increasingly.  So it is a 
really toxic mix to have these playgrounds be a place where 
children are fair game to pedophiles.  It is very 
disturbing.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And it is hard to catch.  I mean, a 
pedophile sitting in his home in Portland, Oregon can hit on 
200 kids a day all over the country, and he can send nude 
pictures of himself or <i>Hustler</i> centerfold, and this court 
said that should be all right.  But Congress said it was a 
crime.  I think the Supreme Court is going to bring that 
crime back.  But it is a tough problem.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You were saying that as sort of a 
stalking on the Internet, and there are articles coming out 
regularly -- 

<p>

MR. MAY:  There have been articles coming out.
Fortunately portions of the law were upheld, and one of the 
portions was the use of computer networks and the like for 
stalking, and that is illegal under the Communications 
Decency Act, but what you have is the enticements and the 
ticklers that go out.

<p>

So as Bruce mentioned, I can send, as long as I do 
not engage in a dialogue with the minor child, I can send 
out material that would be enticing or otherwise interesting 
which I would then intend to be used in some pedophile ring 
or some other certainly illegal venture, and you now have 
given the pedophile or those that would use it for a very 
destructive person a great tool to do what?  To reach 
literally hundreds of children where before, without this 
electronic medium, they certainly would have no ability to 
do that, and the idea that this court believes that we 
cannot require that adults rein in their own impulses and 
own appetites to the point where when you are speaking to 
children and you know you are speaking to children, that you 
do not have indecent conversations, you do not transmit 
pornographic and indecent materials, frankly I do not think 
it is too much to ask, and I think once the American 
families and the voters understand that, they are going to 
realize -- wait just a moment.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Because it is our children we are talking about.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Absolutely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, <i>Saturday Night Live</i> had a 
skit, I do not know if you all saw -- unfortunately my 
husband and I are late night people -- of a dirty old man in 
his underwear emailing in chat rooms.  He would pretend he 
was a little girl or a little boy and would lead a 
conversation in a chat room to a sexual way, and he was 
hanging out in kids' chat rooms, and the nature of the skit 
was these children trying to respond to these dirty 
questions not really understanding, you know, how funny it
was what the kids would say back.

<p>

But would that still -- this would seem to be 
still legal, this sort of interjecting sexual themes if you 
are not intending sex to occur.  Would our children not 
still be vulnerable to these chat room conversations?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Our children now are completely 
vulnerable for any adult who wants to try his best to 
offend, to himself find some sort of sexual gratification by 
scaring or offending innocent children.  Right now, our 
hands are tied according to this Philadelphia court.  We 
must allow that to happen.  We have to stand silent.  Our 
laws have to be silent in front of this.

<p>

Recently, there was an article that talked about 
judges being our robed masters.  There is some telling truth 
to that sort of phrase.  These judges are out of touch if 
they think that is unconstitutional.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Some people look at the 
Communications Decency Act, to kind of take the other side 
for a moment, and say, look, if we start regulating speech, 
you know, today it is speech dealing with sex, tomorrow 
maybe it is speech dealing with our basic liberties, 
although it is hard to believe that Patrick Henry would have 
had a <i>Playboy</i> printing press in his basement.  But do you 
see a slippery slope here if we restrain pornography for our 
other speech freedoms?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  That is one of our favorite 
arguments.  Both of us wrote briefs.  Cathy and I wrote a 
brief for FRC, National Law Center, Enough is Enough, the 
National Coalition for Protection of Children and Families.  
Colby wrote a brief with Jim Henderson for ACLJ.  In both of 
our briefs, we laid out for the court the legal decisions of 
the Supreme Court and the FCC where they said indecency 
applies to that kind of pornography that is sexually 
explicit material -- it has to be sex acts or sex organs -- 
that is patently offensive, that is intended to offend.  It 
has no serious value.  You know, it is the kind of stuff 
that is separated from serious literature and art like you 
find in museums or libraries.  It is not AIDS information.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How is it separated?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Because of the way the courts have 
interpreted that term indecency.  They say if something is 
in Michelangelo's David or Ulysses or some classic work and 
it is not a sexually exploitive type of picture of sex or 
nudity, then it is not indecent, because indecency is not 
all sex and nudity; it is that patently inoffensive kind 
that is inappropriate for children.

<p>

So the court has already said -- and it reaffirmed 
it again last week in the cable decision -- that indecency 
does not apply to serious speech.  It is not AIDS 
information or medical textbooks.  So when the ACLU says, 
oh, this will ban the Venus de Milo, it is a ridiculous 
argument, because the courts have already taken it away.  
Now this panel of judges in Philadelphia bought all of that 
and almost as if they had never read the court decisions, 
and that is why we are more confident that the Supreme Court 
will reverse that, and even though we say, yeah, there are 
some software programs, and yes, parents can kick their kids 
off the Internet, our answer to that is Congress passed this 
law to make the Internet safe for kids and told adults if 
you want to have your own adult pornography, you can limit 
it to other adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You need to set it up and secure it.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And we think that we are going to 
keep fighting with more briefs in the Supreme Court and more 
activities in Congress and in the other courts until we get 
a law that is going to give kids an ability to use the 
Internet just as much as adults, and I think we will 
eventually win it.  It might take us a couple of years, but 
I think we are at least committed to fighting that until we 
get it done.

<p>

MR. MAY:  I would just add that the law here that 
we care about -- we love the First Amendment, we revere the 
First Amendment, we are engaged in a lot of First Amendment 
defense.  We certainly have done it in the pro-life context, 
representing protesters and that sort of thing for many, 
many years.

<p>

But this is a terrible problem which this court 
has just closed its eyes to and refused to realize that you 
are not talking about speech that it is protected to all 
citizens all the time, so the First Amendment implications 
are dramatically reduced.  We all the time define out what 
that is.

<p>

Here we mean -- first, let me say that there is no 
speech that is censored or struck that otherwise is, you 
know, black marker going through.  It simply says that it is 
regulated in that context, and they regulate speech all the 
time.

<p>

So here we are saying to the unique and special 
class of children which we as a people, as a society, care 
and understand need to have special needs and interests, we 
are going to require that adults -- what a surprise -- that 
adults act in responsible ways to make sure that when they 
engage in conversations or transmit material that is 
patently offensive and that the subject of which deals with 
sexual and excretory functions, and you do not direct that 
or engage in that kind of conversation with children.

<p>

That does not seem to me at any rate to be a 
particularly astounding or shocking proposition, and I think 
that is why I would respond to say it is not a slippery 
slope, because the nature of the conversations are not those 
that are automatically free willy-nilly protected to anyone 
and everyone.  Now adults can have it, but you cannot have 
it with children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Just for people to understand, there 
are places where speech is restricted.  I mean, even the 
bill of rights is a balancing of rights.  You cannot vote 
any time you want.  There is a day to vote.  You know, you 
cannot take a loaded weapon into the middle of a hospital 
just because you want to.

<p>

When we come back from the break, let's just talk 
a little bit more about the fact that speech is not the 
untouched right.  Everything is balanced out, and let's talk 
a little bit about where speech is restricted.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear more 
about protecting our children from pornography.  Join us 
after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are talking about 
pornography on the Internet.  I am joined once again by 
three attorneys who are working diligently on this issue:
Colby May, Bruce Taylor, and Cathy Cleaver.

<p>

When we went into the break, we were talking about 
the fact that basically what you are saying with laws that 
deal with pornography, there are appropriate restrictions 
and, in particular, restrictions for our children, but I 
think a lot of people think of free speech and think that 
somehow our speech is unregulated.  Is the idea of keeping 
pornography from our children some new concept, or are there 
any restrictions on speech that people would be aware of?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Well, there are many restrictions on 
speech.  We do not have an absolute right to speak.  We 
cannot rent an X-rated movie to a child.  We cannot sell a 
pornographic magazine to a child.  Those are all 
restrictions on speech.  Then, of course, there are fraud 
and slander laws and laws in favor of the public safety that 
restricts speech, such as yelling "fire" in a crowded 
theater.  We can prohibit that.

<p>

Those are all limits on our First Amendment 
rights, but those are limits we embrace.  We think they are 
reasonable, and we understand we need those restrictions so 
that we know how to live together in a society.  If we allow 
people to exploit children in the name of the First 
Amendment, then that is the beginning of the destruction of 
a civilized society.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Yes, I mean, Bruce, it was interesting
as we went into the break, made the interesting observation
that the slippery slope actually works in the other
direction.  This is not a deterioration or erosion of the
First Amendment protections that we are talking about.  It
is actually flipping it the other way, and the erosion we
see is the protection of certain classes from certain kinds
of inappropriate and, certainly in this case, many cases,
illegal kinds of speech and material being provided to kids.
So we flip it the other way.

<p>

So all of a sudden it will be, well, I can go even
if I am a minor and rent that X-rated video, or I can go buy 
that X-rated book or X-rated magazine even if I am a minor.
That is the slope moving in the other direction, and that
ought to be what we are concerned about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you guys see the schizophrenia in 
the nanny state which is going to make curfews and is going 
to give you all kinds of information on sex and is going to 
tell you a million things, but then it is a restrictive 
atmosphere in government today.  You know, we are going to 
punish parents if the kids screw up, we are going to 
communicate drivers' issues to you -- this is how you drive 
a car -- we are going to communicate voting restrictions, we 
are going to communicate drinking restrictions, but no 
speech restrictions?  I mean, do you guys see any 
strangeness in their attitude on that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I think part of that is from, 
frankly, I think the ACLU has won the public debate on that 
to a large extent.  The ACLU has been able to convince 
enough people that if we touch speech, then our civilization 
will be destroyed, that people are very leery.  I mean, even 
conservatives, Christians, they think, gosh, we cannot touch 
speech.  Then we will not be able to share our faith or 
something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Then why not faith speech, though?
I mean, the same ACLU that says pornography is appropriate 
for children and embraces pedophilia kinds of information 
for children says that prayer in school will destroy 
America.  I mean, I know you have had a lot of experience 
with that, Colby.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, it is one of the freedoms in the 
First Amendment.  The free speech clause, the free press, 
all that sort of thing, they are great champions of and sort 
of this let it all hang out, who cares, sort of thing, but 
when you get to the religion clauses, the establishment and 
the exercise clauses, they have risen the establishment
clause to the point where it just gobbled up free exercise.
So the idea that in public, at least in public, I could go 
out and share my faith and say I believe in Jesus Christ or 
I am a follower of Mohammed or whatever the particular case 
may be, oh-oh, the Republic is at stake; no, you cannot do 
that, that is a real problem, and they refuse to see that 
there are free speech elements to that and that they ought 
to be on the same side in that context as they are out there 
arguing in other contexts on the free speech question.

<p>

But they do not, and it is one of those great 
ironies and one of those great inconsistencies that 
intellectuals everywhere seem to be able to deal with and 
just put in a different pocket and never be concerned about 
and go right on, and that is unfortunately what they have 
done.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR: You know, it is an odd thing that the 
ACLU even a few years ago -- everybody thought that they 
were a bunch of kooks, because they always had such radical 
opinions.  They wanted to legalize child porn and obscenity 
and drugs and guns, and they want to impose sex education 
and certain things on the public and take away the rights of 
parents to teach their kids, and yet they want to defend the 
pornographers.

<p>

What we essentially are doing with Congress and 
the courts is saying let's not change our laws.  The ACLU 
wants to repeal all the obscenity, child porn, harmful to 
minors, indecency laws.  We are saying we have had them for 
100 years.  We have never had nudity and sex on American 
television and radio; they want to put it on.  We have never 
let kids into porno movies or buy <i>Hustler</i> magazines.  They 
want to make that available.  They want to put pornography 
in the libraries.  I mean, they are fighting the revolution 
to change it.

<p>

All we are doing is saying we want to keep the 
laws that we have, and the Congress and the CDA merely 
extended the same protections that kids have in every other 
medium, print, electronic, radio, broadcasting, telephone, 
they just extended that to the Internet and said what you 
cannot sell a kid in a convenience store or you cannot show 
them on a street corner or you cannot beam to him on a 
radio, you cannot put on the Internet.  That is not a 
difference in law.  It is just the same law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bruce, what is the status now of the 
Communications Decency Act?  We had this three-judge panel.
What is going to happen next?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  It is on a fairly fast track.  The 
government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Supreme 
Court.  We kind of skipped the court of appeals.  The 
government will file a brief telling the court about the 
case.  The plaintiff, the ACLU, will file a brief saying 
don't hear this case.  The Supreme Court will, sometime this 
fall, either decide to send the case back down to the trial 
court and tell them, listen, you got this all wrong, start 
over, or they will hear the case and then come out with an 
opinion, and we think they will say the same thing if they 
come out with an opinion.  There is also another challenge 
like this in New York that will probably come out with their 
opinion within the next month or something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  An appeals court?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  No, it is another three-judge federal 
court in New York City that is hearing the same kind of 
challenge Philadelphia did.  I kind of think the New York 
court will come out with a different opinion than 
Philadelphia did.  Philadelphia was pretty radical.  I think 
the New York court will be more careful, and I think that 
between those two cases the Supreme Court will recognize 
that there are some serious issues here and send the cases 
back for them to take another look at it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Just for people to understand one 
more time, what was the most radical thing that came out of 
this three-judge panel, because I am not sure people 
understand.  They understand the Communications Decency Act 
was to apply to the Internet, and in particular, your 
concern was pornography.  What was the most radical thing 
about what the three judges said?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I think we each have our favorite 
worst parts of this opinion.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

The answer is my favorite worst horrible part of 
the opinion is when the judges said that any speech 
regulation on this Internet would ruin it, would destroy the 
Internet.  My response is any speech?  No child pornography 
regulation?  We cannot protect consumers in cyberspace?  You 
know, this is a sacred realm that cannot be touched by law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So I can lie about maybe drug use on 
the Internet.  Yes, you can use lye in your eyes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  So I think that reveals that these 
judges are just off kilter.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  My thing is that we told the court to 
interpret indecency like the FCC and the Supreme Court does 
to apply to unprotected pornographic harmful stuff for kids, 
and the court instead bought the ACLU's argument that 
indecency means museum pieces, works of literature and art, 
AIDS information, and science and medical textbooks, and it 
almost looks so absurd for the court to have the power to 
limit the reach of indecency to the kind of material that 
would not be unconstitutional, and instead in their 
liberalism, they tried to criminalize all the conduct that 
they thought should be the most protected.

<p>

It is almost like -- I don't know what they are 
smoking, but it was an odd decision in that regard, because 
they could have fixed everything they said was broken, and 
yet they broke it even more.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, my own personal favorite was when 
Chief Judge Sloviter[?] said that the Internet was the most 
important development for direct democracy where you could 
have multi-point communications in real-time with multipoint 
other points and have this ongoing discussion, and in 
the reality of the ongoing discussion, we have this 
incredible invigoration of democracy.

<p>

She described this as chaos, and therefore, in 
order to make sure that we preserve the chaos of the 
Internet, we have to make sure that there are no speech 
restrictions.  This is a speech restriction; it is out.  For 
me, I just found that to be absurd, because we talk about 
ordered liberty in this country.  We talk about 
responsibility in the same breath for which you talk about 
freedom, and the idea that it is chaos and that that somehow 
is the spawning ground for American democracy I find to be 
astoundingly silly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A rather narrow reading of history.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary Bauer, President of the Family 
Research Council, made the interesting point after this case 
that if the Internet pollutes itself with pornography and 
all kind of insanity and false speech and 40-year-old men 
masquerading as 5-year-old girls, that eventually, rather 
than being the communications tool it is proclaimed to be, 
it will kill it, because people, families and people who 
might really use it, are going to get out.

<p>

Do you think that that is a realistic assessment?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR: I think that is why Congress passed 
the law, because just like they passed an indecency law 
saying you cannot put indecency on radio and television 60 
years ago to make TV and radio available to every home, and 
we put restrictions to protect kids in videos and magazines 
and everything else so industry can survive and so can kids, 
if the Internet becomes so toxic and unfriendly to children 
that they cannot use it safely, then what is it going to be 
in another 10 years that the next generation that could 
benefit the most will be able to use it the least?

<p>

So Congress was intending to open up the Internet 
to kids to be able to use it, not to close it, and that is 
why if it is only good for pornography -- if pornography is 
essential to the Internet, then it is not worth keeping, but 
if the Internet is good for everything else, then they will 
figure out a way to put pornography in its place so it does 
not ruin the Internet from being a universal communication.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Not to mention the majority of 
citizens in our country, women are a great minority on the 
Internet right now.  I wonder whether that has anything to 
do with the fact that pornography is completely free-wheeling. 
It always depicts women and degrades women, and 
most people on-line now are adult males making over $50,000.
It is somewhat of an elite group.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, isn't it?

<p>

I have to thank my guests.  We are going to have 
to have you all back, especially after the next ruling.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about 
the plight of America's families. Don't go away.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. You may have recognized one of 
tonight's guests from her appearances on nationwide news 
broadcasts.  Tonight, we will bring you a short clip from 
one of her more challenging appearances on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>,
debating ACLU president Nadine Strassen[?]. Let's take a 
look as we bring you some Homefront News.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Look, in 1985, the ACLU said that 
child pornography is a sacred text that ought to be freely 
traded with no restrictions whatsoever.  At least we can say 
for the ACLU that they are consistent.  But what we have 
here is a --

<p>

MS. STRASSEN:  Cathy, I defend your --

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: -- either indecency or harmful to 
minor situation.  Let's look at reality.

<p>

MS. STRASSEN:  I would like to, but you are in a fantasy world.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Laws to protect children have been 
widely -- by liberals and conservatives -- under your 
agenda, Nadine, it is the bully who wins.  We care about 
children and about protecting children from pornography.  We 
are not talking about adults with this legislation.  We are 
talking about protecting children.  There is a wide 
consensus that the government has a role.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the 
break.  Stay with us to hear how you can get more 
information regarding critical issues affecting you and your 
family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you
would like to receive more information about the Family 
Research Council, tonight's guests, or the topics discussed,

<p>

Next week, we will share key information regarding 
the Defense of Marriage Act and some sound reasoning from a 
variety of experts on why marriage should not be destroyed

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight 
on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are presenting some very important facts 
about homosexuality and marriage.  You will hear from 
experts who have examined the ramifications of destroying 
marriage to reshape it with same sex unions.  From 
psychiatrists to educators, Family Research Council brought 
experts together in a briefing on Capitol Hill to present 
their findings to the media and our country's legislators.

<p>

We will also see a clip from the news conference 
where grass roots leaders presented their views on changing 
marriage.  Why is this an issue?  Because aggressive 
homosexual activists have tried to change America through a 
court case now pending before liberal judges in Hawaii.  
That case could come down in August.  If you want to 
understand this radical change, stay tuned.

<p>

But first we bring you Gary Bauer, president of 
the Family Research Council, a long term expert on values 
discussions and a leading conservative political analyst.  
Let's here Gary's opening remarks.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing,  broadcast July 
2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. BAUER:  As the 20th century draws to a close, 
the United States finds itself in the middle of some fairly 
profound debate on a whole host of issues, and I suppose 
that is the way it should be in a democratic republic like 
ours.  The people ought to be debating the most important 
issues of the day.

<p>

We all are aware of the great debate taking place 
on the size of government and how big Washington ought to 
be.  As conservatives, we believe that Washington is too 
large and that bureaucracy is too extensive and it ought to 
be cut back.  There is a great debate taking place on the 
question of taxation, and once again, I think the issue is 
pretty clear.  I believe that the American people, American 
families, American workers, are overtaxed and that 
Washington, D.C. is overfed and needs to tighten its belt.

<p>

We are having a gigantic debate at the end of this 
century on the question of America's role in the world.  We 
were reminded of that again this week when once again flag-draped 
caskets came back from Saudi Arabia.  Whether it is 
Bosnia or Haiti or Somalia or Saudi Arabia, Americans will 
be debating for a long time our proper place in the world, 
where it is we should show the flag, and for what we will 
ask young men and women to pay the ultimate sacrifice.

<p>

These are all important issues.  They are all 
things that in a democratic republic the people must debate.  
But there is also a whole group of issues that are also 
important and profound, and I would argue in many ways even 
more profound than the issues I just mentioned to you.

<p>

They are issues that relate to values and to 
virtue and how it is that free men and women ought to live, 
what the purpose of our liberty is.  A little over 200 years 
ago, our founding fathers meeting in this week of the year 
debated these issues, and to a man they believed, whether 
they were Christian or agnostic or deist, they all believed 
that only a virtuous people could remain free.  There is a 
lot of evidence that in the last 30 years in the United 
States, we are setting out to prove the founding fathers 
wrong.  The culture mocks virtue in many ways.  Many people 
in Washington think that virtue is an outdated concept.

<p>

I am always marveling in events around the world 
how Americans will with great pride begin to chant "we are 
number one."  I have chanted that myself watching Olympic 
events or other events, but the fact of the matter is that 
the United States has become number one in a lot of things 
that ought to bring shame rather than honor.  Whether the 
issue is half of our marriages ending in divorce or a third 
of our children being born out of wedlock or the incredible 
amounts of pornography or child abuse or drug addiction, by 
many, many measurements the United States has moved away 
from virtue, and as a result, I think, is in deep, deep 
trouble.

<p>

One of those issues related to the role of liberty 
and the role of virtue is this issue of marriage and how 
define it.  For over 5,000 years of civilization, marriage 
has been defined as the bringing together of two individuals 
from opposite sexes.  It has always been defined that way in 
civilizations that are influenced by the Judeo-Christian 
value system, and I believe that clearly in America today 
the overwhelming majority of the American people, by most 
polls 80 percent, still understand and believe marriage to 
be the bringing together of a man and a woman.  Yet, we find 
ourselves in 1996 needing to debate this basic idea.  We 
need to debate it because the cultural elite of America 
seems confused about it.  We need to debate it because a few 
unelected judges in Hawaii are in danger of redefining a 
marriage for the whole country.

<p>

I would like to spend my time discussing and 
debating other issues, and I think it is terribly 
distressful that in the latter years of this century we have 
to debate such a basic concept.  But debate it we will.  We 
believe that this issue of how marriage is defined and the 
broader issue of the nature of our liberty and how it should 
be used are the most profound issues facing the United 
States as we go into the next century.

MR. HEKMAN:  We are kind of forced into this 
particular arena, not because this is a choice on our part 
that we have to glom onto this particular issue at this 
time, but because there is a decision in Hawaii, far-off 
Hawaii, of an obscure court there that has the implication 
or the possibility of impacting laws across the states, the 
other 49 states.  So we would suggest to you that without 
one vote being taken in the state of Michigan by the 
legislature, without even a court decision in the state of 
Michigan, that Michigan's laws that have existed since we 
were a state would significantly change in a very 
undemocratic method.  There is no more undemocratic method 
than such as this where an obscure court makes a decision 
significantly impacting the law in the state of Michigan in 
a particularly important area.  Few people deny that the 
definition of what marriage is is incredibly important to a 
culture.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.  In FRC-sponsored Defense of 
Marriage briefing, Dr. Jeffrey Satinover, a psychiatrist and 
author, stated some key findings that have a great impact on 
society's view of homosexuality.  Dr. Satinover is a former 
fellow in psychiatry and child psychiatry at Yale, past 
president of the C.J. Young[?] Foundation, and holds degrees 
from MIT, the University of Texas, and Harvard University.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing follows.]

<p>

DR. SATINOVER:  There is certainly no instance 
anywhere in history, including ancient pagan cultures, where 
the proposition has been put forward that there is a 
reasonable basis for society in anything other than the 
union of a man and a woman for the purpose of establishing 
the family.  Now the fact that that has been historically 
true, of course, speaking as a scientist, does not mean that 
it inevitably must be true.  It is conceivable that we may 
be holding onto dearly cherished opinions for 3,500 years 
which are in fact mistaken, but the burden of proof rests 
with those who would in fact alter traditions such as those.

<p>

Central to this debate is the question of 
homosexuality and what it is, and it has long been known 
among proponents of an activist agenda that it is crucially 
important to alter public opinion and public sentiment on 
the question as to the nature of homosexuality before one 
can successfully make an argument to alter the family 
structure so as to include homosexuality as a reasonable 
part of it.

<p>

Thus, quite some time ago, 15 or 20 years ago, a 
series of studies were done to examine a key point.  Let me 
read you a portion of one of these studies.  To measure the 
relationship between beliefs about the determinance of 
homosexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuals, 745 
respondents in four different societies were queried about 
their beliefs, and the following point emerged.

<p>

Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that 
homosexuals are born that way held significantly more 
positive attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who 
believed that homosexuals choose to be that way and/or learn 
to be that way.  There is a well-known public relations 
effect to be had from making the claim that homosexuality is 
innate, genetic, and -- the key point -- therefore 
unchangeable.

<p>

Now there have been in the last 6 or 7 years a 
series of studies.  There is a broad awareness of three 
different kinds of studies that have been put forth, largely 
by the media, as demonstrating the fact, the supposed fact, 
that homosexuality is innate, genetic, and unchangeable.  
Those studies fall into three categories.  One are brain 
changes.  The other are family or so-called twin studies, 
and the third is the search for chromosomal linkages.  The 
nature of all of these studies that have been done on 
homosexuality demonstrate a biological component to it that 
is intrinsically no different than the kind of biological 
component you would find if you examined basketball players.

<p>

Now here is how that works.  First of all, brain 
changes.  Most people presume that the brain does not 
physically change as a consequence of behavior, and that is 
an old idea.  The truth is the brain changes dramatically as 
a result of behavior.  When this was first put forth as an 
argument against brain changes, studies, the studies that 
were done, a wisecracking commentator made a remark about 
only fundamentalists believing that. 

<p>

However, the editor of <i>Nature</i>, probably the 
world's premier scientific journal, commenting on that 
research himself, said plainly the neural correlates of 
genetically determined gender are plastic structures in the 
hypothalamus and could allow the consequences of sexual 
arousal to be made permanent.

<p>

A clear example of how this happens:  in 
individuals who become blind as adults and then learned 
Braille, the part of the brain governing the right index 
finger became progressively enlarged.  What we do with our 
lives not only changes our character and our personality, it 
will also have an effect in the brain.

<p>

Second, twin studies.  The most widely touted set 
of studies supposedly show that among identical twins there 
is an increased incidence of either both being homosexual or 
both being heterosexual such that it points to a genetic 
determination of homosexuality.  Now, first, I am going to 
read you two paragraphs from the very study that is cited as 
evidence.

<p>

The opening paragraphs:  these studies were 
designed to detect heritable variation, and if it was 
present, to counter the prevalent belief that sexual 
orientation is largely the product of family interactions 
and the social environment.  Now you will notice that this 
is a scientific study being done for a political purpose, 
which of course is not right to begin with.

<p>

Nonetheless, this is what the authors concluded:  
although male and female homosexuality appear to be at least 
somewhat heritable, environment must also be of considerable 
importance in their origins.  Now that paragraph from their 
study is never quoted in public.  In fact, other 
commentators, other scientific commentators, have said very 
clearly -- for example, two authors from Harvard and the <i>MIT 
Technology Review</i>; both are geneticists; one is the head of 
the largest genetics faculty in the country.

<p>

While the authors -- referring to the same study -- while 
the authors interpreted their findings as evidence 
for a genetic basis for homosexuality, we think that the 
data, in fact, provide strong evidence for the influence of 
the environment.  Now there are science writers currently 
going around saying that there is absolutely no argument on 
the point that homosexuality is genetic, and that is flatly 
wrong.  The majority of well-informed behavioral geneticists 
understand that the current research only shows a heritable 
influence, which is not terribly specific, and that most of 
the research actually demonstrates the opposite of what is 
being claimed.

<p>

Now heritable influence is something that I will 
explain very briefly, but before I do, let me also quote you 
from the author of the most widely cited study on 
chromosomal leukogens[?].  This is the study about which 
major news weeklies headed across their cover "Gay Gene," 
and you may have seen another one on a related topic about 
adultery, "Adultery, In Our Genes?"

<p>

When pressed by scientists to explain the 
discrepancy between the way his findings were being reported 
and what his findings actually demonstrated, this author 
said the following:  the relationships among genes and 
environment probably have a somewhat different effect on 
someone in Salt Lake City than if that person were growing 
up in New York City, i.e. liberal Manhattan, conservative 
Utah, difference in outcome as to whether an individual is 
or is not going to be homosexual.  The bottom line of that 
statement is a clear acknowledgment that the social 
environment has a dramatic effect on the incidence of 
homosexuality.  What does it mean for something to have 
genetic influence or genetic linkage or genetic association 
or heritable influence?  It does not mean what most people 
think it means.  Most people do not understand enough about 
behavioral genetics to realize that that phrase means almost 
nothing, and a good behavioral geneticist will tell you that 
heritable variation is a meaningless finding.

<p>

Here is what it means.  If you look at a group of 
basketball players, you will find, first of all, that their 
brains are different than the brains of non-basketball 
players, because those areas of the brain responsible for 
repeated basketball playing will have grown larger.

<p>

Point number two.  If you look at family studies, 
you will see that if one identical twin is a basketball 
player, even if the second twin is raised in another family, 
the second twin is also likely to be a basketball player, 
not because there is a gene for basketball playing, but for 
the simple reason that height and athleticism are factors 
which are inherited and which will make basketball playing 
more likely.  Therefore, if the one is, the other is.  The 
principle here is that heritable variation points only 
toward intermediate traits which themselves need not have 
anything to do with the subject you are studying.  So for 
example, it is quite possible that the intermediate trait, 
which predisposes to homosexuality or intermediate traits, 
would include such things as sensitivity, shyness, a 
tendency to be more interested in the world of the mind.  I 
would not be surprised, in fact, if intelligence itself, to 
the extent that it has a heritable component, correlates in 
the same way with homosexuality.

<p>

I cannot give you evidence to prove that, because 
the political process has prevented the kind of reasonable 
scientific studies that should be done on this subject, 
especially considering how many people struggle with it.

<p>

Change.  There were about 50 years of outcome 
studies on treatment of homosexuality using a variety of 
modalities.  Some of those methods, we have come to believe, 
are inappropriate and should not be used, but the majority 
of methods are simply psychotherapeutic.  They involve 
nothing more than talking and exploring the underlying 
sufferings that help give rise to homosexuality in 
vulnerable individuals.

<p>

Here is an example, just one study, with long-term 
follow-up.  Of 49 patients who were able by a previous 
therapy to control their homosexuality, 63 percent were 
contacted for follow-up.  The average period since the end 
of treatment was 4 years.  Nineteen -- 61 percent -- have 
remained exclusively heterosexual.  There are more details 
of this.

<p>

If you look at outcome studies up until the 
American Psychiatric Association basically killed off the 
field by removing homosexuality from the DSM as a diagnosis, 
you find a consistent result of anywhere from 25 to 75 
percent success rate, with an average rate of success of 
over 50 percent.

<p>

Now I will close by making the following 
observation.  If you look at the heavily funded program 
aimed at changing high risk sexual behavior among at-risk 
homosexual males, you find a long-term success rate just in 
changing the dangerous behaviors which is actually somewhat 
worse than the results for changing sexual orientation 
altogether.  Given that epidemiologists now acknowledge from 
multiple studies around the country that among 20-year-old 
men who identify themselves as gay, 30 percent will either 
be HIV-positive or dead of AIDS by the time they are 30, 
even if a success rate of 10 percent were available, it is 
in my view morally reprehensible that we are not making a 
determined effort to do everything possible to help people 
leave homosexuality who wish to.

MR. MANSFIELD:  Public opinion drives public 
policy, whether it is in Washington, D.C., or in Boise, 
Idaho, or New Jersey.  It does not matter where you are at.  
Public opinion drives public policy.

<p>

In fact, the New Jersey ACLU just this past week 
stated it is a shame that we have some radical heterosexuals 
who are activists who want to create special rights for 
straight people.  We felt in Idaho that if moms and dads who 
attend soccer practices, who put their babies to sleep, who 
wake up every morning and take care of things, that if they 
are radical extremists, then somebody somewhere is out of 
line.

<p>

Now ladies and gentlemen, supporting the 
prohibition of same sex marriage, it is not unkind and it is 
not uncompassionate.  From the heartland of Idaho, it just 
makes sense.

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are presenting 
the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing on Capitol Hill.  
Dr. Hadley Arkes, professor of jurisprudence at American 
institutions at Amherst College and contributing editor to 
major national publications, takes a look at what would 
happen if we changed the definition of marriage in the 
context of the law.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. ARKES:  I want to take a moment to remind the 
press and the public about what it is that created a certain 
urgency for the Defense of Marriage Act.  It was not merely 
the litigation percolating in Hawaii, because that had been 
going on for along time.  Matters had to move along quickly 
because there was an awareness of <i>Romer versus Evans</i>, the 
Colorado case then pending before the Supreme Court.  When I 
testified on May 15, we were expecting that case any day, 
and it turned out it was decided on May 20.  It was quite as 
bad as many of us anticipated it would be.

<p>

The court in that case struck down a 
constitutional amendment in Colorado that refused to treat 
gays and lesbians as a protected or favored class.  We will 
hear, of course, many different accounts of that case, but 
in my own reading, that case will be read by many activists 
among the judges to produce this lesson, that a state may 
not incorporate anywhere in its laws or public policy an 
adverse judgment on homosexuality, and it may not refuse to 
accord to homosexuality the same standing or legitimacy that 
attaches to that sexuality imprinted in our natures.

<p>

With this move, the court may have armed federal 
judges to tie up any legislation in a state that refused to 
honor homosexual marriages.  After all, the argument could 
run that the state refuses to credit this marriage only 
because of the gender or the sexual orientation of the 
couple.  Would this not be then on its face but another 
discrimination directed at gays and lesbians?

<p>

When we look at <i>Romer versus Evans</i> and how that is 
complicating the situation, we do not have to be confined to 
speculation.  We simply follow the precise warning cast up 
by Justice Scalia in his dissenting opinion.  As Scalia 
pointed out, the Association of American Law Schools now 
require all of their members to extract this pledge from law 
firms that are interviewing candidates that the employer 
would be willing hire homosexuals.

<p>

At the same time, the Supreme Court has now 
declared in the <i>Romer</i> case that the people who hold to the 
traditional Jewish and Christian teaching on sexuality are 
fueled by an irrational animus.  Now as far as I know, no 
moral court has managed yet to refute the traditional Jewish 
and Christian teaching on this ancient problem, and yet the 
court has now pronounced that teaching to be vacuous, to be 
connected to no plausible or defensible purpose.

<p>

As Scalia has observed, the court now declares 
serious Christians and Jews to be nothing less than bigots.  
So as we put these strands together, they start pointing in 
this direction.  Is there not an incentive now for law firms 
to gauge whether senior partners or young associates harbor 
views that may put the firm at odds with the regulations 
bearing on the law schools.  While affecting no prejudice, 
mind you, toward people who are serious about their 
religion, the law firms may nevertheless screen out people 
who acknowledge their seriousness as Christians and Jews.

<p>

And the incentives will not emanate simply from 
the conventions of the law schools.  After all, if the 
Supreme Court itself has now declared that a moral objection 
to homosexuality is indefensible, irrational, the 
distillation of an unreasoned prejudice or animus, does the 
court not in fact install the predicate for grievances and 
litigation?

<p>

If the young gay associate is denied standing as a 
partner, could it not be claimed now that the climate in the 
firm was poisoned from the outset or set in a discriminatory 
cast by the presence of senior partners who bore moral 
reservations about homosexuality, and what could be said 
about the law firms could be said even more forcefully about 
the colleges and the universities, and given the litigious 
experience these days in the academy, we can virtually count 
on the fact that grievances will be filed.

<p>

What if a member of an academic department has 
simply done what I have done, given testimony in public or 
published an article staking out a position, reaching a 
moral judgment on some of these questions, on gay marriage?  
Might that supply a prima facic[?] route for a grievance 
later?  Might it not be argued -- in fact, won't it be 
argued that the situation was at least biased or tilted from 
the very outset by the presence of that member of the 
faculty?

<p>

Can we not then expect certain kinds of pressures 
to suggest that his presence during the process of tenure 
would be inappropriate?  Perhaps his presence during the 
hiring process would be inappropriate.  In fact, being 
prudent about these matters, it might be better simply to 
forestall the problem at the root by failing to hire people 
of this kind who generate problems later.  Some of what you 
have here in <i>Romer versus Evans</i> is a rather clean device for 
purging from the professions and the universities those 
people who are overly religious, overly serious about the 
traditional teachings of Judaism and Christianity.  It is a 
very powerful weapon.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  When Missouri found itself in the 
unconscionable position of having to defend marriage in 
response to the situation in Hawaii, the legislators began 
to hear such things as this legislation is unnecessary, or 
come on, guys; we do not need this shameful hate-mongering 
in our state, and as the debate began to rise, the same 
issue began to come up time and again, and we also began to 
hear things like this is not a gay issue, this is not a 
homosexual issue, but this issue is being brought to the 
forefront by this radical right.

<p>

I am here to submit to you today that those two 
components come straight out of the pages or the playbook, 
if you will, from the same sex marriage proponents.  In its 
manual <i>To Have and To Hold</i>, the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force sets forth their legislative agenda, and it reads 
rather simply:  stall the bill, shepherd it into less 
hostile committees, define the bill to the press and 
politicians in terms of benefits or strategy, and they go on 
to say to urge politicians to say the bill is unnecessary or 
that we do not need this shameful hate-mongering in our 
state.

<p>

In addition to that, the other side of the 
argument was that this issue was not being brought up by the 
homosexuals.  In fact, several testified that they were not 
really ready for same-sex marriage, that they had not really 
had a chance to think this out.  In its manual Lambda puts 
forth in the marriage project, it calls the case in Hawaii 
and several other cases, its case.  They go on to say that 
for the last 5 years they have been working on these cases, 
forum shopping for judges, working with law students, 
lawyers, and people across the states to bring this back and 
make it a state by state issue.

<p>

So as we began to look at that in Missouri -- it 
is the old don't tell me show me state -- we began to look 
more and more at some of the things that were occurring 
across the United States, and we were not alone, and as 
people began to step up to podium you began to hear things 
like history proves that no society which has ever redefined 
sexual morality outside of one man one woman marriage has 
ever survived, and we began to look around us and to see 
things in our own culture that led us to believe that the 
culture in Missouri and perhaps the culture in America would 
not fare any better than any prior civilization's.

<p>

So as a result, the Missouri General Assembly 
overwhelmingly passed language in defense of marriage.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We will now hear from Robert 
Knight, FRC's Director of Cultural Studies.  Bob examines 
the legal, social, and cultural ramifications of same sex 
marriage on our society.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Most Americans believe in the 
philosophy of live and let live.  I do not think there is 
any widespread sentiment for persecuting homosexuals in this 
country.  As a matter of fact, they have achieved an 
enormous deal of tolerance.  But what they are trying to do 
now is go beyond that tolerance and to harness the power of 
the law and of corporations increasingly to force 
affirmation of homosexuality on those who disagree with the 
idea that it is healthy and normal and moral.

<p>

If homosexual marriage is legalized -- and I use 
marriage in quotes, because it is a non sequiter; there is 
no such thing as homosexual marriage, marriage being the 
union of a man and a woman -- this would create a situation 
where people who are of devout Christian, Jewish, or Muslim 
beliefs, or if they are atheists who just happen to think 
that marriage ought to be between a man and a woman, find 
themselves outside the law.

<p>

We will have the prospect of business people being 
forced to subsidize homosexual relationships or face legal 
sanction.  We will face the prospect of children being 
taught that homosexuality is normal in school, because how 
could they be taught otherwise if the state sets aside 
status and privileges that make homosexual relationships on 
a par with marriage?  The reason marriage has special 
benefits built in at the legal, cultural, and social levels 
is because it is indispensable to the survival of 
civilization.  No other institution does for civilization 
what marriage does.

<p>

While homosexuals say they only want tolerance, 
they are being dishonest, I believe, about that.  They are 
quite intolerant with anyone who disagrees with them, and if 
you do not think that is true, ask the Boy Scouts of 
America.  They are under legal attack in states where the 
gay rights laws are already on the books, and the Scouts are 
basically being told you abandon the moral traditions that 
you have had for 80 years in raising boys to be men, and you 
have place homosexuals over young boys on camping trips, or 
we will see that you face legal ruin.  We will litigate and 
litigate until you cry uncle.

<p>

Mind you, the Scouts are a private organization, 
and that parents in a free country ought to be able to 
entrust their children to an organization that reflects 
their most deeply held beliefs.  One would think in a free 
country they could do that, but gay activists do not think 
so.  They want to force their agenda right into the Boy 
Scout troops.  That is tyranny.  That is not tolerance.

<p>

Here is an example of where we are headed if the 
gay rights movement is not turned back.  In Hamilton, 
Ontario -- and I got this out of an article by David Fromm 
in a Canadian magazine -- in Hamilton, Ontario, gay 
activists came to the mayor, and they said, look, we want 
you to issue a proclamation to celebrate Gay Pride Week.  
Now Hamilton is a blue collar Catholic town, and the mayor 
has no ax to grind with gays, but he said, look, I don't 
think this would sit well with most of my constituents, and 
I just don't want to do it.

<p>

He was hauled before a Human Rights Commission 
under the gay rights law, and he was fined personally 
$5,000, and the charge was that he was sowing hatred and was 
gay-bashing, merely for not celebrating what most of the 
people in Hamilton considered something immoral.  That is 
where we are headed with gay rights.  That is the real 
agenda.  You celebrate it, you affirm it, or we will bring 
legal sanctions against you.

<p>

Homosexuality has been discouraged in all cultures 
in all eras, because it is destructive.  The truth should 
finally be told about it, but what you read in the media is 
not what the gay lifestyle is all about.  I was in the media 
for 15 years as a reporter and editor, 7 of them at the Los 
Angeles Times, and I can tell you that in those news rooms 
all across America, there is a reluctance to deal with the 
behavior of homosexuality, with scientific studies that 
contradict the major claims of gay activists, particularly 
in the genetic area, and to propagate certain myths that 
move the agenda along.

<p>

In a brief time, I would like to go through some 
of those myths.  The 10 percent myth, that 10 percent of the 
population is homosexual.  That stems from the discredited 
Kinsey studies of the 1940s.  It has not been replicated, 
and there are 30 reliable studies from around the globe 
showing that it is under 3 percent and more probably under 2 
or 1 percent, and yet you still see it used.

<p>

The genetic studies.  Dr. Satinover addressed 
them.  Suffice it to say you can drive a truck through these 
studies.  The twin studies, in particular, for identical 
twins show that if half of them are not gay, then how can it 
possibly be genetic.  If you know what identical twins are, 
it is the exact same genetic material.  These studies, if 
anything, undercut the claim that there is a genetic 
component.

<p>

Gay teen suicide, and you will probably hear more 
about this later from Pete LaBarbara[?], there is this claim 
that one in three teen suicides is gay.  That came out of a 
single report in 1989 by a gay activist named Paul 
Gibson[?].  His report was repudiated by Louis Sullivan, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and it has been 
criticized deeply by experts in the field like David 
Schaeffer[?] of Columbia University, and yet you see it used 
constantly to justify programs in public schools.

<p>

Psychological studies.  In the 1950s, a UCLA 
psychologist named Evelyn Hooker[?] gathered 30 homosexual 
men and 30 heterosexual men and put them through some 
psychological tests.  She was trying to prove -- and she 
told interviewers later -- trying to prove that gays were no 
different from non-gays.  In two of the three tests, the 
gays were picked right out by the independent judge.  They 
sexualized everything in the tests.

<p>

Yet, that is never revealed in the media.  The 
media keeps saying, well, these studies of Evelyn Hooker 
show that gays are no different; they are normal.  That 
study was the major piece of evidence cited in 1973 when the 
American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from 
its list of disorders.  This is bad science, and it has been 
used in a very political way.

<p>

Finally, gay parenting studies.  We hear them all 
the time in the quest for expanded adoption opportunities 
for gays.  If you look at all of these studies, they have 
tiny sample sizes, 8 or 9 people.  Most of the people know 
each other in the other study groups.  The people were 
recruited by gay activist publications, and the studies are 
done by lesbian activists.

<p>

But even with all of that, if you add up the 
children in all these studies, the weight of evidence shows 
that the children are four times as likely to either have a 
homosexual orientation later in life or to experiment with 
homosexuality.  Doesn't that make sense?  Children model 
their behavior after their parents.  Why would we be 
surprised that kids in gay households might try homosexual 
sex?  After all, if mom and mom are doing it, or dad and 
dad, why not the kids?  This is a threat to children.  It is 
a way to lead them into a destructive behavior that will 
diminish their lives.

<p>

The language of gay rights is tolerance.  We just 
keep hearing that word.  We hear diversity also misused.  
But the aim is raw power, to basically criminalize dissent 
on this issue.  If you are identified as an opponent of gay 
rights, you are going to have a rough time.  That is across 
the board in this country now, and it has to stop.  The 
truth should be told about homosexuality, and that is that 
it is changeable; it does not lead to a happy life; there is 
a way out; and more people should know about it.

MS. DEALY:  Society has long recognized that men 
and women are different.  They bring different strengths, 
different perspectives, different ideas, and different 
insights into relationships, and when they are combined as a 
unit, there has the strongest building block for all 
society, but especially for the effects that that has and 
what that brings to children, and even in California, where 
anything goes and there is rare consensus on public policy 
issues, there is overwhelming support for traditional 
marriage.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.  We now bring you the impact 
legalizing same sex unions would have on your children at 
school.  Linda Page, a former school principal, education 
consultant and writer, presents what she has already seen 
take place due to homosexual activism and her prediction on 
what that would look like nationally.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MS. PAGE:  As we look at what the education scene 
is about, without being denigrating or without in any way 
diminishing the role of dedicated caring teachers, we see 
that we have folks that jump on bandwagons right and left.  
We see a culture in education that is driven by whatever the 
latest thing is.  That comes from the fact that teachers are 
the kind of people who want to make a difference with 
students.  They go into education because they want to 
prepare them to have better lives.  So they are always 
looking for better ways of doing things, and they are always 
looking for more effective things that will work.

<p>

Why do we have these people who find themselves in 
situations that really actually bring harm to students?  We 
have state and federal mandates that educators are bound to 
fulfill.  We have local mandates that educators are bound to 
fulfill.  Take, for example, the Rainbow Curriculum in New 
York City a few years ago.  That caused a major public 
outcry, because we had activists there who wanted to make 
certain that every child had positive self-esteem regardless 
of the kind of family they came from.  That relates very, 
very specifically to same sex marriage.

<p>

I brought a copy of one of the books that I would 
like to share a few pages with you from.  This book is 
called "Heather Has Two Mommies," and this is the kind of 
thing as we move toward a bandwagon which would ensue if we 
have federal mandates or state mandates that would result 
from same sex marriage being legalized and having the force 
of law behind it.  This is the kind of thing that we could 
expect in our primary children's classrooms.

<p>

This is Heather.  She lives in a little house with 
a big apple tree in the front yard and lots of tall grass in 
the back yard.  Heather's favorite number is two.  She has 
two arms, two legs, two eyes, two ears, two hands, and two 
feet.  Heather has two pets, a ginger colored cat named 
Ginger Snap and a big black dog named Midnight.

<p>

Heather also has two mommies, Mama Jane and Mama 
Kate.  A long, long time ago before Heather was born, Mama 
Jane and Mama Kate were very good friends, only they weren't 
mommies then; they were just Jane and Kate.  Kate lived on 
one side of town with Midnight, and Jane lived on the other 
side of town with Ginger Snap.

<p>

After they were friends for a long, long time, 
Kate and Jane realized that they were very much in love with 
each other.  They decided they wanted to live together and 
be a family together.  So Jane and Kate and Midnight and 
Ginger Snap all moved into the little house with the big 
apple tree in the front yard and the tall grass in the back 
yard, and they were all very happy, except for one thing.

<p>

Kate and Jane wanted to have a baby.

<p>

I am not going to finish reading this, but this is 
the kind of book that we could expect in our classrooms for 
primary readers if we have same sex marriage legalized.  
What we can expect overall if this situation takes place is 
a complete overhaul of curricula in general, staff 
development programs, teacher training programs, textbooks.  
We can expect an erosion of parental rights.

<p>

What we will see are kids who have already been 
instilled with values clarifications notions, which says 
that all values are equal, which is a totally ludicrous 
thought when we consider the horrific Saudi Arabian bombing 
last week.  All values are not equal, but our kids will be 
indoctrinated and immersed in a culture and in rhetoric and 
in education curricula which completely changes their view 
of themselves and of the world, and it is absolutely 
essential that we protect our kids who are very, very tender 
and very pliable from this danger.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Same sex marriage is now prohibited in 
the state of Illinois.  It has been signed by the governor.  
The majority vote in the House was 83 in favor of this bill 
prohibiting same sex marriage and 12 against.  In the 
Illinois Senate, 43 to prohibit same sex marriage, and 7 
against.

<p>

Any time we have gotten into debates about welfare 
reform, criminal justice, inevitably these kinds of issues 
look back to what are the causes of some of the problems, 
and it is broken families time and time again.  So the kinds 
of issues that had sensitized our general assembly had 
already been talked about.  Intact families are the best 
place for kids, and to think that all of a sudden we are 
going to destroy this concept of marriage that has been the 
basis of our societal stability for hundreds, probably 
thousands, of years, was outrageous.

<p>

MR. OSTRANDER:  The fact is that each of us and 
each of us in the context of our families live in a cultural 
ecosystem, and this ecosystem, I think, is more fragile than 
we care to note.  The fact is several years ago William 
Bennett did shed some light on it in his index of leading 
cultural indicators, and with that report, what we saw was a 
kind of toxicity in our culture.  What I am referencing is 
the rate of divorce.  I am referencing promiscuity of all 
kinds.  I am referencing spousal abuse, child abuse, 
substance abuse, illegitimacy, poverty, any number of 
things, all of which should be looked at as a toxicity to 
the health and well-being of our families.

<p>

When an ecosystem is threatened to this degree, 
the environmentalist is not content with a redefinition of 
the ecosystem or a redefinition of what we use to measure 
the health of that ecosystem.

<p>

We must not at this time redefine marriage and 
redefine family.  We must, instead, put our efforts to 
strengthening the family, the tried and true, the 
traditional, that which has for generations given us layer 
of leadership after leadership that could move freely in the 
realms of government, in the realms of business, in the 
realms of the spiritual, in all realms.

<p>

We simply cannot allow a small handful of judges 
whose ideas about the family are different, far different, 
from the average American's to dictate to the rest of 
America what the American family is and what it should be 
and what it will be for generations to come.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we continue the presentation of 
our recent FRC-sponsored Defense of Marriage Briefing, which
took place in the Capitol Building before a distinguished
Hill audience.

<p>

This is especially timely because of the House's 
critical vote in which the Defense of Marriage Act passed by 
a vote of 342 to 67.  Now the battle moves to the Senate.
To understand the issues at play, we will show some experts 
who present crucial information regarding the impact 
legalizing same-sex marriage would have on children, their 
development, school curriculum, adoption law, and our places 
of worship.

<p>

You will be introduced to a former homosexual who 
now devotes his life and his ministry to helping those who 
would like to escape the homosexual lifestyle, and we'll 
hear from leaders of grass-roots organizations talking about 
the impact changing marriage would have on the states.

<p>

Tonight's show promises to be an informative one, 
full of exclusive information and facts that the media does 
not usually divulge.

<p>

We will begin with Anthony Falzarano, executive 
director of Transformation Christian Ministry.  Anthony, a 
former homosexual, truly understands the destructiveness the 
lifestyle brings into a person's life.  Let's hear what he 
had to say about his own experience and views on same-sex 
marriage.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
Capitol Hill, July 2, 1996 follows:]

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  My name is Anthony Falzarano.  I 
am the executive director of Transformation Ex-Gay Christian 
Ministries in Washington, D.C.  We are the Washington, D.C., 
affiliate of Exodus International, which is the largest ex-gay 
network in the world.  We have over 120 ministries 
worldwide, and we offer hope to the repentant homosexual 
community.

<p>

We are one of four ex-gay networks in the world, 
and currently there are over 200 ministries to help 
homosexuals who desire to leave the gay lifestyle behind.

<p>

The United States of America has taken a dangerous 
moral nosedive in the last 35 years, and it is time to say 
enough is enough to the enemies of this country that have 
been allowed to infiltrate the halls of Congress with their 
voices of destruction.

<p>

The politically motivated homosexual community in 
this country has stepped over the line.  This movement is 
extremely well funded and well connected.  It has been 
working for the last 30 years like an army of termites, 
secretly eating away the floorboards of moral integrity in 
this country.  It is time to expose the agenda of these gay 
political organizations.

<p>

The gay community shocked us in the 1970s by 
coming out of the closet.  They gained our sympathy in the 
1980s with the horrible pandemic called AIDS.  And they are 
now trying, in the 1990s, to force our acceptance of this 
lifestyle using the legal systems of this country.

<p>

I speak to you today not as an observer of the 
homosexual community but as one of them.  I am a former 
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 
until the time I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle 
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.

<p>

What I didn't realize is that although I didn't 
choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay; that I 
had a choice; that I could change my orientation from gay to 
straight, and that is what Exodus did for me nine years ago. 
I am now happily married and I have two children, and only 
by the grace of God, after having over 400 sexual partners, 
I am HIV negative.

<p>

My healing process was a long and difficult one.
However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay 
networks are currently ministering to over 10,000 former 
homosexuals, and our phones are literally ringing off the 
hooks.  We are growing in leaps and bounds.

<p>

Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that 
initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all 
kinds of bondage and eventually kills us.  I have lost over 
35 of my friends and acquaintances to the disease of AIDS, 
and I don't want to see one more person contract this deadly 
disease.

<p>

The organized gay community in this country is 
telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease, and 
although it is spreading into the heterosexual population in 
this country very quickly, the facts are, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control, that 61 percent of people that 
have AIDS are homosexual men.

<p>

America needs to start helping homosexuals recover 
from sexual brokenness.  Eighty percent of the people that 
come to Transformation have been sexually molested and/or 
raped as children.  Homosexuals are victims.  Homosexuals in 
most instances do not bond with their same-sex parent, and 
we need to start helping homosexuals.  We must love the 
homosexual and hate the sin that they are involved in.

<p>

Putting a stamp of approval on this lifestyle by 
legally recognizing it and even calling it marriage is not 
really helping homosexuals; it is perpetuating a false myth 
of happiness.  Many people believe that if I can marry, then 
all of my problems concerning homosexuality will be over.
That is a myth.

<p>

QUESTION: I have a question for Mr. Falzarano.
What brought about your personal transformation, if you 
don't mind going into that, and a little bit more about the 
transformational ministries and what they do to help the 
homosexual transform?  I am curious about that.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  My past life is very public, so I 
don't mind sharing any detail of it.

<p>

Basically, one of the strong motivations, 
obviously, was my conversion to Christianity.  I began to 
look at the Holy Scriptures and see that Jesus says, if you 
love me, you will refrain from all sexual immorality, and, 
obviously, I was highly promiscuous.  Not all homosexuals 
are, but there were a large amount of my friends that were.

<p>

So I began to look at my personal life and 
realized that I had to clean up my act.  And then I got 
married 12 years ago, thinking that that would cure my 
homosexuality, because there was not help like there is 
today and I had no one to go to, so I thought, well, I would 
do the right thing and get married, and that would surely 
cure my homosexuality.

<p>

One third of the people we help at Transformation 
are married men and women, so we know that marriage does not 
cure homosexuality.  I needed to look within myself, and 
that is what Exodus helped me look at.  I was a victim of 
sexual abuse as a child; I was sexually molested five times 
as a child.

<p>

I had a physically present father but a 
psychologically absent father.  He was there every night.
My parents were married for 50 years.  On the surface it 
looked like a great marriage, and it was a decent marriage, 
but my father was psychologically unavailable to me.  Those 
were some of my root causes.

<p>

So when I came to Exodus, I had to deal with a lot 
of those issues, a lot of anger inside, especially directed 
to my perpetrators.  Forgiveness -- I had to look at my 
father and my mother, look at the reality that with seven 
children they had a full plate and that he did probably the 
best that he was able to do.  So a lot of forgiveness in 
that area.

<p>

I had to stop my physical acting out.  I was 
addicted to masturbation and pornography.  Many homosexuals 
are, male homosexuals.  I had to put aside all of my 
addiction and get some therapy for that to understand why I 
was falling into that kind of behavior.

<p>

And as I began to lay all of that aside in my life 
and deal with those issues, I began to have proper sexual 
attraction to my wife.  I can say now that we have quite a 
successful marriage after 12 years.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, National Press Club, June 24, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. PAULTON: Why are South Dakotans so decisive 
about this issue?  First, they understand that, throughout 
the course of history, marriage has been the foundation of 
society.  It uniquely brings the sexes together to form the 
foundation, the framework for the family.

<p>

In South Dakota we believe that our most precious 
resource is the family.  As Joe mentioned, with all of the 
dysfunctions, the social dysfunctions that we see around us, 
this is no time to toy with the very building block of the 
family.

<p>

Secondly, this is also a state's rights issue.  As 
has been said very well here, this is a decision that should 
be left to the people of each individual state.  The people 
of South Dakota have spoken clearly on this issue, and their 
elected officials have spoken clearly.  That decision should 
rest with each individual state, not with a few people in a 
far-away Hawaii court.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. In the FRC-sponsored Defense 
of Marriage Briefing, Dr. Brenda Destro focused on the 
potential ramifications that same-sex marriage would have 
upon teen sexuality.  Dr. Destro, who served as a social 
work consultant for the U.S. Department of Health and 
Services, shares her experience regarding child sexual 
identity development and the same-sex debate.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing of 
July 2, 1996, continues:]

<p>

DR. DESTRO:  Before I talk about the relationship 
between sex education and homosexuality, I want to just give 
you a little background on sex education, which was 
originally a product of the public health community as a 
method of primary prevention or education to help sexually 
active teens prevent pregnancy, usually using medical 
technology.

<p>

Even though these programs and the evaluation 
studies that have overseen them for the past probably 20 
years have continually shown that sex education has little 
or no impact on teenage pregnancy, it has continued to 
expand in both its approach and its audience and is now 
widely available in public and private schools throughout 
the United States.

<p>

So the sex education programs that many, many, 
many, many teenagers are participating in now happen to be 
the primary mechanism with which most teens learn about 
sexuality, learn about pregnancy, very little about 
marriage, and now homosexuality.

<p>

Those political people who are advancing a 
homosexual rights and the same-sex relationship rights 
agenda actually have very little regard for the 
developmental needs of the preteens and teenagers in our 
society, and it is very evident in these widespread sex 
education curricula which are offered to 10- all the way 
through 18-year-olds in most of the public schools 
throughout our country.  The subject of homosexuality, along 
with other topics, is included in most sex education 
curricula, more as a politically correct thing to do and not 
necessarily balanced with the cognitive, emotional, social, 
and moral needs of the children who participate, and, I 
believe, having harmful results.

<p>

As homosexuality and same-sex relationships are 
further sanctioned, these topics will be given even greater 
recognition and higher profile in sex education curricula, 
and I believe this will result in even more harm.

<p>

I am going to talk about maybe the work of the 
developmental theorists, Pieget(?), Erikson, Kohlberg(?), 
all people whose work is probably the basis of most of what 
is learned in the public education system.  But they believe 
that there are distinct differences in personality and the 
way we think and the way we socialize and even in our 
morality, and that is true among children and even adults of 
different ages.

<p>

The pattern by which each of us goes through these 
stages is an individual and interrelated and interdependent, 
basically a very complex process.  But for most of us, we 
acquire these skills, especially socialization, in a fairly 
sequential manner, and we move from one stage to the next if 
we are able to complete the tasks that are required from the 
previous stage.  If we don't complete those tasks or there 
are certain skills that are absent, it makes learning new 
behaviors or more mature behaviors a little bit harder.

<p>

Before I discuss the issue of homosexuality and 
sex education, let me give you an example of another, 
actually, a less controversial topic in sex education that 
is not consistent, let's say, with the cognitive development 
or the learning needs of preteens and teens, and that is the 
notion of including a decision-making model.

<p>

Many sex education curricula teach decision-making 
to children -- again, this 10- to 18-year-old age -- so that 
they make appropriate decisions regarding their sexual 
behavior.  They learn a model that helps them to identify a 
problem, develop a set of options to solve that problem, 
assess those options, and then eventually make a decision or 
pick one of the options that they consider to be the best.

<p>

Now, my first reaction when I looked at these 
programs -- and, I am sure, any parent's first reaction -- 
is, well, this sounds like a good thing.  You know, getting 
children to make responsible choices sounds like a great 
thing.

<p>

But when you balance that against the actual 
characteristics of these same children, you find that many 
of them are not able to think ahead, they are not able to 
assess risk, and they don't really fully consider the 
feelings of others.  Instead, as is characteristic of most 
preteens and teenagers, they are self-centered, they are 
idealistic, they are very present-oriented and impulsive.  
And the result is that these children may be able to 
memorize a decision-making model, but they are not likely to 
use it.

<p>

But the problem runs a little bit deeper than just 
using or not using this particular model.  It is a problem 
of adults expecting preteens and teenagers to act like 
adults when they should be acting like teenagers.  And as 
much as none of us like a lot of the behavior of teens, they 
are actually supposed to be self-centered, they are supposed 
to be idealistic, and they are supposed to be very grounded 
in the present.  And these characteristics actually provide 
a kind of protection for them in the process of 
experimenting with new ideas and new behaviors.

<p>

The role of parents and adults or teachers, then, 
is to provide a structure that allows teens to do this 
experimentation, to experiment, but making it consistent 
with their capabilities, but also be available to help them 
learn from this experience.

<p>

What is taught in sex education really asks the 
child or the preteenager or teenager to skip an important 
stage of development, to make critical decisions without the 
skills and guidance that are needed.  This expectation can 
and does lure many preteens and teens into high-risk 
situations that are really beyond their current 
capabilities.  Some of those risks can include pregnancy and 
now even AIDS.

<p>

Now let's turn to the topic to the homosexuality, 
which is usually addressed in a very similar manner, just 
presented, put forth out there to the same age group of 
children.  The homosexuality and, to a lesser degree now, 
same-sex relationships are actually commonly found in sex 
education curricula as a result of this growing debate about 
homosexuality.

<p>

But as that is being taught, these preteens and 
teens are entering a phase in their psychosocial development 
where it is very characteristic for these young girls to 
have a very close girlfriend or these boys to have a very 
close boyfriend.  And that is very normal.  That again is a 
stage.  That is an important developmental stage, which I 
will explain in a minute is a building block in terms of 
learning emotional intimacy and closeness.  But in these 
curriculums there is absolutely no distinction made between 
these two, I will say, events -- homosexuality and this 
normal stage of development.

<p>

All of us as children learn emotional intimacy and 
closeness starting in the family, and as we bond with 
mothers and fathers and siblings, et cetera, but as we reach 
puberty, we go outside the family and we develop these 
bonds, first with friends of our own sex; then we sort of 
move into sort of group situations with the same sex and 
then the opposite sex; and eventually, we develop a healthy 
level of intimacy that becomes an important element in 
developing romantic relationships and sexual relationships 
in marriage.

<p>

Now, if they skip a stage or experience a crisis 
in a stage, the negative aspects of that stage will 
predominate, making it difficult for them to handle the 
tasks of the next stage.

<p>

So now, what happens to preteens and teens who 
receive information about homosexuality and same-sex 
marriages at the same time they are going through this 
normal bonding with friends of the same sex, say around the 
ages of 11 to 14?  Well, what generally happens is probably 
not much harm for children who have a large support system, 
a good family and friends, and are kind of on track 
developmentally.

<p>

But for those children who are experiencing, who 
don't have a good family support, have not done well 
developmentally, either emotionally, cognitively, or 
whatever, they are more likely to be confused or seek out 
help to resolve the confusion between these two events.  
Now, that confusion can turn into fear, and that may be a 
fear that I am, indeed, a homosexual, when they are not.

<p>

Unfortunately, I have found as a social worker 
that there are very many well-meaning but misguided 
counselors out there who would actually try to engage this 
child as young as maybe 11 or 12 years old in considering 
whether they are indeed homosexual or not, engage them in 
that kind of conversation, when they are not experiencing 
any kind of sexual maturity whatsoever.

<p>

So as this debate continues about homosexuality 
and same-sex marriages and it gains more legitimacy, I 
foresee that these topics again will just gain greater 
visibility in sex education; and if it is not presented in 
the best interest of the child but rather in the best 
interest of the homosexual rights movement, there is 
potential for great harm to these children.

<p>

MR. HEATH:  -- and the Christian Civic League of 
Maine is not proud to stand here in support of the Defense 
of Marriage Act because we wish that it were not necessary. 
But it is.  It is necessary because our Nation and our 
State, the State of Maine, is considering a radical cultural 
redefinition of marriage, and it is the obligation of all 
Christians in this Nation and in our State of Maine to stand 
publicly and to say, "This is not healthy, this is not a 
good, this is not an appropriate course upon which to 
embark."

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are presenting 
the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing.

<p>

Peter LaBarbera, executive director of Accuracy in 
Academia, talks about how the homosexual activist community 
has impacted the way schools teach our children, and he 
looks at how a pro-homosexual viewpoint is advanced.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing, Capitol Hill, 
July 2, 1996, continues:]

<p>

MR. LaBARBERA:  With all the discussion about gay 
marriage in the headlines, what is really an interesting 
thing that has been transpiring across the country is the 
rush to push pro-gay measures in the schools.  It is moving 
so far and fast that I really don't think the average parent 
with children in the schools is aware of what is going on.

<p>

Ironically, just as we are meeting here right now, 
the National Education Association is meeting across town, 
and one of the things they will be debating is reversing 
Resolution B-9, which called for the celebration of Gay and 
Lesbian History Month.  Inside word from the NEA is that 
they will repudiate B-9 because it created such a stir 
across the country when parents found out that the Education 
Association was calling for this, but it will be replaced by 
another resolution which calls for increased tolerance and 
respect for gays and lesbians.  And so we are kind of seeing 
a watered-down version of the same thing, which is the 
imposition of one moral view on homosexuality in the name of 
tolerance.

<p>

I think that what people don't realize is that the 
guy activists have a big advantage over the pro-family 
movement when it comes to education and other issues.  They 
are promoting one single, radical goal, which is the 
promotion of homosexuality, while parents and others and 
just generally even conservatives are fighting a 
multiplicity of goals, and I think studies have shown that 
when you are pushing one thing, you are concentrating 
heavily on one thing, almost like a religion, it is easier 
to push that through.  And that is what we are seeing.

<p>

There is an organization that I just learned about 
a few months ago called GLISTN.  That is the acronym.  It is 
the Gay and Lesbian and Straight Teachers Network, which 
already has, by its own claims, over 3,000 members.  The 
entire purpose of GLISTN is to campaign against homophobia 
in schools and defend openly homosexual teachers in the 
classroom.

<p>

So I think it is something that is going on.  It 
is happening rapidly, and there are a lot of suppositions 
that are being made that our parents are not aware of, and 
that is the supposition that there is such a thing as a gay 
kid, gay youth.  There's a certain percentage out there of 
kids who are gay, and now they are actually using the terms, 
also, "lesbian," "bisexual," and "transgendered."  They are 
talking about gay and lesbian and transgendered youth as if 
this is a natural identity to these kids, and they are just 
assuming it to be true.

<p>

There has been no societal debate on this.  I 
don't think there has probably been much of a debate in 
educational circles about gay identity.  And yet, all over 
the country, kids are being confirmed in homosexuality.  The 
gay activists and their allies are assuming the existence of 
gay identity, and then they are saying, "Look, we have to go 
out and we have to find these kids and we have to support 
them in the midst of this homophobic society."  You actually 
see more and more focus on eradicating homophobia at even 
the K-6 level, and there is even a call, I think by a gay 
activist group called GLAD, there has been a call to use 
children's television, PBS, to eradicate homophobia.

<p>

And so we are seeing it go earlier and earlier, 
and it is all based on this supposition of born gay.  If 
they are born gay and it's fixed, you can't change it.  
Well, then, get out there and find them and support them in 
this homophobic society.

<p>

I think that what we have to realize is that so 
much of the homosexual activist agenda is based on this 
victim concept, in this whole huge field now of promoting a 
pro-gay, a gay-affirming message in the schools.  We have 
the Gay History Month which is being debated by the NEA.  
Frequently you will have somebody like Eleanor Roosevelt, 
where there are claims on one side that she was a lesbian, 
but the students are given her name, Eleanor Roosevelt, 
without any corresponding getting the information on the 
other side.  There is a debate over this.  There are two 
sides to this debate.  And so they are told somebody like 
Eleanor Roosevelt was a homosexual; they are just told that 
as a fact. 

<p>

In the more extreme cases, they are told that 
people like St. Paul and Florence Nightingale were 
homosexual as well, as this is stated as fact.  And so this 
is highly politicized history that the students are getting.

<p>

Another strategy -- this is really promoted 
heavily by GLISTN -- is the creation of gay-straight youth 
alliances in high school.  These frequently become the 
conduits of pro-homosexual politicking and propagandizing 
within the schools.

<p>

In Massachusetts, these gay-straight alliances are 
actually getting state funding.  An incredible development 
has happened in Massachusetts.  Although there is a 
Republican governor, Governor William Weld, he is also the 
most pro-gay governor in the Nation.  He has instituted 
something called the Commission on Gay Youth, which is 
promoting this victimization strategy to the point where 
they are funding these gay-straight alliances in the 
schools.

<p>

In one instance, in Dedham High School in 
Massachusetts, a gay-straight alliance got $2,000 and they 
ended up creating -- without parents knowing anything about 
it, they created a questionnaire which was passed out to all 
students in their home rooms.  One of the questions on the 
questionnaire was, "Do you feel lesbian or gay people should 
be allowed to marry?"  So we are seeing the politicization 
through the students, and of course, students like to rebel 
and they like to do things that their parents don't like, so 
it is a natural for even the talented students to go along 
with these gay-straight alliances.

<p>

Another thing that they are doing is they are 
affirming the right of openly homosexual teachers to proudly 
affirm their identity in class.  The National Educational 
Association again has defended this very much, and we will 
see more and more of this, the right of teachers to be 
openly homosexual in the classroom.  There was actually a 
teacher who declared her classroom a safe zone for gay 
students.

<p>

And lastly, again, we see the new effort now -- 
there are whole videos out within the gay activist movement 
to combat homophobia in K-6.  So they are going all the way 
down to the preschool level to start teaching about 
homosexuality.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, June 24, 1995, continues:]

<p>

MR. BARBEE:  There is just a plethora of economic
impacts that haven't been talked about hardly at all. For
example, within just federal law, within the law and the
regulations, there are over 800 sections that refer to
marriage.  With the word "spouse," there are over 3,100
references to the word "spouse" within federal law.

<p>

Now, within the beltway mentality, that tends to 
be thinking that that is all of it.  It's not all of it.
There are 50 other states that also have laws and
regulations and local governments that have ordinances that 
state and have to do with the rights that proceed from the 
definition of marriage and family and the word "spouse."

<p>

These would all be set in disarray.  Can you 
imagine the number of court cases, lawsuits, that would 
arise out of this, and the impact on businesses all across 
this country?

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We will now hear from Mary 
Beth Style, a social worker who is a former vice president 
of the National Council for Adoption.  Mary Beth's 
experience with the world of adoption is crucial to 
understanding why pairs of women or men do not trump a 
married mom and dad.

<p>

[Segment from July 2, 1996, Defense of Marriage 
Capitol Hill Briefing continues:]

<p>

MS. STYLE:  Whenever I talk about adoption, I like 
to start with reminding people what adoption is all about.  
Adoption is all about children.  It is all about the best 
interests of children and meeting the needs of children, 
creating families for children, replicating the biological 
families that children would have when their own biological 
families cannot or will not raise them.

<p>

As such, we make sure at this point that children 
have a mother and a father, which is why we terminate the 
biological parents' rights.  It is not foster care, it is 
not guardianship where biological parents retain rights and 
a child may have two mothers or two fathers.  It is adoption 
in which you have one set of parents.

<p>

One of the things that we do see is that in the 
states were adoption law occurs, there is a lot of variation 
when you are looking at time frames of when you can sign 
consents, when you can revoke consents, when you can 
overturn an adoption and things like that.  But the one 
thing that everybody is unanimous about is that an adoption 
cannot occur unless it is proven to be in the best interest 
of the child.

<p>

So one of the things that has concerned me about 
people who are trying to reform adoption laws, as they say, 
whether we are talking about gay rights or any other thing, 
is that we stop talking about children all of a sudden and 
we start talking about the rights of parents or of adults 
and the needs of adults that want to adopt, as if we can 
create a right to adopt.

<p>

There is no right to adopt, and I think we need to 
look at that rights language, because if you have a right to 
adopt, then you have a guarantee to adopt, and the state 
would have to guarantee you a child. Now, it is absurd.
It is absurd on its face, and I think we need to remember 
that.

<p>

A judge cannot grant an adoption unless it is 
shown to him that it is in the best interest of the child.
Now, there may be some differences of opinion on what is in 
the best interest of a particular child, but it still has to 
go back to that child.  Placement decisions have to be made 
on the child, and I think we need to keep that in mind.

<p>

Currently, the states do not generally say who can 
and cannot adopt, with a few exceptions where they may have 
that people with a history of abuse or are criminals, 
felons, cannot adopt.  And I am not sure I want to put on 
the books who can and cannot adopt.  Now, we do have two 
states, New Hampshire and Florida, which say that 
homosexuals cannot adopt.

<p>

I think we need to leave that open to the 
practice, because I think you need to look at each 
individual case to determine what is in the best interest of 
the child.  In most states currently -- now, we do have some 
case law that is changing this -- is that a married couple 
or a single person can adopt, but two single persons cannot 
adopt the same child.

<p>

The reason for that -- and I think that that is a 
sound policy -- is that the state believes that in order for 
two adults to parent a child, they have to have a legal 
commitment to each other.  You cannot form a family through 
a child.  The family has to be there and the child comes 
into it.

<p>

And so one of the things that we have seen is that 
the Court of Appeals in New York has just granted a 
homosexual couple and an unmarried heterosexual couple the 
right to adopt, which is a first time that that has 
happened.  Well, it is not the first time it has happened, 
but it is an exception to the rule.

<p>

One of the more celebrated cases we had where we 
had two unmarried people adopting was Woody Allen and Mia 
Farrow, and they had gotten a special exemption from a 
particular court, and we have seen the disaster of that.
Now, obviously, not all will end up like that, but it is 
important to recognize that there is a legal family, a 
committed family there, before a child goes into it.

<p>

We also, I think, don't want to allow people who 
are making placement decisions to be arbitrary in their 
decision making, but I think that we need to look at that as 
far as what is in the best interest of the child.  People 
will argue that a policy by an agency which says that an 
individual over 60 cannot adopt is arbitrary and that that 
should not happen.

<p>

But we have to remember that in adoption, we are 
responsible for the child; we are going to stack the deck 
for the child, so that while we cannot guarantee that a 35-
year-old is not going to get hit by a car, the odds are that 
there is more chance for a 35-year-old to still be around 
for that child to reach the age of maturity than for a 60-
year-old adopting that child.  And so there are some 
policies that can be discriminating in selecting individual 
families that we need to keep in place because, again, there 
is no right to adopt but there is a right for a child to 
have the best opportunity to a family.

<p>

Now, I think as far as the issue of gays and 
lesbians that we have plenty of evidence that children do 
better in a two-parent family which is a mother and a 
father.  There has been a lot of emphasis in the last year 
or so on what happens to kids without fathers.  We haven't 
paid as much attention about what happens to kids without 
mothers, but I think that all of us can understand what that 
would be.

<p>

And it is not a matter of quantity.  It is not a 
matter of two parents, because children that are raised by a 
grandmother and a mother are not doing as well as the kids 
who have a mother and a father.  Kids needs mothers and 
fathers, and I think that as we develop adoption policies, 
we have to keep children in mind rather than being concerned 
about the needs and wants of adults.  Kids don't care about 
being politically correct; they just want a mommy and a 
daddy.

<p>

[Segment from June, 24, 1995, Press Conference continues:]

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  It has been mentioned here today that 
one of the things that we are most concerned with is our 
children.  Everyone always is concerned about the next 
generation that is coming along; what are we going to teach 
our children?  And quite frankly, as this legislation moved 
through North Carolina and we heard from, in both houses in 
the committee meetings, a number of homosexual activists, 
particularly from several lesbians who talked about raising 
children in their families and how some of their children 
were becoming homosexuals and some of their children, a few 
of them, were not, it really did a lot to let legislators 
understand that this is a critical issue; that in fact who 
raises these children is an important part of where we going 
to be down the road.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

We now bring you some intriguing questions from 
those who attended the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
and the answers, not often heard beyond a quick sound bite, 
from the experts who spoke.

<p>

[Segment from July 2, 1996, Defense of Marriage Briefing continues:]

<p>

QUESTION: Dr. Satinover, when you were talking
about the evidence that is there stating what you had (said)
in your opening statement, what do you see as the primary
barrier for getting that evidence to mainstream America?
You mentioned the media.  Is it more than just the media?
And if it is the media, what does it have to gain by
precluding that evidence?

<p>

DR. SATINOVER: I think probably the major reason 
that that evidence doesn't get out there is because of the 
tremendous reservoir of sympathy and good will that most 
Americans harbor for people who are in any kind of trouble 
and who are put upon.

<p>

The truth of the matter is that homosexuality 
afflicts a very small minority of the population.
Obviously, that figure itself has been the subject of some 
dispute.  Probably 3 percent is a good scientific, 
replicable percentage.  And there is no question that 
homosexuals suffer tremendous emotional distress both in 
their early personal lives and also in the way that they are 
frequently treated by others.

<p>

When they began to organize as a group and made a 
plea for sympathy, I think most people felt that, yes, that 
is right, we owe it to them.  And it became very, very
difficult, as the whole picture began to change and
determined efforts were made to paint a portrait of the
scientific evidence that was different than the truth, it
really became very difficult for people to be motivated to
take the time and trouble and argue against it. The
majority of people really didn't care about it. It didn't
affect them, and so why make trouble?

<p>

And the truth is that you can get into a 
considerable amount of difficulty by crossing gay activism, 
especially within the professions.  They have made an 
attempt within the American Psychiatric Association to make 
it an ethical violation for a psychiatrist to help treat a 
homosexual who wishes to change, even if that is what the 
person himself wants.  So a lot of people have been 
basically intimidated into just walking away from it.

<p>

However, it has gone too far, and in my view, the 
real problem that we need to look at is not so much gay 
activism as it is the very, very large number of people who 
wish to leave homosexuality.  The relationship -- there is a 
strong correlation between broken families and the next 
generation's incidence of homosexuality.  We are witnessing 
now the problems that began in this society 20, 30, 40 years 
ago, and there are a tremendous number of people out there 
who need our help, and it absolutely will do no good 
whatsoever for us to say, "This problem doesn't really touch 
me.  I'm just going to deal with it on a political level.
Let 'them' have what they want."  Because that will teach 
the younger rising generation precisely the wrong lesson.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Gay political activists say that 
they are really for exclusions in discrimination concerning 
the churches in America, the temples and churches in 
America.  But if gay marriage is accepted into the civil 
government in America, what would stop the gay political 
activists from coming up now to the church level and saying, 
"Hey, you know, it's accepted in the civil government, and 
unless you accept active homosexuals into the churches, then 
we are going to withdraw your 501(c)(3) status, your tax-exempt 
status"?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, I think that is a very real 
threat.  A lot of the gay activists have said, "Look, we'll 
allow ministers to perform the usual type of wedding and to 
bar homosexual weddings."  I think what they are leaving out 
is, "for now."  Because once you are outside the civil law, 
once the churches' rules are said to be immoral, because the 
law says they are wrong, this situation cannot hold for very 
long.  We have seen other situations in which religious 
exemptions once granted were taken away once the government 
felt there was a compelling interest to do so.

<p>

I can foresee a time when there will be -- if all 
these gay rights laws are in place, and some churches 
perform same-sex weddings -- that the ones that do not will 
be seen as suspect, as churches themselves, and we may find 
ourselves in the situation that the people of the Soviet 
Union were in where these churches might be allowed to 
perform their own ceremonies and have services behind closed 
doors but have no public life at all.  They will be 
outcasts.

<p>

So when you put gay rights into the law, you are 
slowly and surely ghettoizing the churches and saying that 
you're no longer part of the civil code here.  That's very 
dangerous.

<p>

QUESTION: I think it was you that mentioned that 
most gay activists don't really intend to harm the family.
Mr. Knight, you were using words like "tyranny" and "aiming
to achieve raw power."  Is there any way to assess if there 
is an aim or a goal of this body?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  We may disagree.  I think they are 
out to harm the family based on their own statements.
Michelangelo Signorelli(?) is not alone.  Paula 
Edelbrich(?), who is legal director of Lambda Legal Defense 
Fund, which is bringing many of these cases, is not even a 
fan of marriage because she said it isn't radical enough.
"We want to completely, radically alter the institution of 
the family."  And other activists have said so.

<p>

I am not saying that homosexuals feel that way; I 
am saying homosexual activists are aiming at that. A lot of 
homosexuals are sitting on the sidelines just saying, "Leave 
me alone.  I don't want to get involved in this."  That's 
not who I am talking about.  I am talking about the activist 
movement here.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I think it is very important to 
point out that most homosexuals are not activists.  I was in 
that myself for nine years, and many of us were not really 
involved.  The homosexual activists seem to be speaking for 
the majority of homosexuals.  Most homosexuals don't even 
want to be associated with the political movement in this 
country.  I don't think it is more than 5 percent of the 
homosexual population in this country that are connected to 
the gay political movement, and I think that needs to be 
addressed.

<p>

[Segment from June 24, 1995, press conference continues:]

<p>

MR. ZANOTTI:  If we liken marriage to a kite in 
the wind, we could observe that over recent generations the 
string that holds it in the sky has been fraying.  Sometimes 
the kite doesn't look that good up there.  Sometimes it is 
not as shiny and as brilliant as we once thought it was, and 
we wonder how far it can eventually travel, if our culture 
does not deal with this issue today, if we do not pass DOMA, 
if we do not hear the cries from across the Nation, of state 
after state after state, if we permit marriage to be 
redefined according to the proponents of same-sex marriage 
who define it accordingly.  It is best understood as a 
relationship of financial interdependence between two people 
who make a public commitment.  If this happens, we will cut 
the string of marriage forever, and our culture will drift 
off with no control.

<p>

Mark the hour.  It's somewhere around 10:17.  Mark 
the day.  This is the 24th of June.  In 16 years in the 
public policy business, we have taken quite a practice to 
studying history.  If you are a student of history, you will 
have noticed the different dialects, the different 
geography, the different approaches, and it will sound a lot 
like debates that have happened before in this Nation, and I 
would caution you to note this day in history, because this 
is the kind of debate that rents the soul of a nation.  It 
rips the soul of a nation; it tears it.  This is the kind of 
debate that gets out of hand.

<p>

"These are the times that try men's souls," has 
been once before stated in our culture.  Mark the hour and 
mark the day, because this sounds like places our Nation has 
been before, places that have cost huge human sacrifices in 
life.

</ul>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are discussing what once
was the foundation of families and cultures: marriage.

<p>

Unfortunately, the institution of marriage battles 
daily for the esteem it once held, and the reasons for this 
erosion range from the breakdown in values to the laws which 
allow individuals to hastily rid themselves of a difficult 
situation.

<p>

Is it possible to have both love and marriage?
We'll be talking to columnist and author Maggie Gallagher, 
whose most recent book, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>, takes 
a look at why marriage is collapsing and some ways to rebuild 
cherished lifelong relationships.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council.  Gary takes an analytical 
look at the approaching elections and the strategy political 
parties are employing.  It has already been an interesting 
road to election day.

<p>

So let's hear from Gary to see what he foresees 
for the journey ahead as Straight Talk takes you Behind the 
Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

You know, there has been a lot of conversation 
lately by media and political analysts about the way in 
which the Republicans are playing their hand versus the way 
the Democratic Party is playing its hand.

<p>

You've got Bill Clinton with the issue of the week 
and Bob Dole saying, you know, "Look, I'm going to bring my 
strategy out later."  You've got the Democrats on the Hill 
bringing forward new legislation even in the ninth hour of 
the legislative session, and the Republicans sort of trying 
to clean up old business and doing a lot of behind-the-scenes, 
quiet negotiating that we're not hearing about.  Do you think 
this is an effective strategy?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think the Republican Party has 
a problem right now.  I think a lot of folks around the 
country are really hoping that they'll get a little bit more 
aggressive in putting the program out for the American 
people to examine.

<p>

It's kind of ironic, because I think most 
Americans are close or closer to where the Republican Party 
is on these issues, whether it's lowering taxes, smaller 
government, traditional values, or whatever.  The polling 
data is pretty overwhelming.  And so it's sort of ironic 
that the party seems to not be able to find its legs right 
now to be promoting those things.

<p>

I would love to see and hope that Bob Dole, for 
example, will emphasize in the weeks ahead the need for 
massive tax cuts.  The American people want tax cuts.  It 
will get the economy moving strongly, which is what we all 
want.  And yet the issue seems to not exist right now 
because the party hasn't brought it up.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Tax cuts are a great example.  As 
you know, Bill Clinton talked about the middle-class tax 
cut, and one never appeared; and the Republicans, in their 
Contract with America, said, "Look, we're going to go for a 
$500-per-child tax cut," and there's a lot of quiet again 
behind the scenes negotiating.  Maybe it will be on one 
appropriations bill, maybe another.

<p>

And yet Bill Clinton, who has raised taxes, is 
talking a lot about tax cuts; Bob Dole again saying very 
little.  What's the problem here?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Yes, this is really bizarre.  I saw a 
poll the other day that just was unbelievable to me.  It 
asked the question, "Who do you think is most likely to 
lower your taxes?"  And Bob Dole and Bill Clinton were 
basically tied on that question.  Now, this is absurd.  Bill 
Clinton put through one of the most massive tax increases in 
the history of the country right at the beginning of his 
administration.  As you just alluded to, he promised a 
middle-class tax cut which never materialized.

<p>

Senator Dole has advocated tax relief for years.  
And yet to the general public, the two candidates right now 
are indistinguishable.

<p>

I think that kind of a poll ought to be a reminder 
to the Republican National Committee that you cannot assume 
that people out of Washington understand these differences. 
We've got to remind them every day.  And certainly Senator 
Dole and the Republican Party need to remind the American 
people every day that they're the party of lower taxes and 
tax relief.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like Bill Clinton has taken 
a page out of Newt Gingrich's playbook with his issues of 
the week, and Newt had, of course, the Contract with 
America, talking about this is what I'm running on; Bill 
Clinton bringing forward his own agenda items.  Do you find 
some irony there?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, yes, there is a lot of irony 
there. In fact, Senator Dole, I think, suggested the other 
day that maybe Bill Clinton just ought to get a big sign 
that says "Me, too," and then every time Senator Dole takes 
a position, Clinton could stand up and hold up the sign. I 
think the point that Senator Dole was trying to make is that 
the President has been co-opting many of these issues.

<p>

There's an interesting thing here to notice.  The 
issues that the President is going out on are not really 
federal issues.  In the last couple of weeks, we have had 
the President say he is for school uniforms.  We've had them 
introduce a federal initiative on school truancy.  I mean, 
however much one might be happy that the President is saying 
these things, they have almost nothing to do with 
Washington, D.C.

<p>

Truancy, the problem of school truancy, is a 
problem for local school districts.  The decision of whether 
students will wear uniforms to class or not is a decision 
for local school districts to make.

<p>

But the President is very astute.  By taking a 
stand on these positions, he sends a message to voters that, 
culturally, he is traditional, the way they are.  And he 
avoids needing to do anything about these matters because 
they really aren't Washington or Presidential issues.  

<p>

So he gets the advantage of talking about them 
without really having to take any sort of action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It would seem as though the 
Republicans are keeping their powder dry for some future 
date.  Would that be your advice to them?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, my good friend George Bush kept 
his powder dry for what appears in retrospect to have been 
an entire campaign, and unfortunately, instead of getting 
reelected, he ended up losing to Bill Clinton.

<p>

I have never understood what happened during that 
campaign.  George Bush was and is a good and decent man.  He 
had a great program he could have run on, and it just never 
seemed to get explained to the American people.  I hope that 
Bob Dole is not going to make the same mistake this year.

<p>

Bill Clinton is an incredible campaigner.  You've 
got to take your hat off to him.  He really makes his case 
and does it well.  I don't think they should wait till the 
convention.  I don't think they should wait till Labor Day, 
which some advisers are [suggesting].  I think the campaign 
is going on now and that Bob Dole needs to outline his 
vision for the future of the country and how to take the 
American people into the next century.

<p>

You have to say the things you are for, the things 
you believe in, and you've got to do it over and over and 
over again.  It's like telling your wife you love her.  You 
can't say it too many times.  It takes that to get through 
all the din and noise that the American people are subjected 
to.

<p>

So I would urge Bob Dole and the Republican Party 
every day to bring up taxes, to bring up the need for 
smaller government, to bring up the need for a strong 
defense, to bring up traditional values, family issues, and 
to do that right through the campaign, through the summer, 
through the conventions, through the campaign, and begin to 
explain to the American people the differences between that 
party and the party that Bill Clinton heads up, which tends 
to believe in higher taxes, big government, more regulation, 
and so forth.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of Clinton's advisors said that 
the way that you know what America really understands and 
talks about in terms of a campaign is by watching the late 
shows; Jay Leno and David Letterman are an indicator of what 
people understand about politics.  And we've heard a lot 
lately about seances and Hillary Clinton talking with 
Eleanor Roosevelt, and it has been quite a big joke.  And 
yet the Clinton White House struck back very quickly, 
saying, "Look, other people have done it.  Nancy Reagan has 
done it.  Jackie Kennedy talked with Lincoln," something 
that I don't think most people had ever heard before.  Do 
you think that that is an effective way of dealing with it?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know the old saying, the 
best defense is a strong offense.  The Clinton team really 
nailed this down four years ago, again in the Bush campaign.  
They formed a quick-response team whose job it was to 
literally respond within hours of any Republican attack, and 
they did that consistently through the campaign.  If George 
Bush made a point in the morning, by the time the evening 
news played that night, there was a response from James 
Carville and Stephanopoulos and the other wordsmiths around 
the President.

<p>

They are doing the same thing now, and it is very 
effective.  Again, I think my Republican friends could take 
a page out of this handbook and realize that no charge 
against Bob Dole ought to be allowed to linger for days 
without somebody in the party responding to it.  We are 
living in a media age where the attention span is very 
short.  Stories come and go literally within a matter of 
hours, and I think it is very important for the Republicans 
to be just as quick on the response as the Clinton White 
House is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Lately there has been some analysis 
by conservative media critics talking about the incredible 
barrier that a Republican has to overcome in terms of 
getting any kind of positive echo from the media, while a 
Democratic candidate or official really does have a 
resonance with the media on a lot of issues.

<p>

David Fromme(?) from <i>The Weekly Standard</i> said 
lately, "Well, sure, the President gets some negative press. 
But wouldn't anybody if they were accused of womanizing and 
skirt-chasing and bad loan deals and campaign finance 
problems?  I mean, how much do you have to go through before 
you get a couple of bad press stories?"

<p>

But do you think that these character issues are 
going to have a negative effect?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, first, let me address the 
question about the media.  This city is still talking about 
a study that was done earlier in the summer that showed that 
only 4 percent of Washington-based reporters said that they 
were registered Republicans.  Now, are we really to believe 
that that has no impact on the way the news is reported?  It 
has to have an impact.  People are normal human beings.  
Their biases, their prejudices inevitably are going to seep 
into the coverage.  So Republicans and conservatives do have 
a higher bar to jump, and it is something that they are 
going to have to deal with for years into the future.

<p>

The character issue is a troubling one because, as 
you indicated, there are certainly a lot of character 
problems evident in the Clinton Administration.  I was 
talking to Senator Nickles the other day after he had just 
come off the floor of the Senate, where he was attempting to 
summarize in a half-hour, in a floor speech in the Senate, 
those character issues, and he said, "Gary, the half-hour 
was over and I hadn't gotten through half of them."  And he 
could not think of any recent administration, certainly any 
administration in the 20th century, that had this many 
character issues or values-related issues to deal with.

<p>

Will it make a difference on election day?  I 
don't know.  I certainly think character issues and value 
issues can weaken the standing of the President.  But I 
think, at the end of the day, probably, unfortunately, 
Americans go into the voting booth and vote on who they 
think has a vision for the future.  I think they are 
troubled by scandal, they are troubled by somebody that 
might have engaged in inappropriate activities.  But at the 
end of the day, they want to know which candidate is going 
to build an America that is going to be better for them, 
their jobs, their children, their families.

<p>

And so while I would encourage the Republicans to 
keep talking about character, I don't think, when the 
election is over, that that will be a substitute for putting 
forth a coherent vision of how you want to govern the 
country and what you hope for the American people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Democratic Party -- and Bill 
Clinton in particular -- has very much pursued alternative 
media strategies.  They have gone to MTV, they have done the 
late shows, they have looked at where the counterculture is. 
The Republicans, on the whole, have stayed with a more 
traditional approach, doing network television advertising, 
sticking with the weekend news analysis shows, much more 
standard in their approach.

<p>

Do you think that the Republicans would benefit 
from pursuing an alternative media strategy?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think they need to be aware 
that there are obviously a lot more choices now for the 
American people than there used to be in the media, and 
you've got to get beyond just the three major networks.  But 
I wouldn't advise them to do what Clinton did in the early 
years of his Presidency and during the 1992 campaign, where 
he went on MTV and answered questions about what kind of 
underwear he wore and went on stage with Al Gore as the 
blues brothers, and so forth.

<p>

You will notice that in the last couple of years 
you don't see that anymore, that in fact the President tries 
to act Presidential, which is a good thing for a President 
to do.

<p>

I would not try to kowtow to the cultural values 
of MTV.  I would use MTV for regular ads to present the 
Republican message and the conservative message.  But I 
don't think you've got to do the sorts of things that Bill 
Clinton did that I thought were, quite frankly, rather 
embarrassing for a President of the United States.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the day, Gary, what do 
you think will determine who our next President will be?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, this is really a very 
basic issue.  Every public opinion poll shows that America 
is basically a conservative country.  We just saw a study in 
the last couple of weeks where literally 20 issues were 
outlined, and I believe on 17 of the 20 the American people 
came down on the conservative side.

<p>

That being the case, the most conservative 
candidate ought to win the election, and there is absolutely 
no doubt to anyone in this city that Bob Dole is the 
conservative candidate and that Bill Clinton is the liberal 
candidate.  Around the country, however, the public, the 
voter, seems confused about that.

<p>

So I think the election will rise and fall on who 
is able to make the articulate case for conservative values. 
That ought to be Bob Dole, and I hope that he will meet that 
challenge and outline that vision.  If he doesn't do that, 
then I think the American people, out of confusion, may in 
fact reelect the President.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you, Gary, so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
introduce you to a nationally known author, Maggie 
Gallagher, who discusses her book, <i>The Abolition of 
Marriage</i>, and provides key insight into what has caused the 
marriage foundation to crumble.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from the Heritage Foundation's "The Collape of 
Marriage" Panel Discussion held May 15, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. ADAM MEYERSON: The collapse of marriage is 
the number one cause of poverty in this country.  It's the 
number one cause of crime.  It's a major cause of suicide.  
It's a major cause of our educational breakdown.  The 
collapse of marriage also threatens the very future of 
democracy.

<p>

Our republic is based on the self-evident truth 
that all men and women are endowed by our Creator with the 
right to pursue happiness.  Do we have that right if our 
most important institution for providing happiness is 
crumbling before our eyes?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  I really don't believe that we are 
going to be a society characterized by faith, hope, 
optimism, and upward mobility if we live in a society in 
which marriage, as it is rapidly becoming, ceases to be the 
normal way in which we raise children.

<p>

The giving of yourself in a lifelong commitment to 
another human being is the most extraordinary thing most of 
us will ever do.  With the abolition of marriage, that last 
possibility for heroism is being taken from us.

<p>

[End of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We saw a bit of Maggie's insight 
regarding marriage and the struggles men and women face 
today.  But now let's meet the woman of the hour, Maggie 
Gallagher, a syndicated columnist whose most recent book, 
<i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>, has received acclaim in 
publications across the country.

<p>

Maggie, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And I want to hold this up, <i>The 
Abolition of Marriage</i>. We are going to be certainly talking 
about it throughout the hour.

<p>

I think what is interesting to me about it is the 
subtext, "How We Destroy Lasting Love," because I think the 
idea is that Cinderella, throughout all the great women of 
mythological American history, that somehow you find your 
love and you have your love, and then they lived happily 
ever after.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, and it is also about, too 
often, the divorce culture that we live in is portrayed as a 
great good, you know, that we are freer, we are better off, 
we are happier.  And I don't really think so.  I don't think 
that the kind of culture that we are building, that a 
society where your spouse is no longer trustworthy, that we 
can't really count on those marriage bonds for something so 
basic as helping us raise our children, I don't think that 
women, in particular, are freer or better off, and I think 
that we are losing something very precious.  It's a false 
gain.  We're not really more free, but what we are is much 
more anxious, and we have much less faith in the possibility 
of lasting love, and that is what I really wanted to get 
into with this book.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that the culture of 
divorce itself is a self-fulfilling prophecy?  Divorces 
happen, divorce is easy, divorce could happen to me; 
therefore, maybe my marriage isn't good?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  Yes, I do.  I think we're on a 
downward spiral.  I don't think that, by itself, the 
situation will turn around.  You see this in kind of social 
science research that shows that children of divorce are 
both more likely to divorce, themselves, and more likely to 
become unwed parents.  And it is very obvious when you talk 
to these kids why that is true.

<p>

A society which tells people, and tells women in 
particular, that they have a right to be a single parent 
through divorce is going to have a hard time telling the 
next generation that it's important to be married before you 
have children or that a father is a very important part of 
the family, if they didn't have a father as part of their 
family.

<p>

And what everyone experiences, whether they have 
ever divorced or their parents ever divorced or not, is a 
much higher level of anxiety and fear of betrayal.  You 
know, if you do trust your spouse, there's a part of you 
that always ends up wondering, Am I being a fool?  And there 
a lot of people out there telling you that you are a fool if 
you depend on your husband or your wife in any way, because 
the message we're getting is you can't count on anyone, and 
that's not a recipe for a healthy society or a happy person.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think that is a really interesting 
point, being married now almost four years myself.  When my 
husband and I first got married, you would think that people 
would be congratulating you and be very excited about your 
marriage.  And yet I would have to say that the most 
consistent message is, "Now you're going to have problems.  
You think you're happy now.  Give yourself six months, give 
yourself a year."  And since we have made it four years, and 
I would have to say that it has been better every year, I 
guess I don't know when the magic now comes.

<p>

But I was very fascinated by that, about the 
negative way in which everyone encourages you to get married 
and then, on the brink of engagement and married life, tells 
you, "Ah, you're going to have real problems."

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I think probably even more common 
on the part of the watchers, anyway, if not the 
participants, instead of any person's marriage being a kind 
of reaffirmation, this one moment where we watch something 
extraordinary happen -- two people become one -- there is 
this kind of subtext which is always, well, is this going to 
last?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  You know, here we are; we're going 
to give the gifts; we're going to rearrange all our 
relationships.  But is it all going to fall apart or not?

<p>

I do think what you say about happiness, 
everything we know is that marriage is very important for 
people's happiness; that people who don't marry or who are 
divorced as a group are not, by their own accounts, very 
happy people.  They have many more problems, health 
problems, both serious and those that are related to stress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  You know, having a person in your 
life that you can count on, that kind of commitment, which 
is the marriage bond, is very important, and we are made to 
be -- not all of us will marry, but we were really clearly, 
the two sexes were made for each other and made for the kind 
of relationship that marriage contains.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One thing I wanted to ask you, in 
particular, was certainly almost every culture has come from 
a setting in which marriages were arranged, in which 
marriage was not, per se, a romantic adventure, but it had 
the potential to become that, and many people -- actually, 
as a matter of fact, I had an interesting conversation with 
a cabbie on a very long ride not too long ago, telling me 
about how much he loves his wife, whom he met on the day of 
his wedding, and they are from Pakistan.

<p>

What I wanted to ask you was, if you look at that 
historical perspective in which so many marriages have not 
arisen out of romantic candlelight dinners and have a much 
more lasting quality than marriages in America today, why do 
you think, even from our own history -- are these women 
afraid to divorce, or is there something really different 
about marriages in some other cultural contexts?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I think there is a difference.  I 
want to say, first of all, that we should not underestimate 
how unique the Christian/Western tradition is, and in fact, 
the idea of the consent of the bride, the idea of connecting 
love and marriage, is actually quite old in our own culture, 
and certainly for as long as America has existed, people 
have been making what they saw as love matches, even though 
they may not have placed as much attention to some of the 
romantic frou-frou in those days.

<p>

But I do think there is something important to be 
learned from that.  We tend to think that as marriage 
collapses and we get this high divorce rate that the answer 
is just -- some people say, Make marriage harder, and the 
idea is, just look really, really carefully for the exact 
right person.  And the fact that arranged marriages work so 
well is a hint to me that how you love after you are married 
is probably more important to the success of your marriage 
than finding someone whose personality exactly fits yours, 
because the reality is, even if you found that perfect match 
at the moment that you married, life changes and people 
change, and if your marriage is going to last, it has to 
come from some kind of commitment to that whole person.

<p>

And the other thing about that is that our 
mentality is very consumerist.  It is like, who is exactly 
the right person for me?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And for marriage to work, both 
people have to be at least equally and hopefully more 
concerned with how can I be the right person for my spouse; 
how do I love this person well?

<p>

I think that that kind of image of marriage, 
recognition that it is not really about our own internal 
feelings, it is about a real other person that we are 
willing to commit to, to care for and take care of in the 
ways that husbands and wives do, is part of what we need to 
recapture more fully.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think Hollywood certainly 
contributes to that flavor-of-the-month mentality about 
marriage:  Well, I am sure another good wife is coming along 
any moment.

<p>

But I want to talk more about how we love after 
marriage when we come back.  And when we come back, we will 
hear more from Maggie and the reasons why marriage seems to 
be crumbling.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are continuing 
our discussion about marriage and, most importantly, what 
makes a successful marriage, with Maggie Gallagher, author 
of Enemies of Eros(?), and her most recent book, <i>The 
Abolition of Marriage</i>. Welcome back, Maggie.

<p>

We were talking before the break about how people 
do love after marriage, and it seems so many books talk 
about, especially, you know, even bag(?) books for a second, 
because people aren't always as good readers as we wish, but 
you've got Cosmopolitan and El Magazine and everybody 
telling you, if you have sex in this way or you have this 
kind of food or whatever, that you're going to catch the 
right man, but not a lot of conversation about what do you 
do once you have this man.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I am also struck particularly in 
the messages that have been sent to women and what I call 
women's culture, and you are talking about things from Oprah 
and the whole set of daytime shows to People magazine and 
the women's magazines, and for many years they have been 
very, perhaps unconsciously, anti-marriage.

<p>

You look at how many -- go to your supermarket 
sometime and just think about how many covers of People 
magazine in the last -- that you have seen have been about, 
I'm 40, I dumped the geek, I'm free, I'm happy, right?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And the message that you're 
sending women there is that if you haven't dumped the geek 
and you're still staying in a struggling marriage, there 
must be something wrong with you.  Obviously, the first 
thing you need to do to be happy is to get rid of your 
husband.

<p>

I think that there has a little bit of a turn more 
towards marriage as we see how difficult divorced life can 
be for women, particularly women with children, and for men, 
too, for that matter.  But still there has been directed 
particularly at women, I think, a lot of very hostile 
messages.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You know, what is funny about that 
is at Family Research Council I certainly field hundreds of 
media calls sometimes even in a day, and one of the things 
that has come up as there has been sort of a reemergence of 
marriage is, don't I think that the culture of AIDS has 
really encouraged the reemergence of marriage?  Everyone is 
afraid to get a deadly disease, so they're going to make it 
work.

<p>

But, you know, I don't agree, and I am interested 
in your reaction to this.  I think marriage has reemerged 
because so many people recognize that divorce is not the 
easy answer that it has been made to be, that you can be 
very unhappy and realize that that husband or wife wasn't so 
bad.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: You know, I think that AIDS gave 
some well-educated women who perhaps weren't religious an 
acceptable reason to say no, which they were dying for, but 
it isn't the prime impetus.  It is partly the ongoing 
research literature, which now shows very clearly that 
divorce is very harmful for children, on average; that you 
have two to three times the risk of a whole host of things, 
from psychological disorders, education failures, risk of 
becoming a criminal; and that when you follow these kids to 
adult life, they are, on average, less happy.  They are less 
successful and they are less happy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they are very much more 
stressed.  There is a lot of uneasiness.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes, and we have come to this 
theory that you have just a short crisis and then kids 
adjust and it doesn't really matter whether they have both 
of their parents cooperating and raising them together in a 
married family or not.  I mean, that was a lot happy talk 
which has nothing to do with reality.

<p>

I think that the research confirmation, the expert 
opinion, but really, what you are talking about is people's 
experience.  I mean, we all now have been living in this 
culture for 30 years.  Those happy myths about how divorce 
is better for the kids, et cetera, et cetera, if I am happy, 
my kids will be happy -- we know how hard it is when 
marriage breaks up on both the adults and especially on the 
children, and we are looking for answers.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to ask you -- and I 
will throw out some of my own -- what you consider to be 
some of the worst myths about marriage right now.  I think, 
from my perspective with a lot of friends at the beginning 
of their marriages, I think one of the worst myths is that, 
having gotten married, you have finished something, when I 
don't think you have finished anything.  You have begun 
something, and making your marriage is a constant renewal.  
You know, having gotten my job, I am not done.  I am 
actually expected to go and accomplish something.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: There are very few novels that are 
about being married; they are mostly about getting a 
spouse --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, they are.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: -- a husband or a wife, and 
living happily ever after.  Yes, I think there is something 
to that, and it feeds into, again -- the way I think about 
this, Kristi, is marriage basically a creative or productive 
institution or act, or is it a consumption item?  I think it 
is what we produce in life that makes us happy and that it 
is important to recognize that what we're doing when we're 
getting married is building something.  We are making 
something, a relationship with our spouse and a new family 
in most cases; and that in the long run it is our success at 
achieving that, at making that, which is going to make us 
happy, even if we're not happy all the time in the middle of 
that; and that, if we turn around and say, well, "Am I being 
made happy enough to stay married?" what you have done is 
turned your spouse from your principal responsibility, your 
vocation in life, to being just a thing, an object that you 
use up, and if you are not getting what you want, you trade 
them in.

<p>

That is very destructive to love.  It is a habit 
of the heart which is very destructive to both human 
happiness, human virtue, and the ability to love.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How important is marriage to children? 
You see a lot of conversation today in many contexts, 
whether it be homosexual marriage discussions or 
cohabiting people talking, that if you have one or two or 
three loving people, you know, as long as there is love, 
that children are okay.  But how important is marriage to 
children?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: There have been so experiments in 
the last couple of hundred years, really, with alternate 
family forms, and they all end up dissolving at sort of even 
greater rates than marriage, whatever its imperfections.

<p>

Marriage is key.  It's the way we give children fathers. It's 
the way we teach children that the family is important, that 
family relationships can be counted on. Every person -- and 
I know there are tragic situations where a divorce or a 
separation is necessary -- but every time you divorce as a 
parent, one message you are sending your children is that 
family relationships can appear and disappear, you can be 
related and unrelated, and that in some way, then, love is not 
reliable.

<p>

That message, even if your child doesn't become a 
drug user or depressed or a juvenile delinquent and gets 
good grades and goes to a good college, when you talk to 
children of divorce, that comes out very, very powerfully.  
When they go to love, to marry, to form families, they carry 
with them this enormous burden of fear of betrayal, because 
the lesson their life taught them is that love is not 
reliable, and that is a very hard less to teach a child.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would think that the social 
repercussions of that are going to affect us for many years, 
and I would like to ask you a little bit more about that in 
just a moment.

<p>

Please stay tuned for more words of wisdom 
regarding marriage, divorce, and love from Maggie Gallagher 
when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once 
again Maggie Gallagher, who is sharing her research and 
insights from her latest book, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>. 
Welcome back, Maggie.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We were talking before the break 
about people carrying into marriage, children of divorce, 
even if they have managed to successfully complete school, 
this sense of I don't know what is going to last, what ties 
are real.

<p>

I was wondering if you could sort of look at that 
from a societal benefit. We were talking before. At the 
movie <i>Braveheart</i>, I was watching it and was kind of struck 
by the fact that these men and women were bound by their 
clan, by kinship and these blood lines, and because of that, 
they were going to fight and die together; and how, today, 
we have sort of made kinship optional.  Maybe you're 
related, maybe you're not.  I mean, these ties are very 
breakable.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And that is the biggest change, 
really, in the post-marital family, is that you don't have 
one family where everyone has the same ties and the same 
loyalties.  It is like you have certain relationships, your 
children have -- and some of your children may have 
different ones, and the only tie that still remains 
reasonably firm is the tie between mother and child.  Even 
for fathers, 10 years after divorce, two-thirds of fathers 
have virtually no regular contact with their children.

<p>

We are raising children, increasingly, in a world 
where all relationships are temporary and disposable, and it 
is very difficult for children to prosper or really for 
anyone to prosper in a world that is that really emotionally 
chaotic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that that really has 
implications from a national perspective.  There has been a 
lot of talk lately in pro-family circles about a need to 
rebuild a sense of American citizenship or of what does it 
mean to be an American, and yet we are talking there about a 
national consciousness. about a national tie, when what we 
have really communicated through a divorce-prone country is 
that ties are optional.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes.  I don't think, as I said, 
that either the conservative ideal of a limited government 
and a strong nation or the more general American dream of 
upward mobility, each generation better off than the last, I 
don't think it is going to happen unless we begin to deal 
with this.

<p>

Kristi, in just 10 years from now, if current 
trends continue, half of our children will be born outside 
of wedlock.  Half of the remainder will lose their fathers 
through divorce.  That means marriage is going to become, 
almost as a lifelong family-forming union, is going to 
become almost a cult practice, a rare minority.  And I don't 
think we as a nation will survive that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is everyone equally likely to 
divorce?  You know, we see half of all marriages do this, 70 
percent of the population does that, and that is very 
chilling to many.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes. No, it isn't. It is not 
spread uniformly, and there are a lot of different variables 
that affect it.  If you and your husband are both married 
for the first time, you will have a significantly lower 
divorce rate than if one of you has been divorced before.  
People who attend church or synagogue or temple regularly -- 
it actually doesn't seem to matter from the standpoint of 
holding marriages together what your religious denomination 
is -- if you're active in it, you have a lower divorce rate.

<p>

In general, educated and relatively affluent 
people have lower divorce rates than the poor, except for 
one very interesting exception.  Marriages in which both 
partners work full time have much more income, but they are 
also much more divorce prone.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why do you think that is?  Because 
you can't pick up the newspaper today without seeing a rise 
in two-income families.  And, frankly, at the Family 
Research Council we have been concerned about that, not 
because women shouldn't work but because a lot of women work 
to offset the tax burden on the American family.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Oh, sure. I think that it 
reflects a lot of disappointment. I mean, when women get 
married and have babies, it's a lot of work, and one of the 
reasons you undertake that work is because you want to spend 
time with your kids, you want a family life, you want to 
build a family life, and if, instead, you are having to 
spend all of your time working, it makes all of the 
frustrations of family life seem a lot worse to you.

<p>

Basically, I think a lot of women aren't getting 
what they wanted, which may be not necessarily working or 
not working but not being the primary breadwinners for their 
family.

<p>

It also, frankly, partly reflects, Kristi, 
sometimes when couples both become very career-oriented, 
there is not a lot of time left for the marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: They are just two people who are 
both more invested in their careers than their family life, 
and people like that are more prone to divorce.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have actually seen a lot of data 
on that in which people say that the give point is the 
marriage.  I mean, you can look at that statistically.  If 
you have home, husband, children, career, outside activities 
-- outside activities do tend to dissipate, depending on 
whether they are connected to your job -- but that, 
ultimately, it is that primary relationship between husband 
and wife, that is the easiest to put aside and say, "Well, 
we'll spend quality time later.  We obviously need to take 
care of our job and kids."

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Right. Well, those are the not 
optional, I guess.  They won't give you the pay check if you 
don't show up, and kids have a way of making themselves 
felt, so people often feel -- and again, I think it is 
worse, either if you are family-oriented and frustrated in 
that desire, you are going to be more frustrated with your 
spouse in your life and feel like you're not getting what 
you're supposed to be.

<p>

And then there is the opposite: if you are not 
family-oriented, if you primarily get your sense of self-worth 
from your job, you are going to be a prime candidate 
for divorce, anyway, and working doesn't cause it; it just 
reflects that orientation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, that is an interesting point 
that you bring up because, I mean, if you read again 
feminist literature or even your average glamour magazine, 
you are certainly going to get the message as a woman that 
your career -- don't let anything interrupt your career.  
That above all things is sacrosanct.  You know, you can put 
your children in day care and you can get another husband, 
but your career is the center.

<p>

And you are saying that the more connected your 
self-worth is to your career, the higher your possibility of 
divorce?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, I am not saying this is a 
fact.  I mean, it is a fact that two full-time working 
couples are more likely to divorce -- it does not apply, by 
the way, to part-time working wives -- but I mean, I think 
that if you talk to therapists and to couples who have 
divorced, it is an issue that comes up.

<p>

The question in a marriage is, What is first 
priority?  If the answer is your kids, that can cause some 
problems, but they are both of your kids, so that can be an 
acceptable answer.  If the answer is my job is more 
important than you are, your marriage is in trouble.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So you were talking -- one of the 
things I like about your book is, after it sort of outlines 
a very shaky foundation our society rests on because 
marriage is so stressed by kind of a divorce mentality, you 
are saying, Look, there are some answers.  So how can people 
build a lasting love, or what could society do?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, you know, we have to change, 
as I say -- these things did not happen in a vacuum, and we 
have been talking a lot about some of the cultural changes 
and the changes in our ideas of marriage and love and the 
kind of commitment we need to make, and all those are very 
important.

<p>

But something else happened, too, Kristi.  Around 
1970, our government became, for reasons that are difficult 
to fathom, very hostile to marriage as an institution, and 
in a lot of ways, people -- if you go back, there is no one 
saying, "Oh, I want to undermine marriage; I'll do this."  
But a whole series of changes came, passed through our -- 
which have really, I think, been very hostile to marriage.  
They range from, for example, the shift to unilateral no-fault 
divorce.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the laws became a problem.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Which is responsible for -- maybe 
as much as 25 percent of the increase in divorce rates came 
from that change in the laws, which -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I am going to have to hear more 
about this in two seconds.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: After this break, we will bring you 
more interesting revelations regarding marriage and its 
standing in today's society.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are trying to 
understand how our government has had an impact on divorce.

<p>

Maggie, you wrote about this really brilliantly in 
the book, and I certainly want to encourage people to buy 
the book and to read it.  But one of the problems that you 
are uncovering in terms of fixing the divorce problem was 
that some structures had gotten in the way of marriage.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes. The government has been very 
hostile.  You know, what unilateral no-fault did is really 
say we're not going to enforce the marriage contract 
anymore.  We're not going to let you get married.  When you 
get married, what are you doing?  Well, you're promising to 
live with someone until you feel like doing someone else.  
Well, guess what, Kristi?  That is rather like cohabitation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is true.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And one reason why I think 
cohabitation is on the rise is we have reduced marriage from 
a legal standpoint to where it is rather like living 
together with a license.

<p>

But there are a lot of ways government has drained money 
from families that is desperately needed.  Married couples 
are struggling.  They are not having children they want to 
have because they have to pay for subsidies to Amtrak and 
Dole Corporation, and it has been a very low priority, 
protecting family income.  That has had an effect.

<p>

And then we have rewarded in the form of welfare policies 
very destructive behavior, and I am particularly concerned 
with this whole issue of children having children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Then there are other things that people 
don't know about at all, which is, there are federal laws which 
have basically prevented local communities from enforcing 
basic moral standards.  If you, in your school, would like to 
deal with getting pregnant teens out of the classroom and put 
them in a special program and teach them what they need to 
teach and send the message that it is wrong to be 16 and 
having a baby out of wedlock, the reason you cannot do that 
is that the Federal Government has defined that as pregnancy 
discrimination, and you cannot have it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Public housing used to give a 
strong preference to low-income married couple, very 
important support for marriage in the working class, and 
again, that was abolished because the Federal Government 
said that was discrimination on the basis of marital status.

<p>

So there is a lot of work to be done.  There are 
terrible cultural trends.  But a lot of them are, if not 
driven, at least being reinforced by the government, and 
they are frustrating the desire of ordinary Americans to 
have control over their homes, their families, their income, 
and their community life, and that has to change.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, Maggie, 
and I really appreciate your joining us today.  But what one 
or two things can you tell us in this brief amount of time 
about marriage to help people have success in their own 
marriages?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, I guess what we really need 
-- people say we need to be less romantic.  But I don't 
believe that, Kristi.  I think we need to be more 
idealistic.  We need to recover a vision of marriage as 
being really heroic and extraordinary and worth making 
sacrifices for.  We need to say to people who are in the 
middle of troubles in their marriages that we think their 
struggles are valuable, that they are doing something 
important, and that we have faith for them when they don't 
have faith themselves that they can work their problems out 
and that the reward for doing so is worth waiting for, and 
that reward -- we are not trying to punish people; we are 
trying to help couples achieve their objective, which is a 
happy family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is a phenomenal book.  I want to 
hold this up, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>.

<p>

Maggie, thank you so much for being with us, and I 
think you are right, you know, and I have to say for myself, 
marriage is the best thing that I have ever done, and I know 
you feel the same way about your family.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to share 
more information regarding issues affecting you and your 
family.  Stay tuned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are going to discuss so-called 
easy answers to pregnancy, sometimes called the morning 
after pill, emergency contraception, or RU-486.  It all 
sounds like a worry-free procedure when described by the 
activists who are pushing its approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration, but some disturbing facts about the 
complications of those drugs are beginning to come to light.
According to pro-life groups, this two drug abortion method
could lead to severe physical, emotional, psychological, and
legal troubles if it receives FDA approval.  So we will hear
from some experts about the possible complications of this
so-called simple solution.

<p>

But first, a preview of an innovative part of the 
upcoming Republican National Convention.  I spoke with Gus 
Pace, the RNC's Co-Director of Internet Services and FRC's
own Internet expert, Loralei Gilliam, about the
opportunities in Cyberspace for all of those who want to
participate in the convention from their own home. In fact,
FRC president, Gary Bauer, will be available during the 
convention for a cyberchat. Let's here more about this 
exciting opportunity as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the 
Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gus and Loralei,
for being with us today on Behind the Headlines. You all 
are involved in a very exciting and revolutionary new way in 
which people can get involved in the Republican Convention.
You know, for the most part people watching conventions were
very passive, watching it on television, reading about it in 
the newspaper, but the Internet has offered some very 
exciting new opportunities.

<p>

Gus, I know you have been working on that.  Can 
you tell us a little bit more about what is going to happen?

<p>

MR. PACE: Well, I think what we are doing with 
the Internet and what the Republican Party is doing with the 
Internet is very exciting right now.  You know, the term 
there that you used, passive, is a very key term.  Always 
before, our participation in political conventions and in 
political activities and in campaigns has been very passive.
We read what is in the newspaper.  We see what is on 
television, and that is it.

<p>

The Internet, I think, has revolutionized that.
It gives us the ability to actually participate -- two-way 
communication.  You know, you can email the platform 
committee this year for the first time.  You can participate 
in live chats with members of Congress and senators and 
governors and elected officials and delegates at the 
convention.  This is a complete new way for the American 
democracy to become involved in the electoral process like 
we have never seen before.

<p>

You know, in 1962, the debates that were televised 
revolutionized the electoral process.  In 1996, I think this 
is sort of the test drive year for the Internet. I think we 
will see a lot of participation on the Internet. It gives 
us the ability to put all of our information, provide all 
the press releases, provide all the speeches, complete on 
the Internet, and you as an active participant or a person 
wanting to participate in the electoral process, can call 
this up from your local computer.

<p>

It does not matter if you are in a small town or 
in a large city or at a public library or at a friend's
house.  You can call up the home page.  You can read the 
speech for yourself.  You are not reading a two-paragraph 
clip that someone else has put together.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: No middle man.

<p>

MR. PACE: No middle man. So I find that very 
exciting.  I mean, I believe that when our message is out 
there and when people see our message complete that we have 
a good message, and it will sell itself.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Loralei, for those people who are 
watching our program and are not familiar with the Internet, 
how would they find this exciting opportunity and the Family 
Research Council connection?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The best way that I would suggest is 
to participate in FRC's home page.  By accessing our home 
page, we will have what is called a hot link that will link 
our page directly to the convention site.  So that way they 
are able to get FRC's input from the convention, in addition 
to looking at our news releases on what is going on at the 
convention, but at the same time linking to the convention 
site and seeing directly what is going on there.

<p>

The convention site is very innovative in what 
they are able to do with live footage.  You can actually 
click in and see exactly what is going on on the convention 
floor.  From my understanding, this is the first time that 
this has ever happened.  This is going to be real exciting 
for folks to be able to click in and then go into a chat 
room and talk with folks in California, Texas, Missouri, and 
be able to talk about what is going on and see if they are 
in agreement and turn around and use that input and send 
emails to their members or send emails to the platform and 
put their input in on the convention.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gus, I know you have been working 
very long and hard hours developing a lot of things for 
people to enjoy and connect with.  Could you tell us a 
little bit more about what is going to be available?

<p>

MR. PACE: Sure, if I could just follow up a 
little bit with what Loralei said about the Family Research 
Council being a key component, and your home page is a key 
component.  You know, we have designed a very unique 
interactive home page that will exist during the two weeks 
of the convention.  It will be unveiled on the fifth, the 
day the platform discussions take place.  It will be active 
and continue through the entire convention.  The chat rooms 
will all be up and live during the platform.  You will have 
the ability to participate in platform discussions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And there are going to be some news 
makers participating in that.

<p>

MR. PACE: We will have some news makers scheduled 
during the evening to chat live with you, answer your 
questions.  I will give an example of on Tuesday night the 
state of Missouri has organized a Missouri Night on the 
Internet, and as part of their grass roots organization, the 
local clubs are being encouraged to host their own 
convention parties where they invite their friends in.

<p>

You know, everyone does not have Internet access.
I mean, as I mentioned, this is the test drive year.  So 
they are being asked to invite their friends in or go to a 
library or a public place where there is Internet access, 
and they will have the ability to chat with all the Missouri 
elected officials that are at the convention.  They are all 
going to be on-line for an hour-and-a-half, and this is just 
one example.  There are other states that are doing that, 
also.

<p>

I know that your group, for example, several of 
your members may decide that there is one night that they 
want to have friends over and participate in the convention.
This is something that has never happened before.  To get 
groups together before, you called them around the kitchen 
table, you opened up the newspaper, you read the newspaper, 
and then you discussed what was printed in the newspaper.
This gives you the ability to click on one icon on the home 
page and watch the podium live, like you are on your 
television, or if you do not have that software, you can 
click on another icon and get the printed textual update.  
Then if you want to go into a live chat room and ask some 
questions of your elected officials, you have the ability to 
do that all at one time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, Gus, to ask a quick question, 
Gus, are you all working with the Internet site going to be 
monitoring the input and the email to pass along to Haley 
Barbour and the GOP leaders what people are saying?

<p>

MR. PACE: Yes, we will.  We will have a 
continuous content update.  As quick as a speech is given 
from the floor, it will be updated to the home page.  There 
are a couple of really neat things.  Haley will be calling 
in and providing an audio update to the RNC home page about 
once an hour, just sort of a this is what is taking place.  
The week of the platforms, all official platform positions 
will be updated immediately.

<p>

So people will have the access to that 
information.  They can read the complete platform.  They can 
read the complete speech that was given.  They will know who 
is on the platform talking right then.  You are not relying 
on a news anchor or someone else sort of to give you a 
synopsis of what is taking place.  You get the complete 
picture as it is occurring, or you can go back and see what 
was said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A wonderful opportunity like this 
that has opened two-way communication is, of course, going 
to open the GOP up in the convention to hearing some 
critical voices and some people who have different kinds of 
opinions.  How are you guys prepared to deal with that kind 
of feedback?

<p>

MR. PACE: Well, you know, our founding fathers 
wrote of a truly informed and participatory democracy.  I 
mean, I think the Internet gives us the ability to do that.  
I am sure there will be some people that will participate 
that will probably express opinions that are a little 
contrary, but our biggest advantage is an informed 
electorate, and I think that once the electorate sees our 
message complete and reads it that they will see we do have 
the best message.  You know, we are not relying on small 
clips of a message.  We have a complete package here.  We 
have a complete party and a complete package.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: I think that is one of the most 
exciting things for our constituents, because so many times 
they feel that they are not able to get all of the 
information, that they are restricted to the media that 
tends to give a liberal bias to the information that is out 
there.

<p>

This way they are able to actually see word-for-word what is 
happening and what is said, and then they can 
make their own informed decision about what was spoken, and 
they are able to participate and get involved, and that was 
part of what was so exciting in 1994 was the grass roots 
actually were able to make a difference, and this is going 
to give them the tools to continue to be involved in 
politics.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If you are sitting down at the 
computer and you are going to pull up some kind of search 
engine, what kind of words could I type in to get to the 
convention or to FRC's site?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: For FRC's site, it would be www.frc.org.  Easy.

<p>

MR. PACE: And you can go straight from the FRC 
site to the RNC site.  There will be a hot link.  But I 
would encourage everyone to participate.  I mean, we have 
developed what I consider is a phenomenal on-line presence 
this year.  The thing that will make it successful is if 
people come and participate.  Never before have they had the 
opportunity, and we have given them the opportunity this 
year. So I encourage everyone to participate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to be highlighting this 
exciting opportunity on the program and supering it 
throughout, because we want people to make this important 
connection.  Is there anything else you can add so that our 
viewers can really get something different out of this 
special convention?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM:  Well, this allows our constituents 
to get involved, and I think this is very important for them.

<p>

MR. PACE: And I would just say come join us in San Diego.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, both Gus and Loralei, for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will begin our 
discussion about RU-486, the most vogue method of abortion 
today:  how simple is it?

<p>

Please stay tuned to find out.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape of National Right to Life Conference follows.]

<p>

DR. GLASOW: The RU-486 site-detect prostaglandin 
technique is the first first-trimester chemical abortion 
method to seek licensing in the United States and is the 
first chemical abortion method of any kind to be seeking 
licensure in over 20 years.  Dr. David Kessler, the 
Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, President 
Clinton's appointee to that position, has put this RU-486 
abortion method on a record-breaking fast track approval for 
U.S. marketing.  The licensing application was filed a mere 
4 months ago, and Kessler promised that the whole process 
would only take 6 months, which is about one-third of the 17 
months that fast track drugs usually take.

<p>

Based on our concern for both the mother and her 
child, tomorrow we will testify before the only public 
hearing that will be held before the FDA makes its final 
decision on approval.  RU-486 is not a contraceptive or a 
morning after pill and is being licensed only for abortion.

<p>

DR. HARRISON: Proponents of chemical abortion 
claim this is almost a swallow a pill and poof, the 
pregnancy disappears. This is pure medical fantasy.
Chemical abortion requires a four to six step procedure 
taking place over weeks.  The woman has not one but two 
drugs to take on two separate occasions, requiring at least 
three separate pelvic exams until the woman finally passes 
the fetus, and she may pass the fetus any time any place 
over those two weeks.

<p>

DR. FRANZ: RU-486 abortions are marketed as 
providing benefits over surgical abortions because they are 
supposed to be private, patient-controlled experiences that 
are somehow more natural.  These characteristics may 
actually predispose the woman to having greater 
psychological problems.  It is possible for the woman to be 
alone at home when she aborts.  Since it is important that 
she identify the contents of her womb, she must look at the 
results of the abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The facts regarding RU-486 are more 
disturbing than many would like the public to believe, so 
tonight we have some special guests to present the rest of 
the story.  I would like to introduce you to Olivia Gans, 
who is head of American Victims of Abortion, a long-time 
Washington activist, and also Gracie Hsu, a policy analyst 
with the Family Research Council, who has worked extensively 
on the RU-486 issue and shares with us some of her findings 
tonight. Thank you both for being with us.

<p>

I would like to start first with Gracie, and I 
know, Olivia, you have been working on this issue at 
National Right to Life for quite a while, but the thing that 
we always hear about chemical abortion is that this will be 
a simpler process.

<p>

We have this surgical procedure in which you go 
and have the baby taken out by a vacuum suction method or a 
new thing, partial birth abortion, some extraction 
techniques at the end of abortion, but is a chemical 
abortion -- first of all, let's take their claims -- simple?

<p>

MS. HSU: No, it is not. As you know, a surgical 
abortion requires maybe a 15 to 30-minute procedure, and it 
is a surgical procedure.  So there is not bleeding 
prolonged.  But when you talk about RU-486, there is 
actually a lot of prolonged bleeding, and this is a 
procedure that takes over the course of 2 weeks to 30 days, 
and you have to go into the doctor's office the first day to 
be administered the drug, two days later to receive a 
prostaglandin, which actually induces labor.

<p>

So you are actually going through the process of 
labor, and because it is a poison -- it is a hormonal change 
in your body -- your body reacts pretty violently, and so 
there is a lot of nausea and vomiting and a lot of bleeding 
involved, and in fact, we know that many women have had to 
seek hospitalization, narcotics for pain killers.  Some have 
even had to undergo transfusions because of the hemorrhaging.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing I found startling -- I 
thought I was pretty informed about this -- but when I was 
reading up for the show, that anti-inflammatory drugs like 
Advil or Aleve or some of the typical ibuprofen kind of 
drugs, you know, like a woman in that kind of pain who might 
take an Advil, that is actually a bad decision, that there 
are counterindications for all kinds of drugs that a woman 
in that kind of pain might even take on her own.  What are 
the dangers of some of these drugs?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, I cannot speak to the narcotics --

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, there are different 
complications.  We do know that certain types of drugs like 
the ones you have mentioned can increase bleeding, can 
increase other complications.  The drugs are synthetic 
drugs, after all.  They are very powerful synthetic drugs.  
They are being introduced into an otherwise healthy and 
normal condition of female bodies -- that is, pregnancy.  
Pregnancy is not a disease.  There is nothing abnormal about 
a female body being pregnant.  It might be uncomfortable at 
certain times, but it is not abnormal, and it certainly is 
not a disease.

<p>

So you have these two powerful synthetic drugs 
being introduced into a healthy body.  Then you are asking 
perhaps for other interactions from different types of 
drugs.  If she does, for instance, use narcotics to try to 
numb the pain or to stem the bleeding, all kinds of further 
complications, because you are not then talking about one or 
two drugs, but maybe three or four different drugs, all 
going into an otherwise healthy body.  There is just no 
sanity in that, and it makes no logical sense to people on 
both sides of the issue to insist that this is a reasonable 
and logical course of action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to ask more about that later, 
because what is interesting about RU-486 and the morning 
after pill is you see feminists and actually pro-abortion 
advocates saying, look, I am concerned about this chemical.

<p>

But Olivia, you understand abortion from a 
personal angle, as well. Can you tell us a little bit about 
your experience?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, I am a mother of an aborted 
child. I did have an abortion in 1981, and I am very 
conscious of the ramifications of making that decision and 
also the dynamics that go into finding a woman in the 
position where she would even consider abortion a reasonable 
thing to do. I have also been working for 15 years now in 
the pro-life movement, for 10 of those years as the director 
of American Victims of Abortion, and I have worked with 14 
countries outside the United States, where I have had the 
opportunity to listen to other women like myself who have 
experienced surgical abortions and who recognize that 
abortion is always an act of violence committed against 
unborn children and their mothers, that both of us are 
harmed.  Our children lose their lives, and we may lose our 
lives, and here now we are talking about another effort on 
the part of abortion providers to expand the number of 
abortions being performed, to come up with yet another way 
to destroy our children, and leave women without the real 
life-affirming options that they seek.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think from your 
experience and from working with women overseas, and 
obviously a lot of the RU-486 and chemical things have taken 
place in France and testing there, and other countries have 
been more aggressive in pursuing it.  How do you think women 
are psychological going to react to a surgical procedure 
versus something that could take a month, a month of 
bleeding, a month of pain, a month of doctors' visits? What 
is your assessment to date of the psychological trauma that 
that could give a woman?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, unfortunately, as with all post-abortion 
syndrome complications, there has not been enough 
significant research, and what is present is anecdotal at 
best.  Now anecdotal research is valuable, because it sets 
the criteria for statistical research, but the evidence is 
pointing to serious trauma, the most powerful part of the 
trauma coming from the mother of this child actually having 
to identify the unborn child that she has passed and making 
sure that she has in fact passed her baby, that the baby has 
not remained inside, and she has simply experienced 
hemorrhaging.

<p>

She must, therefore, look at the result of having 
taken this drug with her own hand, and for many 
psychologists who work in the area of post-abortion 
syndrome, it is that dynamic, asking this woman to take with 
her own hand the drugs that are intended to kill her unborn 
child and then to identify that in fact her child is dead.  
That will be -- and I can tell you, as the mother of an 
aborted child, that will, in fact, I believe be the most 
profoundly affecting thing that occurs during the entire RU-486 
process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, you do not really hear 
about that at all, Gracie.  You and I deal with this at 
Family Research Council, and we know that one of the biggest 
complications of this is if the child does not pass.  There 
can be infection.  There can be incredible bleeding, as the 
body attempts to follow through with the chemical process, 
but women must examine then everything.

<p>

MS. GANS: What they have been told is a product
of conception.  Remember that they have been told up to this
point you will be passing a clump of tissue, a lump type of
substance may pass from your body, and then what she sees is
what some people refer to as the teardrop baby.  Many people
may be familiar with the picture of a two-month-old child in
what is the shape of a teardrop, the amniotic sac, and there
inside is a perfectly formed tiny child whose eyes you can
see, whose tiny little developing hands are quite visible.
The spinal column is visible at that point.

<p>

All of these things can be seen if when she passes 
the amniotic sac it is more transparent than bloody, and 
that is what I believe is the height of cruelty to women to 
ask them to believe the unbelievable at that point.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, this has been highly 
politicized by the FDA.  As we noted on the tape before, 
this has way been escalated beyond what we are looking at 
for other drugs.  Why are we looking at taking something not 
to deal with disease or injury?  Why are we escalating a 
chemical that causes an abortion when it is not as if there 
are not other abortion procedures available if that was what 
you wanted to choose?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, that certainly is the question of 
the hour.  We know that President Clinton in one of his 
first acts of office removed the ban that would allow RU-486 
to be imported into the United States, and furthermore, Dr. 
David Kessler, who is the commissioner of the FDA, has also 
said on record in congressional hearings that he wants to 
see this put on a six-month fast track, and that, again, is 
purely political, and when we spoke to the population 
council on the day of the hearing itself, they said that the 
reason why they were pushing this, even with incomplete 
data, even with incomplete analysis of the U.S. clinical 
trial, they said that the reason why they are doing this now 
is because they want to do this before the presidential 
elections, because if on the small chance that President 
Clinton does not get reelected, then they will not have an 
advocate in the White House any more, and RU-486 would be 
dead in the water.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. We are going to have to 
hear more about this.  When we come back, we will hear more 
from our experts regarding RU-486 and the damaging effects 
it can have on children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are continuing 
our discussion about RU-486.  We are joined by Dr. Camilla 
Hersh, an obstetrician and gynecologist who has worked on 
this issue, a long-time activist; Olivia Gans, director of 
American Victims of Abortion; and FRC policy analyst Gracie 
Hsu.  Welcome back, and welcome, Dr. Hersh.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, I have known you for a while 
now.  We were talking a little bit before about why this 
drug is coming quickly, kind of the political motivations, 
but one thing that has been problematic in the discussion is 
that as it is being discussed as so simple, and they are 
doing it in France, so why can't we do it here?  But what 
would be different about the way it is being discussed in 
application here than France?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, Kristi, I am really concerned 
about that, because, for one thing, in the French trials the 
whole procedure was very, very strictly controlled.  Each 
patient had to be registered by name, her address, where to 
find her, and France, compared to our country, is a 
relatively small place, and I have a lot of concerns about 
compliance in any trials or the release of this, the 
potential release of this terrible medication in our 
country.  We are a much bigger place.  We already have a 
much bigger problem with compliance.

<p>

One of the things that my patients often say to me 
when they describe their abortion experience is that halfway 
through, they really wish they could have changed their 
mind. They asked the doctor to stop.  They pleaded to stop.
But of course, things were so far along they could not stop, 
and I do not think it takes too much imagination to realize 
that once a woman takes the handful of drugs that they give 
her at the first visit and then she leaves, a lot of those 
women are not going to come back.  They are going to get on 
the plane and go back to Kansas City and see if Mom and Dad 
can help them out.  They are not going to complete the 
process.  We are going to have a large number of children 
deformed by this horrible drug.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are some of the deformities 
that can take place?  I have read a vast amount of 
information about complications, but what first and foremost 
are the complications to any children that might result, and 
then what are other complications for the woman?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, of course, Kristi, it depends on 
what week in pregnancy the woman takes this medicine.  A lot 
of major organs are under formation at that point.  At the 
very end of the time that would be allowed to be given, the 
heart has been beating for three weeks, the little fingers 
are formed, but a couple weeks earlier, the midline facial 
features are coming together as the baby is being formed in 
the uterus.  Children that have been born that have had 
similar medications given at that point in pregnancy are 
missing limbs, missing the completion of their fingers, 
missing -- midline facial defects would be more common.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like cleft palates?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Cleft palate, cleft lip, where the 
nose does not come all the way together in the center,
holopresencephaly[?] -- that is a long word for those
things.  And frankly, no one really knows, because there of 
course are not any studies where you could ethically test 
medicines that act at this point in pregnancy.  You just 
have to anticipate from the organs that are forming, and 
every two or three days, something major during that time in 
pregnancy is being formed.  All of our major organs are 
formed and in place by eight weeks from the last menstrual
period.  So it is a very critical time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, what has been the response 
of the Clinton administration and the FDA when groups like 
yours and Olivia's say we do not know enough about what is 
going to happen in RU-486, and frankly, we are pretty sure 
that American women are not going to comply as French women 
have?

<p>

MS. HSU: Yes, that was the most interesting 
result of this hearing.  A lot of the doctors on the 
committee did make reservations, and they did say we do not 
have complete U.S. data, we do not have all the information 
that we need, especially when it comes to compliance in the 
inner city and the low-income people who may be taking this 
drug and who may even be targeted because of this drug, but 
interestingly enough, they chose to gloss over it.  The 
chairperson of the group said, okay, with these reservations 
then, let's take these serious reservation under 
consideration, and let's vote anyway.  It was silly.  I 
mean, I think everybody who was in the audience, especially 
the press, could see that there were some major questions 
that were left unanswered but that they chose to continue in 
this process because they really wanted to get this through 
the FDA as soon as possible.

<p>

MS. GANS: If I may interject at this point, with 
relationship to what we know and don't know about RU-486, 
and I am sure Dr. Hersh can amplify this, but one of the 
things that is completely unknown really is the long-term 
effect on different population groups, which often have 
different health needs, different circumstances, dealing 
with their own biology because of different ethnicity 
sometimes, different issues. To say that we know what we 
need to know based on the experience of France or Sweden or 
Great Britain is completely erroneous, because one of the 
population groups, for instance, which has to be seriously 
considered separately from the general population are Native 
American women, and to my knowledge, there is a very small 
number of Native Americans living in Sweden.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So it is incredibly scandalous, actually, that the 
FDA would suggest that we know what we need to know about 
this non-homogeneous population, which is the United States 
population, and we can go ahead and unleash this into an 
unsuspecting female population.

<p>

DR. HERSH: It is really a mockery of the 
standards that we expect to be in place to protect us as 
women in this country.  There are a number of population 
groups that are at greater, incredibly greater risk of 
complication with RU-486.  You mentioned Native Americans.  
African Americans, Asian Americans, and again, what portion 
of the populations of France and Sweden have any significant 
number of those individuals?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What percentage of the women in some 
of the testing had to have a surgical abortion because the 
follow-up showed that the abortion had not been completed 
with the chemicals?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, it varies. Depending on which 
of the studies you look at, anywhere from 2 to 13 percent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that is in a very controlled 
setting with a doctor checking you and with them being very 
able to ascertain that.

<p>

MS. GANS: But take that to its nth degree.  Two 
percent of what could be as many as 300,000 RU-486 abortions 
a year is upwards of 20,000 women requiring surgical 
abortions per year.

<p>

DR. HERSH: And that does not factor in that you 
can guarantee a certain percentage of women are not going to 
even comply to the point of coming for that second 
appointment. It is really frightening that the FDA can just 
gloss over. Imagine if our FDA had glossed over the 
complications, say, of thalidomide, which was a medicine 
used for nausea.  It was a wonderful medicine for nausea and 
pregnancy.  It was released in France and in Europe with a 
very minimal amount of testing, and there is a whole 
generation of thalidomide affected individuals who have no 
arms, have no legs. They are mentally intelligent, healthy 
people, but without any limbs it is hard to get along.

<p.

Our population was saved from that disaster 
because the FDA did not approve it.  There were not 
sufficient studies for use in pregnancy, and when there is 
something that is going to be used in such large numbers in 
this country, it is going to have tremendous repercussions, 
and who is going to bear the emotional, the financial -- 
name your risk.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to ask more 
about that in a moment.  Please stay tuned for more facts 
surrounding the newest in abortion methods, RU-486, when 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once 
again our experts who are discussing the most recent pro-life 
battle, RU-486.  With us are Dr. Camilla Hersh, Olivia 
Gans, and Gracie Hsu.  Welcome back.

<p>

Gracie, one of the things that kind of is an 
interesting counter-melody to this entire discordant 
discussion about RU-486 is there have been a lot of people 
saying, look, we really do need to reform the federal Food 
and Drug Administration; the FDA has been too slow; we have 
not done enough for high risk people with AIDS and cancer.
So maybe the speeding up of RU-486 is a good thing, because 
it shows that the FDA is being more sensitive.

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, obviously not. It has shown that 
their priorities are all out of whack.  If you consider 
something like an AIDS patient or a cancer patient who has 
no other option and an experimental drug could do some good, 
the FDA should put that on a fast track.  The FDA should see 
that that gets first priority, not an abortion drug that has 
not cleared its final testing in the United States, that has 
not cleared a lot of the standards that the FDA normally 
recommends.

<p>

But beyond that, I think it is interesting that 
Congress right now is putting forward an FDA reform bill 
that would speed up the process for a lot of these life 
saving drugs, and this obviously is not -- RU-486 is not a 
life saving drug by any means.  Not only is it harmful for 
the child in question, but it is also harmful for the 
mother.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And in fact, there is a lot of -- 
one of the things that I have not read anything about except 
in pro-life literature is that some women would really be at 
high risk to take that.  It is not a one size fits all drug.  
What are some of the risk factors for women that would say, 
look, you in particular should not use this drug.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Kristi, there are several risk factors 
that are actually pretty ordinary.  Anyone who has asthma.  
Now a lot of people who have asthma do not think they have 
asthma.  They call themselves exercise wheezing or wheezing 
when they have allergies or wheezing when they have a cold, 
but in fact, they have low-level asthma.  Women who have 
asthma are at great risk for exacerbations of their asthma 
and cardiac arrest with these kinds of drugs.

<p>

Women who have recently taken anti-prostaglandins, 
which you think, well, I do not take any anti-prostaglandins, 
but how many times in the last week have you 
taken an Advil, a Nuprin, an Aleve.  Hello!

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

That makes you at increased risk for hemorrhage 
afterwards.  Anyone who has had uterine surgery, a recent 
cesarean section, anyone who has a history of ectopic 
pregnancy, anyone who has a history of pelvic infection, 
anyone who has a history of uterine fibroids.  Probably half 
of women by the time they reach age 40 have at least one 
fibroid.

<p>

The list goes on. Those are pretty common things 
for women to have. Women of Asian ancestry have a much 
higher risk of hemorrhage afterward.  There is no logical 
explanation for that; it needs to be studied, but they pick 
up a higher incidence of that.  One of the reasons that 
women of Native American descent have a higher problem is 
that they often have undiagnosed diabetes. Women with 
diabetes have a much higher complication. Women who smoke.

<p>

So you put together someone who is nervous, she is 
bleeding and passing clots, she took the second dose of 
medicine.  She does not know what to do.  She usually 
wheezes with stress.  She is starting to wheeze.  She quit 
smoking three weeks ago, and so she wrote on the form that 
she is not a smoker, but really she just has to have a 
cigarette, and maybe if she just took some of those Advil in 
the closet she would feel better.  You put those things 
together, and that is not an unusual thing, that scenario 
that I just put together. That is a person who may have her 
complications coalesce into a death.

<p>

Another thing that is very scary to me is in the 
few studies that have been done in this country, it seems 
already that the complications are being swept under the 
carpet.  There is the woman in Iowa --

<p>

MS. GANS: Perhaps the most -- that is Dr. Lavier's[?] case?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Right, hemorrhaged.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us about some of those complications.

<p>

MS. GANS:  Well, Camilla probably could explain it 
far better, but the simple story is that one of the women in 
the trials did begin to hemorrhage.  She lost a full half 
volume of her body content of blood before going to the 
emergency room.  The surgeon who was brought in was Dr. Mark 
Lavier, who was at the testimony the other day at the FDA 
hearing, and his concern was brought to the fore because 
shortly after treating this woman and saving her life -- she 
was on the verge of death when she was brought to the 
emergency room by her distraught husband -- he saved her 
life only to read in the papers just shortly thereafter the 
reports of Iowa Planned Parenthood that there were no 
complications in the Iowa trials.

<p>

DR. HERSH: When they were questioned, they said 
that complication was not outside the expected realm of 
complications.

<p>

MS. GANS: So death is expected.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Major hemorrhage requiring transfusion 
and near death is within the expected range of complication.  
As a woman, I find that frightening.  But that is not 
reported.  As a doctor, I find that frightening, that it is 
not reported as a complication.

<p>

MS. GANS: That is the most dangerous thing about 
the case with Lavier, as Dr. Hersh points out.  They tried 
to back up, once Dr. Lavier brought it to the press’s 
attention.  There was no offer on their part to admit that 
there were complications.  It was only when Dr. Lavier 
brought it out and said wait a minute, you are telling half 
truths, because I treated one of the women who almost died 
in your trials.  Then they tried to back pedal and say that 
this was a reasonable complication which we can live with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So death is a reasonable 
complication.  I mean, where are the women's rights
activists who are supposed to be champions of what is good 
for women?  I mean, we have lived through thalidomide.  We 
have lived through IUDs and the Dalkon shield and toxic 
shock and everything else. I mean, breast implants. You 
can't open a women's magazine without seeing a story on how 
horrible corporate America has been toward women.  Why 
aren't we worried about the implications of a drug like 
this?  Gracie, what are feminists saying?  Where are our so-called 
advocates on this?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, they certainly are not on the side 
of women's health.  They are on the side of abortion and 
abortion alone. NARAL, NOW, all of these pro-feminist 
groups have come out saying that women want this drug, that 
women want to abort their children this way, and that this 
is a good thing, and unfortunately they have had to sweep 
aside the data, because the data clearly show that there are 
so many questions, so many complications that will occur.

<p>

DR. HERSH: And there is no information whatsoever 
about long-term complications from this drug.  If you simply 
look at the organ systems that this drug affects -- a 
person's uterus, her fertility -- what happens to someone 
who has maybe two of these kind of abortions within a 6-month 
period?

<p>

If you think about it, 40 percent or so of all 
abortions are repeat abortions.  What if someone uses this, 
as many people use with abortion, as basically a family 
planning method?  What happens when this builds up in your 
system?  What happens to your breast tissue?  The breast 
tissue is also in an incredible growing phase during early 
pregnancy, and this drug is going to act on the progesterone 
receptors in the breast tissue.

<p>

What is going to be the impact on breast cancer?
There are already some clues with other studies that the 
risk of breast cancer may be increased with just an ordinary 
-- if you can call any abortion ordinary -- surgical 
abortion.  What happens to the rest of our bodies? What 
happens to the fat storage where medicines build up? What 
happens to your risk of other long-term malignancies? There 
is no study.  There is not even any animal data on long-term 
complications.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, I am sure the animal rights would be better 
organized than women.

<p>

DR. HERSH: You can just count on it.

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, I think the bottom line here is 
who is organized on this issue are the pro-abortionists.
The abortion agenda is highly organized, totally mobilized 
on this front, and as we have said already, Bill Clinton's
agenda is part and parcel of their agenda. Probably the
only promises Bill Clinton has not broken are his promises 
to the abortion lobbying groups, and here we see the end 
result of that.

<p>

Bottom line here, what the abortion providers want
to see are more physicians performing abortions. They are
upset that doctors are getting out of the abortion business.
They want to see abortionists increased. They do not care 
at the end of the day whether women's lives are hanging in 
the balance, and they certainly do not care that their 
unborn children are dying.  So for many of these groups, as 
was stated at the trials, it was admitted that more 
physicians would perform abortions if this drug was 
available.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

After this break, <i>Straight Talk</i> continues our 
discussion of RU-486.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are wrapping up our 
discussion of RU-486 with tonight's special guests, Dr. 
Camilla Hersh, Olivia Gans, and Gracie Hsu.

<p>

Olivia, I would like to ask you, working with the 
National Right to Life and certainly being long-term in this 
particular field, one of the success stories has been fewer 
and fewer physicians being willing to participate in 
abortion.  RU-486 kind of deals with that.  How does that 
work together?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, let's understand why doctors 
don't want to be abortionists. Doctors do not want to be 
abortionists because they recognize that there are two 
people involved in every abortion decision, the mother and 
her unborn child, and of course, with the advent of all of 
what we know from ultrasound technology, the science of 
fetology, these doctors are now able to actually treat in 
the most minute ways this second patient, and suddenly now 
you are seeing young physicians, and older physicians, 
saying no, we will not be a part of this violent horrible 
act.  This is not why I became a doctor.  So these 
individuals are dropping out like flies, and thank Heavens 
they are.  They are not staying in the abortion business.

<p>

But the increase in RU-486 abortions precedes for 
some people what has been a problem with actually having to 
participate in a hands-on way killing the second patient.  
So the abortion providers presume that if the doctors do not 
actually have to lay hands on the second patient, more of 
them will become abortionists.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They would be willing to write a 
prescription and do what they would not do with their own 
hand.

<p>

MS. HSU: Data actually shows, for polling data, 
that a greater number of family practitioners and not 
surgical abortionists would choose to use RU-486, but beyond 
that, it is interesting, because family practitioners do not 
have necessarily the medical knowledge and the training to 
undertake the complications of an RU-486 that does not 
result in a complete abortion.  So what has happened is that 
the population council said in the testimony itself, oh, it 
is okay.  Any doctor, any medical student, is trained to do 
the gestational age, to do complications of pregnancy, and 
every single committee member shook their head and said no, 
you have to be trained to do surgical abortions.

<p>

DR. HERSH: It does bring up a different kind of 
compliance problem.  We have talked some about the 
compliance problem of the patient who changes her mind or 
doesn't follow the directions or doesn't come back, but the 
compliance of the abortionist, the chemical abortionist, if 
you will, is that unless you are experienced in the use of a 
particular procedure or a protocol, the chance of mistakes 
is going to be very high -- giving the wrong amount of 
medication, giving it at the wrong time, diagnosing how far 
along in the pregnancy the woman is, knowing how to follow 
basically the management of an intentional induced 
miscarriage, whether the woman has passed all the parts of 
the baby, whether she is developing an infection afterward, 
how much bleeding is a normal amount of bleeding, how much 
bleeding is a non-normal amount of bleeding.

<p>

If you did then need to do a surgical abortion 
after a partial abortion, whether it is spontaneous or 
induced, the uterus is a much more fragile organ at that 
time, the chance of perforation and further damage, 
lacerating the cervix.  I could probably go on and on, but 
you are right.  There is much more chance of basically 
medical malcompliance as you have fewer trained people 
following the patient carefully.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. You even have the abortion 
advocates almost bragging that you could have nurses or 
physicians assistants involved.  We can cut the doctor out 
totally.

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, you have to look at what has 
happened to those of us that have had abortions.  Since 
abortion was legalized, we have seen the casual disregard of 
the woman as patient, let alone -- obviously the baby is 
invisible, completely irrelevant in this experience, but now 
women are --

<p>

DR. HERSH: But these babies will not be so 
invisible.  We are going to see thousands and thousands of 
birth defects entering our society as a result of 
incompleted chemical abortions.

<p>

MS. GANS: The only thing I would say is that in 
fact they are claiming that doctors will have more attention 
to their patients and more understanding, and they cannot 
possibly, because as women have been treated more and more 
like cardboard objects on the table, as the abortionist 
kills their children, and the assembly line of the abortion 
industry has continued, this is just another way to speed up 
the assembly line process and to once again remove all 
connection and all responsibility for the decision that is 
actually being made.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, we have about 20 seconds 
left. This could come up quickly. Tell me how quickly.

<p>

MS. HSU: We can see this within the next 2 months 
perhaps. The full agency of the FDA will come out in favor 
of recommending this for marketing in the United States.
One of the most problematic things is that the one
manufacturer that is going to do this, this RU-486, is 
called Advances in Health Technologies.  They are a brand-new 
corporation.  We do not know whether they are going to 
be manufacturing here or overseas, and they do not have any 
assets.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to get phone 
numbers, and we are going to invite our -- thank you to my 
guests, and I certainly hope people will call, and when 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, you will hear how you can receive 
more information regarding the issues affecting you and your 
family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are live from the Republican
National Convention.  It has already been an exciting few
days, and you have probably seen Gary Bauer, Family Research
Council's president, on many networks and on news shows. We
hope you have been watching the national policy debate and
seen Gary fighting for family issues during the Republican
platform hearings and on the floor of the convention.

<p>

Tonight we bring you more about those issues and
what the Republican Party promises for your family in the
future with some very special guests, including former 
Republican Presidential candidate, Ambassador Alan Keyes.

<p>

But first, let's go to Family Research Council's 
Kristin Hansen, who is live on the convention floor.
Kristin, I know that they have started the coverage. What 
do we have to look forward to this evening?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Hi, Kristi. We are going to have so 
much fun this evening.  We have a great lineup of 
interviews.  We are going to be first talking with Rick 
Santorum and, hopefully, Senator Dan Coates later on.  We 
have the Young Republicans behind us.  So it is sure to be a 
fun evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kristin, I can't wait to hear more, 
and we are going to be talking to Kristin throughout 
tonight's show.  But first I would like to introduce a key 
player in pro-life policies and the platform hearings, 
Colleen Parro, Executive Director of the Republican National 
Coalition for Life; and I am also joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, who is Family Research Council's leader of our 
government relations.  Welcome, both of you.

<p>

Colleen, you all have been working for a long time 
getting us to this point.  The convention means, really, 
your work is done.  What has gone into getting us here, 
especially those interested in pro-life policies?

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, a lot of hard work. We have 
reached out to pro-life Republican primary voters for the 
last five years, letting them know that the threat to the 
pro-life plank was real and that there was something that 
they needed to do about it.  We encouraged them to get 
involved in their precinct and county and state conventions; 
to get elected a delegate to the Republican National 
Convention, if possible, and many of them have done so; and 
in addition to that, to try to get on the Platform 
Committee, and many of them did that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the pro-life platform that we saw 
come together last week was a five-year process.

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, yes, actually. We have had a 
pro-life plank in the Republican Party platform since 1976 
calling for a human life amendment to the Constitution.  But 
the effort to overturn that really started in earnest by 
Republicans for Choice in 1992, and they have continued 
their efforts to try to strip the pro-life plank from the 
Republican platform.  We expect that they will continue to 
do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would think so.

<p>

MS. PARRO: And that is why it is so important for 
people to get involved in the process and to be here every 
four years to make the statement that this is the pro-life 
party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, you have been on Capitol Hill 
for 20-some years and now with Family Research Council.  How 
important is the platform in GOP politics?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it is particularly 
important when you have a Republican President.  I can 
remember when Reagan and Bush were both in the White House 
and there were some staff who might have tried to steer them 
in one direction or another.  It was very helpful to be able 
to go back and say this is the position that is in the 
platform, and there would be letters signed by Members of 
Congress, and so on, that would reinforce that point.

<p>

So it is very important because it is a point at 
which people really get focused on policy.  You do hear a 
lot of people say, "Well, it is ignored after the 
convention."  But that is not really the case.  It really 
does set the blueprint for the policies that are in effect 
by the Congress but more particularly when you do have a 
President of the same party in the White House.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know it hasn't escaped your 
attention, Colleen, that Vice President Al Gore and 
President Clinton at one time said they were both pro-life.
How do you help people remember their pro-life grass roots,
you might say?

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, what is important for us to 
remember is that the platform is an excellent platform, and 
it is pro-life, but it takes grass-roots pressure from the 
bottom up to make sure that elected officials attempt, at 
least, to turn the principles in the platform into public 
policy and law.

<p>

We are seeing somewhat of an erosion of that 
support among the Republican leadership in Congress.  We 
cannot afford to let down on our job, which is to hold them 
accountable to the platform and to not be afraid to stand up 
to your local Congressman and say, "Hey, wait a second.  We 
want to restore the right to life in this country.  What are 
you doing to get that done?"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, as somebody who has been on 
Capitol Hill, Marty, that kind of pressure, does that work?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It does. Like I say, we would 
get Members of Congress to sign letters.  You might get 20, 
30, 40, 50 Members of Congress to point out in a letter to 
the White House, this was the position in the platform; this 
is the position that we expect to abide by.  It has been 
helpful to have that in there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Standing by with Kristin Hansen, we 
have Senator Rick Santorum, a pro-life fighter, a real 
leader.  Senator, thank you so much for being with us on 
<i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, thank you. It's good to 
be with you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Kristin, have the Senator talk to us 
about the importance of the kind of policy debate that we 
have seen take place over the last week.

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, I think what we have come 
out and done in this convention with this platform is we 
have stood up for principle; that we have made very direct 
statements as to what the Republican Party believes in.

<p>

You know, I am a conservative who was elected in 
Pennsylvania, in a state where they say you cannot elect a 
conservative. What I found out, and what Spence Abraham 
found out in Michigan, and Mike DeWine in Ohio, is that what 
the voter wants is someone who is going to provide a clear 
vision for this country, who is going to stand up and fight 
for what they believe in.

<p>

They don't expect to agree with you on every 
issue.  But what they do expect you to do is to stand up and 
be honest, be forthright, and to deliver what you said you 
were going to do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, I am sure that you have 
seen that Jack Kemp is our new Vice Presidential candidate, 
used to represent New York, right on the border of 
Pennsylvania, a big football player.  Tell us, how do you 
think the Jack Kemp selection plays in Pennsylvania?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: I think it will be very 
helpful.  Northwestern Pennsylvania, which obviously borders 
the Buffalo area and in fact gets a lot of the Buffalo 
television, is going to be a very strong area for us.  We 
just elected a governor from up in that area, and it is a 
swing area which we are going to do very well in now as a 
result of Jack.  Jack played football in Pittsburgh, frankly 
not very well. He only played five games for the Steelers.
But, you know, he lived there, he is known there a little 
bit, people remember him, and I think it will be a plus for 
him.

<p>

And just his message. I mean, Jack has such an 
inclusive message that is really going to help us in cities 
like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where we are going to 
reach into communities that frankly are not traditional 
Republican areas. So I think, overall, that vision, that 
energy is going to be very helpful in Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Senator, and I 
really appreciate your taking the time to be with us.  There 
has been a lot of talk about inclusiveness in the big tent, 
but would the Republican Party be a pro-life party?  How 
would you describe its commitment on that issue?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, I don't think there is 
any question that the platform is clear.  I mean, we are a 
pro-life party, and the Democratic Party is a pro-abortion 
party. I don't use the term "pro-choice" because what the 
Democratic Party platform is, abortion on demand at any time 
during the pregnancy for any reason.  I mean, that is the 
extremist plank on abortion.  That is the plank on abortion 
that is well out of the mainstream, and I think we contrast 
very well with a party that says life is important, and that 
we stand up and we respect the right to life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Fantastic!

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Senator, we had read that Dan 
Quayle, in his draft comments for this evening, was going to 
mention President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth 
abortion ban.  Have you heard anything more up to date on 
that?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: I am not, but I am working 
very, very diligently on trying to override that veto.  I 
mean, the President allowing that barbaric procedure to 
occur is just -- what a horrible commentary it is on the 
moral leadership of this country, and frankly, if we don't 
override it in the House and Senate and the American public 
doesn't mobilize behind this, I think it is a horrible 
commentary on this country as a whole if we allow that to 
continue.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. PARRO: Senator, I have a question for you.  I 
am wondering, since Senator Dole the other day said that he 
had not yet read the platform and that, if he did, he would 
not feel bound by it, what efforts do you think are going to 
be made among Republicans to see to it that the Dole-Kemp 
ticket actually runs on the platform?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, you know, I think Bob 
Dole is making the statement like you would about a piece of 
legislation.  I haven't read every word of it, but I 
generally agree with its direction, and he is going to run 
on the themes and issues that were in the platform.

<p>

Bob Dole's record on the pro-life issue is 100 
percent; his record on most of the issues in the platform is 
right in line with that platform.  I mean, I think we 
shouldn't worry too much and picket our candidate.  I think 
what we should do is recognize that with a Bob Dole 
Presidency and with a Republican Congress, we are going to 
move forward on a lot of fronts that Bill Clinton is 
stopping us on right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, as a former Pennsylvanian, 
I have to tell you that my parents are always telling me 
what a champion you are.  We really appreciate your being 
with us on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

When we come back, we are going to have more, live from San Diego.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are very excited to have you back 
with us at <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>
where we are broadcasting live from the 1996 Republican 
National Convention.

<p>

We have Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell at the 
podium.  A lot of you may be watching.  There are a lot of 
issues that we are talking about here that affect you and 
your family, and we have been going to a lot of trouble to 
bring you some of the best in the business to give you 
insight into pro-family issues, other family issues.

<p>

I am joined by a very special guest, Ambassador 
Alan Keyes, and also Marty Dannenfelser from the Family 
Research Council.  Thank you.  It is a privilege to have you 
here with us.

<p>

How does it feel?  You obviously were making your 
way to San Diego, thinking perhaps that you would be 
candidate, and now you are here watching all this take 
place.  What kinds of thoughts are going through your mind?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, actually, my campaign, as 
I said repeatedly on the trail, was not so much about Alan 
Keyes becoming the nominee as it was about making sure this 
party stayed on track with its moral principles, its pro-life 
principles, that we had a strong pro-life plank in the 
platform, that we had a ticket in which the Vice 
Presidential candidate and others were not pro-abortion.

<p>

I think we have achieved all those objectives at 
this convention. I feel very pleased about that. I think 
there are, obviously, still some problems.  The convention 
organizers want to project, for reasons best known to 
themselves, an image of the party as a pro-abortion party  
that is not committed to the principles of the platform.  I 
think that is a great mistake.  But I think that we did 
succeed in making sure that the delegates who come to this 
convention are true to Republican principles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I mean, it is quite a pendulum if 
you think about it.  We started with maybe Christine Todd 
Whitman and maybe Colin Powell as a Vice Presidential 
candidate and let's get rid of the platform to Jack Kemp and 
a strong pro-life platform.  Do you think that a lot of what 
you were talking about maybe might have changed that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think it had an impact.
A lot of people were doing a lot of hard work in that
regard:  Phyllis Schlaffly, Gary Bauer, Jim Dobson, others
who had the courage and heart to speak up and to send a
clear, strong signal to Bob Dole, to the Republican Party
leadership, that the grass-roots Republicans were not going
to tolerate an abandonment of the pro-life principle and
that that would not be the best route for the Republican
Party.

<p>

I think, in any case, this fear of the pro-life 
issue on the part of the leadership is inexplicable, since 
the pro-life position has been our position, as we have 
gained strength all around the country, won Presidential 
elections, taken back the Congress.  I think if they pretend 
that there is some political liability involved here, it is 
a lie and they know it, and that some of them are doing it 
simply because they are not really committed to the moral 
principles that then lead to the pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, you have seen the impact of 
Presidential races on Capitol Hill.  What happens as leader 
like Ambassador Keyes speak out on the life issue?  What 
kind of buzz happens on Capitol Hill?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it emboldens people who 
support the pro-life position, and it is very encouraging to 
those pro-life Members of Congress who sometimes get 
discouraged by their own leadership's lack of willingness to 
speak out on the issues.  So it is important to have people 
with the moral courage of Alan Keyes out there speaking 
forthrightly to the issues and speaking with clarity as to 
why this is so central to our national purpose.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have been talking to a lot of the 
delegates about why they are here, and it was interesting 
that more than half, almost 60 percent of the delegates, are 
first-time delegates.

<p>

As we have been doing some of the pro-life 
activities through RNC for Life and, obviously, Gary Bauer 
at Family Research Council talking to them, a good many of 
them got into this just because of their concern for the 
unborn.  And yet, earlier today, I was in Voice of America 
in a debate where a gentleman from Republicans for Choice 
was telling me that the abortion issue is a killer for the 
Republican Party.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, you know, that is, as I 
say, the simple lie that has been spread.  I don't believe 
that even the people who tell that lie think that it is 
true, since all of the polling that was done after 1992 
showed pretty clearly that the pro-life position did not 
hurt George Bush; it was his stand on taxes and his failure 
to keep his no-new-taxes pledge that hurt him.

<p>

It is also clear that, in 1994, overwhelmingly, 
pro-life, moral Republicans accounted for our ability to 
take the Congress from the Democrats.  How can that be a 
political liability?  It makes no sense.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have standing by Kristin Hansen 
on the convention floor.  Kristin, whom do you have with you 
now?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Hi, Kristi. Right here with me I 
have Mr. Marco Gillam(?).  Mr. Gillam, where are you from?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: San Antonio, Texas.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: San Antonio, Texas?  And why have you 
come here to the convention?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I am an alternate from the 20th 
Congressional District.  We don't have a Congressman there 
because his name is Henry D. Gonzalez.  We want to get more 
Republicans in the Congress.  We want to get a Republican in 
the White House.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: And what have you got here?  Oh, 
you're wearing a hat.  What does the hat say?

<p>

MR. GILLAM:  The hats are distributed by the 
Republican National Coalition for Life, a pro-life 
organization, and most of the Texas delegation is wearing 
it.  Fortunately, they go with our ties and our Texas 
accents.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: How do you think the Dole-Kemp ticket 
will do in Texas?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: They will carry Texas easily.  We are 
very excited that Jack Kemp is aboard.  I feel we are going 
to go forward together now and defeat Bill Clinton.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Mr. Gillam, how do you feel the life 
issue plays in Texas?  Do you see any kind of a drag on the 
ticket?  Certainly a lot of media coverage this week has 
indicated that it has been a bad thing for the GOP.  What is 
your position?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: What, the pro-life issue, did you say?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is correct.

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I think the majority of Texans are 
pro-life.  I know our delegation and the grass roots we 
represent who elected us up the line are opposed to 
abortion, especially partial-birth abortion.

<p>

It is an exaggerated issue. The pro-abortionists, 
I feel, are basing their arguments strictly on emotion.  I 
don't think it is going to be a drag.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, how have you seen -- as the 
different delegations have been put together, some have 
tried to say that it is not that the majority of Americans 
are pro-life but that they control the process.  Do you 
think that is accurate?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the pro-life people have 
been very committed to getting their people elected during 
this process.  That part is true.  But I think you see all 
too often that the network camera people and the talking 
heads in the news booths are very much out of step with the 
American people on the life issue, and they repeatedly frame 
the issue in a way that is not really representative of the 
true pro-life position.  But the grass roots do oppose most 
abortions in most circumstances, and the polls have been 
showing that repeatedly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Mr. Gillam, you are standing by, I 
know.  Have you seen the life issue to be the majority 
position of your fellow statesmen, or do you think it is 
that you have been more involved in the process?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: Could you repeat the question?  I 
could barely hear you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. Do you think that the pro-life 
position is that of the state of Texas, or do you think 
you guys have just been more active in the process?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I can't hear hardly at all.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Mr. Gillam, thanks so much for 
being with us, and I am going to ask that same question to 
Ambassador Keyes.  Ambassador, what is your perspective?  Do 
we control the process or do we have the philosophy on our 
side?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, two things are true.
One, I think it is true that pro-life moral conservatives 
are more active in the process.  That also means, of course,
come election day, they are going to be more active in 
distributing the literature, more active in carrying people 
to the polls, more active in knocking on doors, more active 
in spreading the word.  So their activism goes beyond the 
pro-life issue and really becomes the key asset for 
Republicans on election day, the activism of that moral 
conservative core of the party. Without them, I don't think 
we can win victories.

<p>

I also think that the election results would 
suggest that this business of pro-life being somehow not the 
view of the people is wrong.  If that is the case, why is it 
that pro-life conservatives can stand up, run for office, 
and win?  Why did they win overwhelmingly in the course of 
the 1994 election?  Why is it that not a single pro-life 
incumbent in the Congress was defeated on the Republican 
side in that election?

<p>

So I don't understand where these arguments come 
from when the facts simply don't track with this notion that 
the pro-life position is a political liability.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: You know, yesterday there was 
another primary in the state of Colorado, and the pro-life 
candidate in the Republican primary won a very decisive 
victory against a pro-abortion candidate.  A week earlier, 
there were three pro-life candidates in the states of 
Kansas, Georgia, and Michigan that won their victories, and 
it was a clear-cut challenge between pro-life and pro-abortion 
in all three cases.

<p>

So time after time we have seen this. We saw Pete 
Wilson and Arlan Specter run in the Presidential race.  
Their candidacies went nowhere, and it came down to 
competition between several pro-life candidates.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have a call on the line.  It is 
Nancy from New York.  Nancy, do you have a question for 
Ambassador Keyes or a comment about what we are watching 
right now?

<p>

CALLER FROM MILESSES, NEW YORK: Well, Ambassador 
Keyes, I think you're great.  I love you.  I would have 
voted for you or a libertarian, but I don't like the 
libertarian view on a strong defense.  I think that is 
imperative.

<p>

But I wanted to say is I don't know why you give 
the courtesy to the Democratic Party to say they are pro-choice. 
They are pro-death.  To me, pro-choice is my choice 
between abstinence and free sex.  When you get under that 
umbrella, it is either pro-life or pro-death.  It is the 
guilt of the women in America.  We don't understand there is 
grace for us, and the inability of us to say, "We were 
wrong.  It's death.  I'm guilty.  Forgive me."  That's it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nancy, that is a very interesting 
point that you raise, and I want to make a point for all of 
you watching that you can call if you call 1-800-5000-NET 
with a question for Ambassador Keyes, who is going to stay 
with us through the show.

<p>

But, Ambassador, what is your response to Nancy's point?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think she is correct.
Generally speaking -- I mean, I don't know if I said 
something to the contrary just a few minutes ago -- but I 
use the phrase "pro-abortion," not "pro-choice."  I think 
that the pro-choice slogan was a very shrewd one.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: In one way it does raise an 
issue, because I think what these people represent is the 
view that freedom consists of making any choice you please, 
and we know that if you define it that way, it then becomes 
a curse because it implies that there is no responsibility, 
no moral discipline, and that in turn undermines your 
ability to maintain a decent society and strong institutions 
in that society like the family.

<p>

So I think in that respect the notion that they 
are pro-choice does convey something about their 
irresponsibility.  But the truth is, in this context, they 
are pro-abortion and pro-death, just as the caller says, and 
generally speaking, I use that phrase "pro-abortion" because 
I think that this notion that I am against abortion but, 
which then leads to a tolerance for the sanctioning of this 
as a legal matter, that basically is a cop-out, and it 
leaves the evil abroad, which means that you support its 
existence.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have another caller on the line.
1-800-5000-NET for you to call and participate in this to 
ask a question for Ambassador Keyes or make a comment about 
what is going on behind us.

<p>

Again, we are live from San Diego.  We are going 
to look forward to talking with you.  Stay tuned as <i>Straight
Talk</i> brings you more of the national GOP convention.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are live from the 
Republican National Convention, where we are talking to a 
true warrior for America's families, Ambassador Alan Keyes, 
and Marty Dannenfelser, our Director of Government Relations 
at Family Research Council.

<p>

Behind us, former Governor Carroll Campbell is 
talking, but I understand that Kristin Hansen has a special 
guest with her.  Kristin, you have Senator Coates with you?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Yes. Hi. I am down here on the 
floor with Senator Dan Coates of Indiana, definitely a 
champion of the pro-family movement.

<p>

Senator, we have been here with the Family 
Research Council working with the platform hearings, and we 
were definitely happy with the way things went last week.
And now I know definitely people in the pro-family movement 
are interested in the Dole-Kemp ticket, and how are they 
going to stick to the platform in the next couple of months 
and in their campaign?  What do you think we are hoping to 
see with the Dole-Kemp ticket and the platform?

<p>

SENATOR COATES: You know, we were all pretty 
happy with the way the platform came out, and it is a 
document that I think forms the foundation of our party, 
what we believe and where we think the party ought to go, 
where America ought to go.

<p>

But the reality of it is not that piece of paper.
It is the translation of that paper into the reality of 
action of legislation, of carrying out the basis for all the 
various agendas and programs that are incorporated in that 
document.  That has to be a decision of the President, the 
Vice President, and the party to say we are going to take 
that piece of paper and we are going to turn it into 
reality.  That is our job, to make sure that that happens.

<p>

I really believe that the Dole-Kemp ticket and the 
people they will surround themselves with will advocate what 
we believe and share in our beliefs in terms of 
demonstrating to the American people that we care about the 
values, the underlying fundamental values that are important 
to the future of this country.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: What do you think people in Indiana 
are looking for in action under the Dole-Kemp ticket, 
especially families?

<p>

SENATOR COATES:  Well, I think they want to see a 
recognition of the fact that the family is the most 
important building block of society.  There is no government 
agency that will replace the family.  And, therefore, what 
we can do to strengthen the family, both through the tax 
code, through government policies that don't impact 
negatively on the family but rather encourage family 
formation, a strong declaration that the family is the 
essential foundation of America and we are not going to 
broaden that definition to include all different forms of 
what some people think constitutes a family, I think those 
are essential elements of what ought to be done in the next 
four years.

<p>

Also, I think we have to recognize that the family 
is torn asunder these days in many of our communities, in 
many of our neighborhoods.  And to the extent that we can 
reach out with proactive, conservative social programs, many 
of which I have outlined in my Project for American Renewal, 
to strengthen the family, I think that we need to take an 
active voice.

<p>

So there is a lot that we can do to change the 
definition and the direction that this current 
administration has taken in regard to the family and bring 
us back to a traditional base.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Kristin, if you can hear me, or 
Senator Coates, Senator, you are well known for working on 
welfare reform and on compassionate and community 
involvement.  How do you think welfare reform is going to be 
a part of this coming election battle?

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Well, the resolution that we have 
come up with in Congress and that Bill Clinton has signed is 
a recognition that the American people's voice has been 
heard as far as the White House, and Bill Clinton 
politically could not afford not to sign that.

<p>

I have defined this as step one of the welfare 
revolution.  We have taken the important step of 
transferring power out of Washington back to the states.  We 
have taken the important step of telling people that we are 
no longer going to allow them to live a lifetime of 
dependence on the Federal Government paying the bills; that 
they are going to have to get a job, they are going to have 
to take responsibility for their children, they are going to 
have to take responsibility for their lives.  We will help 
them in the transition, but it is a transition, and there is 
an endpoint to it.

<p>

But the second step ought to be to energize those 
institutions like the church, like the family, like 
volunteer associations, like Habitat for Humanity, church- 
or faith-based organizations to deal with some of these 
social problems that break down the family that government 
has not successfully dealt with.

<p>

We have spent trillions of dollars at the federal 
level with lousy results, terrible results, so we have 
condemned people to lifetimes of dependency.  And yet there 
are organizations across America that don't rely on 
government for their funding and for their ideas that are 
just reaching out with Christian love, reaching out with an 
involvement of themselves in other people's lives and 
bringing the transforming power that spiritual renewal can 
bring to lives, and that is where our future is in terms of 
how we deal with a lot of these problems.  They will not be 
solved in Washington.  Washington can feed the body, but it 
cannot feed the soul.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, thank you so much for being 
with us today on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>.

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Sure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We really appreciate that, and 
thanks for your leadership on welfare reform.

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ambassador Keyes and Marty both, how 
do you think welfare reform debate and those kinds of values 
issues are going to play and have been playing?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think that it is kind of hard 
to see how welfare reform is going to be an issue in this 
election campaign given that the Congress and the President 
just agreed on a welfare reform effort which they passed, 
and you saw it.

<p>

That, by definition, kind of knocks the issue off 
the table as a point of difference, unless Bob Dole can 
define a bold proposal that would take things further than 
they have been taken as yet by the Republican Congress 
working with the President.

<p>

I think that is one of the dangers of progress in 
terms of reaching agreement on an issue just before an 
election.  Sometimes people say that prevents any progress 
from taking place before election time, but clearly, both 
the Congress and the President in this case thought that it 
was smarter for them to be seen doing something in an 
election year than just fighting about it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But, Marty, we at the Family 
Research Council, and you in particular, have been working 
on things like the family cap and dealing with not extending 
additional benefits as more children are born out of wedlock 
into the home.  Why have you seen the family cap as being 
important in welfare reform, and where is that right now?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the parliamentary process 
in getting the bill passed prevented that family cap from 
being included in the final product.  It was in the bill 
that was passed by the House of Representatives, but it got 
knocked out under a parliamentary objection in the Senate 
because of the process they were using to get the bill 
passed.

<p>

However, the bill does take away the need for many 
of the states to go hat in hand to the Federal Government to 
get waivers to implement that family cap and other similar 
proposals at the state level.  So that will probably be a 
boost that the states can do these things more on their own.

<p>

I think another interesting question is going to 
be what happens down the road, because some of these 
programs are going to remain in place for a few years and 
then be phased out, and there was a battle between the 
Clinton White House and the Congress about whether or not to 
extend the benefits after five years, and they did allow 
them to use federal funds through some other programs other 
than welfare after five years.  So that is still going to be 
something to see if there is an effort to maintain this 
federal support for welfare, or will it truly be turned over 
to the states at the end of that time period?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like family tax relief has 
been the favorite theme of the Republican convention to 
date, but a lot of moral issues -- life, welfare reform -- 
have been very hard-fought and hard-won.  We are going to 
talk about what other issues we think are important in this 
next election cycle.

<p>

Remember, if you are watching at home, you are 
welcome to call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more from Alan Keyes and Kristin Hansen and Marty 
Dannenfelser, more here live at the Republican National 
Convention.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> is back with more live coverage of the 
Republican National Convention.  We are talking to you from 
the convention floor, and we are joined by a man who has his 
own followings of supporters amongst the Republican Party, 
Ambassador Keyes.

<p>

We have Kristin Hansen on the convention floor,
but we also have a caller on the line from Vermont. Hi.
Welcome to <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

CALLER FROM FAIRLEE, VERMONT:  Hi.  Ambassador 
Keyes, it is a distinct honor to address to you two short,
interrelated questions:  If abortion is considered a woman's 
private choice, then why is it paid for with public funds?
Isn't this taxation without representation?  Thank you very 
much.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is a very good 
question.  I think it really makes us all, as supporters of 
the public treasury, complicit in a choice that many people 
regard as immoral and that they are saying is entirely the 
private choice of that individual.  But if it is entirely a 
private matter, why should it be supported with public 
funds?  There is a contradiction there, and I think that 
contradiction actually points to the fact that this is not a 
private matter at all; that it is in fact a matter of 
concern because it violates an important public principle of 
justice, which is that all men are created equal and endowed 
not by their mothers' choice but by the Creator God with 
their unalienable rights.

<p>

So I think you are right; that is a contradiction 
that shows that within that pro-abortion position there is a 
self-confessed error where they try to say it is a private 
thing and then want to support it with public funds.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take another call now, Ed from 
Pittsburgh.  Ed, are you with us?

<p>

CALLER FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA:  Yes, I am here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what is your question or comment?

<p>

CALLER FROM PITTSBURGH: First of all, it is a 
distinct honor to speak with you, Ambassador Keyes. The 
first question I have is, were you or would you consider 
being a running mate for Senator Dole?  And the second 
question is, are we going to see you back on track in the 
year 2000?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, as I often told people, 
the man who thought that Colin Powell might be his first 
choice didn't have Alan Keyes second on his list.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And I think it took, to tell you the honest truth, 
a lot of honest pressure from moral conservative groups to 
make it clear to Bob Dole that that pro-abortion temptation 
was a bad idea, and he finally ended up with Jack Kemp, who 
doesn't emphasize the pro-life issue, is not really a pro-life 
leader but at least has a solid record of support for 
the pro-life position.

<p>

So I think that that is about the best we could 
have hoped for, given the strong temptation that Bob Dole 
seemed to have in the other direction, and that, 
unfortunately, is also exemplified in the lineup at this 
convention, which seems to be afraid of standing forward and 
presenting to the American people the clear argument for the 
pro-life position, which I think is a unifying argument that 
inspires Americans.  It is not, as they are trying to make 
us believe, a divisive argument.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much, Ambassador.

<p>

We have another caller, Heather, in Fayetteville, 
Tennessee.  Heather, thanks for joining us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.
Your question or comment?

<p>

CALLER FROM FAYETTEVILLE, TENNESSEE: Yes. I
would like to know why, every time I turn on the TV and 
watch the convention, all I see is pro-abortion speakers.  I 
don't see any pro-life speakers.

<p>

I will say I cannot vote for Bob Dole, I will not 
vote for him, I don't trust him, and you know, as they say, 
to get elected you run conservative, and once you are in 
office, you govern liberal.  Bill Clinton did it.

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that's what they say: run right and govern left.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think the caller puts her 
fingers on something that I have been disturbed about, that 
many others have pointed out, have been disturbed at.  As I 
say, they are putting a pro-abortion face on the Republican 
Party in spite of the fact that the body is strongly pro-life, 
and they claim that this is because there is some 
political liability in the pro-life position, but that claim 
is not supported by the facts.

<p>

That would lead me to think that some of the 
leaders who are pushing us in this direction are doing it 
because they want to jettison the pro-life position because 
they do not believe in pro-life principles and because they 
are looking, I think, to form an immoral coalition between 
the forces of unbridled greed and the forces of unbridled 
lust, and I don't think that is going to be good for the 
country or good for the Republican Party, and I think they 
should stop it, and I will be recommending as much as I can 
to Bob Dole, to Jack Kemp, and to others that they 
understand the winning position for this slate is going to 
be one that points to Bill Clinton's anti-moral, anti-family 
positions and really drives home the fact that we need a 
better alternative, not one that emphasizes economics to the 
exclusion of morality.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to take some 
more callers in a moment, but first let's go to the 
convention floor. Kristin, you are standing by with Senator 
Rod Grams.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Yes, we have Senator Rod Grams from 
Minnesota.  Senator, thanks so much for joining us.

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Thanks, Kristin. My pleasure to be here.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: I would like to ask you, we have 
heard a lot about hope, growth, and opportunity in the last 
couple of nights.  I would like to ask you, can we 
realistically cut the taxes 15 percent and reduce the 
deficit?  How will that help families, and how should 
families be watching that?

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Well, when we talk about cutting 
taxes, what are we really saying?  We are saying that we are 
going to let families and individuals keep more of the money 
that they work so hard for rather than sending it to 
Washington, so that they can be in control and make the 
decisions how best to provide for their children and their 
family needs. So we need to cut taxes to give them that 
opportunity.

<p>

Second, we need to reduce taxes so that we can 
have economic growth.  I mean, that money is going to be 
spent.  It is going to be spent by families and not by the 
government.

<p>

So it is not a question of either balance the 
budget or give tax relief; that is not an either/or.  The 
question is, we can increase this pie through economic 
growth so we can give tax relief, provide more revenues, 
because we will have more workers and lower taxes, and we 
can balance the budget.

<p>

So it is something that goes hand in hand. It is 
like a hand-in-a-glove type of mentality.  But when the 
Democrats say that we cannot afford to do it, what they are 
saying is the era of big government isn't over, and we want 
that money in Washington rather than in your pockets.

<p>

So it is very important.  There is a big 
difference between our agenda and theirs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, thank you so much for being 
with us.  Unfortunately, we have to go to a break shortly.
But do you think we will get that $500-per-child tax credit?

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Well, we have been working on it 
since 1993.  Bob Dole has made it a very important part of 
his tax package, and we have a lot of support both in the 
House and in the Senate.  So will we get it?  If Bob Dole is 
President, you can bet that that will be a part of our 
budget in 1997.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Senator, thanks for everything you 
are doing for the family.

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares 
more about family issues being addressed here at the 1996 
Republican National Convention. Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are watching Olympic 
heroes come out to the podium.  We are live from San Diego, 
where Washington, D.C., has been transplanted at the 
Republican National Convention, and we are reporting from 
the convention floor and talking with our special guest, 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, along with Marty Dannenfelser, who is 
leading government relations in Family Research Council.

<p>

First we have a caller. Caller, are you there?
Do you have a comment or a question? Steve, I understand.

<p>

CALLER FROM SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA: Right. Yes, I 
do.  First of all, I would like to thank you all very much, 
especially Ambassador Keyes, for taking this call.

<p>

I have a statement to make, then a recommendation, 
and then I am soliciting your comments.  The statement is, 
I am pro-choice, the choice being sex versus no sex, 
protected versus unprotected sex, which is then followed by 
personal consequences.

<p>

My recommendation is that if there is then a fetus 
or any other consequences, that the issue be framed in terms 
of pro-life versus pro-death.  And now I am looking for your 
comments.  Thank you.  But the pro-choice issue is sex 
versus no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ambassador, your response?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I have to say that there is a 
bumper sticker out there that I have always found a very 
good one, and it says, "I am pro-choice until after 
conception."

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I think that that is 
exactly right. It emphasizes the fact that, unlike what 
they try to make us believe, there is an element of choice 
involved in this, but it is the element of sexual 
responsibility, and you are exercising a choice when you 
decide that, outside of marriage, you are going to engage in 
sexual activities; and if, as a consequence of that, a new 
life is coming into the world, that is not the point at 
which you get to make your choice.  That child is not a 
choice; it is an obligation.  And it does not belong to you, 
because it belongs to God, and God has determined both its 
life and its rights, and you are supposed to respect them.

<p>

And that, by the way, is not a personal statement 
of Alan Keyes; it is a statement of American public 
principle which we should respect as a people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A powerful sentiment, and one we 
haven't heard much of yet from the podium.

<p>

Theresa from Louisiana, do you have a question or 
a comment for us?

<p>

CALLER FROM SUGARTOWN, LOUISIANA: Yes. I want to 
tell Alan Keyes that I really admire him and that I agree 
with everything he says.  But I would like to hear his 
comments on this subject.

<p>

I just turned from CNN, and they were really
bashing the Republicans for Jack Kemp's flip-flop on
affirmative action and on the Prop 187 in California, and
they say that he is doing -- well, they quoted "Empower
America" as saying that he had switched on his own volition,
but they really bashed the Republicans for putting that spin 
on it, saying that he is being a good VP, and why don't they 
just admit that he is following Bob Dole's lead?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, you know, I guess I would 
have to say that it probably is of his own volition but that 
he has decided of his own volition to follow Bob Dole's 
lead, and that it is good to be honest about that.  I saw 
that headline and said, "Well, Jack is acting like a Vice 
President already," and that is exactly what he has to do, 
and he knew that when he accepted the position.

<p>

So I don't think it should come as a surprise to 
us or to anybody else.  George Bush had to do the same thing 
when he decided to accept the Vice Presidency with Ronald 
Reagan on some issues, and I think that is what it means to 
run as Vice President.  That is why you have to ponder it so 
hard before you accept that position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Hold someone's hat and agree with them.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the positions that Bob 
Dole and now Jack Kemp have on those two issues are 
consistent with the positions that are espoused in the 
Republican platform. So I think it is a good thing that the 
two candidates are now running in sync with the Republican 
platform.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We have a special guest standing by.
Kristin, I understand that you are down there with Senator 
James Inhofe.  Senator, thanks so much for being with us.

<p>

SENATOR INHOFE: Well, thank you. It's nice to be 
with you.  It's kind of fun here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, I'm glad to hear it.

<p>

Tell us, Senator, as you take a look at a lot of 
the discussion of unity, I am sure there is a lot of 
excitement about the tax policy.  Do you think that pro-family 
conservatives are going to have a lot to be excited about, too?

<p>

SENATOR INHOFE: Well, yes. Oh, I think they 
ought to be really excited. You know, I gave a talk today 
to a group that is sponsored by Coke Industries, a very 
large group, and by coincidence I was to be on the platform 
speaking with Jack Kemp.  That was set up before Jack Kemp 
became the nominee for Vice President.  So we had a chance 
really to talk about these things in a spirited way.

<p>

I think when you look at the tax cuts that are 
right out of the chute that Bob Dole proposed, that is very 
pro-family, you know, the $500 tax credit per child and the 
reduction in taxes, the whole idea.

<p>

I was at a town hall meeting in Sapulpa, Oklahoma,
the other day, and a gal named -- a real good friend of mine 
who came -- her name is Beverly LaHaye(?) -- she said, "You 
know, government has deprived me of my opportunity to be 
charitable."  That is what we are going to change in this 
country.

<p>

I am very excited about what is happening here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, we so appreciate your 
taking the time to be with us.

<p>

Marty, you have been working on welfare policy.
Do you think that a change will allow people the chance to 
be more charitable?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think so, and I think 
that Senator Coates earlier really touched upon it, that 
that is what we should be looking towards, is to give people 
at the local level the opportunity to do more within their 
own communities, and that is the type of charitable help 
that will really make a difference in people's lives, 
because it is much closer to home, and they know exactly 
where it came from, not from a faceless bureaucrat in 
Washington.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you see any connection, 
Ambassador Keyes, in the welfare state, where we are kind of 
dehumanizing people in a way, and the abortion mentality?  
Has there been a seepage over of our philosophy, kind of 
downgrading people?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think that both of them 
come, ultimately, from a failure to recognize that what 
defines human beings is their moral capacity, and I think 
that denying that moral capacity means that you set up 
programs that treat human beings as if they are ripe for 
dependency, have no initiative, can take no responsibility, 
and will not be accountable for their own lives and actions.

<p>

And so you hand them a handout, you don't ask that 
in exchange they show some respect and work and try to build 
up their lives, which, of course, is what is done at the 
charitable level by churches and by community groups where 
people work one to one and really have to deal with one 
another as human beings, showing respect for that moral 
capacity and that sense of responsibility.

<p>

And, of course, abortion rests on that same utter 
denial that we must be responsible for the consequences of 
our actions and that same radical selfishness which looks to 
someone else to bear the burden for your condition and 
situation.

<p>

In the case of the welfare state, it is some 
faceless taxpayer through some faceless bureaucrat from whom 
you get support, and in the case of abortion, it's the 
innocent life of that child that is going to be taken rather 
than having you take on the responsibility you should.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tough issues.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: But the spirit is the same in both cases.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank you so much, 
Ambassador, and so much, Marty.  We look forward to having 
both of you on <i>Straight Talk</i> again. I know our viewers 
will, too.

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay 
with us to hear how you can get more information about the 
issues affecting you and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. A special 
thank you to my guests and a special hello to my loyal
viewer, my husband, Michael.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  We 
have been coming to you live from San Diego.  Some things 
you saw on television; some things we showed you -- 
convention highlights when the Republicans were here in 
California.  The Democrats are in Chicago right now, but 
there are still more highlights, some more things that you 
didn't get to see on the networks or on some of your 
favorite programs.  So please stay tuned for more convention 
highlights from San Diego while we talk to you about what's 
going on Behind the Headlines. 

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for taking
time out of your busy convention schedule to meet with us.

<p>

You have been here now for almost two weeks.  You 
came for the platform committee, and now we are in the 
middle of the convention.  As you evaluate the last two 
weeks, how would you describe what has happened?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, Kristi, first of all, it has 
been extraordinary to run into just literally hundreds of 
delegates that are at a Republican convention or any 
convention for the first time in their lives.  I have run 
into teachers and home-schoolers and just typical mothers 
and professional people that, over the last couple of years, 
have gotten into politics because they care about family 
issues or the sanctity-of-human-life issue.  And now here 
they are at a major party convention representing their 
states.  So that has been really exciting. 

<p>

The other thing is that these folks have 
accomplished some things here.  They have a good, 
conservative platform, because so many of them were elected 
as delegates.  I think they have had an indirect influence 
on Bob Dole's choice of a running mate.  I think the Dole 
campaign knew that they had to go with a running mate who 
was a solid conservative and also had a pro-life voting 
record. 

<p>

So I am impressed, and I think the delegates here 
ought to feel pretty good about themselves. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Again, in fact, the delegates really 
-- that story is one that confirms some things that you have 
said all along.  About 50 to 60 percent of the delegates 
describe themselves as being pro-family, pro-life 
conservatives.  Do you think that that reflects the kind of 
energy that you have seen nationwide? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: No question about it.  The real growth 
in the Republican Party all around the country is coming 
from pro-family and pro-life activists.  I mean, the 
economic issues are extremely important to the Republican 
Party, and the economic issues are also family issues in the 
sense that American families are working harder and harder 
and they are falling further and further behind on the 
treadmill.

<p>

But when you really go out around the grass roots, 
it is not so much the economic issues as it is the sense 
that there is something that has gone wrong with the 
culture, that the family has broken down -- the 1.5 million 
abortions a year that we have.  That is what is generating 
all this energy and excitement and growth in the Republican 
Party, and I hope the people at the top of the Republican 
Party understand that that is where all the new blood in the 
party is coming from. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But if you think about where we have 
come on Vice Presidential selections; I mean, rumors of 
Colin Powell and Christine Todd Whitman, and now Jack Kemp 
is the selection --

<p>

MR. BAUER: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  -- what do you think was the impact 
that a lot of these pro-family Americans had on that 
pendulum swing? 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I actually heard through the 
grapevine that the Dole campaign did some polling of 
delegations before they got to San Diego and discovered that 
they would have a major problem on their hands at this 
convention if they had gone with a pro-abortion running mate.

<p>

So you are right; we went from a point six or 
eight weeks ago where literally almost every name on the 
list was pro-abortion and from the more liberal wing of the 
party to the point where, I think, over the last 10 days, 
even before the Kemp selection, almost every name was pro-
life and pro-family.  Whether it was Senator Nickles or 
Senator Mack of Florida, Governor Engler, or Jack Kemp, the 
ultimate choice, every trend line within the Republican 
Party is in a pro-life, pro-family direction. 

<p>

We saw it again just recently in the three Senate 
primaries in Georgia, Kansas, and Michigan.  I think we are 
going to see it this November in races all over the country.  
We saw it two years ago in the congressional races, where 
every pro-life incumbent won and no pro-life challenger lost.

<p>

So I think the trend line is pretty clear.  I am 
glad that Christine Todd Whitman and Colin Powell and 
Governor Wilson find other parts of the Republican agenda 
compelling enough that they want to be Republicans, but I 
think they are going to have to content themselves to be in 
a party that is pro-family and pro-life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to see throughout the 
show, Gary, some of the scenes from San Diego.  But what do 
you think the untold story is that our viewers may not know 
about what has been happening here in the last two weeks? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the untold story at this 
convention is the one that we have already talked about.  
There is a lot of cynicism in the media about people being 
turned off on politics, that nobody trusts the system 
anymore, and yet here there are literally several thousand 
people, most of whom are new to politics, just getting 
involved at the grassroots level. 

<p>

Time and time again, they came up to me and said, 
"I'm just starting.  This isn't a one shot for me.  I'm 
going to be in this four years from now and eight years from 
now."  That's exciting.  That's good for American democracy 
and good for America and good for the Republican Party. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, as we have gone from place to 
place throughout the convention and the platform hearing, we 
have seen crowds form, instantaneous news conferences, a 
tremendous outpouring of public support.  We are going to 
show some of that throughout the show. 

<p>

One reporter called it Christian Woodstock, 
watching the kind of reaction of people to you as you have 
come here to the platform.  What is your response to this 
incredible outpouring of really affection and interest in 
what you're doing? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, it's humbling, actually.  I 
mean, I am flattered by it and pleased by it.  But whatever 
I do in Washington, I am able to do only because I have the 
proxy of all these folks that have been coming up to us this 
week.  And so my hat goes off to them rather than them 
thinking that I am the important person in this movement.  
They are the important people, and I am just trying to speak 
for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, take a look at the next four 
years and the next eight years.  Where is the balance of 
power going to lie between the economics and the social 
issues, and how will they work together? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think that a Republican Party that 
will be at its peak effectiveness will be a Republican Party 
where the economic issues and the social issues are seen as 
being equal -- equal of attention, equal of energy, et 
cetera.  And when the Republican Party really finds its 
voice, not only on the need for economic reform and lower 
taxes but also on the issues of cultural renewal and the 
respect for life, then I think it's going to be an extremely 
difficult party for anyone to overcome and anybody to 
dislodge as the majority party in the United States.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we are bringing you more pro-family 
highlights from the convention.  Let's take a look. 

<p>

[Clips from convention and related events follow:]

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  Well, I think the families 
of America have a great ticket, they have a great platform, 
and now they've got a great party.  It's called the 
Republican Party. 

<p>

[Segment from Tribute to Patrick J. Buchanan,
Escondido, California, August 11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. BUCHANAN: Friends, what are we doing to our 
own people?  During this campaign, I went down to a tiny
town in Louisiana, central Louisiana in the bayou country.
It is called Rayne, Louisiana.  I went there because I had
just heard that a Fruit of the Loom plant was shutting down.
The plant had been built in 1992.  And so I went outside 
that plant where 600 women worked, and they were bewildered, 
and some of them were crying, and they didn't know what 
happened, because the plant was brand new, and they were 
making $6 an hour, and they were told that the plant was 
being shut down and one just like it was opening up in 
Mexico.

<p>

So, you know, in Washington, the think-tank 
scholars, foundation-fed, will get up and tell you, "These 
are sunset industries, these are dead-end jobs.  Let them 
all go."  But to those women of Rayne, Louisiana, those $6-
an-hour jobs were how they were raising their kids.  They 
were the best jobs they ever had, and they are not going to 
be making computers when they lose those jobs; they're going 
to be on welfare and they're going to be on unemployment. 

<p>

Across America, company towns are becoming ghost 
towns.  Behind this surface prosperity, families are being 
uprooted, forced to move out to find new work.  Young women 
who want to stay at home with their preschool children are 
being forced into the labor market to make the money to keep 
up the family's standard of living. 

<p>

You know, I am a conservative.  I have been a 
conservative all my life.  But if preserving and protecting 
neighborhoods, families, and communities, if conservatives 
aren't doing that, what is it we conservatives are trying to 
conserve? 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Friends, either we Americans go forward together 
or we are not going forward at all.  The American people are 
crying for deliverance.  Let us join forces with men and 
women of all parties to clean up our politics.  Let's put an 
end to all corporate contributions to political parties and 
all PAC payoffs that have put America the beautiful on an 
auction block and corrupted the democratic politics of the 
greatest republic on Earth.  Let us put an end to it all, my 
friends. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We need a party that not only preaches but 
practices a conservatism of the heart, that looks out for 
all of our people, but especially for those who have no one 
else to look out for them and no one else to speak out for 
them. 

<p>

Friends, we are in the process; the job is not 
done of making the Republican Party that kind of party 
again.  When no one else dared, back in 1991, we walked off 
a little TV show and challenged the President of the United 
States.  Look how far we have come. 

<p>

Read that party platform of 1996.  Whole sections 
that stand for life, protecting our borders, immigration 
reform, economic patriotism, fair trade, equal justice under 
law, restoring America's lost sovereignty, and putting 
America first.  They are right out of the speeches of Pat 
Buchanan, speeches we have been giving for 18 months. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I know and I have heard the sentiments in this 
hall tonight, and I respect them, and I appreciate them. I
think I know they are born of love for our cause and 
affection and love for me and Shelly.

<p>

But, you know, the other night -- I have been 
thinking and praying over this, and something came to me 
from the grammar school history books of my childhood.  In 
the Middle Ages, there was something they called the Truce 
of God.  During the 40 days of Lent, the warring nobles and 
knights of the kings, they suspended their battles with one 
another, and there was no fighting during Lent.

<p>

I believe that today this disputaceous and, yes, 
divided party of ours needs such a truce, a temporary truce, 
a truce of San Diego.  Let us, at least for the next 10 
weeks, nobles and knights and even peasants with pitchforks, 
suspend our battles with one another and join together in a 
common cause to defeat Bill Clinton and Prince Albert.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we are bringing you more pro-family 
highlights from the convention. 

<p>

[Segments from the convention follow:]

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  We are really impressed.
We, of course, are very excited by the announcement that 
Jack Kemp will be on the ticket, and we think, frankly, it 
has been a shot in the arm that the Republicans have needed, 
and we're looking forward to great things as a result. 

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  The party now has a platform 
[unintelligible] for open opportunity, low taxes, higher 
economic growth, higher standard of living. 

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  Well, I'm excited about the 
prospects coming up in November.  I think we're going to do 
very well in the House and the Senate, and I think that 
there's now -- people are very optimistic about our chances 
of winning the White House as well. 

<p>

[Segment from Pro-Family Briefing, August 12, 1996, follows:]

<p>

AMBASSADOR ALAN KEYES: We have, I believe, to 
stand before the American people in order to represent what 
we believe to be true about the heart of this nation's 
identity.  There are issues that go to that heart, and we 
must speak to them with integrity, and we must understand 
the priorities implied by that integrity, or two things will 
be true:  first, we will not win; and second, we will not 
deserve to win.

<p>

And I know that's hard for folks to understand 
right now, because in the midst of all of the things that we 
do with victory in mind, we sometimes forget that victory is 
not our purpose.  It is the result of serving our purpose 
well.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When I fought against the Communists during the 
course of the 1980s in the Reagan years, it was my 
understanding that one of the reasons we fought them was 
that they were people who believed that the end justified 
the means; that it did not matter what moral principles you 
violated so long as, in the end, your partisan cause, 
whether in a country or in the world, was triumphant. 

<p>

This cannot be the Republican way.  It cannot be 
the American way, or the battle we fought in the 1980s will 
be meaningless. 

<p>

Now, why have I said all of that?  I say all of it 
because it is true.  I, along with others, want and have 
worked very hard to make sure that the appeal of the 
Republican Party would be as broad as possible in terms of 
the kind of formal groupings that the media and others try 
to impose on us:  Are we going to attract enough Hispanics 
and enough blacks and enough women and enough other 
divisions to our division to make it the majority division? 

<p>

This is important, except that those groupings are 
all wrong.  In the end, human beings are not fundamentally 
divided on the basis of these superficial differences.  We 
are fundamentally divided, most importantly of all, on the 
ground of what we think is right and what we think is wrong.  
That is the true division. 

<p>

And that determines, or ought to determine, our 
priority as individuals and as a party.  If it does not, 
then our ambition has corrupted our purpose, and even if 
that ambition succeeds, the corruption will fail. 

<p>

I think that is very important here in this room.  
I presume you're here because of your commitment to the 
necessity of addressing the issues that affect our moral 
character and moral life. 

<p>

We are being told these days that that is one 
special-interest group among many.  But I don't believe it 
is, because these issues are the heart of the matter.  When 
the nation was founded, it was founded on the basis of moral 
principle. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When we went forward in the face of the wars and 
the adversities, starting with the Revolutionary War, what 
inspired and encouraged our people was that commitment to 
moral principle, that sense that as a nation we not only 
stood for something that would be successful -- see, this is 
what everyone wanted us to believe is the optimistic view of 
the American future:  We are optimistic because we're going 
to achieve success. 

<p>

But in the end, success is an empty word unless we 
know the standard by which that success is to be measured, 
and I think that success for America has to mean what it 
meant in the beginning, that we hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, 
and that that phrase is not just a statement of abstract 
principle; it is the definition of liberty.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And if we abandon that definition, then in the end 
our success will be no success at all. 

<p>

And the cause that brings us together, the cause 
of the family, the cause of our defense of life, these look 
like discrete causes(?), but they're not.  In the end, there 
is only one principle at work here:  either we accept that 
first definition of our liberty, which sees it as a gift 
from the hand of God dependent on our respect for His 
authority, His will, His standards, His law, or we do not. 

<p>

And I think that for all the polls -- I see polls.
This morning I was reading a poll about abortion, and the 
footnote in the USA Today thing was, you know, the vote 5 to 
4 in the Casey(?) decision seems to have achieved what all 
of these parties cannot.  It has gotten to the position 
where the majority of the American people are, according to 
our poll, and that is a position that is a little bit this 
way and a little bit that way about abortion, doesn't treat 
it as an issue of principle.

<p>

But haven't we in our history learned that there 
are certain issues that do not depend on majority vote, that 
there are certain issues that cannot depend on majority 
rule?  And was it not the wisdom of the founder of the 
Republican Party that there are times in history when you 
must stand for those principles regardless of what may seem 
to be the majority opinion, because the purpose of 
leadership is not merely to be the puppet of every majority 
whim; it is, rather, to be the representatives of those 
principles by virtue of which the majority assumes the right 
to rule, by virtue of which every individual assumes the 
right to demand respect for their vote and for their consent.

<p>

And the principles that we champion and defend in 
the cause of the unborn are not only the principles of 
respect for innocent life in every particular case; they are 
the principles of respect for that truth that the source of 
human rights is not a human decision.  It is not the 
mother's choice; it is not the Constitution's words; it is 
not the Supreme Court's decision.  The source of human 
rights is a will beyond our will, a choice beyond our 
choice, and we must respect that or lose all sense of right.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Everything else we do, by the way, flows from 
that.  That includes our economic agenda.  When people stand 
in front of us as they sometimes try to do and they say, 
"Well, you've got fiscal conservatives and moral 
conservatives; they're at odds with each other."  Not in 
principle, because if I believe that by respecting So-and-So's 
right to control his $100,000, I am going to have to 
conclude that they have the right to own slaves and build 
death camps, is that understanding of individual rights 
accepted? 

<p>

See, we are not a party that believes in the 
untrammeled promotion of selfish interests.  We are 
committed to respect for individual rights because we 
believe in the capacity of human beings for moral choice and 
moral responsibility. 

<p>

And, therefore, we must be committed to doing 
those things and sustaining those things that build up that 
capacity for moral responsibility.  An educational system 
that understands that the ground of decent education is 
motivated and grounded in morality, and an economic system 
that understands that the ground of risk-taking and 
initiative and all of the things that are needed to sustain 
the free enterprise system we are dedicated to is a moral 
character capable of self-discipline and self-control and an 
individual will that acknowledges that there are limits to 
individual choice that come first in our responsibilities 
toward our children, toward our spouse, toward our 
community. 

<p>

This, I know, is what we all profess to believe.  
I hear it all the time.  During the course of my little 
campaign, even now as I walk the halls of this convention, 
everyone acknowledges this is what we believe. 

<p>

You will not hear this articulated from the podium 
at this convention, because the connection between our 
economic hopes and our moral identity is being denied here.  
But it is the truth of our Republican creed.  And regardless 
of what the consequences are for the moment, those who truly 
believe in that creed will have to stand for it, come what 
may. 

<p>

I am put in mind of the fact that Ronald Reagan 
spent 20 years in the American political wilderness 
championing what was right before, in the 1980 election, he 
finally was able to achieve success.  He stored up all that 
integrity so that, at a moment of our great international 
crisis, it would be there in reserve. 

<p>

Some of us still have to store up the integrity of 
this nation's truth, and in the moment of our real crisis, 
which is coming, which has come, it will be there in reserve.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More pro-family highlights from the 
GOP convention in just a moment.  Please stay tuned. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to a look at more pro-family 
highlights from San Diego, California, and <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Segment from Republican National Coalition for 
Life's "A Whale of a Party," August 13, 1996, follows:] 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  For millions of Americans, life is not 
about judicial decisions and executive decrees in 
Washington.  It's helping hands and good neighbors.  It's 
nighttime prayers and lovingly packed lunch boxes.  It's 
hard work and a little put away for the future. 

<p>

Those are the things you believed in.  Those are 
the things the American people, even in 1996, believe in.
Fight for those things.  Teach your children about those
things.  And if you do that, we will have this meeting again 
on the floor of the Republican convention in the year 2000. 

<p>

God bless you all.  Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MRS. BEVERLY LA HAYE:  You know, we're really the 
pro-life world right here.  You are the men and women of 
America that really count and will make a difference.  We 
dare not let our voice be silent; we must speak out. 

<p>

PARTICIPANT: -- three leaders who have brought 
the pro-life cause to the national audience through the 
Presidential debates. 

<p>

MR. BUCHANAN:  The platform of the Republican 
Party reflects the views and values of right to life all the 
way, and that's our victory.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES:  I believe that it is essential, 
given the evil that we fight, that we come together and 
unite, dwelling not so much upon our failings, our foibles, 
our inadequacies, as upon the fact that however hard the 
journey was, however great the temptations may have been, 
the Republican Party at this convention has reached the 
right conclusion, we have made the right choices, and we go 
forward now to represent once again the right alternatives 
for this great nation. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE DORNAN:  All of you remember 
Clinton, on the disgraceful day, 20th anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade, Phyllis and I and some of you and Gary Bauer were all 
out on the Ellipse.  He looks through the window at us and 
signs five executive orders, death orders, what Billy Graham 
and the Pope and Mother Teresa called the culture of death, 
five executive death orders:  RU 486, human pesticide; what 
Chris fights on, the Chiro(?) policy crushing the Mexico 
City policy.  It went on and on.

<p>

One has been reversed; four to go.  The one that 
is reversed, with your help, with Chris speaking on the 
floor with me, and Henry, no abortions in military 
hospitals. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I won it last year.  I held the line this year.
One down, four to go.  God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE DORNAN: Here we are.  That's 
pretty good.  Hey, William, look up here, buddy.  Come on,
Molly, look around here.  There we are.  Here's all my gang.
This is why I'm for life.  Any questions?  There it is. 

<p>

[Segment from Christian Coalition's Faith and 
Freedom Celebration, August 14, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. RALPH REED:  We are to proclaim loud and clear 
that this country was made great not by taxing and spending 
bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., but by faith in God and the 
traditional family. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And in case you haven't heard it from the podium 
the last two days, let me say it so that there can be no 
doubt:  the Republican Party is a pro-life party, and as 
long as we're here, it always will be. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We are inclusive.  We are open.  We exclude no 
one.  But lest there be any doubt, we will never walk away 
from the innocent sanctity of human life in the mother's womb.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I have in my hand your 1996 Republican platform.  
There have been some this week that have said they haven't 
read the platform yet.  I don't intend on reading the whole 
thing this morning, but let me just go through a few of the 
things that are in here that this ticket and this party 
stand for. 

<p>

First of all, this platform calls for a human life 
amendment to protect all innocent human life:  born, aged, 
disabled, infirm, and elderly.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for a constitutional amendment to ensure 
that every single child in America has the same right that 
every member of Congress and every member of the Supreme 
Court has, and that is to be able to bow their head and 
begin their day with prayer in the public schools. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for a massive, $500-per-child tax cut, 
the largest tax cut in history directed at the family, to 
strengthen the most successful department of health, 
education, and welfare ever conceived, and that's the two-parent, 
intact family. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for returning control of education to 
parents and families, where it belongs, and abolishing 
outcome-based education, Goals 2000, and the Department of 
Education. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And it calls for not one more dime to go to 
Planned Parenthood to use our tax dollars to take the lives 
of unborn children. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

You know, to those who say that religious 
conservatives are an albatross hanging around the neck of 
the Republican Party, let me remind them of something.  This 
party was founded not simply to balance the budget, not 
simply to cut taxes.  It is not just a party of accountants.
This party, unique among all political parties in the 
history of Western civilization, was founded to right a 
wrong, to combat an evil, and to remove the stain of the sin 
of slavery from this land.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And just as it once stood for those who had been 
left behind who were of a different color and a different 
ethnic background, today it must stand for other 
marginalized people:  it must stand for the unborn; it must 
stand for the minority adolescent in the inner city who is 
walking through a metal detector into a school that is a war 
zone.  We must be a voice for the voiceless and a defender 
for the defenseless.  That's our mission. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More pro-family highlights coming up 
in just a moment.  Please keep watching. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from U.S. Taxpayers Party National 
Convention Platform Hearing, August 15, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I want to start by just reading some 
copy that the Family Research Council had in an ad that we 
ran in the <i>Washington Post</i> about the Defense of Marriage 
Act.

<p>

As you know, in Hawaii, the Hawaii court could 
rule that a marriage of two men or two women is a marriage, 
and we have been very aggressive in fighting this.  This is 
the way that we began our conversation on the issue: 

<p>

"The institution of marriage was built to last.
It was made in heaven, recognized by the state, sanctioned 
by faith, and honored by the community.  It has gone hand in 
hand with the rise of civilization.  Marriage has survived 
Marxism, outlasted free love, outlived Woodstock, toughed 
out the Playboy philosophy, and even endured radical 
feminism." 

<p>

As one of six children from a large and boisterous 
extended family, I understand that family is more than a 
word.  You know, it's joyful; it's a great experience.  But 
it is concrete. 

<p>

Family is that unit which is bound by marriage, by 
blood, by birth, and by adoption.  It is not a fill-in-the-blank 
phenomenon.  It is not something that we define based 
on the way that we feel today and not tomorrow.  It is a 
firm foundation for raising the next generation, and it is 
specific, concrete, and has long-lasting benefits. 

<p>

The reason why our government recognizes family is 
not because the founding fathers were a well-organized 
interest group and were very effective in institutionalizing 
their world view until, thank God, you know, the homosexuals 
of log cabin came along to enlighten us, and I say that 
facetiously, of course. 

<p>

Family has created the world in which we all 
survive.  In the same way in which water is a bond of 
hydrogen and oxygen, and it creates something that has a 
unique and specific life-giving value to everyone, marriage 
is the union of a man and a woman.  And if we call every 
fluid water, that does not mean that everything you drink is 
going to have the same benefit.  And if we call every 
relationship marriage, we do not create the same foundation 
for our children, and we can bring the same poison into our 
society by pretending that all things are created equal if 
we pretend that they are.  Marriage is specific. 

<p>

That is one of the things that we're fighting and 
one of the things that we have to actually worry about 
today.  I marvel at the fact that in my 10 years in 
Washington, we go from talking about whether or not we 
should do more for the family to whether we even know what 
family is at all, and that we actually have to fight this.  
It's a chilling circumstance today. 

<p>

The Family Research Council was created to be a 
voice for the family at the federal level, and I presented 
to the Taxpayers Committee a whole family catalog of 25 
platform positions.  But I just want to kind of go through 
some touch points on things that we consider critically 
important at the Family Research Council. 

<p>

The American family is in crisis, and government 
cannot solve all the crises of the family.  But it can take 
positive steps to restore the integrity of the family and 
its vitality.  We can oppose the marriage penalty in which 
it is more financially profitable for us to live together 
rather than to marry, and under the Clinton Administration, 
that marriage penalty has increased. 

<p>

It is an overtaxed family that we are seeing 
today, and we have commended the 104th Congress for 
supporting a $500-per-child tax credit.  In fact, if the tax 
credit per child had kept pace with inflation, rather than 
the $2,500 that you have today, it would be about $9,200.  
And, ironically, when Bill Clinton was a governor, he was 
part of a national family coalition that said, Gee, we need 
a $1,000 tax credit; and the $500 one is still hard-fought 
and not yet won. 

<p>

Forty years ago, the average American family spent 
one in 50 dollars in taxes.  Today it is one in four.  And 
the second earner in a family, normally it covers about 30 
percent of the overall budget, which is exactly the kind of 
income that Uncle Sam is taking home.  We have a nation 
today in which one member of the family works for the 
government and one member of the family works to support the 
family.  And that's pathetic.  That's absolutely pathetic. 

<p>

We are not talking about women who say that they 
want to work or women who have -- I am sure we all remember 
that the Proverbs 31 woman had a thriving real estate 
business and was managing to trade with the merchant ships.  
You know, it is not a matter of saying we think that women 
should not be involved in their community.  What we are 
saying is that, statistically speaking, the vast majority of 
women would prefer to stay home when their children are 
young and cannot afford it because Uncle Sam has a voracious 
appetite for their funds, and we need to cut him off.  He 
needs to get a job. 

<p>

[Laughter and applause.]

<p>

One of the places that we can turn to on that 
front is welfare.  We believe that the failure to form 
stable families is at the heart of the welfare crisis, and 
we have in fact instituted a system which pays you not to 
name the father of your child, not to marry the father of 
your child, not to save any money, and not to work.  And if 
you manage to do these four things, yes, there's a raise in 
it for you.  And if you have another child, more money is on 
the way. 

<p>

We have created a series of disincentives that is 
destroying people, and I know that is not news to you.  The 
Family Research Council, among the policy that is supported, 
has been in favor of the family cap, and a lot of people 
have talked about this as a cruel thing.  But let us be 
honest.  We have created an incentive for you not to marry 
and for you to have more children as the best way to ensure 
that you see a raise in your income. 

<p>

My husband and I, as we contemplate our own 
family, know full well that, much as Family Research 
Council, I am sure, loves me, I don't think Gary is going to 
give me a raise every time I have a new child. 

<p>

Every family has to make its own decisions, and 
that is the strengthening process of family, people working 
together to survive, and we have destroyed families by 
pretending like certain of us are so inept or so incapable 
or must be spoken down to in such a way that we will believe 
little of them but that they bear more children, that they 
have no self-control and no capability, when in fact they 
are very intelligent people.  They are making the only 
decision available to them in which their income is 
automatically guaranteed to go up. 

<p>

And so we see that welfare reform is key.  But the 
most important kind of welfare reform is that which gets the 
community involved with people. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We have to make our programs community-centered, 
church-centered, private initiative-centered.  We have to 
provide tax credits for those kinds of programs.  We can't 
be afraid to acknowledge that the most successful drug 
treatment programs are faith-based, that the most successful 
child care programs are faith-based, that the most 
successful alcohol programs are faith-based, that the best 
way to deal with out-of-wedlock pregnancy is faith-based. 

<p>

And instead, once again, we have a tremendous 
disincentive in our tax structure.  We're not going to help 
the people that are doing the job.  And you may have seen it 
in Texas.  There has been a lot of controversy over a drug 
program that actually works and got some money, some federal 
monies, and a very secular humanist set of lawyers went 
after them to take that money away because they actually 
mention God.  They actually mention God in the treatment of 
drug abuse. 

<p>

So, apparently, it's all right for us to have 
recidivism that leaves people dying in the streets, and it's 
not okay for us to get the community engaged in ways that we 
know will work. 

<p>

Welfare spending has increased from $57.6 billion 
in 1960 to $400 billion today.  We have gone during that 
period from 5.3 percent in out-of-wedlock births to 30.1 
percent in out-of-wedlock births.  We have gone from 22 
percent among African-Americans to 68.1 percent. 

<p>

You know, I believe frankly, I don't think we are 
hard-hearted, green-eyeshade people here -- I mean, I don't 
think anybody would have problems with a welfare state that 
was successful.  This is not a monetary discussion.  This is 
about true compassion.  And we are ruining people's lives 
with our federal dollars because we refuse to do the things 
that help them. 

<p>

We are not experimenting with "wedfare," in which 
we help people establish homes.  We are not allowing the 
church to get involved in matters of broken lives.  And 
isn't that what the church is for? 

<p>

Our goal has to be effective compassion and to get 
Uncle Sam out of the job as being the gluttonous middle-man.
On the critical moral issues of our day, we have got to have
the church involved in helping to solve our problems. 

<p>

But let us be clear that all of these programs and 
all of the tax benefits that we could think of are 
meaningless if we do not have life itself.  We hold these 
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal 
and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, and among those are life. 

<p>

We have got to appreciate the fact that we as a 
nation are funding, to the tune of some $245 million, the 
efforts of Planned Parenthood.  We are funding in the 
millions of dollars the U.N. conferences on the woman and on 
the child.  And we are spending millions and millions of 
dollars on condom handouts. 

<p>

I found it very ironic that my Federal Government 
made dancing condom ads.  I mean, at the very least, if 
you're going to allow such tasteless things to take place, 
can't they make them themselves?  Why am I forced to make 
these kinds of ridiculous and immoral ads and then pay for 
the air time to run them?  We are funding immorality. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Last week, we brought you some convention highlights,
Republican GOP convention highlights, from San Diego.  But 
there were a lot of pro-family events we didn't get a chance 
to show you, so please stay tuned for more convention 
highlights while we talk to you about what's going on Behind 
the Headlines.

[Segment from behind the scenes at the Republican National 
Convention follows:]

<p>

INTERVIEWER: This is Gary Bauer, president of the 
Family Research Council.  Mr. Bauer, first of all, I guess, 
a comment on everything preceding the convention.  We're 
kind of rolling, we're kind of all on one page, it seems 
like, but are you satisfied with what happened in the
platform hearings?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think a broadly conservative 
message is emerging from the convention.  Certainly the 
platform is a Reaganesque platform:  low taxes, small 
government, family values, respect for life.  Those are the 
key issues that I think we can get 51 percent of the 
American people to rally around.  It's what worked for 
Ronald Reagan, and if Bob Dole and Jack Kemp run on that 
platform, I think we'll have a real competitive race.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Are you convinced that they will run 
on that platform?  Are you convinced that they will take the 
social issues to the people?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I'm hoping that they'll spend a 
lot of time at this convention actually getting to meet 
real-live delegates and finding out what they think, instead 
of listening to all those high-paid Washington consultants 
that often tell politicians what they're supposed to do.

<p>

I think Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are both bright
men.  I certainly think they understand -- I hope they do --
that this is a new Republican Party that believes in family
values, and I think if they spend some time with these
delegates, they will realize that that's the ticket for this
campaign and those are the issues they ought to emphasize,
along with economic growth and lower taxes.

<p>

[Segments from FRC booth area of convention follow:]

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Thank you. Appreciate everything 
you're doing for the country.  Take care.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Good to 
meet you both.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: . . . the party of Lincoln ought to be 
arguing for the protections of our Constitution for our 
unborn children.  That seems to me to be a good and right 
thing to do, even if occasionally the polls may show that 
most Americans are either confused about the issues or can't 
make up their minds.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Speaking of Dole, he had some 
critical remarks about you not too long back.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Right.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: How's the situation now?  Have you 
spoken with him since that time?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Only through intermediaries.  You 
know, Bob Dole is an opinionated guy, and so am I, and it's 
not unusual in Washington that you occasionally get into the 
ring with somebody and spar a little bit.  But at the end of 
the day, I think it's going to be a pretty united team, and 
I certainly don't have any ill will.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Dole's selection of Kemp.  Your comments about that?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, Jack's a personal friend of 
mine.  His daughter worked for me at the White House, so I 
guess I'm a little biased.  But he had a solid pro-life 
voting record when he was in Congress.  He brings the ticket 
some needed energy and optimism.

<p>

I suppose he is probably the biggest, most natural 
heir to the Reagan legacy.  So I think it's going to help a 
lot.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER [upon autographing a copy of his book, 
Our Hopes, Our Dreams]:  I hope they enjoy it.

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  They will.  Thanks a lot.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  It was really good to meet you.

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  Nice meeting you.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you.

<p>

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  . . . and our eight-year-old son says, 
"Because of our values."

<p>

MR. BAUER: Fantastic.  You're obviously already 
doing something real right at home.  That's fantastic.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  I think everybody will be leaving San 
Diego at the end of this week with a whole new situation.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

LADY:  . . . I really like Jack Kemp.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  He's a good man.

<p>

LADY:  Yes.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  He's a good man.

<p>

LADY:  He is.  Thank you very much.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  A lot of enthusiasm, which the ticket 
really needed.

<p>

LADY:  I know.  It really did.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  It's good to meet you, Gerri.

<p>

LADY:  Nice meeting you.

MR. BAUER [autographing his book]:  You said Richard?

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Richard.

<p>

LADY:  . . . really appreciate the fact that 
you're able to succinctly articulate the things we believe 
in.  It takes me half an hour to say what I want to say, and 
you say it so well.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be right back with more 
convention highlights here from San Diego, California.
Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we're bringing you some pro-family 
highlights of the GOP convention.  Let's take a look.

<p>

[Segment from Pro-Family Briefing held August 12, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. BAUER:  You know, for most American families, 
life isn't about executive decisions in Washington or 
judicial decrees and all the things in the headlines.  It's 
helping hands and good neighbors.  It's nighttime prayers 
and lovingly packed lunch boxes.  It's hard work and a 
little put away for the future.

<p>

This platform understands those things and stands 
for those things.  First of all, the platform has a solid 
commitment to economic growth and to economic opportunity.  
The platform writers understood that no American family has 
ever been held up by pulling another American family down.  
The platform writers knew that the idea is not to make the 
rich poor but to give the poor opportunity to accomplish 
everything that they can.

<p>

It calls for significant tax cuts across the board 
for all Americans.  It has specific tax cuts for American 
families with children.  Those are key points of differences 
between this ticket and the White House, and I think it will 
be a difference that will loom very large in this 
Presidential race.

<p>

The second key area in the platform is education 
reform.  The platform begins with the knowledge that parents 
are the first and most important teachers that a child has. 
It calls for a cutting back of the educational bureaucracy 
so that more of the money that the taxpayers give can get to 
the teachers and the children for whom it was intended.  And 
it makes a strong statement for educational choice so that 
all parents, not just suburban parents and well-off parents 
but inner city parents, can choose the schools they send 
their children to.

<p>

A third important area is the area of cultural 
renewal.  My hat goes off to Bob Dole for having the 
courage, in the last year or so, to take the message of 
cultural renewal to Hollywood and to say what all the 
American people instinctively know; that is that our culture 
in recent years has become debased, has emphasized violence 
and sexual exploitation, and that that culture is having an 
impact on our children.

<p>

Too many American families feel today as if they 
are surrounded by hostile territory, and this platform calls 
for a reinstitution of the idea of shame so that men and 
women that are making a fast buck, whether it's in Hollywood 
or Madison Avenue, will recognize their responsibilities as 
citizens to create a culture that is family-friendly.

<p>

And finally, this platform is, without shame or 
embarrassment, pro-life, and it should be, since this is the 
party of Abraham Lincoln.  Over 100 years ago, this party 
argued to the American people that the most defenseless 
members of our society then, African-American slaves, 
deserved the full protection and promise of our Declaration 
of Independence and Constitution; that they were in fact 
included in the words that said, "all men are created 
equal."

<p>

Today and over the last 20 years, the Republican 
Party has stood for the sanctity of human life, for the fact 
that today the most defenseless among us, our unborn 
children, are in fact included in those words, "all men are 
created equal."

<p>

I believe this platform is a noble and good 
platform, that it can inspire the American people to listen 
to the angels, the better angels of their nature, and I 
believe that if Bob Dole and Jack Kemp run on it, that we 
will all be at their inauguration in January 1997.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

SENATOR DON NICKLES: I want to thank everybody 
for their help, and I saw my friend Gary Bauer just spoke, 
and let me just say what a delight it has been to know and 
work with Gary and Family Research Council and other friends 
on really trying to help protect America's families.

<p>

I have heard lately Bill Clinton is talking about 
family values. I thought, well, wait a minute, is that Bill 
Bennett or is that Dan Quayle?  No, it's Bill Clinton.  One 
story did a kind of analysis that talked about the number of 
times he said "family values" and so on.  He mentions it now 
in his speeches. He knows it sells.

<p>

But, folks, you have to look to the facts.  Look 
at the history.  What about family values?  Bill Clinton's 
record doesn't comport with real family values.

<p>

You say, "What do you mean by that?"  Well, 
families are concerned about drug use.  And you look at the 
White House; they've been AWOL in the war on drugs, totally 
AWOL.  President Clinton takes off, he cuts off drug 
enforcement in the White House 80 percent.  Eighty percent. 
Makes jokes about, "Oh, well, yeah, I used -- well, I 
didn't break the drug laws of this country -- I did that in 
England -- and then I didn't inhale," and all this kind of 
cavalier attitude on drugs, and then we find out just 
recently, due to the fact that a couple of the FBI agents 
that were in charge of background investigations, that 
several people in the White House had used drugs fairly 
recently, some maybe as late as on inaugural day.

<p>

And yet this administration continues to push -- 
maybe that's the reason it took them so long.  They had over 
100 people that were a year late in having their FBI 
clearances done.

<p>

And then what did they do?  Well, they pulled out 
900 files of people who worked on cases years before in the 
Bush Administration, some even going back to the Reagan 
Administration, and they pulled out their files.  Why did 
they want to clear those files instead of the people that 
were working in the White House?  Those people had no reason 
whatsoever to be going into the White House, and this was 
for access purposes.  That's a real abuse of power.

<p>

And then you get into a real issue, too, and that 
is of character.  Who is telling the truth?  It bothers me. 
Mack McLarty -- I think very highly of the former chief of 
staff in the White House.  He said as recently, I think, or 
it just became public about eight or nine days ago that he 
was pressured into firing people in the travel office.

<p>

I remember David Watkins had a memo we found some 
time ago that said something about there would be hell to 
pay from Mrs. Clinton if they weren't fired.  Well, 
Mrs. Clinton said she didn't have anything to do with it.

<p>

Wait a minute. Truthfulness is an important 
family value. Family values are important.  Integrity is 
important. When you find people, either the President or 
Mrs. Clinton, not telling the truth, I think that undercuts 
family values. I think there is a real problem there, and 
we have seen scandal after scandal, almost a scandal a week, 
from this administration.  That undermines family values.  
That undermines discipline.

<p>

And then you look at some of the appointments this 
administration has, when they are talking about family 
values, and I remember leading the fight in the Senate 
against Dr. Elders, the surgeon general.  You know, if you 
believe in family values and then you look -- and no one can 
say that President Clinton didn't know Dr. Elders, because 
she came from Arkansas.  He appointed her originally in 
Arkansas, and then she was making comments, "Well, maybe we 
should legalize drugs."  He didn't fire her for that 
statement.  She made it once and then she made it again.  He 
didn't fire her again.  Finally he did fire her because she 
started talking about other things maybe even worse about 
what we should teach in school, and I didn't want Dr. Elders 
-- you know, she had one comment, "Well, we teach kids what 
to do in the front seat; maybe the government should teach 
them what to do in the back seat."  I don't want Dr. Elders 
teaching my kids what to do in the back seat.

<p>

But that's the kind of family values, and federal 
judges and so on, that you see that this administration has 
put in.  So their new allegiance to family values is 
rhetoric because some poster said we need to talk about 
this.  But it's not where their heart is.  It's not where 
they have been governing.

<p>

As a matter of fact, they don't have a surgeon 
general today.  They tried another one who was advocating 
abortion or had involvement in abortion, had actually 
performed them and so on -- he couldn't decide if it was one 
or 49 or 100 or what -- and so, well, now they just don't 
have one because they know it would be another hotly 
contested issue, my point being family issues are vitally 
important.  Families are the best level of government.  We 
need to protect the family structure.  We realize that when 
kids don't have two parents that those kids have a lot 
higher tendency to end up in trouble or on drugs or in 
broken families or maybe even in jail.  And so we owe it to 
America's society to protect American families, but this 
administration has almost declared war on families.

<p>

There is only one group that is really radical on 
abortion, and it's President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, and the 
Democrats.  They are the ones that vetoed a bill that 
passed, a bipartisan bill, overwhelming majority, that would 
have banned partial-birth abortion.  It's as close to 
infanticide as anything you'll ever find, and an 
overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate said, 
let's stop it.  Let's stop it.  It is about the only bill, I 
think, I have ever voted that would actually ban some 
abortions, and this President vetoed it, and he was wrong.

<p>

This President, too, has made a lot of statements.
He is the one that is in favor of funding abortions,
funding the termination -- funding and actually subsidizing 
the termination of innocent, unborn human beings. The 
Republican Party and most Republicans say we don't think we 
should subsidize; we don't think taxpayers should have to 
pay for that type of activity.

<p>

So there is a big difference, and people should be 
aware of it, and I am very proud of the fact that our party 
and the American people are saying, we want to stand and 
protect the lives of innocent children.

<p>

Some people say, "Is that banning all abortion?"  
No, it doesn't to do that.  We just don't think the Federal 
Government should pay for it, and we feel pretty strongly, 
and we think the American people, by an overwhelming 
majority, 80 percent or more, agree with us on that issue.

<p>

We also think states should be able to have the 
right to pass laws such as parental notification or parental 
consent, and this administration doesn't agree with that, 
either, and they happen to be wrong.

<p>

So I just want to compliment you for your efforts. 
I thank you for your efforts.  Let's work very, very hard 
and have a great victory in November.  Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: More convention highlights coming up 
in just a moment.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to a look at the things 
you couldn't see on network television.  Let's take a look.

<p>

[Segment from National Federation of Republican 
Women's Salute to Elizabeth Dole follows:]

<p>

SENATOR DOLE:  . . . and I would just take a 
moment just to share a few memories that made a difference 
in my life.  It was the day we met.  It was on Tuesday, 
March 14, 1972.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Now, I am not one for horoscopes, but I brought 
the one along (from) that morning.  It's turning a little 
yellow, but otherwise it's all right.  And the horoscope 
said, and I quote:  "Find the right solution to governmental 
and other problems that face you."  End of quote.

<p>

[Laughter and applause.]

<p>

Well, at 11 o'clock that morning, the solution 
walked into my office.

<p>

[Laughter and extended applause.]

<p>

She was there with her boss, a great lady, 
Virginia Knauer, who had been alluded to before, for a 
meeting on consumer issues.

<p>

Now, normally, I don't like meetings -- normally.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But this was a pretty good meeting.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

It was so good, we're still meeting 24 years later.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I don't think Elizabeth knows this.  You don't 
surprise her very often, but I do have a little surprise for 
you, Elizabeth.  I initiated a search through the Senate 
archives last week and located the schedule for that week we 
met in 1972, and I brought it with me.  It says right here, 
"Eleven o'clock, Mrs. Virginia Knauer, appointment in Senate 
office.  If I have any questions, call Nora Joel(?), 
secretary, 456-2645."  I didn't have any questions before 
the meeting, but I had a number after the meeting.

<p>

[Laughter and extended applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. BIZELL:  My name is Lisa Bizell, and I am 
somebody because of Elizabeth Hanford Dole and the Mary 
Cathy(?) Hanford Fund.  The Mary Cathy Hanford Fund was 
started by Mrs. Dole and her brother, John Hanford, as a way 
to honor their mother on her 90th birthday.  The fund has 
sponsored the Youth in Action group at the Elizabeth Hanford 
Dole Chapter of the American Red Cross in Salisbury, North 
Carolina, Mrs. Dole's home town.

<p>

Youth in Action is a program that helps teens 
develop self-esteem and learn more important skills like 
first aid, CPR, and HIV and AIDS prevention.  We also learn 
the importance of volunteering in our community.

<p>

I have been a part of Youth in Action for three 
years.  Everyone, like my family, my friends, and my 
teachers have said that being in Youth in Action has changed 
me, and I know that's true.  The things I've learned and the 
experiences I've had in Youth in Action changed my attitude, 
my willingness to accept responsibility, and my ability to 
work with others.  I have never been around so many people 
who really cared about what happens to me and my future.  
Thanks to those people, I am planning to continue my 
education by going to college.  Some day I hope to become a 
coach and teacher so I can help young people just as I have 
been helped.

<p>

I don't think Mrs. Dole realizes how many young 
people she has inspired.  All of us in Youth in Action look 
up to her, not because of the government positions she has 
held or the important people she knows but because of how 
she has shown that she cares about us.

<p>

Thank you, Mrs. Dole, for the difference you have 
made in my life and the lives of so many other young people, 
and you are the first lady to us.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

ROBIN DOLE: . . . and just as Dad and Elizabeth's 
love has grown stronger throughout their marriage, so, too, 
has my friendship with Elizabeth.  I will always remember 
the first Mother's Day after they were married.  I dropped 
by with a bouquet of flowers for Elizabeth, and her eyes 
filled with tears as she realized the special role she would 
play in my life.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Elizabeth, you are very special to me.  I am proud 
to call you my stepmother and my friend, and it is my great 
honor to introduce to all of you the next First Lady of the 
United States of America, Elizabeth Dole.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MRS. DOLE:  Oh, my.  Thank you so much, and Robin, 
thank you so much for your beautiful, beautiful 
introduction.  That really touched my heart.  In fact, the 
whole program has been incredible.  I sat there with tears 
welling in my eyes, and this is just a day that I will 
cherish the rest of my life.  I don't deserve it, but I 
certainly appreciate it very, very much, everything that has 
been said and done today.  Bless you all.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

In speaking of women and opportunities for women, 
I recall especially at the Department of Transportation, 
when I was very new as Secretary, and I must tell you it is 
sort of male bastion, you know, because you are involved in 
highway construction and shipbuilding and air traffic 
control, and I said, "How many women do we have at the 
Department of Transportation?"  And they said, "Nineteen 
percent are female."

<p>

And I said -- now, this is 1983 -- I said, "When 
the Department was established in 1967, how many women were 
there?"  Do you know what the answer was?  Eighteen and a 
half percent.  We had come up half a percentage point from 
1967 to 1983.

<p>

So we decided to set up a program to help women 
enter the field, move up the ladder, and receive 
opportunities in this important area of transportation, 
because, frankly, a lot of the higher paying jobs in the 
private sector are in this area.

<p>

So Jenna(?) was the one who helped put the program 
together, and it may not sound like a lot.  We got the 
percentage up four percentage points while we were there.  
But when you have 100,000 people in your work force, that's 
a lot of women, so we were kind of proud of that record.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I knew we were making progress when a pilot told 
me one day, he said, "Mrs. Dole, the strangest thing 
happened.  I was flying into a major city, and there were 
three different voices on the air traffic control system, 
and all three were female."  And I said, "Right!  The 
program is working!"

<p>

[Segment from Christian Coalition's Faith and 
Freedom Celebration held August 14, 1996, follows:]

<p>

VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE: Do you remember several 
years ago, like 1992, where I made a speech about the 
American family and where I talked about too many of our 
children were being born into fatherless homes?  Bill 
Clinton said that my speech about the family and family 
values was divisive.  Well, today he gives that speech.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And, friends, it shows, if you have the courage of 
your convictions, if you're willing to stand firm for 
principle, if you're willing to stay in the kitchen and take 
the heat, if you're willing to stand up for the family and 
stand up for what is right, we will prevail.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CAPT. SCOTT O'GRADY:  I will have to tell you what 
Scott O'Grady thinks a hero is.  A hero is somebody who 
helps somebody else.  The only thing I was doing was 
surviving, saving myself.  But I'll let you in on something. 
It doesn't take a 19-year-old Marine to go out there under 
hostile fire to save somebody's life to be considered a 
hero.  Every single person here in America can be a hero 
when you help somebody else.

<p>

The reward doesn't come from being recognized.  It 
should come from within, knowing that you did the right 
thing.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE J.C. WATTS:  Let me tell you 
something.  There is nothing more in all the world that I 
enjoy and appreciate talking about more, and that is my 
faith and my relationship with the true and the living God.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And, friends, let me tell you something.  I don't 
apologize for it.  I don't apologize for it if I'm in the 
halls of Congress.  I don't apologize if I'm on the football 
field, on the basketball court.  I don't apologize for it.

<p>

Back in 1994, when I decided that I was going to 
run for Congress, a guy called me from Washington, D.C., a 
reporter, and he asked me, and he talked to me about a lot 
of different things, and he finally, after about 30 minutes, 
got around to asking me the $64,000 question.

<p>

He asked me, he said, "Well, Commissioner" -- I 
was a corporation commissioner at the time -- he said, 
"Commissioner, let me ask you, are you going to accept the 
help from the radical Christian right in your party?"

<p>

I said, "Sir, since you put it like that, I'm a 
Baptist minister, so I am the radical Christian right in my 
party."

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It's so amazing to me that you would think that 
the society wants the Christian community, the faith 
community, to just kind of stand on the sidelines and 
twiddle their thumbs while the nation goes to pot.  I say 
no.  We've got a role to play in this country.  We love our 
country just as much as anyone else.  And I say, Keep your 
chin up.  You fight the good fight, accept the challenge to 
go out and be the very best that we can be and sustain the 
greatness of being the greatest, the freest, most 
prosperous, most wonderful country on the face of the Earth.

<p>

God bless you, and let's go get 'em on November 5. 
Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REV. PAT ROBERTSON:  . . . but we're not going to 
rest until the time comes when, once again, we are proud of 
the occupant of the White House and not ashamed.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And we're not going to rest until once again 
America is that bright, shining light set on a hill, when it 
is considered the hope of freedom of all the nations of the 
Earth, when that Statue of Liberty is once again held high, 
without the stain that has been placed upon it by certain 
occupants from Arkansas and others that need to go home.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

But beyond that, we're going to see a time, my 
friends, and if we continue to work and this organization 
continues to grow and people of the grass roots continue to 
come out of their churches and out of their pews and into 
the polls and into the precincts and into the political 
process, we're going to see a time in America when once 
again it can be said, "There is America.  We give her to our 
children and our grandchildren, free, strong, proud, and 
truly one nation under God."

<p>

God bless all of you, and thank you.  God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<p>

HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH:  There is a moral 
basis for lower taxes, and it is the belief that parents are 
superior to bureaucrats as the source of a family -- 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It is the belief that if you get up and you go out 
and you work, you have a legitimate first claim on your own 
money, and the government has to earn the right to raise any 
of your money in taxes.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And it is the belief that in a healthy, free 
society, if America has been good to you, you have an 
obligation to be good to your fellow Americans by reaching 
out a helping hand.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When liberals say compassion, they mean write a 
check to the IRS so they can hire a bureaucrat.  When we say 
compassion, we mean find a neighbor or a friend or a family 
member who needs help, and you help a person who needs help 
in a direct way.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And this morning, we went to two houses where 
Habitat for Humanity, working with the family, had helped 
build a house, and we said a prayer of dedication, and a 
family which had earned the ability to be buying their own 
home had the proud moment of knowing that they and their 
children would become homeowners and citizens and involved 
in their community.  And that, not the government 
bureaucracy, is the right way to help America.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MRS. KEMP:  We are so honored and excited to have 
been given this awesome responsibility.  We thank you for 
your help.  We solicit your prayers.  We are so thrilled as 
a family to be behind Bob Dole, and we thank you for your 
support that is going to make this ticket a winning one.
Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be right back with more 
highlights from the GOP convention in San Diego. Please 
stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for joining us on <i>Straight
Talk</i>. We have more highlights coming up.

<p>

[Segments from Dole/Kemp Kick Off Rally held 
August 16, 1996, follow:]

<p>

ANNOUNCER:  . . . the next President and Vice 
President of the United States, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I have a couple of jerseys that I would like to 
present to the "Dream Team" -- the Dream Team.  I have to 
tell you, and I want to start off with our next Vice 
President, Jack Kemp.  Jack?  There you are, number 15.  I 
want you to know, we got number 15 . . . number 96 for 
Victory '96.   Victory '96, the Dream Team.

<p>

MR. KEMP: I'm thrilled to be on Bob Dole's ticket.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I want you to know, it is with great humility, 
awesome responsibility, incredible excitement, that Joanne 
and I and our family join the Dole team.  Let me say it 
again today in front of our friends in the press, in front 
of our San Diego family and in front of all those 
Republicans with whom we feel such comradeship, it ain't for 
the Republican Party, with all due respect.  This is for 
America.  Bob Dole wants this country to be restored and the 
dream of America for all people.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I've got to tell you, if I had known when 
Spanos(?) gave me this jersey with 15 on it that that was 
going to be the tax cut for America, I wish I was Jim Brown 
and was 32.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I'll tell you what.  Fifteen is the down 
payment on a new code for America that Bob Dole and I will 
design with the family in mind, with growth and opportunity 
as our goal, and with that equality of opportunity for which 
we as a party -- and Bob Dole spoke last night, too, that 
Lincoln founded the Republican Party in 1860 on one simple 
yet profound predicate:  that all men are created equal; 
that there is a Creator, and He created us equal, and there 
is only one system designed on this Earth to unleash the 
potential of the human spirit to which I talked, and Bob, 
last night.  I want you to know with all my heart that's 
what Kemp, that's what Bob Dole, Elizabeth, Joanne, and this 
whole team are all about.

<p>

I'll close with this thought.  You can imagine, as 
I said earlier, my emotions coming back to San Diego as a 
candidate for the Vice Presidency of the United States.  I 
want to thank Bob for saying in his speech last night, we do 
not look at the other party or those in power today as 
enemies.  They are opponents.  I learned on the football 
field that you can be a good opponent and walk off that 
field, shake hands, and be friends, and I can tell you, my 
best friends in professional football are not just my 
teammates but the guys who used to try to knock my head off 
on Sunday.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I respect that.  I respect that.  It is going to 
be tough, it is going to be long, it is going to be 
incredibly competitive.  And I will just say this to close, 
my second closing -- 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

The Democratic Party, bless their hearts, are not 
democratic.  They are elitist.  That party of Roosevelt and 
Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy has turned into a party 
that wants to run our lives, run your business, manage your 
farm, tell you where to send your children to school.  They 
want to control your money.  They think that if Bob Dole 
cuts their taxes, that it's taking away from the government.

<p>

We are not going to deny the government the 
resources it needs to do what Bob Dole talked about last 
night, to provide a net, a safety net, under which people 
will not be allowed to fall.  There is no man in America who 
cares more about the disabled, the left behind, low income, 
than Bob Dole.  I just want you to know we are going to save 
the net, make it stronger, but we are going to build a 
ladder of opportunity out of poverty upon which all American 
men and women can climb, and that is the Dole-Kemp message.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. DOLE:  I think I did accept the nomination 
last night, so I am proud to be your nominee for President 
of the United States.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

How many think I made a good pick in choosing Jack Kemp?

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And Joanne, too, of course.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Fifteen percent tax cut.  Keep that in mind.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Jack and Joanne have 4 children and 11 
grandchildren, 15.  Fifteen, keep that in mind.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And let me say to my friends -- I know the press 
may not be listening, but let me just say to my friends -- 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I didn't mean it that way.  I mean, I just want to 
tell you a little secret.

<p>

AUDIENCE:  It was an A-plus.

<p>

MR. DOLE:  All right.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If I have anything at all in dealing with my 
colleagues in the Congress of the United States over the 
past many years, it has been credibility.  Democrats and 
Republicans -- the Democrats may have to take a little leave 
of absence here for a while -- but I would not propose a tax 
cut, and I would have not proposed the economic package had 
I not been certain that we could achieve it without hurting 
social security, without hurting Medicare.

<p>

But I really believe that we have an obligation to 
families with children and taxpayers all across America to 
make our tax code flatter and fairer and simpler, and we're 
going to get the job done.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

So we're excited.  I said when I arrived in San 
Diego it was getting exciting, and Elizabeth said, "Well, 
it's about time."

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And I'm now leaving full of excitement and full of 
enthusiasm and full of confidence.

<p>

I did call President Reagan yesterday about 4 
o'clock.  When I got him on the phone, I said, "Mr. 
President, tonight I will give my acceptance speech, and I 
want to say as I do that I have talked to you, and that out 
of great respect from all Americans for you, Mr. President, 
I want to be able to say that we're going to win because we 
have the right agenda, because we are the party of ideas, 
and because we want to complete the Reagan revolution."

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And he said, "That's fine."

<p>

And then I said to him what a great job Nancy 
Reagan had done in her tribute to him just two nights 
before.  And then Nancy came on the line and we had a good 
visit.

<p>

But the bottom line is, Ronald Reagan certainly 
was a man for his time.  He provided great leadership for 
all Americans regardless of party --

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

-- followed by my good friend, George Bush, who 
did the same and should have been reelected.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

So I want to make the same plea that Jack did.
When you go back home -- some of you are already home, but 
the message is the same.  Contact your neighbors, people you 
go to church with, people you go to service clubs with, 
people you work with, whether it is in the hotel, whether it 
is somewhere else.  Let them know about the Republican 
Party.  Let them know that we're looking ahead.

<p>

I see all these great young people here this 
morning.  That's the future of our party.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And if we don't keep our word, if you can't trust 
us, then throw us out.  But I trust the American people.  I 
believe you will trust us, and together we will make America 
a better place as we go into the next century.

<p>

Thank you.  God bless America.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be right back with more 
convention highlights here from San Diego, California.
Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for being with us once again 
on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you 
would like more information about the people you've seen or 
the places we've been, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week we're going to have more pro-family 
headlines, issues, controversies when you join us here on 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks for 
watching.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I want to know why you're here, "Mr. President."

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  Apparently -- I don't 
know if you heard -- this is a late-breaking story -- but I 
believe the Republicans snuck into the White House and 
removed some personal effects, papers and things, from the 
top of the shredder in, I mean top of the file cabinet in 
Hillary's private quarters.  I don't know if you've seen 
this or not, but Hillary was never in Hanoi with Jane Fonda.
Never, ever was she in Hanoi with Jane Fonda.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of things were said, Mr. President.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  I was nowhere near 
Gary Hart and Miss Rice, Donna Rice -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I see.  It's all a lie.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: All a lie. And there 
is absolutely, positively no truth whatsoever to the rumor 
that Newt and I are in any way, shape, or form related, not 
even halfway.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I see.

<p>

Mr. President, what brings you to the Republican convention?

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: Well, what I'm trying 
to do is right this terrible injustice to myself and my 
administration and my family. I'm going to ask Bob Dole, 
Jack Kemp, and Newt Gingrich to 'fess up to this, basically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I see.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  And if need be, I will 
take it to the convention floor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Any thoughts about the fact that now 
they seem to be 9 points away from you instead of 20?

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  You know, any time you 
get somebody new on board, obviously, there's going to be a 
little bit of excitement.  And not only that; he's got nice 
hair.  We all know that the American public -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Nice hair sells.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  Nice hair sells.  So 
it'll wear off in a few weeks.  I'm not concerned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: Thank you very much. 
God bless you.  God bless America.  Don't forget, a party in 
the Presidential suite.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are taking a look at the 
Democratic National Convention and how the Democrats face 
the problems affecting American families.  We will talk 
about Family Research Council's role at the convention and 
how the pro-life and pro-family message plays to a key group 
within the Democratic Party.  You won't want to miss seeing 
some of these DNC highlights.

<p>

But first we bring you Robert Knight, FRC's 
director of cultural studies. Just yesterday, I spoke with
Bob about the historical Senate vote which protected 
marriage as it has been defined since the beginning of time:
as a union between one man and one woman.  In fact, the 
Family Research Council provided key information to those 
drafting the Defense of Marriage Act, also known as DOMA, 
and spearheaded an ad campaign to inform the public of the 
importance of protecting marriage.

<p>

Bob and I discussed the influence gay activists
asserted in their attempts to redefine marriage and to pass
a gay civil rights bill, also known as the Employment Non-Discrimination 
Act, or ENDA.  Let's hear what Bob had to say
as we bring you insights we're sure you didn't hear on the
national news, as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

As you well know, yesterday there were some very 
historic votes in the Senate, first on the Defense of 
Marriage Act and then on ENDA, the gay civil rights bill.  
It is amazing that we are talking about whether marriage is 
really a man and a woman.

<p>

We are going to talk in a couple moments about the 
implications of that, but first, could you tell us what was 
the chain of events that led us to actually debate what is 
marriage and how sex should be interjected in the workplace.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it all started several years 
ago in Hawaii when three homosexual couples came to the 
state and said, look, we want marriage licenses.  The state 
said no, you can't, because it is reserved for men and women 
together.  And they took their case to court, and it wound 
its way up to the Hawaiian Supreme Court, which sent it down 
to the lower court with instructions warning them that 
they're going to legalize same-sex unions as marriage if the
state can't find a compelling interest.

<p>

That case has wound its way back up to the 
Hawaiian circuit court level, where it began yesterday, on 
September 10.  That case could result in the legalization of 
gay marriage, so called.

<p>

Now, this presents a conflict for the rest of the 
states, because they are supposed to recognize each other's 
marriage licenses and driver's licenses, and so forth, under 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution.

<p>

And so people who are concerned about this being 
forced on other states drafted the Defense of Marriage Act 
at the federal level, which does two things.  It defines 
marriage as the union of a man and a woman as husband and 
wife, for federal purposes, because it is in the Federal 
Code hundreds of times -- you'd better know what it means -- 
and it gives the states protection against being forced by 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause from having their marriage 
laws radically redefined.

<p>

It doesn't impose a federal definition of 
marriage.  I mean, it would be nice if it did, but then 
again, that's not really the Federal Government's role.  But 
the Federal Government does have a role under the Full Faith 
and Credit Clause.  Congress is ordered to interpret the use 
of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

<p>

So this is entirely constitutional, and it is
necessary, because gay activists have said they plan to fly
couples from the 50 states to Honolulu, get the marriage
licenses, come back, and raise the issue in the courts. So
we needed this kind of protection.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the Defense of Marriage Act is an 
attempt to stop what the gay activists have said that they 
are going to do, which is break down the definition of 
marriage and the institution of marriage in all the 50 
states by forcing it through the courts rather than 
legislatively.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, exactly, and some of the gay 
activists have been very candid about this.  Michelangelo
Cignorilli(?), who writes for the <i>New York Times</i>
periodically, wrote in <i>Out</i> magazine that same-sex marriage 
-- quote, unquote -- was the final tool to get rid of the
rest of the sodomy laws -- and there are sodomy laws in 18
states -- teach children about homosexuality in the public
schools, and, in short, usher in a sea change about how the
public views homosexuality.

<p>

He also said gay activists should acquire "same-sex 
marriage" not as a way of living up to society's moral 
codes but as a way to destroy this "archaic institution" 
which, as it is, "serves to keep us down."  In other words, 
it's not about two people yearning to get a marriage license 
out there; it's about an organized group of very well-heeled, 
very aggressive homosexual activists who are trying 
to use marriage as a weapon in a larger struggle, which is 
to force society to affirm homosexuality as good and normal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you know, Bob, the polling 
numbers on marriage and support for the Defense of Marriage 
Act have risen volcanically.  In Hawaii, which is a liberal 
state, you've got numbers now close to 80 -- they have risen 
about 15 points or so -- and nationwide above 80 percent in 
favor of defense of marriage.

<p>

And so you take this really popular bill, and 
we've seen some gutting techniques and amendments added, in 
particular from Senator Kennedy.  Could you tell us a little 
bit about that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. This was interesting, the way 
the gay activists saw this coming as a steamroller and said, 
well, we have to throw something in front of it.  They got 
Senator Ted Kennedy to throw the Employment Non-
Discrimination Act in front of it, and that is what we call 
the gay jobs bill. It would be an historic restructuring of 
civil rights, because it would add a behavioral component 
for the first time. Sexual orientation would acquire the 
same status as race, gender, and religious rights.  It has 
never been accorded that at the federal level.

<p>

So they hoped that this would be what we call in
Washington here a poison pill, where you attach something to
a bill you don't like, hoping that people won't swallow it,
and thus you kill the whole bill.

<p>

In negotiations with the Senate leadership, Trent 
Lott and Don Nickles, who is the chief sponsor of DOMA, they 
agreed to bring up four amendments on each side.  One of 
them was this gay jobs bill. When Senator Kennedy saw the
Republicans' amendments, he didn't like them, canceled the 
whole deal, and they ended up with a deal allowing a 
straight vote on DOMA and ENDA separately. That cleared the
way for a clean vote on DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that is a little 
confusing, I think, is whether or not the Defense of 
Marriage Act can be canceled out by the gay civil rights 
bill, ENDA. Is that possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: ENDA would apply only to workplaces.
So it really wouldn't affect the marriage law that much.
What it would do is send a signal that the Republican-controlled 
Senate, in an election year, is talking about a 
national gay rights bill. I think the gays have to be happy 
about that, that they have gotten us to this point, that 
there hasn't been enough serious opposition among the 
leadership of the Republican Party, in particular -- because 
the Democratic Party is behind this -- and that is why it 
has become an issue.  If they had been steadfast, I don't 
think we ever would have seen this. We didn't even see this
under the Democratic Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to talk a couple of 
minutes, Bob, live about the implications of the two 
historic votes. But in terms of the gay civil rights bill,
would it inject sexuality into the workplace?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Right. It is supposed to reduce 
intolerance toward homosexuality and bisexuality; it is in 
the bill.  Actually, it would increase sexual tension in the 
workplace, because how would an employer know who is 
homosexual and who is not, unless the employee makes a point 
of it?  That has been the case all along.

<p>

I see a great threat to religious freedom, freedom 
of speech, freedom of association, because laws like this 
are not passed in a vacuum.  You've got the whole realm of 
sexual harassment laws to deal with that are kind of coupled 
to it.  What if a person has a Bible on his desk and a gay 
employee says, "Look, that book is homophobic and it says 
homosexuality is wrong.  That creates a hostile atmosphere 
to me, and I feel threatened."  What if the employer to do? 
Tell the guy to put the Bible away?  Now he's trampling on 
religious freedom.

<p>

How about the provision in ENDA which says there 
can be no consideration at all based on sexual orientation? 
So what if an employer prefers to hire a person that he 
thinks is morally straight, like a good boy scout would be? 
A homosexual would-be employee can say, "Well, you hired 
that person because he was heterosexual."  And the employer 
would say, "No, I didn't. I did it on qualification."  And 
the gay would-be employee will say, "Well, prove it."  And 
you could see where this can go. With a couple of activist 
lawyers and a couple of liberal judges, you've got a big gun 
aimed at American business' head.

<p>

So I cannot understand why more people who should 
know better don't see this as what it is, a massive 
expansion of federal power over America's workplaces.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Bob, we'll be back in just a 
couple moments to talk with you about the Defense of 
Marriage Act and the gay civil rights bill. Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are joined by Robert 
Knight, director of cultural studies for FRC.  Bob played a 
key role in relaying information pertinent to the Defense of 
Marriage Act and the gay civil rights bill.  Bob, thanks so 
much for being with us on the show.

<p>

Yesterday, before the vote, you and I were talking 
about how we got to this situation, the court case in 
Hawaii, in which arguments started yesterday, and all the 
different states getting concerned.  But now we've had the 
votes.  Why don't you quickly first tell us the results of 
the two votes, and then let's start talking implications.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, DOMA was a resounding victory.
The Defense of Marriage Act passed by a vote of 85-14.
There was one Senator missing, David Pryor, who was out of 
town because of a son's medical emergency.

<p>

What was most interesting, though, was the vote 
following that on what we call the gay jobs bill and Senator 
Kennedy calls the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.  What 
that act does is add sexual orientation to civil rights law 
in the workplace, therefore giving it the highest possible 
protection, right along with ethnicity or race.

<p>

We squeaked by.  They defeated ENDA by one vote, 
50 to 49.  Now, that's the first time the U.S. Senate has 
voted on a gay rights bill, and we just saw it go down by 
one vote, and I think that is very significant.  It shows 
that the homosexual activist lobby was very active in 
promoting that.  It is almost as if they gave up on DOMA 
because millions of people, frankly, were hammering the 
Senate on DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Calls and phone calls and letters 
and talk shows and -- 

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Oh, yes. Even many liberal -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of energy.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, a lot of energy on DOMA.  People 
just saw the threat to marriage and reacted.

<p>

ENDA wasn't on their radar screen.  It is almost 
as if the homosexuals did an end run.  In fact, ENDA 
originally was attached to DOMA as a killer amendment by 
Senate Kennedy, and then through a series of parliamentary 
maneuvers, it was stripped off DOMA so DOMA could have a 
clean vote.  But then the compromise that Kennedy extracted 
was to have a vote on ENDA straight up, which was 
unprecedented.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think one of the things that we 
have to mention is, even though the gay civil rights bill 
was defeated, Senator Pryor said that he intended to vote in 
favor of that, and in a 50-50 split, I think we have to 
anticipate that the Clinton Administration, with Vice 
President Al Gore having the tie-breaker, probably would 
have voted in favor of gay civil rights, given some of their 
other policies and their discussion of gay civil rights.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Every vote counted, and I 
didn't know whether ENDA would go through or not.  A very 
good sign was when Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican, 
took the floor against it.  She is not exactly a big 
opponent of gay rights; in fact, she prefaced her remarks 
saying, "Well, I support rights for gay people," and so 
forth.

<p>

But this bill would shackle businesses with 
another layer of federal regulation.  It would be an 
unprecedented intrusion into the workplace.  And it would 
interfere with the beliefs of millions of Americans.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have to jump on that for a 
second, because everyone understands in their workplace EEOC 
regulations, equal opportunity regulations, that say perhaps 
we need a percentage of so many women or so many of a 
certain minority, or we are looking at a community; we have 
to have this kind of mixture to legally qualify for federal 
grants or even to avoid prosecution.

<p>

So to take a look at something that talks about 
sex in civil rights legislation, doesn't that mean we would 
have to ask every person, "How do you have sex?" when they 
are hired?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, that would protect an employer,
I suppose, under ENDA.  ENDA has a non-quotas provision in 
it. They say specifically you cannot base quotas on sexual 
orientation.  But we have seen similar promises before in 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act when Hubert Humphrey said, "Don't 
worry, this won't lead to quotas."  And we know what 
happened.  We got racial quotas, we got gender quotas, we 
got the whole ball of wax.

<p>

You know what would happen.  Employers would try 
to find out the sexual orientation of their employees so 
they could be seen to be complying with the act.  Quotas 
follow civil rights laws as naturally as day follows night. 
It is the only way they can prove they are complying.

<p>

And, as you said, it would inject sex into the 
workplace.  Right now most employers really don't care if 
their employees are homosexual or not.  There really isn't 
this great problem. In fact, Ed Mickens(?), a writer for 
<i>The Advocate</i> magazine, a gay national magazine, wrote two 
years ago that gays aren't being fired from their jobs in a 
big way.  In fact, because the Cracker Barrel had fired a 
lesbian, the fact that it was so sensational pointed out the 
larger fact that it just isn't happening.  You have a case 
here or there, but there is no great national upsurge in 
rooting out homosexuals from their jobs.

<p>

And so they have manufactured this issue.  And had 
they prevailed, we are talking about a threat to religious 
freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of association.  How 
about a Christian employee who puts a Bible on his desk, and 
a guy in the office who maybe he didn't know was gay says, 
"You know, that's a homophobic book.  I feel threatened.  
You have created an atmosphere of sexual harassment here."

<p>

What is the poor employer to do?  If he tells the 
guy to take the Bible out, he is just trampling on religious 
freedom.  If he leaves the Bible in, the gay goes to the 
EEOC and says, "Hey, I feel put upon; I feel harassed."  I 
mean, this is a lawyer's dream, this kind of legislation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems that the only way that you 
can deal with it is to talk openly about it.  In the Sunday 
<i>New York Times</i>, there was a fascinating article on the front 
of the national section about people who cross-dress and 
bisexuals saying that they are not, to use a phrase, 
"straight homosexuals," where they are not just all guys or 
just all girls; they like to be a mixture of all, so that 
they need their own separate classification.

<p>

So we are going to have, I guess, straight 
straight and straight homosexual or lesbian and then people 
who cross-dress, and it seems like the checkoff for man, 
woman, minority, sexual, occupation, is going to be pretty 
intense.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it has got to be.  And the 
whole problem with sexual orientation is, it's in the mind. 
And the law concerns human actions, not thoughts.  This 
would be an unprecedented attempt to inject fortune-telling 
into the law.  I mean, how would you know what is in 
somebody's mind unless they tell you?

<p>

A friend of mine, Paul Mirro(?), who works for Bob 
Dornan, wrote a funny piece just yesterday called <i>My
Favorite Martian</i>. It's about an employer who sits down with 
an employee, a long-time employee, and the employee says to 
the employer, "I need to talk to you.  I have to tell you 
something."  He says, "I'm a Martian."

<p>

The employer says, "Well, I didn't know you were a 
Martian."  The employee says, "Well, I've kept it secret."
It goes into a parody, and he uses all the language the gay 
activists use.  When it comes down to it, the employer says,
"Well, since nothing you have done is Martian and I didn't 
know you were Martian, why are you making it evident to me?" 
The employee says, "Because I want to be recognized for 
what I am."

<p>

The employer says, "Well, then, aren't you 
imposing your Martianness on the rest of us?"  And the 
employee says, "Well, yeah, but why not?  What's wrong with 
being a Martian?"  And again, he could never nail down 
exactly what a Martian was.  He said his parents weren't 
Martians, but he just knew he was a Martian.  I knows this 
sounds silly, but it shows how silly the whole thing is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that has been 
discussed is whether or not the gay civil rights bill might 
be attached to an appropriations bill, whether we might see 
it one more time before this Congress leaves.  Senator 
Kennedy has been a real champion of it.  Do you think that 
is possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It is possible. Our lobbyists have 
told us that there is scuttlebutt on the floor that they 
might try to attach it to another bill and hope Senator 
Pryor is back in town to break the tie.

<p>

I am not sure that is what the Clinton 
Administration would like to have happen, because then you 
would have Al Gore breaking the tie.  That would put the 
administration in a very visible position of supporting a 
gay rights bill on a national level.  They are already on 
record as doing so, but this would notch it up a few 
degrees.

<p>

I am not sure that any political campaign really 
wants to inject that element into a campaign.  The 
Republicans have been very quiet about it, and the Democrats 
haven't exactly made it a huge issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. The <i>Post</i> made a point this 
morning of talking about the rather subdued debate leading 
to a rather quick vote, which anyone who watches much C-SPAN 
knows that that is not very normal.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: No, it isn't. Both parties are 
uncomfortable with the issue.  They wanted to get it off 
their plates and on to other business, and they did do the 
right thing by rejecting ENDA and passing DOMA, in my 
estimation.

<p>

I think the DOMA victory should give a lot of 
people heart that there has been a realization that you can 
go too far.  You can knock at the stilts of civilization and 
perhaps bring it down, and this was a lot of Americans 
shoring up that foundation with DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So where do the bills go from now?
Obviously, one -- Senator Kennedy is saying that the gay 
civil rights bill he will probably just reintroduce next 
time.  Where does DOMA go?  It has been passed by the 
Senate.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: DOMA goes right to President 
Clinton's desk, and in the words of our president, Gary
Bauer, "President, eat your spinach and sign the bill."
And, of course, that is Gary's reference to the fact that he 
suspects that Bill Clinton doesn't really want to sign the 
bill, but he said he will, so he expects him to do so.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That was a real point that the 
Republicans made on the floor: If the President likes it, 
why wouldn't you be for it?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Well, I don't think everybody 
is believing that the President really likes it.  After all, 
the President was on record as supporting ENDA while it was 
attached as an amendment to DOMA in an effort to kill DOMA. 
So it is kind of, on one hand he is saying, "Okay, I'm for 
marriage"; on the other hand, "I'm for all these guys 
attaching these things that everybody says might kill it."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you say, Bob, to people who 
think that it is only a matter of simple fairness?  We heard 
that phrase: "It's a matter of simple justice and a matter 
of simple fairness." Do we want someone who is homosexual 
or lesbian to be fired from their job for being homosexual? 
It's a matter of simple fairness.  What is your response to 
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, I think the polls are very 
revealing.  If you frame it that way, "Do you think gays 
ought to be fired just for being gay?" almost nobody says 
yes, because in a vacuum like that, it sounds unfair; it 
sounds un-American.  And it probably is, depending on the 
job and how the sexuality was made manifest.  You know, a 
lot of these concepts sound great until you try them in the 
real world.

<p>

What ENDA would have done was, instead of leveling 
the playing field, it would have added an entirely new 
component.  It would have allowed gay employees or would-be 
employees an enormous ability to litigate against an 
employer if they didn't get what they wanted.  And it is not 
as if they are not a litigious group.  I mean, they've got 
suits against the boy scouts, they've got suits about sexual 
harassment, they've got gay lawyers hammering this issue all 
over the country.  They were licking their chops at the 
prospect of having a federal law in place that said you must 
take sexual orientation into account, basically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But would the research indicate that 
homosexuals and lesbians are being fired and that they are 
suffering economically because of the way in which they have 
sex?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: There is no evidence that that is 
happening. There are probably a handful of cases where 
employers have said, "I'm not comfortable with this 
behavior; you'd better work someplace else."  Depending on 
the situation, that might be okay, it might not.  What if 
it's a day camp?  What if it's the boy scouts?  What if it's 
an organization that deals with children?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. It is easy to see in a case 
recently in Virginia where a teacher was in pornographic, 
homosexual films, working as a gym teacher with young boys. 
When this information was revealed, he was fired.  And 
would he not have an actionable case under the gay civil 
rights bill to come back and say, "Hey, they fired me for my 
sexual practices"?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, that is right, because the term 
is "sexual orientation" in the law, and real or perceived. 
That's the way they define it:  homosexuality, bisexuality, 
heterosexuality, whether real or perceived.

<p>

He could say, "Well, look.  Because I was in a gay 
porn film, an ordinary person might conclude I'm homosexual. 
Therefore, I am being fired on an outside activity, 
unrelated to work, has nothing to do with my job as a 
teacher, but it's the perception that I'm homosexual, that's 
my orientation, and you're firing me."  I think he would 
have a case under ENDA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you go into the case, too, 
Bob, out of Canada where a mayor ran into an interesting 
circumstance, to help people understand how some of these 
things have broken out?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. The gays use the rhetoric of 
fairness:  gays just want to be left alone.  But I think the 
situation in an Ontario town, Hamilton, proves the opposite. 
The mayor was approached by gay rights groups and asked to 
create a gay pride week, and he said, "Well, this is a 
Catholic, blue-collar town.  I don't think so.  You know, I 
have nothing against you guys, but I'm not going to proclaim 
a pride in something most people think is wrong."

<p>

They hauled him before the Human Rights Commission 
in Ontario, and he was threatened with a fine of $5,000 
personally for hate-mongering and bigotry because he 
wouldn't celebrate homosexuality.  So that's not exactly 
asking to be left alone and just being tolerant.

<p>

This is a very aggressive agenda that is designed 
to harness the power of law to force affirmation of 
homosexuality on everybody else, because, as you asked, are 
gays doing okay in the workplace?  Yes, I would say so.  The 
surveys show they are among the top group in per capita 
income, disposable income, college degrees, advanced 
degrees, even frequent flyer miles.  I mean, they travel a 
lot.  The gay magazines are full of luxury items.  They're 
not hurting.  They're not hurting like blacks were after 
years of racism and Jim Crow laws.  They just don't meet the 
requirement for a put-upon minority group.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think one thing that we have to 
do, from the Family Research Council, we are always looking 
at what happens to children.  Looking at the DOMA and the 
gay civil rights bill, one of the things that we are all 
seeing a lot of is lesbian couples adopting -- this has 
become very vogue lately -- and a lot of controversy now 
that we are in the back-to-school time about human sexuality 
classes, and whether or not we say that homosexuality exists 
or whether we say that it is morally neutral and people are 
just as welcome to enter that as any other lifestyle.

<p>

How do you think a gay civil rights bill would 
affect lesbian or homosexual adoptions or the kinds of 
things that we teach in a sex education class?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it would be a tremendous boost 
to the attempts by homosexuals to adopt children.  We saw 
that in a Florida case right after Amendment 2 was shot down 
by the Supreme Court.  That was the Colorado amendment that 
said you can't make sexual orientation a specially protected 
class.  A lesbian lawyer misinterpreted the ruling but used 
it in a case, an adoption case, saying the Supreme Court 
says you can't discriminate in any way against homosexuals, 
even in parenting.  And, of course, the Court never said any 
such thing, but that is the kind of thing that happens when 
you enshrine the concept of sexual orientation within the 
law.

<p>

There is a perception that if it ain't illegal, 
it's okay, and if you raise the bar even higher and say not 
only isn't it illegal but we're going to give it special 
benefits and privileges we don't give just any behavior, 
we're going to make --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Because we're celebrating it.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: We're celebrating, we're protecting 
it.  Society has a stake in making sure people continue to 
engage in homosexual behavior.  That's what they're saying.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to keep up with 
you, Bob, on what happens as I know this comes back, and 
when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you some highlights 
from the Democratic National Convention and we'll see how 
the Democrats addressed issues affecting you and your 
family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Scenes from the Chicago Democratic National 
Convention, then segments from Celebration of Life rally 
held August 26, 1996, follow:]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RALPH HALL: Let me just say to 
you, to set the stage for brevity for the other Members of 
Congress and the other people who will speak, I served in 
the Texas Senate for 10 years, I served as a judge for 12 
years, I have been 16 years in the House of Representatives.
I have heard testimony from fathers and mothers.  I have 
heard testimony from pastors.  I have heard testimony from 
men and women of medicine.  I have heard testimony for all 
those years, and after hearing all of that from the word go, 
with rancor toward none but prayers for all, I come down on 
the side of life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE COLLIN PETERSON:  . . . and I think 
one of the good things about the fact that you're here at 
this convention and your presence is here is that you're 
getting at what we've been trying to do in the Congress, and 
that is to try to end some of the partisanship, to try to 
have some common-sense solutions to things, and try to end 
all this bickering and fighting that goes on between the 
parties.

<p>

We have worked hard to do that.  I hope that your 
organizations and your groups will look at Members of 
Congress based on what their beliefs are, what their voting 
records are, and where they stand on the issues, and not 
necessarily what party they belong to.

<p>

There are 43 members of the House of 
Representatives that vote pro-life 100 percent of the time. 
You can count on us to be there all the time. That's 
almost a fourth of the Democratic Caucus. There are a lot 
of people that are pro-life in the Democratic Party.  I am 
one of those people.  I am proud to be pro-life. . .

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE BART STUPAK: The issue before us 
today is not about the politics of choice but the deeply 
held principles of life and living.  The issue before us 
today is not about allowing the continuation of ghastly and 
objectionable procedures but of rededicating ourselves to 
the belief that all children should be protected.  They 
should live, and they should be allowed to grow.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. RALPH REED: Our message to President Clinton,
Al Gore, and Chris Dodd is, we will not allow you to drive 
pro-lifers out of the Democratic Party.  This party is going 
to continue to have pro-life activists.

<p>

[Conclusion of DNC segments.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It was wonderful to see the pro-life 
Democrats speaking out at rallies such as the one held by 
the Christian Coalition and the National Right to Life 
Committee.

<p>

Here to discuss the Democratic National Convention 
and its impact on America's families, we are joined by 
Maureen Roselli, executive director of the Catholic 
Alliance, and Cathy Deeds, deputy director of government 
relations for FRC.  Welcome to you both.

<p>

You all were both in Chicago taking a pro-family, 
pro-life message to the Democratic convention.  Whom did you 
find there that was willing to hear that message?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, we were very fortunate. As
you said, Christian Coalition hosted a rally called 
Celebration of Life on Monday.  We had that at the Field 
Museum.  It was attended by over 450 people, which was 
wonderful.  Collin Peterson and Representatives Stenholm, 
Stupak, and Volkmer all spoke at that rally.  So it was 
wonderful to see the Representatives come out, talk about 
the pro-life movement, and be so supported by such a large 
number of pro-life Democrats.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Who do you think represents the pro-family 
and pro-life constituency within the Democratic 
Party?  Certainly a lot of people talk about Reagan 
Democrats in terms of a lot of blue-collar family people and 
Catholics nationwide.  Do you think that still represents 
the group that really resonates with that message?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, certainly as Catholics we 
embrace the pro-life movement because it's a doctrinal issue 
with our faith. You cannot be anti-life and be a Catholic. 
So certainly those Catholics who are in the Democratic 
Party should be going toward the pro-life movement.
Certainly Governor Casey has been a wonderful example of 
that in the Democratic Party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: He now heads the American Families Organization.

<p>

And, Cathy, I know you were there for Family 
Research Council.  What did you find as you were looking for 
people to talk with about a pro-family message?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Well, of course, as you know, Kristi, 
Family Research Council is a nonpartisan organization, but 
we feel like our issues and our message transcend political 
parties, so FRC wanted to have a presence at both the 
Republican and the Democratic conventions.

<p>

Although it was a little more limited in the sense 
that we had to talk about maybe fewer issues that some 
Democratic people would be concerned about, we brought some 
messages to the various delegates, like -- we can get into 
those later on -- partial-birth abortion and family tax 
relief, the Defense of Marriage Act, which many of them 
should and do support.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about that in a moment.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i>
continues our discussion of the Democratic National 
Convention. Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking about the 
Democratic National Convention and the impact of policy 
discussed there on America's families.  I am joined by some 
key players in the fight for life, Maureen Roselli, 
executive director for the Catholic Alliance, and Cathy 
Deeds, the Family Research Council's deputy director of 
government relations.  Welcome back.

<p>

There were some issues that sent both of you to 
Chicago.  Maureen, what were you hoping to talk about?  What 
issues had the Catholic Alliance said, look, these are our 
key issues?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, the key issue that we wanted 
to bring for the Democratic Party was, of course, the pro-life 
issue.  We went to participate in the Celebration of 
Life that was hosted by Christian Coalition and National 
Right to Life, as I mentioned before.  Unfortunately, we 
found not as much tolerance for that discussion as we found 
in perhaps the other convention.

<p>

We, of course, are a nonpartisan organization. As 
a matter of fact, half of our advisory board is Democrat, 
and our membership is well represented by both Democrats and 
Republicans and even independents who join our organization.

<p>

But we basically found that the platform of the 
Democratic Party is so extreme, and it is only embraced by 
perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the population, and that platform 
is that abortion should be granted on demand and paid for by 
tax dollars.

<p>

So, really, as I said, it is only embraced by 5 to 
10 percent of the people, and we believe that, generally, 
Democrats are much more mainstream on this issue, and 
certainly Catholic Democrats are far more pro-life.  In a 
recent poll, it was discovered that 10 to 15 percent of 
Catholics would not vote for the Democratic Party because of 
the partial-birth abortion issue, even though they were 
Democrat.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Partial-birth abortion is a 
tremendous rallying cry right now.  Cathy, there is going to 
be an event tomorrow, Thursday, surrounding that.  Could you 
tell us a little bit more about that?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Yes, our listeners might be interested 
to know that. A very unprecedented event, really, that we 
expect about 100 Catholic bishops, and all of the Catholic 
cardinals in the United States are going to be here in 
Washington, and they are going to the Capitol to really 
plead with President Clinton one final time, or actually to 
Congress to override the President's veto of (the) partial-birth 
abortion (ban).

<p>

Partial-birth abortion is a good example when 
we are talking about pro-life Democrats, because, as 
everyone probably knows by now, it was such a bipartisan-supported 
bill, and more than 72 Democrats voted to ban this 
procedure.  And yet this President that says he wants to 
make abortion safe, legal, and rare, he could have done that 
by signing this bill, and he vetoed it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And to describe this horrible thing, 
a child, generally a child that could live outside the womb,
is delivered feet first into the birth canal, stabbed in the 
base of the skull, living brain tissue suctioned out, and 
then the dead child delivered, a child that the developer of 
that procedure said could live, that the majority of these 
horrible procedures are done on viable babies.

<p>

This has been a tremendous rallying cry for 
Republicans and Democrats.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes, absolutely, and it has been a 
really unifying issue for Catholics as well.  As Cathy said, 
the bishops have, in an unprecedented move this summer, 
asked people to participate in a postcard campaign on 
partial-birth abortion.  Even the Holy Father spoke out 
against this heinous crime, which is really, as Helen 
Alvarey(?) said, four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth 
abortion.

<p>

Catholic Alliance mailed out over 572,000 letters 
to Americans, Catholic Americans, educating them about this 
horrible procedure, and we have received tremendous response 
calling for the override of the President's veto.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What was your experience when you 
talked to the people at the Democratic National Convention 
about partial-birth abortion, which has been certainly a 
rallying cry, and then the life issue in general?  Were they 
interested in talking to you all about that?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Well, as a matter of fact, it was 
quite difficult in some sense, and I was reading a poll 
during the convention that said more than 60 percent of the 
convention delegates were pro-abortion, and in fact 77 
percent of the delegates supported the President's veto of 
the partial-birth abortion bill, clearly out of step with 
mainstream America and even Democrats, because we know about 
a third of self-identified Democrats are pro-life.

<p>

So we kind of had a difficult time breaking in to 
that particular audience, but we still tried, and what 
Family Research Council generally did was kind of just pass 
out our information on the partial-birth abortion.  People 
seemed thankful.  We had a few conversations.  But I don't 
know how well it really resonated.  We got a lot of paper 
out there.  Hopefully, people will be contacting us.
Hopefully, it dispelled some of the myths that they are 
hearing certainly from the White House, unfortunately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The myths on partial-birth abortions.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Did you find that people were 
generally uninformed about the realities?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, I think, like Family Research 
Council, Catholic Alliance, our contact at the Democratic 
convention was almost limited to those people who are 
already pro-life and pro-family.  We attended the Wednesday 
rally that was held outside of the actual convention.  There 
was a large rally; about 1,500 people attended.  Catholic 
Alliance was there and Family Research Council was there, as 
well, and they were passing out their fine information on 
the partial-birth abortion ban.

<p>

But I found that it was generally the people who 
were already pro-life who were taking that information, who 
were willing to talk to us about partial-birth abortion or 
any life issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Frustrating.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: But that was another reason to be 
there, as well, to be of support for these pro-life 
Democratic heroes who really are in the minority and are 
oftentimes kind of punished or pushed to the side; nobody 
wants to hear from them.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: And we found that that was so, even 
though the Democratic Party talked about their "conscience 
clause" that is now in their platform, that they are 
supposed to be tolerant of the -- quote, unquote -- 
intolerant pro-lifers.

<p>

So even though that may be part of their platform 
now, our experience was still that we generally were only 
received by those people who were already, again, pro-life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There were some interesting 
contrasts in the two platforms, and we are going to have to 
talk about that in a moment.  More about the Democratic 
National Convention when we return.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are discussing the 
Democrats' role in the fight for America's families, and to 
help in that discussion, I am joined once again by Maureen 
Roselli and Cathy Deeds.  Maureen, I have to apologize in 
saying your name wrong the entire time.

<p>

It was interesting, though, to contrast -- Family 
Research Council was at San Diego and at Chicago, both, and 
the brouhaha over the way in which the Republicans weren't 
equally pro-abortion and pro-life seemed absent from the 
Democratic convention.  Did you find that the Democrats had 
more unanimity on this point and that is why it wasn't worth 
reporting?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, actually, I think it was 
really a media decision; at least that is what we found.  
There are the same number of pro-abortion Republicans as 
there are pro-life Democrats, and yet the pro-abortion 
Republicans received much more media attention than the pro-life 
Democrats did at their convention.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And how many is that?  That's 40?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: It's 40, roughly.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: It's roughly about the same number, 
because we lack -- we oftentimes rely on those pro-life 
Democrats to make up the votes that the pro-abortion 
Republicans -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which is kind of an untold story in 
a lot of pro-life votes -- 

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Yes, I don't think people realize -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- is that there is a solid voting 
bloc of pro-life Democrats.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And so, even though the numbers were 
the same, the coverage seemed very different then.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: It did, and there seemed to be much 
more attention drawn to the pro-abortion Republicans because 
there seemed to be more perhaps media pressure to change the 
platform of the Republican Party than there was to change 
the platform of the Democratic Party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Republican Party had a very 
strong pro-life plank, you know, very much a commitment to 
the unborn. And then they said, although we recognize that 
there are people with different views, and we want to be 
kind and respectful to each other.

<p>

And the Democrats.  Describe to us -- you said 
earlier a very extreme platform, but a lot of media 
attention was made about their so-called tolerance language, 
as well.  Was that reflected?  At the Republican convention, 
we saw a lot of pro-abortion speakers.  And at the 
Democratic convention, what did you all find?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, we know that Tony Hall was 
able to speak at the Democratic convention, but of course, 
what he was able to say was very limited.  When Cynthia 
McKinney of Georgia, who is a pro-abortionist, called for 
tolerance of the pro-life people in her party, she was met 
by silence at the convention.

<p>

So I think that certainly at the Republican Party, 
the Republicans seemed to go a little more out of their way 
to represent the pro-abortion side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What was your experience, Cathy?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Just to add onto that, I think the 
Democrats were certainly more representative at their 
convention of their platform.  As we have been saying, their 
platform -- very extreme; it reaffirms the <i>Roe v. Wade</i>
decision, which is abortion on demand; no sort of call for 
any sort of restrictions; no support at all for the partial-
birth abortion (ban), which we said many, many Democrats 
supported, and then the speakers were consistently pro-
abortion.  Kate Michaelman(?) -- it was not shown on prime 
time, but the head of a national abortion rights group did 
talk about abortion and her own abortion.  I think that is 
very, very sad.

<p>

On the other hand, we saw in San Diego a very, 
very strong pro-life platform, very, very compassionate, 
wonderful language; and yet where were the pro-life speakers 
on the platform in San Diego?  We had wonderful heroes.  
Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde, who did chair the platform 
committee -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Republican platform.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Right, the Republican platform -- he 
did speak at the convention, and he maybe had one line about 
the sanctity of human life.  But he was not able, it was my 
understanding, to give a specifically pro-life speech.  We 
certainly didn't have the president of National Right to 
Life giving any sort of speech, and in fact, it seems like 
the Republicans went out of their way to be tolerant of 
people like Colin Powell and Susan Molinari and other fairly 
prominent pro-abortion Republicans who reminded us of that 
of the platform.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: I think we have to say Governor 
Casey also experienced a repeat of four years ago.  He even 
went to Chicago to wait for the call so that he could go -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Governor Casey, the former governor of Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: That is right, the former governor 
of Pennsylvania, a pro-life Democrat and really quite a 
sophisticated Democrat, was denied the right again this year 
to speak at his convention, the party that he has supported 
all of his life.  So again, he experienced that.  He went 
even to Chicago this time and waited for a phone call; still 
was not allowed to talk.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It wasn't quite the tolerant thing 
that we heard about in the news, it would seem.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you for sharing your 
stories and thank you even more so for going there to 
encourage the pro-life Democrats that we all know and work 
with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are discussing some solutions
to the current predicament of our education system.  It's
back-to-school time for children and parents across the
country, who face decisions ranging from school choice, or
lack of choice, to how to deal with controversial student
curriculum.

<p>

We will be talking to Congressman Lindsey Graham, 
who has proposed new steps toward education reform, and we 
will also be talking to a man who founded an organization 
which provides less privileged children and their parents 
with school choice.  You won't want to miss hearing what is 
happening in education on tonight's show.

<p>

But first, we will be taking you to an historical 
event that took place just last week.  Catholic cardinals 
and bishops, along with other religious leaders from across 
the country, gathered to lead prayer on the steps of our 
Nation's Capitol.  Their prayers were pleas for the lives of 
unborn children and appeals to our Congress as they vote to 
override the President's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act, a vote that could come even tomorrow.

<p>

This is very timely because, just hours ago, the 
Clinton Administration successfully pushed the FDA approval 
of the abortion-causing drug, RU 486.  The Family Research 
Council is already targeting this historical decision, and 
we will keep you informed of that decision's consequences.

<p>

You may have caught a glimpse of the powerful day 
of prayer in your newspaper or on your local newscast, but 
we have much more to show you as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

[Segments from Prayer for Life at the Capitol, held September 
12, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. HELEN ALVARES: We come here today to pray at 
the place where life-and-death decisions are being made by 
lawmakers, decisions which affect the very most defenseless 
among us, the unborn.  We will pray for members of Congress, 
for mothers and fathers tempted to abortion, for all 
children -- born, unborn, nearly born -- for many others who 
are threatened in some way.

<p>

As you know, within a few weeks, the House and the 
Senate will vote on the override of the Presidential veto of 
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.  We therefore pray for 
members of Congress to act on their obligation to defend 
life and to reject the cruel destruction of infants only 
seconds away from taking their first breath.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL JAMES HICKEY: Brothers and sisters, you 
and I stand at the edge of a new century and a new 
millennium.  Either it will be an era of life or an era of 
death.  Either we will protect life or destroy it.  With all 
our hearts, with all that is within us, we pray this day and 
every day that our nation will choose to protect life, the 
life of the unborn child in the womb, the life of the child 
as he or she is being born, also the life of the frail 
elderly and the terminally ill.

<p>

We ask Almighty God to give us the wisdom to 
reject the culture of death and, instead, to embrace the 
culture of life.  We come here not as political leaders nor 
as lobbyists, but we come as men and women of different 
faiths who are united in prayer and united in a common 
cause, and our cause is life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL WILLIAM KEELER: Here today are those 
from other churches who support the culture of life.  
Together, we are bound by our support of life and by our 
opposition to partial-birth abortion.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

PASTOR GEORGE ANDERSON: Indeed, men and women of 
faith -- Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim 
people -- are one, are allies, as we stand in defense of 
children and the family.  We stand united against this 
hideous and inhuman abortion procedure.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL BERNARD LAW: We gather on the steps of 
our Nation's Capitol to pray.  Mindful of our obligation to 
the littlest, the weakest, and the most forgotten, we pray. 
Hopeful that those who work in this place will know the 
right and do it, we pray.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL JOSEPH BERNADIN: If you obey the 
commandments of the Lord your God, which I command on you 
this day, by loving the Lord your God, by walking in His 
ways, and by keeping His commandments and His statutes and 
His ordinances, then you shall live.  Therefore, choose 
life, that you and your descendants may live, loving the 
Lord your God, obeying His voice, and cleaving to Him, for 
that means life to you and length of days.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REV. JEFFREY BROWN: If a man has 100 sheep and 
one of them goes astray, will he not leave the 99 in the 
hills and go in search of the stray?  And if he finds it, 
amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the 
99 that did not stray.  In just the same way, it is not the 
will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones 
be lost.

<p>

[Conclusion of segments from Prayer for Life at the Capitol.]

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The sinking test scores of U.S. 
students over the course of the past few years have forced 
parents, teachers, and politicians alike to face a crisis 
which permeates our schools today.  Despite many attempts to 
fix our education system, the harsh reality remains:  poor 
student performance has many underlying causes and no easy 
solutions.

<p>

In 1994 Congress made its own attempt to improve 
student performance by passing legislation called Goals 
2000.  The bill set in place national curriculum standards. 
Controversial from its outset, Goals 2000 added to the 
power of the Department of Education by allowing the Federal 
Government to interfere with school curriculum.  Previously, 
such involvement was prohibited, and without this important 
restriction, parents have almost no voice against decisions 
made by Washington bureaucrats.

<p>

Like most things that come out of Washington, 
Goals 2000 also has a power game attached.  In exchange for 
federal money, school districts must conform to national 
attitudinal and behavioral standards.  These take away the 
emphasis on learning and place it on socialization.  In 
essence, Goals 2000 standards allow conflict resolution 
training and comprehensive sex education to overshadow 
instruction in basic skills like grammar and math, even at 
the elementary school level.

<p>

Goals 2000 proponents claim the program gives 
local parents and teachers important decision-making 
authority.  In fact, the only choice Goals 2000 leaves at 
the local level is whether or not to participate.  Several 
states, including Virginia, New Hampshire, Montana, and 
Alabama, rejected the Goals 2000 money, giving up access to 
the federal tax dollars in exchange for local control of 
schools.  But, whether or not a state participates in Goals 
2000, every taxpayer foots the bill.  And the battle over 
who defines good education rages on.

<p>

The controversy over Goals 2000 brought a recent 
flurry of activity on Capitol Hill.  To clear up confusion 
about some recent governmental decisions regarding Goals 
2000, I am joined by Congressman Lindsey Graham, who just 
this morning introduced a bill that would stop federal 
funding of Goals 2000.

<p>

We are also joined by Jennifer A. Marshall, FRC's 
education policy analyst.  Jennifer keeps families, 
educators, and legislators informed on all the hot education 
issues.

<p>

Welcome, both of you, to the show.

<p>

You know, Congressman, when I came to Washington 
in the 1980s -- I have actually been here now almost 10 
years -- we were going to get rid of the Department of 
Education.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: We're still talking about it, aren't we?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we're still talking about that.
And then Goals 2000 came up, and so we were just going to 
fix the Department of Education.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But why do you want to get rid of 
Goals 2000 and defund it?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, let's talk about 
what we are trying to do with this legislation.  Goals 2000 
was an idea that came out of the Bush Administration about 
having national standards to compete in a global economy.  
That sounds really good on paper, that we are going to have 
school districts pushing at the 21st century so our kids can 
compete with the Japanese and the Germans.

<p>

The problem is, when you start taking national 
standards and implementing them, the agenda of the 
bureaucracy gets put in place.  And, to be honest with you, 
the NEA owns the Democratic education agenda; they own the 
Department of Education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The National Education Association.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The teachers' unions.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: The teachers' unions, okay.

<p>

They are a very liberal group.  To deny that is to 
deny the obvious.  It is not a crime to be liberal; I just 
disagree.  If the conservatives take over the White House, 
which we will one day, I really don't believe it is good for 
America to have a conservative agenda coming out of the 
federal Department of Education.  I think these decisions 
need to be made at home.

<p>

So what we are doing is taking the $350 million 
that is allocated for Goals 2000 that would be run through 
the Department of Education and come home in dribbles; we 
are just going to bypass the Department of Education and the 
Federal Government and write the check to the states, who 
will in turn give it to the local school districts, and we 
are going to get the money home as quickly as possible.

<p>

There is a dynamic that has existed for a long 
time.  Six percent of the education funding in America comes 
from Washington.  Fifty percent of the mandates come out of 
Washington, D.C.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So for six pennies on the dollar, 
they are calling all the shots.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, in politics, the 
power is really the power of the purse.  If I can control 
your agenda by telling you what to do through legislation 
and mandates, I own you politically.  If I can tell a county 
council and a city council what they must do to comply with 
federal law, then I have taken a lot of their resources and 
directed how they spend it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: I don't give them the 
money, but I tell them what to do.  The same way in 
education.  If I can control the mandate part of education, 
how you teach, then I own your curriculum, I own you 
politically.  And I don't want to own anybody.  What I want 
to do is free up the parents, the teachers, and the local 
school officials and give them a shot at getting this money 
quickly and let them build a bridge to the 21st century that 
will be built on solid ground.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jennifer, are there any horror 
stories to come out of what we have seen of Goals 2000 so 
far, or are we just seeing people being asked to be sure 
that fifth graders can do algebra?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, it is certainly not the 
latter, and in fact, with the push for more and more social 
services to be offered in schools, we are seeing tragic 
cases like the one in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, 
where 60 young girls, adolescent girls, were told to strip 
down to their underwear, wait -- scared little girls; some 
were prevented from calling their mothers -- and they then 
proceeded to have genital exams.  That is just horrific, and 
there was no parental warning there.

<p>

This is the kind of thing that happens when 
schools think they play a bigger role in kids' health than 
the parents do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, I am sure you have 
heard this argument as many times as I have:  Well, the 
reason why we need federal standards is not for the good 
parents that would take their children to the doctor but all 
of those terrible parents out there that wouldn't.  Will 
Goals 2000 get at the liberal straw man of the terrible 
parents abandoning their kids?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: I think what we need to do 
in Washington is get behind labels.  Drug-free schools.  
That's a label that sounds great.  Goals 2000.  It sounds 
like a good program to move the country forward.  Let's look 
at education results over the last 30 years and see if it is 
rational to continue to turn to the Federal Government.

<p>

Since 1965, test scores in this country have 
plummeted.  They have gone literally downhill at a dramatic 
rate, all-time lows.  Dropout rates are up.  Schools are not 
safe to go to anymore.  And what we have realized is that 
every time we increase the power of the Federal Government, 
the best we do is become stagnant.

<p>

So the evidence is in pretty clearly that for the 
last 16 or 17 years, turning to an exclusive federal remedy 
is not working.  We are not improving test scores.  We are 
not enhancing learning.  We are not getting parents more 
involved; they are less involved.

<p>

So let's do something different.  Let's take the 
money that would be spent through federal bureaucracies with 
a federal stamp of approval and free up the resources at the 
local level, give people more money, and let parents and 
teachers and local school officials sit down and design a 
curriculum that they feel good about, that the good parents 
feel good about, and that really addresses the bad parents 
in a local community, because all bad parents are not alike.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, it is interesting.
Education Secretary Riley had this huge news conference 
about six months ago about how we know that if parents are 
involved, children do better, and in fact, the data was 
interesting that even if you had shown up at a PTA meeting, 
your children then were more likely to do well; that parents 
who were involved had children who did better.

<p>

And then we move all the curriculum decisions to 
Washington, D.C.  I mean, what have you seen, Jennifer, in 
terms of involved parents equalling better educated 
children?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, there are mounds and mounds 
of research that say parents are the single most important 
factor in their kids' educational achievement.  It has been 
proven by home schoolers, it has been proven by Christian 
schoolers, public schoolers.  Any environment, parents are 
the key factor.

<p>

So that just calls more and more for the decisions 
being made locally, by parents who care.  You know, the 
Washington bureaucrats -- Secretary Riley, Bill Clinton -- 
don't care more about our kids than we do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, I think one thing that 
is interesting in some of the debate is the discussion of 
the fact that Bill Clinton and Al Gore have their children 
in private, faith-based schools, as do the majority of the 
Washington elite.  And then you have Goals 2000, on the 
other hand, dictating what your children will learn, even 
though I wouldn't put my child in that school.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right. Well, let's agree 
on something.  Secretary Riley is from South Carolina; I am 
from South Carolina.  I know he cares about the kids in this 
country.  I am sure President Clinton does.  He cares about 
his daughter, and as a parent, he made a good decision.  He 
tried to put his daughter in the best educational 
environment he could find for her so she would be safe and 
she would learn.  He did what every parent in America should 
do.

<p>

What I am saying is, let's give the parents of 
America some of the resources that would filter through our 
bureaucracy; give it to them directly in conjunction with 
our local school officials and see if they can create an 
environment where they can send their kid to a public school 
or maybe a private school that they feel better about.

<p>

This idea that you can only have compassion if you 
spend money in Washington and you can only trust quality 
coming out of Washington is a dismal failure.  Just look at 
the evidence.  I don't have any children, but I am a 
taxpayer, and one day I hope to have a family.  But I can 
tell you from a taxpayer's point of view, we are spending 
$120 billion cycling through federal bureaucracies, not just 
the Department of Education -- it is only $32 billion -- so 
there is $120 billion being spent through Washington, D.C., 
bureaucracies, and the children and the teachers are getting 
about 26 cents of the dollar.  If you designed a business 
this way, you would go broke in a week.

<p>

So we are trying to get a new formula, what she 
just said.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a 
Ph.D. to figure out that the best way to have a quality 
school is have moms and dads showing up at PTA meetings, 
having kids go, with teachers who have the power to teach 
and are not micromanaged from afar.  This is simple, basic 
stuff that served our country well for 180 years.  Only 
since the Great Society have we seen a bottoming out of 
education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's interesting, isn't it?  I mean, 
I saw a chart just the other day -- I think it was from the 
Heritage Foundation, another conservative organization -- 
that was saying that they looked at the beginning of the 
Department of Education and tracked test scores with its 
inception and growth, and it was one of those things; it was 
almost an anti-chart, you know, a mirror image of, as the 
federal role has increased, the educational system has done 
much poorer.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, the dropout rates 
are at an all-time high.  The test scores, SAT quantitative 
test scores, have gone down a tremendous amount.  In 1965 
they were about 950.  They have really dropped, and they are 
just stagnant now.

<p>

All the money we spend in Washington and all the 
bureaucracies we have created in Washington have, at best, 
kept us stagnant.  I am looking for a different way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, has anything good come 
out of Goals 2000?  I mean, you were there to defund it 
today. Is there any good news with that bad news pill?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, everybody says it is 
a voluntary program and it has done a lot but we can't get 
-- well, if it is voluntary, why not just -- you know, 
what's the big deal about getting rid of it?  If there is no 
federal control, why is everybody so dead-set in the NEA and 
other liberals of hanging onto it?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what do they say to that?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, they just said,
Well, there is no micromanaging.  Well, why not just get rid 
of it?  There is.  Obviously, there is.  That is why they 
are fighting for it.

<p>

Their agenda can never survive at the local level.
You would never have homosexual awareness week in most 
school districts.  The only way you are going to have it is 
to have a power base in Washington, D.C., that mandates 
curriculum that goes the liberal way.  You cannot win these 
wars at the local level.  So if they can consolidate money 
and power in Washington, then they can control the 
curriculum, but only then.

<p>

So what we are trying to do is destroy a breeding 
ground that is going to lead to more federal intervention, 
is going to lead to more NEA-type doctrine, because this is 
surely the first step along a long road of more federal 
involvement.

<p>

Let's nip it in the bud now.  Let's take the money 
back home, send it directly with no carrying charges, and 
see in a few years from now if we have a better school 
system.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We know, Congressman, that you have 
to get back to the Hill.  It's a busy week.  Before you go, 
we have been talking a lot about partial-birth abortion, as 
I am sure you are aware of.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We appreciate your taking this quick 
moment out.  Any word as people are looking -- they are 
saying it might come up tomorrow, might come up next week.
How does that look, Congressman?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, it's a fluid 
situation right now.  Please get on the phones, write 
letters.  Don't send them to my office.  We are going to 
vote to override the veto.  Get involved.  I think this is 
one that we have a shot at winning.  The Catholic Church has 
gotten behind the issue.  There is a real faith-based 
coalition growing out there.

<p>

Pro-choice people voted against this procedure 
because it is so ghastly.  If you look at the facts, if you 
look at exactly what we do to children under this procedure, 
it is a blight on America.  And if we cannot come together 
and stop this, I am really very disappointed in my 
government right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Congressman, for being 
with us. Jennifer, we will see more of you in a moment.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will bring you more 
about America's education standards, and we will introduce 
you to a man who is helping give parents some new choices.  
Please stay with us.

[Segments from Washington Scholarship Fund FUNDay, 
held September 15, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MR. RANDALL BYRNES (Co-Chairman): We feel at the 
Washington Scholarship Fund, when we start these children in 
the programs, their age is kindergarten, they start in 
kindergarten and they go all the way up through the eighth 
grade, and at ages 5 through 14, those are the most 
formative ages in their lives, and we feel as though it is 
important that they get the kind of quality education and 
the nurturing that, unfortunately, they are not getting in 
the public school system.

<p>

So by virtue of having them go to whatever private 
school they deem desirable -- most of them are schools in 
their neighborhoods, Catholic schools and other independent 
schools -- then they can get a good start in life and 
receive the kind of attention and care and discipline and 
value system, as well as the education, that will put them 
in good stead for life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. ROBERT THOMPSON (Co-Chairman): When we 
started it two and a half or three years ago, the Washington 
Times ran a full-page ad gratis for a couple of days.  Since 
that time, it has been all word of mouth.  We have 225 
children on scholarship, but we have 600 on the waiting 
list.

<p>

What Randy and I consider our main role is to 
figure out a way to raise enough money to take those 600 
kids off the waiting list.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. GEORGE JOCHUM (Board Member): Well, we first 
heard about the Washington Scholarship Fund through a 
friend, and we really liked the concept that you help young 
people get a better education.  What is extraordinary about 
this is it is just not a gift.  The parents, who are less 
affluent than most, have to pay half.  So you feel like you 
are truly making a contribution, not only for the children 
but also for the parents.  The parents are making great 
sacrifices.

<p>

MS. CRIS JOCHUM: And we certainly understand how 
important education is and also understand how important it 
is that the parents are committed to education.  And that is 
what is so great about this program, because the parents are 
as involved as the children are or they couldn't be in the 
program.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. LYNDON BILAL (Recipient Parent): I got the 
<i>Washington Times</i> newspaper on a Saturday evening and went in 
to work, and my concern was how am I going to be able to 
send these children to a school that I would like to send 
them to, which for me it's an Islamic school.  And so I was 
blessed to see that article in the <i>Washington Times</i>, and 
then I immediately filled it out and faxed it in that night.
I have three children that are being sponsored by 
Washington Scholarship Fund, and I have four children in the 
school, but only three of them are being sponsored, but that 
is a tremendous help.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: I found out about the program 
through my aunt at one of the libraries up in Georgetown, 
and I called and applied for the scholarship fund and 
waited, and I got the scholarship.  I have one child.  She 
is 5.  I want her to have a good foundation to start, and I 
think it's the best considering the public school situation 
that is around us.  And she is doing an excellent job, and I 
really, really want to thank the scholarship fund.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: Well, I wanted them to get a 
better education through Saint Augustine.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: It's a little more disciplined 
attitudes, all of that,  It's different, the learning -- I 
don't know, it's more or less like they want to learn.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. THOMPSON: This is my way of trying to give 
something back to the community, and I believe it is the 
best return on a charitable dollar because we are giving 
these young kids an opportunity to get a very good education 
as well as the values that go with that.

<p>

[Conclusion of segments.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you just witnessed, the 
Washington Scholarship Fund is impacting the lives of 
parents and their children's education.

<p>

With us today is Doug Dewey, the founding 
president of the National Scholarship Center and the 
executive director of the Washington Scholarship Fund.  Also 
with us again is Jennifer A. Marshall, FRC's education 
policy analyst, who brings us education innovators such as 
Doug.

<p>

Welcome very much.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, your program is very unique, 
and we are going to hear a lot about it in these next couple 
of minutes.  But one of the key functions of it is to get 
parents involved in their children's education.  Why is 
that?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, as Jennifer said, the evidence 
is just overwhelming that that is the number one indicator 
of success for schooling, and that is no different for low-
income, underprivileged children in inner cities.

<p>

What our program does, it is kind of a tough-love 
scholarship program.  We provide half of the tuition for any 
non-government school that a family wishes to send their 
children to, up to a maximum of $1,500 a year, and the 
parents are responsible to pay the rest.

<p>

You have to understand that the average annual 
income of the parents in our program is $14,000.  So they 
are making an incommensurate sacrifice on behalf of their 
children.  We send the checks to the schools from September 
to June, and they are written out to the mother and to the 
school.  They have to be endorsed by the mother.  That keeps 
them involved, knowing that they have to pay -- some of them 
pay on a weekly basis and, we have even heard, in rolls of 
quarters.  Some of them pay on a monthly basis.  But all of 
them are owners of their education, and they take great 
pride in that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you have found it's not an 
income-level outcome, but it is an involvement outcome that 
has made a difference?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, definitely. As I say, our average 
income is very low.  But I think if I had to point to a 
single difference of why these people are doing so well -- 
in the private schools in the inner city, regardless of 
whether they are Catholic or Christian or non-denominational 
or non-sectarian, they all have about a 95 to 99 percent 
graduate rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. Compare that for us, 
Jennifer, quickly, with schools at large.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I think we are talking about 70s.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So 70 percent national average.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: And about 40 percent in the District 
of Columbia.  And not only that, the children go on to 
college at a rate of about 85 percent, and they complete 
college.

<p>

So they are the children from the same 
neighborhoods, from the same demographic facts, that you 
would look at them and all of those expectations that they 
would not succeed, and yet they do.

<p>

So again, if I had to point to one thing, apart 
from all of the faith and the discipline and the things that 
people talk about that exist in private schools, I think it 
is that ownership of education which comes with paying your 
own tuition.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, then, in a way, you must be 
excited about a recent headline out of New York City where 
the Catholic Church has offered to take the 1,000 children 
at the very lowest end of ability in the schools and put 
them into private school.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, indeed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you see that as an answer?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: I do. No one knows yet how the 
program there will be structured, but I think it is a 
courageous offer from Cardinal O'Connor to take the bottom, 
I guess they said 5 percent, but we won't know how they are 
going to structure it.  I would hope, and I would advise if 
I were asked, that they include a parental match component 
in their program.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To get people involved.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That is right, so that all those 
children, their families are paying something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to be coming back in a 
moment, Doug, but if you could tell us, are you concerned -- 
and we can talk more -- that as vouchers develop -- and 
there are experiments in Cleveland and around the country -- 
that that is going to mean federal control of the private 
schools that are doing well by the kids you are talking 
about?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, a lot of people have that 
concern; there's just no doubt about it.  Attempts to pass 
vouchers in different jurisdictions around the country have 
been going on for about 15 years now, and with each 
successive version, in order to try to secure passage and 
enactment, we find more and more compromises.  I think this 
is putting more and more conservatives and Christians and 
home schoolers and others on the alert.

<p>

One of the advantages of privately funded vouchers --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which you have.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That's right -- is that they sidestep 
this whole controversy because they don't use government 
funds.  And so, of course, they carry none of the risks.  If 
I wanted to regulate the schools in my program, I have no 
power to do so.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about that in just a moment. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we 
will continue our discussion on education and how parents 
can make the most of available resources.  Please stay with 
us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are discussing some 
alternative solutions to the decline of education standards.
I am joined by Doug Dewey, president of the National 
Scholarship Center and executive director of the Washington 
Scholarship Fund.  Also joining us is Jennifer A. Marshall, 
FRC's education policy analyst.  Welcome back, both of you.

<p>

You know, Jennifer, there is a lot of frustration 
on the part of parents with the role of government, and you 
see a program like this, in a way, doing an end run.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Oh, yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think about that?  We're 
cutting out the middle man.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, it's wonderful.  You know, we 
get so many questions about what would happen if we 
decreased the federal role in education.  What if we got rid 
of it?  It would be disaster for education.  Well, no, it 
wouldn't.  Things like this would happen.  Things like this 
are happening now.  And they are recapturing education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: These are success stories, Doug, and 
we are excited to present your story.  How did you guys get 
started?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: I was working, I must confess, for 
Lamar Alexander, helping craft America 2000 -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now Goals 2000.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: -- which became Goals 2000, renamed 
and made worse, to be sure, when I came across a program 
started by a chairman of the Golden Rule Insurance Company, 
Patrick Rooney(?), who is in Indianapolis, Indiana.  He had 
made an attempt to get some vouchers for children in 
Indianapolis from the legislature there, failed, and 
somewhat on the rebound of that, decided, well, he will put 
his own money where his mouth is, and he earmarked 
$1.2 million in 1991, announced it in the radio and the 
newspapers in August, and had 1,000 kids in school that 
September.  Now he is entering his sixth year.

<p>

So I wrote about that while I was at the 
department, got very excited.  You may recall the results of 
the 1992 election.  Well, I was a Bush White House 
appointee, so I needed something to do, even if it wasn't 
gainful employment, and we needed this kind of opportunity 
for children in Washington, D.C.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And how long has this program been operating?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: We are going into our third year now. 
We started with 30 children in 1993 and went up to 100 and 
150.  Now we are at 225 children, and we have 600 children 
on the waiting list.

<p>

Our average grant, what we get for the money, is 
$1,000 for each child, and that sends a child to a private 
school for an entire year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know what is amazing about that 
is the District of Columbia's cost per child in education is 
the highest in the nation.  I think it is what, $9,000,
Jennifer?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The highest amount of money, $9,000, 
with violence and the drug problem and the dropout rate.  
And for $1,000, one-ninth of the cost, you are going to put 
a child in a safe and effective educational environment.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doesn't money make the difference?  
If we spent more on education, aren't we going to get more?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, I know of one economist in 
California who has done a study which actually shows an 
inverse relationship between spending and achievement.  But 
I do know that for a little bit of money, you can get a lot 
of impact from these programs.

<p.

After Pat Rooney started his program in 1991, we 
had copycat programs in Milwaukee, San Antonio, Atlanta, and 
now they have spread.  By 1996, right now, we have 28 
programs in 27 jurisdictions around the country, with about 
10,000 low-income children all going to private schools of 
their choosing -- Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Catholic, every 
variety -- and I think that is very exciting and very 
promising.

<p>

And for those who don't like publicly funded 
vouchers, either for conservative reasons or for liberal 
reasons, as it were, this is a great alternative.  This is 
something everybody can be involved in.  On our board we 
have Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and William Bennett as 
our two honorary co-chairmen.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Two different political ends.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Absolutely. And we can all agree, 
low-income parents who want this opportunity for their 
children, it is an appropriate thing for the private sector 
to step in and give them a shot at that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jennifer, what has been the impact 
as programs like this have sprung up nationwide?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, they are the perfect example 
of what can be done and what is done by parents, by 
concerned neighborhood members, who want kids to have good 
education.

<p>

I think this is such a good example, and it is 
great to bring up in our legislative battles here, because 
there is such a mind-set in this beltway that problems can 
only be solved here, and if we don't do it here, those poor 
kids will just not get an education.  It is simply not true. 
There are parents, there are community members who care 
dearly about this and will provide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the District of Columbia 
is a great case study.  Even recently in the political 
realm, I have heard some criticism from one political camp 
to another, you know, if liberalism was so great, why wasn't 
the District doing better?  And it's very sad the way the 
District is often the bad example, and it is unfortunate.

<p>

How are the children doing, though, in your 
program?  How are they faring individually?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, they are doing remarkably well. 
We have about an 85 percent retaining rate, or I guess a 15 
percent attrition rate.  Five percent of that are just 
people that have moved to Prince George's County or another 
county outside of Washington.  We only serve Washington 
children for now.  So I think they are doing extraordinarily 
well.

<p>

We had one child at Saint Augustine School who was 
new to private school, and they were able to get a grant 
from us, and she became valedictorian and is going to attend 
one of the premier Catholic prep schools next year, or this 
year she is just starting.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Wow! That's great.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: We have another boy that we know who 
just got academic prize of the year, and he was also 
formerly in a government school.  So we know that we've got 
not only some superstars but just the fact that they are 
staying in there, that they are having to make an enormous 
discipline adjustment from really very little requirement of 
being disciplined in the government schools to having to sit 
still, not speak out, never fight.  There is a pretty 
dramatic difference between these schools.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How are the children in the 
neighborhood and the families in the neighborhood responding 
as some of these children leave, going to different schools, 
and certainly having a different academic experience?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, that is an outstanding question, 
because I think -- and, again, I don't have a RAND study 
behind me on this so I can only say anecdotally -- I know 
that this program comes home with the child and has an 
effect in the neighborhood.  Mothers will call me and say 
how proud they are that their boy comes home in a uniform.
They tell their friends that they are paying for their 
children's education now; their boy is in private school, or 
their girl.  And then I get neighbors calling me saying, "I 
spoke to my neighbor who is doing this.  I want this for my 
child, too."

<p>

So this is real self-esteem, not the bogus 
injected kind that we sometimes hear about.  And so I think 
it has a great spillover effect to get people charged.

<p>

The other thing it is doing occasionally is it is 
bringing families that are broken apart back together.  
Grandmothers help out, sisters, and estranged fathers come 
back to help pay that tuition.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about private responses to public education.  More about 
your family's options when it comes to education and a 
special report from the Family Research Council.  Please 
stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are talking to some 
movers and shakers in the world of education.  With us are 
Doug Dewey and Jennifer A. Marshall.

<p>

Jennifer, you wrote about Doug's outstanding 
scholarship program in a really special report, the <i>Moms and
Dads' School Survival Guide</i>. We at the Family Research 
Council have been concerned about education for quite a 
while.  People may remember that Gary Bauer was Under 
Secretary of Education with Bill Bennett, one of your board 
members.

<p>

Jennifer, why did you write this publication?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, we hear maybe more than any 
other issue from parents and families about education, and 
we hope that this booklet will be just about everything you 
need to know about schooling and education and the concerns 
you should have.

<p>

One of the things you should know is that you have 
some options, and so we have included the listing of the 
private scholarship programs across the country.  You will 
find it in there, so if anybody is interested across the 
country, they can look to that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If you would like to hear more about 
Doug's program or programs available in your area, you are 
going to want to get one of these.  And, Jennifer, thanks 
for putting it together.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Sure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of problems are people 
faced with in the education system that this might be of 
assistance to them?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I would say the biggest problem -- 
just an overarching summary of it -- is that schools are 
moving more and more into the realms that families have 
filled for years and that are rightfully the role of 
families.  So we have a section in there on parental rights. 
We also have a discussion of current education trends, like 
outcome-based education and Goals 2000, easily 
understandable articles so that parents can be conversant in 
these issues, fight them in their schools.

<p>

We also have a section on education jargon that 
defines these terms that are just batted back and forth 
between education bureaucrats.

<p>

We have another section that describes students' 
religious freedoms in the public schools.  That is an 
important and very misunderstood area.  Many students could 
be exercising much more religious expression and religious 
freedom than they already are.

<p>

So we want students and families to know that and 
then to know about the options that they have if the public 
schools just aren't working for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Doug, as you are working 
with people often in the inner city, one of the things that 
we hear anecdotally, and I wonder if you agree, is that 
people are just intimidated to talk to school educators, 
sort of the tyranny of complexity.  How do I talk, what do I 
say? Will anybody even listen to me?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Yes. I would even go further and 
compare it to a kind of almost religious-type loyalty that a 
lot of parents that I deal with feel they should have for 
their public schools, their government schools, that they 
are not pleased with, clearly.  They are not happy.  They 
don't like their child failing and getting beaten up, and 
sometimes they want to tell me, "Well, the school's okay and 
all" -- they don't want to really confess how bad they 
really think the school is -- "but I just want to have more 
challenge or more foreign languages."  And, clearly, that is 
not at the forefront of their concern as I talk to them 
more.  So I do detect this from the parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We get a lot of calls, Jennifer, at 
Family Research Council.  What are sort of the top two, 
three, four calls that you get about education that we have 
really tried hard to work with here?

<p>

MR. MARSHALL: A lot of people are concerned about 
the content of their kids' curriculum, and this goes in all 
different directions, but sometimes it is just morbid, 
violent, horrible, dark stories that they are reading in 
literature; or in math they are simply not learning their 
times tables; or in reading they are in third grade and they 
don't know how to read yet because they are simply bypassing 
the simple method of phonics.

<p>

So many problems like that, then also problems 
where the school is simply not recognizing parents' rightful 
role in their children's lives and shutting them out of the 
educational process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When people have come to you, Doug, 
saying, "I want to get my children out of public school, 
government-run schools, to private schools," what are the 
reasons they give you?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, they give the whole gamut, from 
academics to discipline to wanting values taught to their 
children.  Most of the schools that we have are Catholic 
participating in our program because those are the most 
plentiful in the cities, but only a small minority of the 
families that are going to those Catholic schools are 
Catholic themselves.  So they want something that is usually 
Christian, but they want values, they want character.  They 
think that is important.

<p>

And they also want a greater responsiveness from 
the school, which they do not tend to get, I think, and that 
is probably the most common thing.  They say that I just 
can't make a difference.  There is nothing I can do.  I try. 
That's a word I hear all the time, that expression.  I 
tried but nothing happened, so I now feel I have to have 
this other option.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, as a person that helped work on 
Goals 2000 -- and we are not going to hold that against you 
too much --

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That was supposed to bring values 
into the classroom.  We are going to have the goal of 
values.  Why hasn't that worked?  Jennifer?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Maybe Jennifer should answer that.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I say simply that they are building 
bricks without straw.  There is not a solid basis, a 
consensus, about what these values even are.  Those are the 
solid virtues that should be taught in the home and clearly 
agreed upon among family members.

<p>

The public school, in trying to be accommodating 
to all different views, simply cannot even come up with the 
values that they want to teach, so they are not going to be 
successful in teaching them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, we have about a minute left, 
and I wanted to give you the last word.  As you look at the 
lives of the children in your program, why do you think this 
kind of endeavor is the way to go?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, I think just hearing what 
Jennifer was saying about having the values being taught at 
home, and when people do send their child to a school, they 
want to have that school agreeing with their most basic 
values.  Whether they be Catholics or Muslims or whatever it 
is, they don't want to be in a kind of tug-of-war for the 
minds and hearts of their children.

<p>

What this program allows is for those parents who 
want something for their children, who have at least one 
person in their life that is crazy about them and is willing 
to sacrifice for them, this gives them a chance.  It's a ray 
of hope for the whole nation when we see 10,000 very low-
income children in very disadvantaged circumstances who are 
taking charge of their education in its entirety -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And going forward.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That's right, and succeeding.  And I 
think that is a bright hope and a good sign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks so much for being with us, 
both of you.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you 
more information regarding issues affecting you and your 
family.  Hope you'll write us, and stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
The 104th Congress should close this week, so tonight
<i>Straight Talk</i> is discussing some of the historic and 
controversial issues that caught the attention of those both 
on Capitol Hill and in homes across America.  These issues 
ranged from life to teen drug use to welfare reform to 
parental rights.

<p>

Tonight's guests worked consistently with our 
Senators and Congressman, dispensing crucial research 
information to ensure that the best arguments supporting 
pro-family viewpoints were heard.  You won't want to miss 
this key overview of your 104th Congress.

<p>

But first, we are taking you to an event which 
included some of the most prominent faith and family leaders 
in America today. They gathered in Senate majority leader 
Trent Lott's office to speak for life.  Protestant, 
Catholic, and Jewish voices blended as they urged Senators 
to override Bill Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act. This act would have protected viable 
children killed viciously moments from birth with a stab to 
the base of the skull.

<p>

The House voted to overturn President Clinton's 
veto.  After powerful debate, the Senate did not.  As you 
hear these leaders speak, you will understand why the fight 
for life is so intense and urgent.  And it's not about 
politics; it's about the kind of people we are.  Let's all 
take a look Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

[Segments from the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban
Press Conference held September 26, 1996, follow:]

<p>

SENATOR TRENT LOTT: We have a great delegation of 
leaders here in this room that are going to make some 
comments on the vote that we are going to have today on 
overriding the President's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban.  This was a tragic mistake by the President, 
because this is a horrible, tragic procedure.

<p>

We are going to have this vote in the Senate this 
afternoon at 3:30, after continued debate this morning and 
about an hour and a half for closing debate, and then we 
will have a vote that will tell us a lot about the 
conscience of America.

<p>

This is not a regional issue.  This is not an 
issue that is affected by sex or race or by philosophy or by 
party.  This should be a vote of the heart and conscience.  
This horrible procedure is not rare, and it is murder of the 
worst kind.

<p>

We are not interested in this as a political 
issue.  We are interested in this because it is absolutely 
the right thing to do, and that is to override this veto.

<p>

So I am very pleased to be here with this 
distinguished delegation.  I want to thank them for taking 
the time to be here with us to support our effort to do the 
right thing in ending this procedure.

<p>

I want to thank especially Rick Santorum, a great 
Senator from Pennsylvania, that has taken this to heart and 
has taken it across america.  He has changed this debate.  
His efforts had an impact on the tremendous veto override 
vote in the House and are having (an impact on the) vote in 
the Senate, but more importantly, it is having an effect on 
people's minds and hearts all across America.  Thank you, 
Rick Santorum, for your work.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

SENATOR DON NICKLES: We need to recognize that we 
have laws in the land that protect endangered species, and 
if people kill the unborn of endangered species, they can be 
fined up to $50,000; they would be imprisoned for a year.  
And yet this procedure happens, and as Senator Lott 
mentioned, it is not rare.  It happens thousands of times, 
not a few times, not a couple of times.  It happens 
thousands of times across the country.

<p>

And, also, I will just mention that medical 
professionals have said it is never necessary.  President 
Clinton was wrong, maybe had wrong information, but it is 
never, never necessary for the health of the mother or to 
protect her fertility.  We have had people make that 
statement from respected professionals, C. Everett Koop and 
others, and this really is a vote about life and death.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL ANTHONY BEVILACQUA: This vote is 
critical for the preservation of this Nation, of our 
civilization.  As you have heard, partial-birth abortion is 
four-fifths birth and one-fifth abortion.  The child is but 
a few seconds, a few inches, away from full birth.  That 
means it is only a few seconds, a few inches, away from 
being legal infanticide.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

DR. JAMES DOBSON: You may remember in the 1980s a 
little girl named Jessica, a little toddler, fell down a 
well in Midland, Texas, and was trapped there, and a frantic 
effort to get her out began.  As I recall, for nearly 80 
hours they worked to get that little girl out.

<p>

The entire country held its breath while they 
struggled to save the life of this child, and I wept when I 
saw that child come out of that hole in the ground, and so 
did so many others.  Why?  Because of the worth of a single 
child, one child worth more than the possessions of the 
entire world in our viewpoint.

<p>

We are talking here not about one child; we are 
talking about what we now know to be thousands and thousands 
of children.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. CHARLES COLSON: -- and as one of the last 
survivors of Watergate, I have to tell you that I reflect 
back on that now and realize that that was a defining moment 
in the country's history because we decided as a people we 
were not going to suffer unrighteousness in high places.
And so this Nation rose up against that, and the question is 
whether, 20-some years later, we have that same moral 
indignation to rise up again against unrighteousness of the 
most horrid kind imaginable.

<p>

For me, as a Christian, I would have to say this 
with a heavy heart, but I believe if this veto is not 
overridden, that this Nation will be sanctioning 
infanticide, and a nation which sanctions infanticide is no 
better morally than China, no better morally than Nazi 
Germany was during the 1930s.

<p>

Those of us who are believing Christians, who put 
their first allegiance in the God of our fathers and Jesus 
Christ, could no longer, I believe, lend moral support to a 
government that had lost its moral legitimacy.  I think that 
issue is that serious today.

<p>

I am one who is praying for President Clinton, 
that even as he comes up here to the Capitol, his conscience 
will be stricken, he will realize that he was misinformed, 
change his opinion, and let the Nation rise up and say, 
"This is enough; we are not going to do this."

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

RABBI DANIEL LAPIN: The men and women that make 
up the body of the Jewish community understand that this 
issue has absolutely nothing to do with reproductive rights, 
but it has everything to do with the ongoing process of 
coarsening and vulgarizing American society.  This is 
something that must be stopped if we are not to descend into 
a horrifying and dark abyss.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. RICHARD LAND:  We face a situation where, in 
one operating theater, the doctors and the nurses are 
laboring heroically to save a baby's life moments from 
birth, and in the very next operating theater, they are 
laboring in some cases physically, holding the baby's head 
inside the mother's body until they can execute the child.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. KAY COLE JAMES: Never in my wildest dreams 
did I ever think that we would get to the point in this 
discussion, in this dialogue in America, where the extremist 
elements of the pro-choice movement would push the envelope 
so far that we are not even debating anymore whether it is 
human life; we know in fact that it is a human being.  It is 
a child.

<p>

And now we have taken this debate to the point 
that we actually have to stand here before the American 
people and plead with them that we as a Nation are not going 
to sit back and tolerate having children come down the birth 
canal and have a physician actually insert scissors in a 
very painful procedure that kills a child.

<p>

We are not talking in esoteric terms anymore, 
ladies and gentlemen.  We actually have to be here today to 
say we are talking about children, and they know it.  But 
somehow, somehow, the right to choose has been elevated over 
the right to life.

<p>

In a free and civilized society, there are some 
things about which there ought not to be a choice, and 
killing children as they come down the birth canal is one of 
them.

<p>

I feel like I am in a surreal environment that in 
America today, we have to debate that issue.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MRS. BEVERLY LA HAYE: It was Dr. James 
McMahon(?), who was one of the pioneers of the partial-birth 
abortion procedure, who said after he saw what was 
happening, before the procedure, he said, "Gee, I wish this 
baby could be adopted."

<p>

And why not? Why not let these babies live and 
then let somebody adopt them who could love them and give 
them life, rather than end their life just seconds before 
they have that opportunity?

<p>

If the President truly supports adoption, I 
challenge him to withdraw his veto and to say, "Let's adopt 
these babies and give them a chance to live."

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. WANDA FRANZ: One of the statements that is 
frequently made is that this procedure is only done under 
extreme cases, for cases in which the child is severely 
deformed or has a major medical problem.  However, 
Dr. Martin Haskell, who pioneered the procedure and has 
performed more than 1,000 of these procedures, has stated 
himself that 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he 
does are purely elective.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BOB DUGAN: Worst of all, the partial-birth 
abortion technique snuffs out the life of a child who is 
literally a somersault away from taking its first breath.  
How can God bless America if we allow this moral outrage to 
become the practice in our land?

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: Every once in a while, a great nation 
is forced to deal with a great issue, with a defining issue 
that says something about who it is, what it is about, 
issues of race, of war, and of life.

<p>

This is one of those defining moments.  This 
moment says something about who we are as a free people.  
The founding fathers said this was a shining city upon a 
hill.  The question in 1996 is open:  Are we still a shining 
city upon a hill?

<p>

Even if this vote is lost today, the issue will 
never go away.  It will stick in our throat.  We are better 
than this.  We are a better people than this.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
discuss the consequences of the Senate's vote on partial-birth 
abortion.  Please stay turned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The battle between life and so-called 
choice, now spanning decades, continued most recently 
with partial-birth abortion.  Our guests tonight will 
discuss the implications of votes regarding such life 
issues.

<p>

Here tonight are three members of the Family 
Research Council's Government Relations Department.  I am 
joined by Marty Dannenfelser, assistant to the president for 
government relations; Jacqueline Halbig, congressional 
liaison; and Loralei Gilliam, legislative assistant.  All of 
you, welcome again to the show.

<p>

As you know, we are taking a look at some of the 
most significant votes that we have had, and partial birth, 
Marty, certainly was very powerful and most recent.  What do 
you see as the implications of this vote, which ultimately 
did not prevail, even though there were majorities in the 
House and the Senate?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there were overwhelming 
majorities, particularly in the House, and increasing 
majorities in the Senate.  We went from 54 votes in the 
Senate to effectively 59, despite the 57 votes that were on 
the roll call, and many Senators who did vote against the 
override, I think, were very uncomfortable with that, 
knowing that it was a very unpopular position with the 
public.

<p>

So I think we are going to see further movement on 
that, and we got a two-thirds majority in the House on every 
occasion when the vote came up.  So I think that there is a 
lot of potential for this in the new Congress.  Congressman 
Charles Canady, the chairman of the Constitution 
Subcommittee in the House, has already indicated that he 
will be bringing this up again in the 105th Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like partial-birth abortion 
gave us an opportunity that we never had before to really 
talk about what happens in an abortion itself.  And so you 
have here late-term abortions, often viable children, 
healthy children, a scissors stabbed in the base of the 
skull, brain tissue vacuumed out, and the public 
overwhelmingly, as they become aware of it, saying this is 
horrendous.  I think it was something like 75 percent of 
people thought abortion only happened in cases of rape, 
incest, life of the mother, and then in the first trimester.

<p>

Do you think that partial birth has any positive 
implications in terms of its educational opportunities?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: As you noted, it really does 
cause people to focus on the reality of abortion.  In the 
past we have had so much discussion about euphemisms:  a 
woman's right to choose, keep the government out, and all 
these types of things.  And this really is very stark.  Most 
people don't realize that late-term abortions are allowed in 
this country, that they are allowed for any reason, and 
particularly this, where the baby is in the process of being 
born, I think is shocking to many people when they find out 
that this sort of thing is allowed in our country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems sometimes like House and 
Senate members are locked into a position before they come.  
They run on a certain platform and then they come and kind 
of vote knee-jerk.  Did this issue help people break out of 
molds?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I think so. You saw people 
like Jim Moran of Virginia, Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, 
people like that, who is the nephew of Ted Kennedy, and when 
you see people like that starting to vote for this, some 
other people who had some pretty hard-line pro-abortion 
positions, it does give them the capacity to say, "This is 
different."  Many of them said, "Well, this was more like 
infanticide than abortion," which in many respects it was.
So it does give them an opportunity to finally cast a vote 
in favor of protecting life.  So that is a step, and 
hopefully, we will get them to look at other forms of 
abortion are just as heinous.

<p>

I think the analogy to what happened in England 
with the slave trade is something that is very instructive.  
William Wilberforce gradually outlawed the different methods 
of bringing the slaves on the boats, and so on, and when he 
forced people to focus on what was going on, how people were 
being held in bondage and treated very shabbily, they 
gradually said no, we can't allow that, and then no, we 
can't allow this other action.  And if people start saying, 
well, we can't allow partial-birth abortion, and then we 
can't allow the dismemberment of children, or we can't allow 
salt-poisoning of children, then perhaps they will start to 
really take a harder look at this abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, that's fantastic.

<p>

Loralei, I know there were some other victories 
for us on the pro-life front.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us a little.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: In the Labor, Health and Human 
Services appropriations bill, we were successful with 
looking at the education process of doctors.  The ACGME, 
which is the Accreditation Council for (Graduate) Medical 
Education, looked at training of abortion as a procedure for 
doctors.

<p>

Senator Coats took the lead on this in the Senate, 
and we were successful in keeping that in to where the 
doctors are not required or the medical schools are not 
required to learn how to perform abortions if they so 
choose.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And again, taxpayer funding was 
involved.  It was amazing to me, Marty, when we were talking 
earlier about the kinds of issues, how many involved 
taxpayer funding issues. Could you go through a couple of 
those for us?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, we renewed some things 
that had been lost in the last Congress.  When President 
Clinton first came in, he had veto threats on a number of 
bills where there had been longstanding restrictions, such 
as with the federal employees' health insurance programs, 
and that restriction, which had been in place for eight 
years, was lost in the last Congress; it was restored in 
this Congress.

<p>

On his third day in office, on the anniversary of 
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> in 1993, he handed down five executive 
memorandums on different abortion policies, one of them 
being a mandate to allow abortions in the military 
hospitals.  Now Congress has legislatively overturned that.

<p>

The District of Columbia prohibition on abortion 
on demand, funding for that, was lost in the last Congress, 
and it was renewed again in this Congress, and we did, of 
course, maintain the Hyde amendment, and as Loralei 
mentioned, the accreditation now so that these colleges that 
train doctors will not be threatened with the loss of 
federal funds if they refuse to be a party to the training 
of abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was really struck by one of the 
things that happened.  We don't often think about human 
research as happening in America.  You think of that as 
being some kind of Nazi phenomenon.  But we actually had to 
have legislation related to human embryo research, the 
creating of human beings for research purposes.

<p>

Loralei, what happened on that?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: We were successful in keeping embryo 
research from being funded.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It doesn't really allow -- they can 
still do some private funding, I guess, Marty, but they 
don't have to --

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: In federally funded programs, 
yes, they cannot be creating live human embryos for the 
purpose of experimentation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which is ironic, because then in 
private programs they can, can they not, go ahead and use 
human beings for the purpose of research?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes. There is some scary stuff 
that is going on out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is there any indication that if 
federal funds would be cut off we might see a little less 
human embryo research?  Although it is almost gruesome to 
think that it is happening.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There might be a little bit, 
but it is important for the Federal Government to at least 
go on record and set the standard that this sort of thing is 
inappropriate, because when it gets federal sanction, it 
makes it that much more credible and acceptable throughout 
the entire society.  So it is an important step to say that 
that type of experimentation on living human beings is 
unacceptable.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We also took a look at funding in 
this session of Congress on international funding of 
abortion, and ironically, we might not have taxpayer-funded 
abortion in the United States, but internationally, that is 
not the case.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: No. You have a situation where 
the under secretary -- I guess his name is Tim Wirth(?) -- 
at the State Department is such a zealot in this area that 
he has a ball in the shape of a globe in his office where he 
keeps condoms, and the whole program has been promoted, and 
they have worked through the United Nations to promote this 
whole agenda.  We have managed to keep the funding in check 
because there are no longer the constraints on giving money 
to organizations that promote abortion as a method of family 
planning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. When <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns, we will bring you more about America's fight for 
family issues within the halls of Congress.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

ROBERT WOODSON: -- but use the considerable 
political and economic strength of churches and churchgoers 
and others to remove the kind of government barriers that 
prohibit faith-based organizations from properly serving 
their own peers.

<p>

REV. RONALD MOORE: -- every individual can find 
work, and whenever they find work, there is a sense of 
dignity.  It develops dignity, it develops accountability, 
it develops responsibility, and their moral and their 
ethical lives are changed, and I'm not talking about 
temporary change; we're talking about a permanent change.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you just witnessed, some very 
controversial topics, such as immigration, affirmative 
action, and welfare reform activated the American public.  
With me to discuss some of those issues are the finest 
government relations staff in town, Family Research 
Council's Marty Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei 
Gilliam.  Welcome back.

<p>

Marty, you all worked a lot on welfare reform, and 
there were some interesting -- people don't often think of 
Family Research Council as being involved in immigration 
policy, but there were a couple of things that caught our 
eye. What happened on these things?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were areas where we 
had some success in a scale-backed form from where we 
started. The welfare area, we wanted to tackle the issue of 
illegitimacy in the area of caps, and so on, and that did 
not survive.  There was a bill that passed the Congress and 
was vetoed by the President that included those types of 
provisions.

<p>

But the ultimate legislation that passed really 
ended the federal entitlement but left things largely to the 
states to design it, and even there, there were waivers that 
were still in place that are still potentially problematic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you tell us a little bit more 
about caps, Jacqueline?  We were taking a look at different 
provisions. What were we hoping for when we got started?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Well, we had pretty strong, high 
hopes, and a lot of those did not prevail, as Marty noted.
But the family caps were designed to stop the process of 
illegitimate births in families, that women kept having 
children out of wedlock and seemingly were rewarded for that 
by increased funding, and so we were trying to cap their 
funding and not allow them to get increased funding for each 
additional child that they had out of wedlock.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But was that a desire -- I mean, it 
almost sounds kind of cold, and I ask this as a straw man 
setup question.  I mean, why caps?  Was that the most 
compassionate answer, and why would it have been?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It seemed to work as far as a few 
experiments that took place.  One was in New Jersey, and it 
seemed to have the positive effect of not rewarding a 
negative action.  If you don't reward a negative action, 
then they won't continue to do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ultimately, what was the best thing, 
Marty, that came out of welfare reform?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think the idea that it 
did end the federal entitlement, and that is probably the 
most significant thing, and it gives much more power back to 
the states.  There have been many states that have been 
taking action that they have to keep coming on bended knee 
to the Department of Health and Human Services looking for 
waivers, and now they pretty much are on their own to design 
these programs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Waivers would be like federal 
permission to try an experiment, to do something different.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Yes, to get a waiver from the 
law dealing with Medicaid funding or some other proposal in 
the welfare area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And so, for the first time, we are 
saying, look, we are not going to automatically give money 
if these situations exist; we are going to try to be smart 
about it. And we can actually do some experiments to try to 
change our situation?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: The idea is to try to phase it 
out at the federal level over a five-year period and then 
allow the states to put stronger work requirements and other 
things in the area of illegitimacy.  One of the areas of 
controversy with the family cap was the question of would 
that lead to increased abortions, and what they resolved was 
to say that states could get an increase if they were able 
to bring down their illegitimacy rate without increasing the 
rate of abortion.  So that was the compromise that was 
reached among people in the pro-family community who had 
some concerns in this area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that was 
interesting this year, Gary Bauer testified on Capitol Hill 
-- President of Family Research Council -- about the 
persecution of Christians as an immigration issue.  I mean, 
we certainly have not really heard much about this in the 
past.

<p>

We have about a minute left, Loralei.  Could you 
tell us a little bit about the status of that?  What is 
happening?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The immigration reform bill just 
went through and was passed and signed, and what it looked 
at is providing asylum.  We ran into women that were trying 
to find asylum here in the United States coming from China, 
having to deal with the human rights violations in their 
home countries.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like forced abortion?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Forced abortion and wanting to get 
out of their situations, and unfortunately, the 
administration was not very supportive of these women, and 
this new immigration reform looks at providing asylum for 
people that are trying to escape human rights violations.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Interesting, and I know in the 
Sudan, crucifixion of Christians, and we will probably hear 
more about this in the next session of Congress; it just got 
started.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will continue our 
discussion on pro-family issues that were debated among 
Congressmen and Senators in the 104th Congress.  Please stay 
with us.

[Segment from PRIDE press conference on drug abuse 
prevention held September 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Today marks the fifth straight year 
that we have come before you to announce that teen drug use 
is rising.  In fact, for every illicit drug and tobacco, 
drug use by students, mostly ages 11 through 18, is at the 
highest level PRIDE has ever recorded.  More students are 
using more drugs more frequently, and their use is more hard 
core than we have seen in nine years.

<p>

[Segment from Parental Rights and Responsibilities 
Act staff briefing held June 25, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. PAUL TUCKER: We sent our child to school one 
day with all the expectations that she is going to be going 
to school and there will be no problem, and she was informed 
that she had to go down for a physical examination.  Well, 
she thought, no problem, because my daughter does go to camp 
every summer; we do have physicals every summer for our 
children, and we do have the paperwork filled out and we 
hand that in.

<p>

My daughter decided to leave class early to go 
down to the office to explain to these nurses that she had 
the paperwork filled out, that she really didn't need a 
physical.  When she informed the nurses that she had done 
so, the nurse said, "We have lost your paperwork; you have 
to have the physical."

<p>

My daughter said, "But I already had one."  They 
said, "Well, it's too bad; you have to have one, anyway."
She said, "Well, let me call my mother."  They said, "No.
It doesn't matter what your parents think.  You are going to 
have this physical, anyway.  So it wouldn't matter what your 
mom said."

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Issues such as parental rights and 
teen drug use cut to the heart of families this year, and 
with me tonight are those who ensure factual information 
regarding these issues is provided to those making key 
decisions on Capitol Hill.

<p>

From Family Research Council, I am joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei Gilliam.
Welcome, all, back to the show.

<p>

Jacqueline, you were tracking some of the parental 
rights issues.  What happened that affected parents and the 
way in which they make decisions for their families?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Well, increasingly, we have just seen 
a large usurpation of parental rights in the just regular 
decisions in bringing up their children, like medical 
decisions, educational decisions, like educational choice, 
and just religious decisions.  A lot of ground has been lost 
to the state.

<p>

But this year we worked hard, as our viewers just 
saw, with Paul Tucker.  He had an incredible case where his 
child was brought in and had a gynecological exam, you know, 
for the whole world to see.  She felt very violated, 
obviously, and her parents felt like they had no recourse.

<p>

This is the Parental Rights and Responsibilities 
Act.  This is something that this bill would address.  So we 
are hopeful for next Congress as far as pursuing that 
further.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think what is interesting about 
that was not only did they give these children gynecological 
exams without parental notification or consent -- 

<p>

MS. HALBIG: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  -- when they were confronted, you 
would think the school would be embarrassed and apologize, 
and they said, "Hey, we have a right, because bad parents 
might be out there."

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they were actually coming to legal loggerheads.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right. I mean, whose children are 
they, parents' or the government's?  Apparently, the 
government thinks that those children belong to them, and 
they have acted in such a way.

<p>

The FDA has --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Federal Food and Drug Administration.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: -- thank you -- has just also done 
something that was egregious, or we have just found out 
about it, anyway.  There has been a lady who has been making 
these home drug-testing kits so that parents could test 
their children for drugs.  What in the world is wrong with 
that? That's their right.

<p>

Well, the FDA doesn't seem to think so.  They are 
classifying these drug-testing kits, which include two urine 
sample cups and a label to send it to a lab, they are saying 
that these are a class III medical device, which is the same 
thing as a pacemaker.  Not quite.  It is not on the same 
grounds at all.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A little plastic cup with a lid is --

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It's not quite a pacemaker, and that 
is what they are saying, so this woman who has been peddling 
these drug-testing kits has now come under fire from the FDA 
as if she has really violated the law.  So she is in danger 
of going to prison because she wants to allow parents to 
have the right to test their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. Who are some of the 
groups that have been opposed to parental rights?  You would 
think everyone would be in favor of that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the National Education 
Association is one of the leading ones, and many other self-
styled child advocacy groups in the liberal community.  But 
the National Education Association, particularly in the area 
of education, they don't want parents to have any more say 
in curriculums or anything like that, so they have raised 
all kinds of horror stories about how any kind of parental 
authority is going to disrupt the classroom.

<p>

So that has been a real problem, and they have 
been an obstacle in many areas of providing school choice, 
cutting back on government mandates through the Goals 2000 
program, and so on.  So we see them rear their heads at a 
lot of turns along the way in the pro-family area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it has been interesting, 
too, to see what happened in pornography in the last year.
We have certainly seen some victories in pornography. But 
you look at the Internet, where children can get pornography 
easily, or have been able to, and in an attempt to restrict 
that through the telecom bill, where we were successful, the 
ACLU and others jump in, "Children need pornography," 
apparently.  And so that is a speech issue.

<p>

What else has happened on pornography?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you run into these on-line 
companies that don't like the restrictions, as well, 
and the Microsofts, and they don't like any restrictions in 
the computer area.  So you do run into this libertarian 
group that has strong objections, and we have seen even 
within the conservative community that you run into a few 
people who have those problems.

<p>

But we have made good headway.  When people 
understand what this does to children and what kind of stuff 
is available to children, they do recoil at it, and many 
people do acknowledge that something has to be done.  The 
Senate voted 84 to 16 to pass this telecom restriction, the 
porn-on-the-internet restriction.

<p>

We had another success on getting the pornography 
out of the military as far as the commissaries on military 
bases, that the government should no longer be subsidizing 
that.  So there has been some movement in this area when 
people realize the detrimental effects this has on families.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: There is an additional success that 
just got passed, an amendment tacked onto the omnibus bill, 
which was something that Senator Hatch's staff was able to 
do.  It is an additional protection against child 
pornography on the internet.  It is computer verification -- 
when they take computer pieces of children and splice them 
together to make a whole child, traditionally, those things 
have not been considered real children so that they have 
gotten away with that kind of pornography.  But now they 
won't be able to since this has been amended.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Loralei, you work with our citizen 
action network a lot.  You are a computer guru, and tracking 
what people have to say about these things.  What is the 
constituent action network response to all these computer 
porn issues and some of the child issues that have come up?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The initial reaction is disbelief.
So many families are just getting onto the 
internet/cyberspace activities and buying their new home 
computers and are thrilled with the new tools that it is 
going to provide.  And then they are excited to see their 
kids surfing the internet sites and going on the web and 
learning a great deal.

<p>

But at the same time, these children are able to 
access sites that provide hard-core pornography and are 
shocked by it that there are not any restrictions out there 
for that.

<p>

The telecommunications bill provided (for) the 
first time some kind of regulation going on.  Pornography 
has some form of regulation in every type of media, and this 
has allowed --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Even if it is just a driver's 
license at a video store, so that you are not giving it to 
kids.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Right, and this is going to provide 
a safeguard for these parents.  Our grass roots are very 
pleased with it, and almost it is like a security blanket.  
They are not scared for their kids to turn on their computer 
at home any longer.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know we have been working for a 
long time to defund the Department of Education.  I have 
been in Washington 10 years, and I'm still hoping.  Any 
chance -- you know, there has been a lot of talk of the 
computer being great for home schools or charter schools -- 
any chance that Goals 2000 or educational choice could 
collide and there would be more parental option in our near 
future?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It is probably going to be a 
long battle.  The entrenched bureaucracies and the unions 
are very strong in this area, and they have a lot of support 
in Congress on both sides of the aisle, and it is a tough 
battle.

<p>

But we are making headway.  There are many people 
who support parental choice, particularly many minority 
parents and lower and middle-income parents.  They see 
people at the national level, Presidents and Vice Presidents 
and other leaders of the civil rights community, and so on, 
sending their children to exclusive private schools, and 
they say, "Well, if they can afford to send their kids to 
those schools, why can't I send my kids to a school?  Why 
can't I have the wherewithal to send my kids to a private 
school?"

<p>

That is starting to put some cracks in the armor, 
so to speak, of the coalition that has been trying to limit 
parental choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been in Michigan some 
testing, some looking at ways to restructure an educational 
school system, and in New York City, the diocese which has 
consistently said to the New York City schools, "Give us 
your 1,000 poorest, worst-off children; we would be glad to 
educate them."

<p>

Do we see cracks in the armor, or when you all are 
lobbying on Capitol Hill, do the National Education 
Association and teachers' unions have the upper hand?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: They do. In a nutshell, they really 
do have the upper hand.  I don't know how to expound upon 
that, because they just have always -- they have more money 
than we do.  They control teachers, unfortunately, and they 
just have the upper hand as far as their policies are 
concerned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to keep working 
on that.

<p>

More about your family's future when it comes to 
votes made by our congressional leaders when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The 
Defense of Marriage Act, for which the Family Research 
Council held an exclusive briefing, was a victory in both 
the House and Senate.  Yet the homosexual activist agenda 
continues to have a profound impact in Washington.  Here 
again from the Family Research Council I am joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei Gilliam.

<p>

Loralei, you're a southern girl.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: That I am.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's hard to believe, isn't it, that 
we are actually discussing in a law that marriage is between 
a man and a woman and that we had to lobby on this.  What 
was the reaction on the House and Senate when we went up to 
talk about what is marriage?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: It was amazing that we actually had 
to produce a federal piece of legislation, a law, that 
states that marriage is defined by a man and a woman.  But, 
unfortunately, we have cases in Hawaii that are going to the 
Hawaiian Supreme Court for same-sex marriage.

<p>

I don't think it is a new idea that a man and a 
woman create a marriage.  Unfortunately, the homosexual 
agenda, the folks on that side thought that we were trying 
to oppress them by saying that same-sex marriage should not 
be legal.  It's a traditional defense of the traditional 
family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But why would a case in a Hawaii court affect the 
rest of the country?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Well, Article IV of the Constitution 
states that each state would have to recognize a previous 
law in another state.  So if Hawaii passed the ability for 
same-sex marriage, then Texas would have to recognize that 
marriage, even though -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You from Texas know that would not go over.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: That would not go over, especially 
since we have sodomy laws on the books in Texas.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. Sodomy laws are interesting.
A lot of the homosexual activists were going to go for 
sodomy laws and attack them with this legislation.  But, 
Marty, when the votes got to the Hill, did the Congressmen 
and women see the value of voting for marriage?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They seemed to. They were able 
to split the difference in the Senate, though, because they 
had a vote the same day on what was called the Employment 
Nondiscrimination Act, which was a homosexual jobs civil 
rights type of bill that would put homosexual conduct on the 
same level as things like race, and we all know, as Colin 
Powell and others have stated, that they are very different 
things, that race is a benign characteristic that cannot 
change, whereas homosexual behavior is something that is 
changeable, and in fact thousands of people who have been in 
that lifestyle have left the lifestyle.

<p>

Yet Ted Kennedy and others in the Senate were 
determined to make that part of the law, and we have had 
examples when that has happened in other states where it has 
wreaked havoc in the work place where someone who was a 
homosexual, unbeknownst to the employer, did not get a 
promotion and then comes back and says, "Well, you didn't 
promote me because I'm a homosexual," and the employer says, 
"Well, I didn't know you were a homosexual."

<p>

Now, if that person was black, obviously, they 
would know that person was black, and they might have a case 
for saying there was discrimination.  But if the employer 
did not know they were a homosexual, they are really at 
great risk of lawsuits and all kinds of legal action that 
can cause a great deal of problem in the work place.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, it was really interesting.  You 
had the two bills, the Defense of Marriage Act, sort of 
establishing marriage in federal law and allowing the states 
to make their own decisions, going through at the same time 
as a gay civil rights bill.

<p>

I guess the question is, if how you have sex 
becomes a workplace issue, isn't this going to force 
everyone to fill out a form, "This is how I have sex"?  It 
is certainly not going to be apparent when you meet someone.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was one of the 
problems that we pointed out, and some of our friends in the 
Senate pointed out to their colleagues, that you are going 
to then have to start having records to demonstrate that you 
are hiring people, and then in order to have those records,
you have to start asking people, and that really starts 
invading people's privacy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. How do you prove it?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Correct. People don't want to 
be answering questions like that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It would seem very charged, and yet 
the vote was very close.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It was only a one-vote margin, 
50 to 39, and one of the Senators who was absent would have 
supported that, and had he been there, Al Gore would have 
cast the deciding vote to pass that, because the Vice 
President votes to break ties.  So it was a very close vote, 
and Ted Kennedy vows that he'll be back next year and he'll 
be ready to pass that in the Senate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what do you think will happen? 
Do you think they'll have a chance?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it will depend on the 
makeup of the Senate in the new Congress, and that is very 
much up in the air right now.  So I think as people realize 
more the facts about this issue that it will move in our 
direction.  As you know, we had the briefing up on the Hill, 
and we got feedback from people.  They didn't know that this 
was not a characteristic that you're born with.  They didn't 
know that there was another explanation for these sorts of 
issues, that there were thousands of people who leave that 
lifestyle and that there are ministries that help people in 
that situation.  And as they find facts like that out and 
they find out the problems that this can cause in the work 
place, they do tend to take another look at it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, and I 
know that one thing Family Research Council does 
consistently is fight for pro-family tax relief.
Jacqueline, what started in that front?  What did we see?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: We did see pro-family tax relief pass 
the House, and that was pretty exciting, a $500-per-child 
tax credit.  So that was a victory.  Unfortunately, it 
didn't fly in the Senate, but we did at least get that far 
in the House.  So that is encouraging.

<p>

Also along the lines of tax credits, there was an 
adoption tax credit which passed, something we have worked 
very hard for.  Because we are pro-life, we believe children 
should be adopted and give people a break who spend a lot of 
money trying to adopt children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think, what, the average cost of 
adoption is around $20,000, and this was $5,000 tax break?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is really significant for people.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It is significant.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was one other change in 
adoption law, wasn't there, Loralei?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes. This was the first time that
we were able to get transracial adoptions be approved.
There is not technically a law out there that says one race 
parent could not adopt a different race child, but, 
unfortunately, that was what was happening in the adoption 
agencies.  They were not letting cross-racial adoption 
happen.  And we have put on the books now that, yes, a white 
family can adopt a Hispanic child, or a black family can 
adopt an Oriental child.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And that was something that Hillary 
Clinton and Donna Shalala had fought, as I understand.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to come back 
and hear more about this when the 105th Congress comes.  
Thanks so much for being with us, and when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns, we will bring you more information regarding issues 
affecting you and your family.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for joining us here on 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you 
would like more information about anything we talked about, 
just call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week we will talk about global legalization 
of drugs and how the people in Switzerland are fighting an 
uphill battle to keep their country and their children safe 
from what could become government-sanctioned pushers.

<p>

Please stay tuned, and thanks for joining us here

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.

<p>

Have you ever wondered if women have had an impact 
on our political system; if the fact that women vote changes 
the way the world is, or at least the way the political 
system operates?  During the suffragette movement, when 
women were trying to get the vote, it was rumored that women 
were really going to change American politics, and today the 
gender gap is big news.

<p>

Just how do women view the political process, and 
what influence do they have?  We're going to hear from some 
experts who have a lot to say about how women are 
influencing the American political scene.

<p>

First, we are going to hear from Kay Coles James. 
She was former secretary of HHS in Virginia.  She is now 
head of government at Regent University, and in fact, she 
was once a vice president at Family Research Council.  She 
says that the way that women care about their families 
affects the way they care about politics.  Let's take a look 
at her insightful comments.

<p>

<i>[Note: Remarks of the participants for the 
balance of the telecast are segments from The Heritage 
Foundation Conference entitled "Women, Politics, and the 
1996 Elections," held September 27, 1996.]</i>

<p>

MS. JAMES: One media outlet says that there is 
something out there called Soccer Mom, and Soccer Mom is in 
fact the woman that both Bob and Bill are interested in 
dating right now.  She is one whose attentions they are all 
vying for.

<p>

Who is this person called Soccer Mom?  Now, those 
individuals who are doing the scientific polling will tell 
you precisely who she is.  I will only tell you what my 
impressions are of who she is.

<p>

And just for the sake of continuity, I have 
decided to name her, and I only picked this name because it 
is my daughter's, and when I've done this before, I've 
switched names four times within the speech because I forgot 
what I named her.  So let's call her Elizabeth.

<p>

Well, Elizabeth is, let's say, somewhere in her 
thirties.  She is a very active woman.  She is holding down 
a full-time job working outside the home.  She is sandwiched 
between her children and her aging parents.  Elizabeth has a 
lot on her mind.  While there are those in the nation who 
are figuring out how to balance the nation's budget, she is 
trying to figure out how to stretch the paycheck.

<p>

She is so very, very committed to being 
responsible with the family's finances.  She is not late on 
the bills, but boy, can she juggle that budget to make it 
all happen.  She is an incredible woman.  She cares deeply 
about her children, and she is very concerned about the 
future of this nation.

<p>

Now, when we ask Elizabeth how she feels about the 
upcoming election, there are three words that she picked out 
of a list for some research that was done for <i>Ladies' Home 
Journal</i>. She said, when asked to describe her feeling about 
politics, she says there are three adjectives:  frustrated, 
disgusted, and disillusioned.

<p>

I would like to add to that that right now 
Elizabeth is so engrossed in her own life that perhaps, just 
perhaps, even with the election as close as it is, she has 
not yet focused all of her time and attention on what is 
happening in national politics.  Right now Elizabeth is more 
concerned that if Bob could drive carpool for her this 
weekend and Bill could figure out how in the world she is 
going to get home from work, defrost dinner, get one child 
to piano lessons and the other one to a dance recital, then 
perhaps she would have time to concentrate on what they are 
saying.

<p>

My point to you is that I believe that Elizabeth 
and the other Soccer Moms out there are a very fluid group 
right now.  And if our national candidates could learn how 
to reach through the noise of their everyday lives, then 
perhaps they could get to her and persuade her that one of 
the two of them is the best choice to lead this nation.

<p>

Well, this particular Soccer Mom has, well, let's 
say for the sake of argument, a combined family income of
around $30,000, and she works as a loan officer in a bank.
Her husband works for the telephone company.

<p>

I just want to take you through Elizabeth the 
Soccer Mom's day and sort of set the stage for some of the 
things that you will be hearing.

<p>

Elizabeth turns over at 5:30 a.m., and as she 
smashes the clock down because its whining is driving her 
insane -- it came much, much too early, but, you see, she 
has to get up very, very early in order to prepare her 
children, herself, and, yes, her husband, in order to go out 
and face their work day.

<p>

Now, there are some things that are influencing 
Elizabeth's life at that moment that she doesn't even know 
about.  She isn't even aware of the fact that perhaps the 
reason that she is getting up and going out and facing a job 
and working that day is because the economy is as it is, and 
in order for her family to be able to survive, they need 
those two incomes.  And she isn't perhaps aware of the fact 
that while she is working 15 hours out of her week in order 
to pay her taxes and she only gets to spend 17 hours out of 
her week in one-on-one time with her children, that she is 
working almost as much time for the government as she is 
working for her children.  And someone needs to get that 
message through to her, so that when we begin to talk about 
a 15 percent tax cut, Elizabeth understands immediately what 
impact that's going to have on her and on her family.

<p>

Well, Elizabeth rouses those kids and gets them 
ready, and as she readies them for school, she begins to 
think about the kinds and the quality of education that her 
children are getting.  Now, she is very committed to public 
education.  Make no mistake about it.  She wants a good 
quality education in that community.  But her primary and 
her first responsibility is to her own children.  It is very 
important to her that they have the best education possible, 
and she somehow fears that her wealthier friends who can 
send their children to private school are getting a better 
edge, because when she looks at the standardized test 
results, for whatever reason, those children are scoring 
higher.

<p>

Now, she figures if we can get a little 
competition in there and somehow drive this issue, that 
perhaps we can improve the public schools, and Elizabeth 
believes, much like Polly Williams, that Bill Clinton should 
not be the only person who lives in public housing and sends 
his kids to private school.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And she would love to take her tax dollars that 
she is spending, she would love to take that money and use 
it to send her children to the school that she chooses, 
because she understands their unique gifts, abilities, and 
needs, and she wants to make the decision about what kinds 
of education her children receive.  Elizabeth is very 
concerned about what she sees happening in public schools in 
America today.

<p>

And so Elizabeth puts the children in the car, and 
she begins to drive off to drop them off for their day in 
public schools.  She is mortified as she drives through the 
neighborhood and goes through a shortcut to get there and 
cut off a few minutes so she won't be late for work, drives 
through a neighborhood that she doesn't always take to get 
there, and is horrified, mortified, petrified, as she sees 
what she believes to be a drug deal going on not more than a 
few blocks from her child's school.

<p>

Now, Elizabeth is very concerned about crime and 
drugs.  She somehow had gotten a sense of security when she 
saw the data that came out several years ago saying that 
casual use among teenagers was down, and she was glad to 
have Nancy Reagan stand up there and tell the children of 
America, "Just say no."  She wasn't smirking, she wasn't 
making light of drug use, and it was exactly the same 
message that she was giving at home.

<p>

And so she felt a certain amount of security, and 
if Elizabeth had time and was listening to the evening news, 
she knows that the gains that we made under President Bush 
have in fact evaporated and that drug use among teens is up, 
and that is frightening to her, because she cares about her 
children, and she doesn't want leadership in this country 
that says, "Yes," with a smile, "I used drugs, and if I had 
the opportunity, I would do it over again."

<p>

Well, she drops them off.  Finally now, Elizabeth 
is headed to work.  She works very hard all day, and when it 
gets to be lunch time, Elizabeth has several phone calls 
that she needs to make on her break.  You see, as a sandwich 
mom, meaning that she is sandwiched between her children and 
her elderly parents, usually at least two to three times a 
week she tries to call her mom and dad at lunchtime.  And 
when she calls them, her father is horrified, saying, "Have 
you heard what they're trying to do to Medicare?"  He is 
frightened.

<p>

She says, "Dad, think about it this way.  What if 
you had a limited amount of money and you looked ahead to 
the end of the month and you realized, Dad, that if you 
didn't spend your money wisely, you were going to run out of 
money before you got to the end of the month?  Now, you have 
two options, Dad.  You can either begin to cut back and 
scale back and maybe change your diet a little bit, or you 
could decide, 'I'm going to worry about it later; let's have 
steak and lobster for dinner tonight.'"

<p>

And Dad said, "Well, of course not.  I would 
figure out how to make it work, how to stretch the limited 
dollars that I have so that we can eat all month."  And she 
said, "Dad, that's what Republicans are trying to do.  And 
in fact, they are not talking about spending less money on 
the food budget; they are talking about spending more, but 
we are not going to increase it as much and as fast, because 
we simply don't have the resources to do that.

<p>

"Dad, they really do want to save Medicare and to 
make sure that in fact you will always have adequate medical 
coverage."  Elizabeth has a lot on her mind.

<p>

But, you know, her boss comes to her in mid-afternoon 
and says, "You know, we have a little bit of a 
problem in balancing out our books.  We're going to need you 
to stay and work a little late," so that, by the time she 
finally leaves work that night, it's dark outside, the 
streets are a little more quiet than they normally are, and 
she has to walk the two blocks that she has to go to get 
into her car.  She sees shadows as she walks to her car, and 
she is angry that Bill Clinton cut prison funding by $580 
million, because some of those people need to be locked up 
and behind bars.

<p>

And so I think that you are beginning to see that 
there is a lot that is happening at the national level that 
can be, should be, and is indeed important to Elizabeth.

<p>

As she makes it home that night, prepares the 
family's meal, and then sits down to watch the evening news, 
there are two more things that come to her attention.  
Elizabeth looks at what is happening internationally, and 
she recognizes that as she looks at her 17-year-old son and 
thinks about her brother who is a Marine, she is very 
concerned that in America's foreign policy that perhaps, 
just perhaps, we are committing American forces to places on 
our globe with missions that are ill-defined; we aren't sure 
what victory looks like; and we're not really clear why 
we're there.

<p>

And that is important because, see, Elizabeth is 
patriotic, and she has taught her son that he will fight for 
and defend freedom and that one day he may be called upon to 
do just that.  But she wants to be sure that when her son or 
her brother is put in harm's way, that it is for a reason 
that is of some vital interest to America.  And she also 
wants to know that he is the best equipped, that he is the 
best trained, and that he has all the tools and resources at 
his disposal to do the job.  She does not want to be one of 
those mothers of one of the rangers who went into Somalia 
and then later was told that some of the defense officials 
should have acted upon requests that came from some of the 
commanders that they needed more equipment and heavier 
armor.  You see, that would be cold comfort to her.

<p>

She wants to know that America's military is 
standing ready and well prepared.  And so that is important 
to her.  She is concerned about what she hears about 
military morale that has hit an all-time low.  She is very 
concerned as she listens to the evening news that perhaps 
America is not prepared to face the international 
challenges.

<p>

And so Elizabeth may not have focused entirely on 
the election yet, and Bob and Bill may still be courting.  
She will have the opportunity to focus on what that means to 
her in terms of education, in terms of crime, in terms of 
drugs, in terms of a strong national defense, in terms of a 
definable national foreign policy.  Because, you see, 
Elizabeth cares about all those things because, yes, she is 
a woman, but she is also an American.

<p>

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD: It is very important, as we talk 
about women and politics here in 1996, that we have some 
context to put that into.  We must understand the patterns 
of feminism, we must understand some of the past of feminism 
in order to be put there, and I am really glad to see a lot 
of people that are in my age group, because we are the ones 
who have received a very narrow view as we have been raised 
of the feminist movement.

<p>

I did my graduate thesis on the defeat of the 
Equal Rights Amendment in Iowa in 1992, and the reason I 
chose that topic was because as I talked to people in my age 
group, I discovered that we did not know what the Equal 
Rights Amendment was all about.  We knew there was this 
brouhaha over it when we were young, back in the 1970s, but 
we didn't know what the issues were that surrounded it.  The 
only things we had ever been taught were what we read in our 
textbooks, that the ERA was about equal pay for equal work. 
And, of course, that was not all that the Equal Rights 
Amendment was about.

<p>

So I am starting off today just bringing up a very 
poignant figure in American feminism, a woman named Betty 
Friedan, whom I am sure you have all heard of.  As I started 
working on my thesis, I thought, well, I really need to dive 
into the concepts and the ideologies of feminism to 
understand these women, where they were coming from.

<p>

So I picked up a copy of <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>,
and, of course, believing I would completely disagree with 
everything Betty Friedan said, I began to read. And to my 
horror, I was agreeing with her. And I read, and I read, 
and I remember sitting in the library, and before I knew it, 
I had read 125 pages straight of this book, and I thought, 
Something's wrong.  I'm agreeing with this woman.  I'm not 
supposed to agree with Betty Friedan.

<p>

And so I stepped back and thought, Okay, what is 
it that she accomplished?  I had recently ended a 
relationship, so I knew I was going to be coming out of grad 
school with no strings, no marriage prospects, would be 
heading off into the career world, would be getting a job, 
supporting myself, and I thought, I can identify with the 
things she is saying in this book.  She wrote that book to 
women who were either newly out of school and headed off to 
a career in the 1960s or women who were married, 
intelligent, a lot of them starting out, of course, Smith 
women, who were not fulfilled because they were at home 
doing laundry and changing diapers, and in many cases, that 
is about all they were doing.

<p>

And so she took some very real fears that I 
believe every women who has any education at all and any 
ambition at all faces, she took those fears, and she said, 
"Okay, if you have these concerns" -- and remember, these 
were concerns that all women have -- "then you're a 
feminist, and this is the road that you must travel."

<p>

An entire generation of young women began to read 
her work and began to agree.  "Oh, I agree with her.  I must 
be a feminist."  And that is how a lot of the masses of 
feminism as we know it, as modern feminism, really got 
moving.

<p>

But, of course, we know that the core of the 
feminist movement in the 1960s and 1970s was actually very 
radical.  So we saw this big battle in the 1970s over the 
Equal Rights Amendment, and of course, I don't know how many 
of you realize that the word "woman" does not appear in that 
amendment once.  It wasn't about women.  It was about 
something much deeper. It was about eradicating any gender 
differences and gender roles whatsoever.

<p>

Now, I just got married recently, and I am 
starting to say, anybody who is married knows that there are 
major differences between men and women, which doesn't mean 
we are not equal.  Of course, we believe that men and women 
are equal not only under the law but under God.  But there 
are definite differences.

<p>

Women were given equal rights in the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act and the 1972 Equal Employment Act.  These were 
situations where we didn't need an Equal Rights Amendment.

<p>

Well, the feminists lost in the 1970s.  Women, by 
and large, did not buy into the gender feminist perspective. 
So the feminists were unsuccessful in the 1970s.

<p>

They spent the 1980s taking the Equal Rights 
Amendment battle to the state level.  They fought it state 
by state by state.  Many states, like Illinois, had to fight 
it 12 times in a row.  Then in 1992 we had the last major 
battle on this issue, and that was in Iowa, and once again 
they lost, and once again they lost because American women 
still are not buying into this radical, hardened, gender 
feminist perspective.

<p>

So, today, who are American women?  Well, I will 
give you one example.  We at Concerned Women for America 
really do believe that we represent most American women.  Of 
course, the National Organization for Women wants to tell 
the world that we don't, that we're radical, that we're 
extreme.  I don't really think I look like an extremist, and 
I don't think I look very radical.  But that's what they 
tell the world.

<p>

But we decided to find a polling organization that 
has a good national reputation and say, What do American 
women believe?  Not CWA members.  We want to know what 
American women truly believe.

<p>

We found out that the social issues were the most 
important to American women today.  Fourteen percent said 
that crime was their top issue.  Eight percent said that 
declining moral values were important.

<p>

When we asked women if they considered themselves 
a feminist, 60 percent said no; 26 percent said yes; and 9 
percent said somewhat.  And that fits what is happening with 
the feminist lingo today.  It is getting into this nebulous 
field, and no one is sure what feminism really is anymore.

<p>

People were asked their total favorable view of 
National Organization for Women.  Only 36 percent had a 
favorable view of NOW.  That's very significant.  That's 
something we're not hearing in the media, but it's something 
that's important when you're considering women today and 
their voting patterns.

<p>

I think this was the most exciting statistic for 
us.  We discovered that eight out of ten women said that 
they would rather stay home with their children if they were 
financially able to do it.  It's not that we believe that 
women have to stay home or they should stay home, but we 
keep hearing over and over and over that women have careers 
and that that's more important, and, you know, children, 
just plug them into day care.  But eight out of ten women 
said, "If I could afford to, I would stay home."

<p>

But we have a very conservative group of women in 
this country, women that, when the media talks and says that 
women speak with one voice, they're wrong.  The liberal 
women out there and the conservative women out there exist, 
but they are in two very distinct camps, and as we look 
towards the elections, we need to realize that attaching the 
"women" label to one group no longer suffices.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. CORSO: Right now you can hear of a gender gap 
anywhere from 20 percent to 32 percent.  While men right now 
are statistically even in their vote for Dole or Clinton, 
women by far prefer Bill Clinton.  If you go back to 
Eisenhower, even for Kennedy, women voted more conservative 
then.  For Reagan's 1984 election, women eked out men just 
by two percentage points, 51-49 for Reagan.  However, now, 
as we see, it is anywhere -- 57 is the last I had heard, 57 
percent Clinton, 31 percent Dole, for women.

<p>

Why? Well, first of all, women support government 
programs more.  Government is not a bad thing for them.  
They would like to see it cut back a little bit, but the 
government is a protector.  That is why they look to the 
government.  Men want the government gone.  Big government 
is bad to them.  Big government is what is taking away the 
things that they want, things that they need.  They are more 
concerned with take-home pay and things like that, whereas 
the woman wants to know that the government is going to look 
out for, again, her children.

<p>

She is also very concerned about social spending. 
She wants to know that the government will be able to take 
care of her parents, whereas the husband is concerned about 
his parents -- he is not going to just ship them off, but 
the burden again comes on the wife to make sure not only her 
parents are taken care of but his parents are taken care of, 
also.  That is why she is concerned that the government is 
not going to cut out Medicare.

<p>

Welfare is also important to women.  They agree 
that right now the welfare state is not the way it should 
be, but don't get rid of it.  Trim it.  Cut it back.  Make 
it streamlined.

<p>

Women, though, are much more conservative when it 
comes to cultural value issues, drugs and crime.  Children 
who take drugs are a mother's worst nightmare.  They also 
worry, I am allowing my child to walk to school.  What's 
going to happen on his or her way home?  This is a big, big 
concern.

<p>

Crime is also a concern when it comes to 
punishment.  Women want to see these criminals punished, but 
they also want to see them rehabilitated.  People are not 
generally bad.  A man wants to see the guy put away for as 
long as possible.  That's another huge difference.

<p>

Women want to see the jails restructured, not just 
build more but restructure them, do more in the ways of a 
halfway house, allow a criminal who is not a violent 
offender to come out and try to get him or her back into 
society.  If, however, it is a rapist or it is someone who 
has done any crime towards children, you can throw that out 
the window.  They want that person put away for as long as 
possible.

<p>

Right now the gap, the infamous gender gap, comes 
from not just the big difference between men and females but 
also from the difference between women.  There is a group 
being courted very, very strongly by the Dole and Clinton 
camps.  Anxious white females, instead of angry white males, 
is what they are being called. Or the Soccer Moms.  These 
are suburban, they are married, they work and they stay at 
home, depending.  They have to work because they need the 
second income.  They really do not want to.  They want to 
take their kids to soccer practice.  They want to work for 
the PTA.  They want to volunteer in the library.  However, 
they just can't.  They need the second income.  It makes 
them a little bit bitter.

<p>

Their age ranges from 35 to 54, and their 
household income is about $40,000 and up.  This is perfectly 
the middle class.

<p>

Right now, they are leaning very strongly towards 
Bill Clinton.  They feel that Bill Clinton is not the 
greatest President we've ever had -- they'll never admit to 
that -- but he is the better of the two choices.

<p>

Why are they against Bob Dole?  A lot of it is his 
age.  They all have parents who are hitting the same age 
right now.  They see what their parents go through.  Bill 
Clinton is young.  Bill Clinton is their age.  He has a 
daughter.  He knows what it's like trying to get that 
daughter into ballet school and making sure she gets into 
the right college.  These are the worries and concerns these 
people have.

<p>

Bill Clinton's character is also not that much of 
an issue to these people.  Character is not going to be the 
deciding factor.  They actually may see him a little bit 
better for all the problems that have happened.  He is able 
to stand up to these attacks.  Nothing has stuck to him.  
Therefore, he is just standing tough and bouncing back.

<p>

They also like Hillary. She is someone who is 
standing by her husband.  She is someone who is trying to 
raise Chelsea and having attacks thrown at her left and 
right.  Yet she is still standing there; she is still 
smiling.

<p>

These women also love Elizabeth Dole, so there is 
going to be no head-to-head here between the First Ladies.  
She is someone who, again, is standing by her husband and 
someone who knows the burden of working and trying to take 
care of her family, Bob Dole.

<p>

Women -- you can change.  Republicans can focus 
more towards women, and there are three ways to do this.  
The first way is focus on the children.  Democrats and 
Republicans have always talked about today and all that.  
You will notice now they are talking about the future, our 
children.  Everyone, all women are going to empathize with 
that.

<p>

You also see today that the drug issue has become 
forefront.  Every ad we see is about drugs.  The two camps 
know this is a way to appeal to the women, to allow the 
women to come front and center.

<p>

Women also make up their minds late.  This swing 
voter, this Soccer Mom group, they are leaning towards 
Clinton, but they are not definite.  They could change their 
minds.  And what is going to happen is the way that they 
talk about children, the way they talk about drugs is what 
is going to lean them one way or the other.

<p>

It is also the family.  The family is very 
important.  Family values got played up in 1992.  "Family 
values" as a catch phrase is not going to work.  True 
feeling towards the families, seeing how people, how the 
members of Congress, how Clinton, how Dole react to their 
own families and family problems -- women are not fooled by 
the words; they need to see.  They need to see what these 
people are going to do.

<p>

You can't just talk to women; you have to listen 
to women, also.  Big difference.  Men, you can talk to them. 
Men will listen, they'll sit, they'll think about it, 
they'll go off.  Women have to have a dialogue.  That is 
another big difference.  You can talk to a woman, but if you 
don't give her a chance to talk back to you, then you're 
going to lose that woman right there.

<p>

<p>

MS. BOWMAN: I have been looking at gender issues 
for quite a long time and, as a matter of fact, did my first 
study of gender issues going back to the early survey data 
from the 1930s, and I thought I would talk a little bit 
about the differences that we have seen over time and about 
where we are today.  Of course, there weren't as many 
pollsters in the 1930s as there are today, but they asked, 
actually, I think, perhaps more interesting questions than 
the pollsters are asking today over a broad range of issues 
overall.

<p>

If you look at the data from the 1930s to the 
early 1970s, the pattern appeared to be pretty similar.  
There were some areas where men and women differed 
significantly and many areas where they didn't differ at 
all.  The so-called women's issues, defined very differently 
in that period than they are today, produced hardly any 
differences between men and women.  There are not 
significant differences between men and women today on 
something like abortion.  There are more significant 
differences by age.  But there were also no differences in 
this earlier period.

<p>

From the earliest of survey history, men and women 
have differed very significantly on when it is proper for a 
society to use force, very broadly defined:  sending troops 
abroad, gun control, the death penalty.  If you look back to 
the Persian Gulf War, you can see gender chasms on some 
questions involving, for example, the acceptability of 
civilian casualties, men saying completely acceptable, women 
saying not acceptable.  So this is an area that has always 
differentiated the sexes.

<p>

Another area, in the early period, women were less 
likely to be informed, less likely to have opinions, and I 
think, as Regina said, there is still evidence of that in 
the polls today.  Women are not necessarily less likely to 
be informed; they are clearly lagging indicators in terms of 
making their views known, making up their minds.  If you 
look, for example, at attitudes about Jack Kemp in some of 
the polls, they are more positive than negative among women, 
extraordinarily positive among men.  But over a third to 40 
percent of women don't have an opinion yet about Jack Kemp. 
They are lagging indicators.

<p>

You see this in a number of different areas.
Women took a long time to be convinced that the fundamental 
nature of the Soviet Union had changed.  Men were pretty 
convinced early on.  After Gorbachev, it became clear to 
them that the situation had changed dramatically.

<p>

The economy is a very important issue where women 
tend to be a lagging indicator, perhaps because they are 
more concerned, as Regina said, with families, and those are 
the first things that come to their minds in thinking about 
supporting their families.  But women are much less likely 
to believe, or much slower to believe, that the recession 
has ended, that the economy is getting better, again 
suggesting another fundamental difference.

<p>

But in that early period from 1930 to 1970, that 
was about all that we learned:  differences on the use of 
force, women less likely to have opinions, similarities on 
many issues overall, and no differences on the so-called 
women's issues.

<p>

If you look from 1975 on, new things began to 
appear in the data, and while I think it is dangerous to tie 
attitudinal data to demographic data, clearly, there are 
some links.  Women were coming back into the work force in 
significant numbers after the war experience, when, of 
course, they had been active in the work force and then out 
of the work force for a while.  Coming back in, they were at 
the lowest rung of the economic ladder, first hired, first 
fired, and many of them were heading single families.  So 
the interaction of those demographic trends, I think, 
produced some of the changes that we saw in the attitudinal 
data.

<p>

Some things stayed the same.  Women continued to 
be slower to form firm opinions than did men.  So-called 
women's issues, once again, no differences between men and 
women.

<p>

We saw some new areas that we had not seen before, 
and those are the most important because they are what 
Regina addressed most dramatically.  One, the minor issue:  
women appear to be more risk-averse than men, Shannon Lucid 
notwithstanding.  When Gallup asked the question about 
whether you'd like to ride on the space shuttle, there's a 
35 percentage point difference between men and women on that 
question.  Most women do not want to ride on the space 
shuttle; most men think it would be a great idea to go up 
and give that a try.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But again, you don't see a gap of 35 percentage 
points on many questions in survey research.  This is a 
gender chasm.  So the risk issues -- the location of nuclear 
power plants, chemical additives in food, safety and health 
issues overall -- women appear to be more risk-averse.

<p>

And then the final area that I thought Regina 
covered so well involves attitudes about the proper role of 
government in the society.  Women, by just about every poll 
that I see, favor a stronger role for government.  That 
isn't to say that they want government involved in their 
lives in an overwhelming way, but they do favor a stronger 
role for government.

<p>

I am just going to touch on three questions that 
were asked recently on issues involving government and see 
how you would respond to the questions, and then I will tell 
you how most men and women responded to those questions.

<p>

In early September, CBS and the <i>New York Times</i>
included two questions in their national survey that
underscored the deep skepticism that both sexes have about 
government.  But when asked to assess what kind of an impact 
government has on most people's lives -- is it negative, is 
it positive, or doesn't government have much impact at all? 
-- the national results, 42 percent said the impact of 
government was negative, 32 percent said positive, and 16 
percent said that government didn't have any impact on their 
lives at all.  But women were much more likely to say that 
government had a positive impact than were men.

<p>

Another question in the same poll:  Is government 
doing too many things better left to business and 
individuals, or should government be doing more to solve our 
country's problems?  Think about how you would answer that. 
Well, 62 percent of all Americans said that government was 
doing too much, and 28 percent said that government should 
be doing more, again a pretty clear opinion overall.  But 
once again, women were stronger on the pro-government side. 
Both men and women were negative about government, but 
women favored the government role more strongly than men.

<p>

But when the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> posed a question on 
their September 7-10 poll, they asked people which idea came 
closer to their own idea about government. The first 
statement was, "Government should provide tools to help 
families better their lives, such as education and job 
training."  The other formulation was, "The best thing that 
government can do for families is to cut taxes and allow 
individual families to decide for themselves how to allocate 
their money" -- very much what Bob Dole is talking about in 
trusting the people.

<p>

The overall percentages:  47 percent that 
government should provide tools to help families, 43 percent 
that the best thing government could do was get out -- a 
public pretty evenly split overall, but once again, women 
came down more strongly on the pro-government side.  Again, 
men and women were not overwhelmingly different on these 
questions, but it persists.  It is what we call in survey 
research patterned.  It is always there.  Women take the 
slightly stronger role for government overall.

<p>

So those areas have stood out in the research, and 
I think that is what is driving the gender gap that we are 
seeing in the Presidential-level polling overall.  We don't 
see it as much when you are asked about individual 
congressional races, and I think that that is because 
individual Republican Congressmen have dealt better with a 
lot of these issues in their districts in terms of talking 
about what is on their agenda than perhaps Bob Dole has 
overall.

<p>

But Republicans and conservatives have an enormous 
amount of work to do.  We cannot deny these very significant 
numbers that we are now seeing in this election overall.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. JAMES: Well, you see, politics is a very 
complex game here, and it is also very important for us as 
women to be as sophisticated about how that works, and so 
what that means for me is that not only is it important for 
the issues that I care about, but it is also very important 
for me that I look, as chairs of the various subcommittees, 
that I look for the leadership in the House, so it is 
important for me that Trent Lott stays there.  And if I 
lived in an area where I had two choices -- thankfully, I 
don't -- two bad choices, I would always go for the person 
that is going to keep Trent Lott and Newt there.  I mean, I 
would, because that is important for the overall, global, 
larger picture.  And so we are sophisticated enough to 
understand that and to be able to work with that.

<p>

MS. MILLER: We have talked about depending upon 
the age of the women makes a difference.  We have talked 
about employment status.  What about family status, whether 
they are married or not married, and how does that make a 
difference in voting patterns?  I don't know who wants to 
take a stab at that.

<p>

MS. BOWMAN: There is also a marriage gap, and in 
some surveys it is larger than the gender gap.  It is a 
very, very significant gap, with married voters being more 
Republican and single voters being more Democratic.

<p>

Married voters tend to turn out to vote.  They 
have more of a stake in the society.  We like to say that 
once you get a mortgage, a marriage, and children, that you 
are drawn back into the political process, and that is, I 
think, what the political science literature suggests, and 
clearly, there are significant marriage gaps.

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD:  . . . is when you look at this 
economy, fundamentally, we started in this nation on a 
premise that the family was the thing that would drive the 
economy; and as you have successful families and family 
businesses, you are going to filter that up, and you are 
going to end up having a successful economy.

<p>

So I think there is definitely merit to that as 
far as the families are getting smaller, people aren't 
focusing on family businesses, people aren't thinking about 
the family in terms of the economy in many instances these 
days, just at the grass-roots level, and I think that could 
have an effect.

<p>

As far as for Betty Friedan, I would just say you 
have just exemplified and pointed out the shift that the 
feminist movement has taken.  They hit on the social issues, 
and some of the more radical social issues, for so long, and 
they have suddenly discovered that women, younger women 
today, don't care, because they have never been told they 
can't get a certain kind of job.  They have never been 
discriminated against in any way, shape, or form.  And so 
when they are presented with this radical social agenda, 
they say, "Take a hike.  This doesn't affect me."

<p>

But the economy and their pocketbook is the one 
area that they are still able to have some sway.  So that is 
the direction that feminism, from a policy perspective, has 
been moving in the last few years.

<p>

MS. MILLER: Laurel, I remember the U.N. Fourth 
World Conference.  There are a lot of interesting things 
that they did in terms of the platform, and I do want you to 
mention a couple in terms of how the word "family" and how 
the word "mother" were recrafted, and it did not appear in a 
mainstream press in this country at all.  They just said, 
"We're doing wonderful things for women.  The Hillary 
Clinton speech is really going to uplift women around the 
globe."

<p>

Yet, at the same time -- you made an interesting 
comment about how they've taken this agenda that didn't work 
on the federal level, hasn't worked on the state level; it 
has gone to the international level.  Would you just mention 
a couple of those?

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD: I will give you some wonderful 
examples. Households, family -- they defined family and 
violence against women -- we are seeing a lot lately about 
violence against women, and of course, we are all women, and 
we would say no, we are not in favor of violence against 
women. But this U.N. document defined violence against 
women as always being home-based, and men are the abusers of 
women and children, and that is how this document put it.  
It was an occasion to go man-bashing rather than to address 
real concerns and issues of crime.

<p>

As far as motherhood, they sought to take out the 
word "mother," to remove the word "mother" from the document 
and replace it with "caretaker," or "household."  When they 
are taking about family, they want to talk about household, 
not family, because it is a system now -- and, of course, 
the gender feminism here in the West, especially in the 
United States, is really driving that -- gender, again, 
socially constructed.  They refused to define the word 
"gender" in the document.

<p>

So you have, for all intents and purposes, a 200-
page document that talks about gender all the way through, 
and yet it is never defined, because when push came to shove 
-- and I know Victor Morero(?) was pushed to the wall by 
Congressman Chris Smith in a hearing summer before last -- 
he said, "I'm sorry, we can't define gender as male and 
female, because there are large segments of society that 
believe it is socially constructed."

<p>

That was the position of our United States 
delegation.  That is the position that was maintained in 
Beijing.  There is no definition of gender, which is 
ludicrous.  When you look at any bill here in the United 
States, we have findings for bills in Congress.  We also 
have definitions for terms, because we know that, legally, 
if you don't define your terms, the sky is the limit in how 
they can be implemented.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we stand with the American Family
Association and recognize Pornography Awareness Week.

<p>

Pornography permeates our society in a variety of 
forms, most of which we try to keep from children.  Yet 
pornography has entered a new, more accessible frontier, 
cyberspace.  Child pornography and other hard-core obscenity 
travels through cyberspace at an alarming pace and not only 
reaches children, who are often more adept on the computer 
than their parents, but also abuses children by portraying 
them in a sexual manner.

<p>

In fact, it is not illegal to send a child hard-core filth 
through e-mail or to make it easy for kids to 
find obscene pictures of sex and sexual-mutilation deaths.
Children, women, and men, though pornography addiction, are 
all victims of a multi-million-dollar pornography industry. 
And it is of particular concern now, because President 
Clinton has pledged to get every school hooked up on the 
Internet, a sometimes dangerous computer playground.
Tonight we talk to two key players in this crucial battle 
against pornography.

<p>

But first, let's talk about the election less than 
one week away.  The majority of U.S. voters are women, whose 
voices both inside and outside the beltway can no longer be 
ignored.  It is important for conservatives and liberals 
alike to learn how to talk to this constituency of women, to 
win their hearts and their votes.

<p>

Let's hear how women at a special Heritage 
Foundation event addressed this gender issue, as we take you 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

[Segments from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. BLAIR: In America today, the term "working 
family" is practically an oxymoron.  You can work or you can 
have a family, but it is awfully, awfully hard to have both. 
The reason why that happens is, quite simply, the tax 
burden. The tax burden is what drives the second person in 
the family into the work force, as we have seen from the CWA 
poll, which showed that 80 percent of women, if they could, 
would stay home with their children.

<p>

What drives the tax burden?  It is often called 
women's interests, but what it really is is interest groups' 
interests.  Those are the folks who want to get every 
taxpayer in America to contribute one penny so that they can 
do this good thing, and those pennies add up, and you find 
that you've got folks working very, very hard to pay the 
government and try to manage to have a decent life for 
themselves.

<p>

If you look at the social issues, it seems to me 
that one thing we really cannot deny is that money has not 
solved those problems, and we would all have to acknowledge 
that it is going to be time and attention that solves those 
problems. Unfortunately, the more government we have, the 
more we are simply throwing money at those problems and not 
time and attention; and the more we drive women unwillingly 
into the work force and drive taxes up to take money away 
from families, the more we are simply doing the wrong thing 
for those problems.

<p>

The women who would like to be at home, the women 
who would like to be able to do volunteer work in their 
communities, so they say, would be exactly the people who 
would be doing volunteer work in their communities to help 
these social problems, who would be raising their children 
in a way that they felt confident that the children would 
turn out to be okay and solve some of those social problems.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. ARNETT: Let's listen to what women are 
saying.  And I think that something I am hearing today is, 
as a conservative women, I don't understand why the polls 
show that women are so overwhelmingly supporting Bill 
Clinton, because he stands for everything that I as a 
conservative woman think is contrary to our interests.

<p>

I believe that conservative women are really at 
the critical threshold of being the most important voice and 
the one that is the least heard in this debate, because 
conservative women have a sense of a society in which values 
matter and the individual and the family are the center of 
decisionmaking, not the government; in which there is a 
balance between different levels of government, where 
community service is something that we consider to be 
something that we want to do, where children and the future 
generations are something that we think about every day.

<p>

When you have a government that -- the classic 
quote -- "a government who can give you everything you want 
is a government who can take away everything you have," and 
there is just this disconnect with women being concerned 
about the future, being compassionate, wanting security, and 
yet all of the programs that have been shown by liberal 
agendas in which government controls the center of power are 
against the things that women most, in my sense, value.

<p>

So I think, as conservative women, we have an 
obligation to help others understand the consequences of 
these government policies.  And I also think women, in a lot 
of ways, are the ones who suffer most right now from the 
policy fixes that we most need.

<p>

The taxation and the tax treatment of health 
insurance is a tremendous problem that drives many of the 
distortions that we see in the current system.  For example, 
let's take two people, one woman who is working two jobs -- 
she may be divorced, she may be a single mom -- with two 
kids, and she doesn't have health insurance.  She is 
working. She is trying to provide for herself, for her 
family. She has stretched time and resources absolutely to 
the limit. She doesn't have health insurance, but she still 
has to pay her taxes.

<p>

She works at a company as maybe a temp, and the 
chief executive officer has this incredibly generous health 
insurance policy.  The reason for that is that the only way 
you can get a generous tax break for health insurance is if 
your employer buys the policy for you.  And so you wind up 
with this incredible, incredible distortion at the center of 
our health care system that costs $100 billion a year in tax 
benefits, in which the chief executive of a company can get 
all of his medical bills paid, absolutely everything, 
probably time at a spa, mountain climbing, all part of a 
health plan.

<p>

And here is this woman who is paying her taxes and 
working as hard as she possibly can.  She doesn't have 
health insurance.  The only way that she can get health 
insurance is to either go on welfare so she can get Medicaid 
or to try to get a job that pays generous enough benefits so 
she can get health insurance.

<p>

That is a terrible problem, where you have this 
woman paying taxes to subsidize health insurance for the 
chief executive officer so he can have this generous health 
benefit plan.  That is the kind of invisible problem in the 
current system that, if women knew about that, they would be 
outraged.

<p>

On taxes, we did a little chart here -- I should 
have brought it as an overhead to show you -- that shows 
that the average family pays more in taxes than it spends 
for food, shelter, transportation, and clothing combined.  
If you visualize a bar chart in which state and local taxes 
are a higher line than those four other things -- food, 
clothing, shelter/housing, and transportation combined -- 
people don't understand that, because they see the paycheck 
that they get, and they don't understand the reason you're 
having to work a second job, the reason you're having to be 
in the work place instead of being home where you want to 
be, raising your children, as eight of ten women say they 
want to do, is because you have to pay all these taxes.

<p>

Government security, the security that you say you 
want from government, is the very reason that your life is 
being so disrupted by a government that is seeping in in its 
power and authority to either take away the resources and 
the authority that you have or to pretend to give you 
something on one hand but to take two handfuls out on the 
other side.

<p>

That kind of education, I believe, as conservative 
women, we have a responsibility to help other people 
understand that government security and compassion and the 
sense of being in control of your own life is not something 
that can come from Washington.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. SILBERMAN: I believe that conservatives are 
somewhat tone-deaf in the way that they relate to American 
women and the American people.

<p>

I don't know whether you all have noticed, as I 
have, in the last few weeks, there have been pundits on all 
sides of the ideological spectrum (who) having been talking 
about the "feminization of American politics" in relation to 
the gender gap.

<p>

I am absolutely fascinated by this, and I think it 
behooves conservatives to spend some time figuring out the 
whys and wherefores of this phenomenon, because it 
absolutely is a phenomenon.

<p>

At first blush, I think, to speak of the 
feminization of American politics is counterintuitive to the 
principles which many of my friends take as an article of 
faith, and that is that one's gender should not dictate 
one's ideology and that having a uterus does not 
automatically mean that you are a liberal.

<p>

It seems to me that the gender gap's inescapable 
concomitant is the feminization of American political 
discourse, and I have come to believe that both the gender 
gap and the feminization of our politics have resulted from 
the fact that conservatives are tone-deaf, and that 
everything that people hear in the media and from our 
culture really reflects the resonance of the liberal point 
of view, because conservatives just don't know how to talk 
to people.

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, we'll talk to those 
in the fight against pornography, as <i>Straight Talk</i> observes 
Pornography Awareness Week.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. For more than a decade, the 
American Family Association has declared Pornography 
Awareness Week.  To help us understand why this week is so 
crucial, I am joined by two of those who have worked 
together in the battle against the multi-million-dollar 
pornography industry.  I would like to welcome Dee Jepsen, 
president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome to the 
show.

<p>

You all have been working on this issue for a long 
time, and why is that?  I think a lot of people think, well, 
I've seen some naked pictures and it hasn't really had an 
effect on me.  Why do we even need to be concerned about 
pornography?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, first of all, the material that 
we are talking about is illegal material, and it has a very 
harmful effect upon society in general, and specifically, we 
have a great concern for children.

<p>

Today, with the availability of this material via 
the Internet, through the computers that kids are more 
literate at than most adults, it is a very big problem and 
getting bigger.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We have so many ways in which we 
have seen pornography devastate communities and 
relationships. Sometimes we talk about the victims of 
pornography, and they, of course, include women and 
children, but not just women and children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Men also are very manipulated by 
pornography, and some don't realize it until they find that 
they have a compulsion to consume it.  So it really has no 
beneficial effect in our society, and we ought to keep 
working to try to push it away from the mainstream and into 
the fringes.

<p>

We have to tolerate some of it, some marginal 
amount, because of our free speech jurisprudence, but we 
don't have to tolerate it in front of our kids and we don't 
have to tolerate it in front of non-consenting adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead, Dee.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is ironic, too, Kristi, that some 
people in our society feel, men feel they should have the 
freedom to have this material.  The irony is that once they 
get addicted to it, which happens quite easily, they are no 
longer in control of that desire to see that material; it is 
in control of them. And we see all kinds of devastation, as 
Cathy mentioned, within family structures, and it becomes 
the hard copy, if you will, of what is playing in the 
theater of their minds, and what you see and what you hear 
does affect how you act.  I mean, that is what education is 
all about.  That is why we have multi-millions and, I am 
sure, billions of dollars spent on advertising in this 
country, to affect action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The scope of pornography -- and 
let's just define it for a second about some of the kinds of 
pornography you are most concerned about -- I mean, a lot of 
people, they think pornography, they think <i>Playboy</i> magazine,
and I am not sure that they are really aware of the kinds of 
material that is available and that there is pornography 
that is actually illegal, because free speech seems to be a 
get-out-of-jail-free card, you know, in our society. It's a 
speech issue, so we can't stop anything.

<p>

But, Cathy, you are a lawyer.  How do the courts 
define what is illegal pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, the word "pornography" is not 
a legal term.  Pornography refers to any representation that 
is designed to arouse the viewer.  But then we move beyond 
the general definition into the legal terms.  There is a 
term called "obscenity," and what that doesn't mean -- 
people think that means foul speech.  It can include foul 
speech, but what obscenity is is the hard-core pornography 
that the Supreme Court says deserves no legal protection.  
The First Amendment does not protect obscenity or hard-core 
pornography.  Adults can't trade in it; they certainly can't 
give it to kids; they can't export it or import it; you 
can't sell it or buy it.

<p>

So obscenity, hard-core pornography, and that 
would be the XXX type of material or worse, simply is not a 
legal commodity.  It's like drugs:  it's illegal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's like bestiality, torture -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Mutilation. Child pornography, of 
course, is a form of it, but all kinds of really bizarre 
behavior involving numerous men, women, animals.  It is 
beyond description.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is the deviant -- things people 
that aren't into this wouldn't even imagine.  It is beyond 
the imagination.  But then you look at the category of 
things, examples of which might be <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i>.
Those types of things have been deemed by the courts -- we 
don't always agree with this -- as being legal for adults 
but illegal for kids, and that would be legal pornography.
It is not obscene, but it can be characterized certainly as 
pornography.  And those things, we are allowed as citizens 
to enact laws or to encourage our legislators to enact laws 
to restrict the sale of these things, but we cannot prevent 
adults completely from getting them.  So that would be the 
second category of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dee, you had a long and prestigious 
career before you came to Enough is Enough, which truly 
focuses on the hardest kind of pornography.  But what is the 
scope of pornography?  This is Pornography Awareness Week.
How many lives are touched by it?  How much money is 
involved?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we have always said, in recent 
years it is an $8 billion to $10 billion a year industry.
With the advent of the computer and the Internet as the new 
delivery system, I imagine those figures now have changed 
quite a bit. It is hard to measure. But the effect that it 
has had in human life is beyond measurement.  You know, we 
get letters, and we look into the faces and the hearts of 
people every day in one way or another that have been harmed 
by it.

<p>

Children who were molested, and one of the major 
tools in that molestation was pornography, will have a pain, 
a hurt in their heart that, even if they go through 
counseling and healing, there will always be a scar from it 
all their life. Ofttimes people that molest children were 
molested as children, not always certainly, but that is a 
factor.  Sometimes people turn to self-abuse because of 
misplaced guilt or low self-esteem.

<p>

It has a huge effect upon society, and I think it 
is even bigger than that, because it is a devaluation of 
human life, and there is no respect because there is no love 
involved.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have certainly read in some of the 
literature on pornography that it encourages -- you know, if 
men see women as objects and they need these kinds of 
devices to become aroused, I mean, eventually, you can't 
have a healthy relationship if you can't see women as 
anything other than something that is a tool.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That is interesting.  Just this 
year, a psychiatrist named Dr. Gary Brooks has come out with 
a book that I would recommend called <i>The Centerfold
Syndrome</i>. It talks about how society is perpetuating and 
helping perpetuate the myth of the centerfold as the ideal 
woman, and all other women as being inadequate.  And men are 
manipulated by this, the result of which is inability to 
have intimacy with real women.

<p>

It is a fascinating book.  He is by no means any 
sort of conservative or religious leader.  He is a 
psychiatrist who has counseled men for many years about 
their issues of masculinity, and he has come out with this, 
and many people are angry with him.  The ACLU and others 
think he is a fraud.  But some feminist groups are taking 
note and saying, yes, that is what we have been trying to 
say all along.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, you know, every feminist, every 
religious, every non-religious, every moderate, every 
conservative, every liberal woman in this country ought to 
agree on this issue, and caring men should, also.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And I think they do.

<p>

We are going to want to hear more about this and 
what happens with children when we come back. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we are going to bring you more about the fight 
to protect our children from hard-core pornography.  Stay 
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are joining with the 
American Family Association in recognizing Pornography 
Awareness Week.  With me to discuss the need for such a week 
is Dee Jepsen, president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy 
Cleaver, the Family Research Council's director of legal 
policy.  Welcome back.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
effect that pornography has had on men, but pornography, 
Dee, has it not had an effect on crime?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it really has, and Cathy can 
probably cite some studies about how it has affected areas 
where there is pornography available, sexually oriented 
businesses exist.  But it encourages rape, because a lot of 
this material is showing women being portrayed as being 
overpowered by men and used sexually, and demeaned and 
degraded.

<p>

It also plays a very large role in the molestation 
of children.  It very often, in fact most often, is involved 
in child molestation.  They use it not only for their own 
incitement, but they use it to break down the inhibitions of 
the child, and they use it as an instruction manual to show 
the child what to do.  And then if they photograph or film 
that molestation, producing child pornography therefore, 
they will often use it to blackmail the child into silence.

<p>

So it plays a huge role in that, and it has an 
economic effect upon communities, as well, where this is 
available.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways in which the 
impact of pornography has been studied, and you don't 
usually hear a lot about this because there are forces out 
there -- free speech rights, absolutists -- that don't want 
people to really know this, and that is, where there is a 
high consumption of pornography, there is a correlative high 
incidence of rape and sexual attack.  There just simply is.

<p>

Oklahoma City was studied over a four-year period 
in the mid-eighties, and over 130 porn and sex businesses 
were run out of the city, and the rape rate dropped 50 
percent as it was rising in surrounding cities.  There was a 
direct correlation to the amount of pornography that was 
available and that was being consumed by the people of that 
area.

<p>

There are studies upon studies of community values 
and community worth and how housing and businesses and the 
value of that property diminishes immediately as soon as 
porn businesses move in en masse to an area.  You might 
think this is common sense, but it is also good business 
sense.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways to approach 
fighting pornography.  There are spiritual, moral, but also 
business and just simple common-sense ways.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the use of pornography in 
sex crimes, I think, has been really illustrated by the 
National Center on Missing and Exploited Children, which we 
have had on the show before, but just talking about how they 
use that pornography in the same way that men become 
addicted.  You become stimulated, and then you need to 
escalate the kinds of materials -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. It's an addictive process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, and a desensitization to the violence of it, and 
then in acting out.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was some legislation recently, 
Cathy.  It didn't work, but it was interesting, to attempt 
to deal with the fact that pornography is used to act out 
sex crimes in a pattern of use.  Could you tell us about 
that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Sure. A few years ago, we were all 
fighting for the Pornography Victims Compensation Act.  What 
that would have provided would be a tool for people, 
individuals who are harmed by pornography because of either 
an attack or some other personal violence, allowing that 
individual to attempt to prove that this pornography played 
a significant factor in their harm.  That law failed, but I 
wouldn't be surprised if we see that coming up again, 
because it makes a lot of sense.

<p>

When there is a direct business injury because of 
an unreasonable and careless business operation, you can 
recover business damages.  But there is no personal damage 
recovery right now from the ill effects of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  What I found so interesting 
about that case was it was a case where a gentleman had a 
video, that he would kidnap a woman -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: And imitate the video.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and imitate the video, actually 
play and stop the video and do that thing to the woman, and 
did this repeatedly.  It was very clear that he was acting 
out that specific video.  And they were not able to do 
anything to the company that had sold him a blueprint for 
murder.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's really what it is, and people 
may not have accepted this idea at the time, but I do think, 
over a period of time -- it takes a while for the public to 
become educated to something.  You think about what has 
happened in a generation as far as smoking is concerned, 
about drinking and driving.  It took 10 or 11 years for 
MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, to bring about a public 
change of heart, a mind-set.

<p>

You have to focus on the problem, and most of 
America hasn't done that because it's not a pleasant topic. 
It is very distasteful, especially as women, to work in 
this area.  But if we don't do it, our children and 
grandchildren will suffer because we haven't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. I know that you all are both 
really concerned because of the Internet and its effect on 
children.  I mean, as easy or difficult as pornography may 
have been to get before, now you can type in a word, a 
single word, like "sex" or "zoo," and get all kinds of 
horrible bestiality or any kind of molestation information 
coming up.

<p>

I was really disturbed to learn recently that 
there are some words on the Internet which are common, like 
"recipe" or the most common words that someone might type 
in, that pornographers have been putting those common words 
on their screens just to bring up the pornography, even if 
their screen has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If Clinton really does have the 
Internet in every school in America, what are you all going 
to be concerned about?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we are very, very concerned.
In fact, Enough is Enough has revised its whole strategic 
plan to focus at this point in time on making the Internet 
safe for children.  That is a huge job, but it is a growing 
technology, and with, as you say, every child being able to 
have access to a computer by the year 2000, which is four 
years away, every parent and grandparent and teacher in this 
country ought to be concerned, and we ought to be doing 
everything we can to address that.

<p>

We feel, frankly, that it is going to take a 
multifaceted approached.  We need tough legislation with 
aggressive law enforcement.  We need an educated public, 
especially parents.  We need a technology industry that 
becomes family-friendly, and I think that is not only a 
civic responsibility, but I think it is a good marketing 
approach, and I think we are going to see more of that as 
time goes by.

<p>

We will need an international coordinated effort 
as time goes by, also, because it is an enormous problem.
It is not just in the United States where there is concern; 
it is growing around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Cathy, I know you and I 
have talked about this on occasion, but there has been a sad 
increase in molestation and rapes of children, of younger 
children, 8-year-olds molesting 4-year-olds and 7-year-olds 
and infants.  I mean, we are really seeing little children 
with not a -- and what has been interesting in some of the 
cases is their arguing that the children did not have 
criminal intent because they didn't understand, although 
they did act out a sexual molestation of a younger child.
Is it accurate to say that pornography on very young 
children has even a stronger effect than on adults?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, it can.  It can absolutely 
have a stronger effect, and I think that what this 
highlights is how many liberal activists like to experiment, 
frankly, with our children, experiment with their new 
agenda.

<p>

The American Library Association, for instance, as 
a matter of policy, says it will never use screening 
mechanisms on computers in libraries, even when a child as 
young as 10 years old or younger sits down at that computer.

<p>

In my opinion, that is a reckless disregard for 
children, and that is really experimenting with their lives. 
And then when we see these cases, we can see how truly 
devastating this can be for children.

<p>

There are many other ways in which we sort of 
experiment with children with pornography.  It is absolutely 
dehumanizing.  In the recent case on computer pornography, 
we saw ACLU experts come up on the stand and say, "I show my 
5-year-old hard-core pornography."  This is supposed to be 
some sort of psychologist, sexologist, or something.  And he 
was applauded, and he was one of their star witnesses.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is amazing.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it sure is.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Now, this is just completely 
unhuman, and we seem to have checked out our common sense at 
the door on some of these issues with kids.

<p>

But pornography can completely ruin a child's 
impression of the world, himself, his body, other people, 
and it's like a poison, and we've got to be careful not to 
feed kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have to hear more 
about this in a moment.  Following this commercial break, 
we'll continue our discussion, and we hope you'll stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to talk 
about Pornography Awareness Week is Dee Jepsen, president of 
the Enough is Enough Campaign, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome back 
again to our show.

<p>

You know, one thing that really struck me about 
the pornography discussions, we have all agreed, on a whole, 
in a society that some information is not appropriate for 
children.  You know, we no more give children guns, even 
though guns are legal in certain settings, or medicines, 
even though certain narcotics are legal in certain settings, 
than we give them pornography.  You can't sell it over a 
counter, or in a video store they couldn't check it out.

<p>

But on the Internet, I was shocked to learn 
recently that it is legal to e-mail a child the most graphic 
obscenity, and there is no law to stop it; that somehow on 
the computer world the law is void or suspended or 
something.  How do we explain that?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is a very difficult thing to deal 
with, and Cathy might talk about some of the legal 
intricacies of it.  But we have had some victories in recent 
days. We were able to see the Communications Decency Act 
passed.  It is now being challenged in the courts and will 
be going to the Supreme Court.  Cathy probably knows more 
about that than I.  And we also saw a bill pass that made 
computer-generated child pornography illegal, just like 
child pornography per se is illegal.

<p>

Today, you look at modern movies and you see how 
that which you know is not real becomes real before your 
eyes, and they can do that on the computers, and that 
material is still used in the same way that other child 
pornography is used by pedophiles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, basically, although we know 
there were no dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, they could create 
them.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So if you created children for 
obscene pictures, that also would be illegal.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. That's right, and this 
material now being available by computer makes every home 
and school and library, every place there is a computer 
outlet hooked to the Internet, a site of delivery or 
distribution for pornography.  That is an appalling 
situation.

<p>

Cathy mentioned earlier about those within the 
library community that do not want to have any kind of 
filter system so children cannot -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that's our taxpayer-funded 
libraries, too.  I mean, let's be clear.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That's right.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: But some of these very same people 
would be so supportive of trying to create a risk-free 
environment in the area of toys and everything else that 
children are involved with, and they want quality control on 
everything, and I am not knocking that at all.  All I am 
saying is, this is what we are pouring into children's 
minds, and somewhere logic has become convoluted in that 
whole argument.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We really treat both pornography, 
which we have been struggling with, and now the Internet 
with kid gloves, I think.  In the next few months we are 
going to be seeing at the Supreme Court the ACLU and other 
pornography magazine distributors, their challenge against 
this computer pornography law.  So there are many anti-pornography 
groups -- Enough is Enough, Family Research 
Council, and others -- who are trying to defend this law 
because it makes sense.

<p>

Guccione, the publisher of <i>Penthouse</i>, is now 
filing suit, we understand, against the military anti-pornography 
law, which says that we ought not sell pornography on our military bases.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: At a discounted rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At a discount to our servicemen, yes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: So that makes sense.  The law makes 
sense.  The challenge doesn't make any sense.  But it's a 
constant battle.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's where he makes his money.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That's where he makes his money, so 
it makes sense to him.  There is a battle in our courts 
always, and there is a really a battle for the hearts and 
minds of the people of our society.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, here is an interesting 
counter to that.  Let's look at what has happened in 
television.  You have the President for the V-chip, 
assuming, of course, that the government decides what should 
be blocked as violence.  And you've got all of these so-called 
child advocates favoring pornography and pornography 
distribution, but on the other hand saying we must mandate 
more educational television, and we must govern advertising 
on television for its impact on children; we have to be 
harsher on cigarette and alcohol ads, so that even the 
presence of Joe Camel on a race car is anti-child.

<p>

And these same people who seem to think that Joe 
Camel on a race car will drive children to smoking don't 
think that killing people in a slasher film will have any 
effect on them at all.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is a great example.  That is 
exactly right.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  But I really 
believe, if we talk about it long enough, that the American 
public are finally going to have the light bulb go on, and 
they are going to say, "Wait a minute.  There's something 
wrong here, and we're going to have to do something about 
it."

<p>

You know, homes and libraries and schools across 
this country should be at least installing blocking 
technology, and now there is new technology that can be 
installed, second generation, at the server level.  And we 
are going to be doing everything we can to get that done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We just have a couple minutes left. 
Tell us how people could find out about that.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, one thing they could do is 
contact our office.  That telephone number is 703-278-8343, 
and we could get material to them.  We would be happy to do 
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There is a little bit of technology. 
I know Cathy has been concerned about how thorough it can 
be, but it would be something.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It should be done.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It's a beginning.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It's a beginning. Many parents have 
decided simply not to have the Internet in their homes if 
they have children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: We hear it all the time.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And if I had children, right now, I 
don't think I would have the Internet in my home.  The 
software blocking mechanisms are very inadequate, and it 
only takes one picture to really assault a child.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And so you might want to consider 
that if you are a parent now with kids, just not bringing 
the Internet in your home until it gets better, until these 
laws start to be enforced.  But at all costs, you ought to 
employ, find out which software blocking program is 
esteemed.  Enough is Enough has some ideas about which ones 
are good programs, and they are a good resource for parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to have people 
call us for that information.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you, and this is not 
over.  I know the court case is going to come up the first 
of the year, and we are going to want to hear back.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will present 
another aspect of how this year's campaigns address women 
and the so-called women's issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

I was fortunate to join the discussion at The 
Heritage Foundation, which you caught a glimpse of earlier 
in the show. These panels showed that there really are no 
kneejerk women's positions, although two issues, education 
and the life issue, are usually played as if there are.
Let's see how those issues unfold as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
some Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

[Segment from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to just put forward that 
there are two issues that I am going to address that I think 
are fundamental to our natures as women.  Harkening back to 
this obsession with feminine hygiene, I think there is 
something true about women's fundamental physical nature 
that makes you very practical about your children and about 
not just the children that you have but that you could have 
or that other women are having, that we are regularly 
reminded that we are not alone in the world, that we have a 
generation to think about before us and that we come from 
something, and I think it makes women, in particular, very 
practical.

<p>

There are two issues that I wanted to address that 
I think are fundamental issues for their importance to 
women, although I don't want to box them in as women's 
issues, but also the problem with them, from my perspective, 
and that launched me on a heated diatribe with Karen, was 
the way in which they are discussed.

<p>

Those issues that I think are very interesting to 
women are education and life.  And again, because of their 
fundamental connection to our interest in children and to 
our interest in our society's longevity, it is a long-term-thinking 
approach.  Both education and the life issue 
connect us to the future.  Both of them say that we are 
going to be building something and we are concerned about 
it.

<p>

But what irritates me about these two issues is 
that they are described in such kneejerk fashion, and I 
didn't get a chance to ask this question, but I think that 
women, in particular, have to be a little more irritated 
with the way in which the debate goes, because its competing 
slogan -- education, tax thing, you know, education, 
program, education this, education that -- as though somehow 
we are too unintelligent, A, to make our own decisions, B, 
to understand a greater context of the debate.

<p>

And so on the issue of education in general, at 
Family Research Council, I will tell you right up front, we 
think that people are smart enough to choose schools that 
have opportunity, and to take tax dollars and set them up as 
a sacred cow in a school system in which you have no input, 
in which groups like the People for the American Way or the 
American Library Association will label your calling the 
school an act of censorship, not because anything happened 
but because a parent accidentally got involved in the 
process, that somehow this is an offense to the educational 
system because you had a thought about your child's 
education.

<p>

And so what we have tried to do in terms of the 
education debate is say, look, people are intelligent.  They 
can make intelligent decisions, and the education debate is 
so jargon-full and practicality-absent.

<p>

And so what I wanted to say to the Dole campaign, 
if they were listening, is it's not to talk about education 
but to talk about it specifically and with compassion, 
because I don't think that Bill Clinton wins in the 
specifics, but I think sometimes he wins in the compassion, 
that as women we are very concerned about what happens to 
our children, and sometimes the green-eyeshade approach, 
which is a Republican-heavy approach, doesn't cut it for us.

<p>

I am not per se -- I can tell you for myself, if 
the money that my husband and I paid out in tax dollars was 
effective, I probably would be thrown out of the Republican 
Party for saying, "Well, sure, it's a lot, but, you know, 
they're doing something."

<p>

But the problem with a lot of people is they're 
taking a lot of my money and doing nothing.  They're doing 
nothing.  It is not just that my money disappears but that 
it ineffectively disappears.

<p>

I have been working for the end of the Department 
of Education for a long time, and I want to tell you why.
Seven cents out of every dollar spent in the local school 
comes from the Federal Government, but the majority of the 
mandates for education come from the Federal Government.  So 
for a toehold of dollars, we get a barrelful of policies, 
and none of them to our liking.

<p>

We have 150 education programs; 16,200 employees 
here in Washington, D.C.; a budget of more than $3 billion, 
bigger than five other departments, and for that we get 
nothing.  We get nothing.  And what I am arguing is that 
education might be a fundamental interest to us, but if you 
don't explain why what you are doing will help people do 
better, it is insignificant if it is less expensive, and 
that that is a problem with the education debate today.

<p>

In the same token, I am unimpressed with Bill 
Clinton's, "How about $1,500 for a trade school of any 
kind?"  Well, what if I didn't want to do that?  What if I 
had different goals for my money?  Why should Bill Clinton 
dictate for me where I spend my education goals, because 
then the government still is making choices for me.

<p>

The way that we have to talk about education 
today, though, has to be both pragmatic and specific and 
compassionate.  We cannot merely be cutting the dollars.  We 
have to be talking about where they're going to go.

<p>

I, for one, am a gigantic advocate of school 
choice, and you are always seeing people say, "Oh, you're 
going to get people out the process.  They are not going to 
get involved."  We have had several very successful school 
choice programs in the United States that didn't violate 
anyone's wall between church and state.  The first one was 
the GI bill, which educated a generation successfully and 
gave them money to go to the school of their choice, and the 
entire nation prospered.

<p>

The second one had to do with Pell grants and 
other educational grants that went to people to go to the 
school of their choice, and again, a tremendous success from 
choice.

<p>

In the same way -- let's not argue about the 
details today, because maybe we wouldn't all agree -- but 
can we not agree that people can make better choices and 
that it is not just the money but it is the way in which it 
is spent?

<p>

So I am a little annoyed sometimes by everyone 
trying to poke my woman button by mentioning education but 
not taking the time to explain how your program works, 
number one, and whether it is even a better use of my money 
than a couple of ideas that I have, frankly.  And so we have 
to start talking about education issues in a compassionate way.

<p>

And I go to the life issue again.  The research is 
clear, and I can go through the numbers but I will skip 
that, that women are pro-life (more) than men.  Again, I 
think it is a fundamental thing, that we understand 
something about what is happening on that area.  But again, 
I am painted as a caricature of myself in the public debate, 
and I reject it.

<p>

Partial birth, yesterday, I think, a very sad vote 
in which viable, healthy children can be stabbed in the base 
of the skull in the name of choice.  Even if a person is for 
abortion, is there no line that goes too far?  Is this the 
oozy of the NRA, frankly?

<p>

But let me take a look at a different abortion 
issue from the standpoint of a woman, and that is RU-486.
Let's say that you really think there should be abortion 
somewhere along the line.  So let's just say, yeah, we want 
abortions to be safe, legal, and rare, but certainly safe.
So we see the Clinton Administration lobbying for RU-486,
which is a chemical abortifacient.

<p>

This morning on NPR I awoke to the very 
fascinating and meaningless knowledge that, in the 1960s, 
Procter and Gamble developed Olestra, which is a pretend fat 
substitute that they will now use to make potato chips, and 
the consumer groups are going to go to court to stop it 
because it might not be healthy, despite the fact that they 
have been testing it for 30 years.

<p>

And in a six-month test on RU-486 in which we 
don't understand its impact on women's long-term fertility, 
whether these drugs originally designed for cancer and for 
ulcers might build up and be a toxin in your system, whether 
there is any impact on your ability to have future children 
-- we don't know any of this, but you know, because it is 
abortion and it's a "woman's issue," we are going to force 
it through and we're going to have abortion, thank God, with 
this chemical.

<p>

I just want to encourage us in our discussion as 
women of the life issue and of the education issues to put 
our practical and our nature-oriented issues to bear and to 
ask harder questions of people.  I think these two issues 
are powerful as long as we discuss them pragmatically and 
compassionately.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to a special live edition of 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm your 
host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, we will bring you election 
analysis from a family perspective.  What does this split 
decision between the White House and Congress mean about the 
policies that will affect your family?

<p>

We've got some special guests to answer that 
question, but none more important than you, and we'll be 
taking your calls throughout the show.

<p>

With me tonight is former Presidential candidate 
Ambassador Keyes, who is founder and chairman of the board 
of the Declaration Foundation.  He is a syndicated columnist 
and host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, 
<i>America's Wakeup Call</i>.

<p>

Also with us is Marjorie Dannenfelser, the 
president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which is a 
nonpartisan, pro-life political action committee founded to 
help elect pro-life women to public office.

<p>

And another member of the Dannenfelser family 
joins us, her husband Marty, who leads the Family Research 
Council's Government Relations Department.  He heads the 
pro-life fight on Capitol Hill.

<p>

Welcome, each of you, to the show.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I appreciate your joining with us, 
and we will look forward to hearing what our viewers have to 
say to you.

<p>

Ambassador, let's start with you.  As you evaluate 
what just happened in the election -- Bill Clinton has 
returned, the Republicans have the House and Senate -- what 
do you think the take-home message is of the 1996 election?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is pretty clear.
Bob Dole attempted to run a campaign that was strictly based 
on economic issues against a President whose great 
vulnerabilities were on the moral front. It was an insane 
strategy.  I said so for months.

<p>

In the last three weeks, four weeks, he tried to 
shift and talk more about what they called the character 
issues, but it was out of context.  He hadn't addressed the 
moral crisis that this country faces, and so, stupidly, 
pollsters were able to ask people, "Which do you think is 
more important, the issues or character?" when in point of 
fact character is an element of all the important issues, 
and that distinction showed that the homework hadn't been 
done.

<p>

The relationship between America's crisis in the 
family, in the schools, on the streets, the crisis of crime, 
even in the area of health care, you can see the impact of 
behavior that is resulting from the moral breakdown in the 
society.  Every one of these issues is in fact a reflection 
of the moral crisis, and to make a separation between the 
issue of character, the moral issues, and the tremendous 
issues that we face as a people, particularly as they affect 
our family and our kids, this is insane.  But I think it 
reflected the deficiency of the Dole camp.

<p>

On the House side, I think what we saw, however, 
was a confirmation of what began in 1994.  Essentially, the 
conservatism of America was confirmed in this election by a 
President who felt he had to run as a conservative, even if 
it meant lying all the time, and by a Congress that, in the 
end, is in the hands of an even more strongly conservative 
and strongly morally conservative Republican coalition than 
was the case before the election.

<p>

So I think, all told, the outcome of the election 
is a strong message that we had better start taking the 
moral issues seriously.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And everybody was a pro-family 
conservative.  I woke up to NPR one morning, National Public 
Radio, to hear Bill Clinton explain how the liberal, Paul 
Wellstone, is really a conservative.  I thought, boy, 
conservative values really must be playing if Paul thinks he 
has to be one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Marty, when you look at the Congress, do we have a 
more conservative Congress?  It would appear from the 
campaigns, anyway, that everyone is a conservative today.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, on paper, I would say 
certainly the Senate is more pro-family conservative.  You 
might look at who won and who lost in the House and see a 
narrow diminution of the strength in the House.  But you had 
a gap between the House and Senate last time, whereas the 
House was the real stronger body taking the lead on those 
issues, and some of them would get tied up in the Senate.

<p>

So I think the House is probably still 
sufficiently strong to push forward on many of these issues 
and now, hopefully, with some of the House members going 
over to the Senate, like Tim Hutchinson and Sam Brownback 
and so on, to add to that strength, they will be able to 
carry through and send more issues down to Mr. Clinton, who 
will have an opportunity to then show us what a pro-family 
conservative he is by signing some of these bills that we 
heard about on the Christian radio ads, and so on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tim Hutchinson has got to be a great 
story. I mean, here you've got Bill Clinton from Arkansas, 
and then you have, in his own Senate seat, he cannot put a 
Democrat in there.  We get not just a Republican but a 
conservative Republican.  We don't have a William Weld kind 
of Republican in that chair.  What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you've had people like 
that getting elected ever since -- in Arkansas -- ever since 
Bill Clinton got elected President.  Mike Huckabee got 
elected lieutenant governor immediately after Bill Clinton, 
and now he is the governor.  He succeeded in the wake of a 
scandal involving the governor.  He was prepared to run for 
that Senate seat himself, but when the incumbent governor 
dropped out, he had to go fill it, and Tim Hutchinson was 
able to step into that void and fill that seat, and the 
trend in Arkansas is very much towards pro-family 
conservatives.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Marjorie, you track the 
pro-life issue, and speaking for myself, personally, I had 
to be disappointed that the pro-life issues, they certainly 
motivate a lot of people at the grass roots, but at the 
Presidential level, there was almost a vacuum.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see on the pro-life 
front in this election?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: On the Presidential level, you 
mean, or on the congressional level?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On any of the levels.  Where is the 
good news for us?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, in several of our 
congressional races, abortion was a very high-profile issue, 
and the Susan B. Anthony List only picks candidates that are 
going to be very aggressive on the issue.  So where there 
are opportunities, our candidates were very forthright.  And 
certainly in some districts it is going to play better; in 
some districts it is just going to play not as well.

<p>

One of our best pieces of news is that Jo Ann 
Emerson, who ran for her husband's open seat in Missouri, 
beat the Emily's List candidate, whose name is Emily 
Firebaugh -- how about that?  And I understand she was.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We really found that when our candidates used 
especially the partial-birth abortion ban issue, which no 
human being alive can be for partial-birth abortions, for 
the first time they had the courage to talk about it, a lot 
of candidates had the courage to talk about it because they 
knew that everyone was behind them, and their opponents were 
in retreat on that issue, because we focused on challenges. 
We were challenging incumbents, and all of them had voted 
against the ban.  So it worked well in those elections.

<p>

The problem was that there was a very concerted 
national effort to oust all those great Republican pro-life 
women who ran and won with our help, and they were 
successful in many cases.  So we had sort of a wash.  Picked 
up two, lost two.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was watching CNN today and was 
very interested to hear that the pro-life issue is not 
influential anymore.  Do we agree with that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there is going to be a 
lot of brainwashing garbage going on in the media right now 
in order to camouflage the truth of this election.  But I 
think that the aim of many things that happened this time 
around on the part of an establishment that included a lot 
of Republicans, meaning no offense, was to try to drive the 
moral issues, not just the pro-life issue but the moral 
issues, out of American politics.  They did not succeed.

<p>

I think there was a concerted effort to do that 
during the Republican primary season.  That failed.  I think 
that it was clear at the convention that an effort was made 
from the podium to lie about the real nature of the 
Republican Party and its issues, and that effort from the 
podium succeeded, with the result that Bob Dole never 
consolidated his base and ran one of the poorest campaigns 
we have ever seen in terms of an ability to consolidate 
support within the Republican ranks.

<p>

So I think that there was thinking that said we 
are going to use this election to get rid of the influence 
of these moral conservatives, and it simply did not work.  
And indeed, I think the election results, particularly with 
the defeat of prominent pro-abortion liberals, as I call 
them, the Colin Powell liberals, like William Weld, like 
Zimmer, I think it really put a wrench in the works of those 
people who had written their stories already about how this 
election proved that the moral issues were no good, the pro-
life issue was no good, Republicans were going to have to 
broaden their base by picking the likes of Susan Molinari 
and Christine Todd Whitman.  All of that is laughable in the 
face of the results of yesterday's election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Northeast was great.  I mean, 
there is Bob Smith, who struggles to a victory, and then 
you've got the Zimmers and the Welds who don't.  I mean, 
Zimmer took Christine's formula.  Marty, what did you think 
about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it was interesting the 
way the networks were so quick to pronounce Bob Smith dead 
last night.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They all projected that he was 
defeated early on in the evening -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They had to resuscitate him.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and he cast himself as Mark 
Twain today, that reports of my death have been greatly 
exaggerated.  But they all made these projections, and here 
was Bob Smith, who had been the champion of the partial-
birth abortion (ban), who had taken heat for talking about 
this on the floor of the Senate, which was not proper.  You 
know, that was not the type of thing you should do on the 
floor of the Senate, after all.  And yet they didn't, in the 
end, really get him.

<p>

And they called another state, the whole state of 
North Carolina, going the other way early in the evening, as 
well, and that came out five points in the opposite 
direction.  So it was very interesting.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I don't know if Bob Smith saw 
it, but I thought that there was a real Providential irony 
in the fact that Bob Dole wanted to be the one who could 
hold a newspaper that had printed a false headline, and to 
do that, he abandoned essentially the prominent position of 
the moral issues.  Bob Smith stuck with those issues, and he 
could have held a copy of the Washington Post that said, 
"Smith Loses."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, he could have.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I mean, God gave him that 
victory because he had stood firm on the right issue.  I 
deeply believe this is true.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to talk more 
about this in a second.  When we return, we will open the 
phone lines so you can join the discussion with tonight's 
very special guests.  You can reach us by the phone, 1-800-
5000-NET, or by fax at 202-544-2405.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
to talk about the election results.  I am joined by 
Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marty Dannenfelser, who heads the 
Family Research Council government relations operation; and 
Marjorie Dannenfelser, who is head of the pro-life PAC, the 
Susan B. Anthony List.  You can call us at 1-800-5000-NET or 
reach us by fax at 202-544-2405. Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Marjorie, I was intrigued by a comment you made at 
the break about what we should have learned about how to 
choose our issues.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. I was just following up 
on what Alan was talking about earlier about how candidates 
choose what they talk about in campaigns, and when they 
decide to open the newspaper and look at whatever poll data 
might happen to be out that day and choose that to talk 
about, they are destined to lose, because it never gets 
below the epidermis and you never reach the heart.

<p>

That is what happened to Bob Dole, and it happens 
to candidates around the country, too.  It is not just on 
the Presidential level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is true.

<p>

We have our first caller on the line.  We have 
Carmen from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Carmen, do you have a 
question for our panel of guests?

<p>

FLAGSTAFF (AZ) CALLER: I have two comments.
Yesterday when I was going to vote, and I asked a lot of 
people that said, "We're not going to vote" -- people in the 
office, people everywhere -- "We're not going to vote.  You 
can buy the electoral votes, so my vote doesn't count."  
They said, "The unions already bought those votes, no matter 
how people vote, so it doesn't really matter." They 
wouldn't even think about going to vote.

<p>

The other comment is that -- I said it in 1992.  
King Solomon said it in the book of Proverbs.  "When the 
wicked are in authority, transgression increases."  So don't 
be too surprised if our moral values go all the way down, we 
see more terrorist attacks, more of everything.  That is 
what has been happening in the last four years.

<p>

But my biggest concern is the electoral vote, what 
people said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's a really good point, Carmen. 
You know, Marty, we were looking at that this morning a 
little bit, about the fact that even though the unions put 
all that money in, and a lot of people had the same idea 
that Carmen did, that a lot of the freshmen survived despite 
$35 million or $40 million worth of onslaught.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They did. They went out there 
and in some cases created a backlash.  They were pointing 
out that this was a lot of money coming in just to distort 
what they had really done. These were outside groups that 
really had no interest in informing their own constituents 
but rather to create this distorted image to the more 
general public, and it did create some backlash in certain 
areas.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there was a concerted 
effort, too, that dovetailed with what the newspapers and 
the television people were doing.  I can't help but think it 
was no accident that you had these wildly exaggerated poll 
numbers, as it turned out, and that in fact the most 
accurate pollster turns out to have been Zogby, who all 
along showed a much tighter race, going at one point to less 
than four percentage points.  And if that had been the kind 
of polling that had been characteristic, then all along it 
would have been portrayed as a tight race with Bob Dole 
fluctuating, and I think we would have seen a very different 
mentality among voters in terms of participation, interest, 
because they would not have had the sense that it was a 
forgone conclusion.

<p>

So the union money plus the media presumption 
about the outcome, I think, helped to induce apathy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it did, too.

<p>

Let's take another quick caller.  We have on the 
line Chuck from Ohio.  Chuck, what do you have to say?

<p>

XENIA (OH) CALLER: Good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi!

<p>

XENIA CALLER: Thanks for taking my call.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for calling.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: I am a conservative Christian. I 
am also a retired UAW member, so I was involved in unions, 
too, and I am just so glad that I am not working now or I 
would really be raising Cain, because I am one of the 40 
percent that voted Republican.

<p>

I saw Mr. Keyes on <i>Cornerstone Live</i> back in March.
Do you remember that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: You were on there with Elizabeth 
Dole, and it was right after your little escapade in 
Atlanta.

<p>

Well, I voted for Buchanan in the primary, but I 
wanted to make two points.  I was just wondering why 
Elizabeth Dole didn't have a little more influence with her 
husband in this partial-birth ban.  Now, I was wondering 
when it was ever going to come up.  It finally came up.  I 
followed him all over the country on satellite, on KU band, 
and he addressed it to just a couple thousand here and a 
couple thousand there.  He never really nationally exploited 
it.

<p>

The other point I would like to make is, right 
after the election last night, on CBS, Dan Rather thinks the 
Republican Party must pull together and move to the center 
and away from the religious right.  I can't see where he is 
coming from.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What is so ironic about that -- I 
want to hear what you have to say about that, Ambassador -- 
but the voting numbers were clear.  I know we have all heard 
them, that the best bloc of the GOP was the people of faith.
I mean, how could Dan Rather say that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: This is why Rather wants us to 
move to the center, so we'll lose all the time.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I was sitting next to, what is his name, Bob 
Fromme(?), I think, who was Torricelli's campaign 
consultant, and he was also responsible for that despicable 
commercial that featured David Duke against the civil rights 
initiative in California.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And his advice to the 
Republican Party is that you had better go with the Whitmans 
and you better leave -- and I hope you'll follow Keyes' 
advice and do all of this moral stuff because then you'll 
lose.  No, it's not true.  They want us to abandon the moral 
issues because then we'll lose consistently, as Dole just 
did, and I think that is what Dan Rather and his cronies are 
up to. They would love to see Republicans behave every time 
the way Dole and Kemp behaved this time because we'll get 
creamed as they got creamed, in the debates and before the 
electorate. That is their wish, that we should do the wrong 
thing. I think if we ignore them and instead build on the 
base of strong moral conservatism, there is a majority 
there, including especially those people, some of whom sat 
out the election this time because they weren't very 
enthused --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, definitely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: -- some of whom we still 
haven't awakened yet to move out of the pews and into the 
voting booth.  But we're going to.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I find it interesting, every 
four years or sometimes even on the two-year cycles, the Dan 
Rathers and people like that have the same conclusions.  
They wring their hands about negative campaigns.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They profess that the 
candidates are not talking about the issues.  But as you 
study the news, you find out that the sound bites of the 
candidates talking about the issues get shorter and shorter. 
I think they averaged about six or seven seconds in this 
most recent campaign cycle.  And then it is the same advice. 
It was the religious right again.  No matter how strong of a 
margin they got with them, they are the ones who were 
causing them this problem.  It is always the same 
conclusion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that Bob Dole and 
Bill Clinton ran the campaign that the media would like -- 
no issues, lots of fluff, absolutely nothing of substance --
and we had the lowest voter turnout since, what, the 1920s?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. About a million dollars 
of consultant fees will pay for that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Their idea of negative is very 
strange, too.  I mean, if you said anything at all, however 
true, about Clinton or about Democrats that brought out a 
lot of the negatives, which are there in the record, then 
that was negative campaigning.  But if you had a filthy 
piece like the Schrum(?) commercial, which basically used 
David Duke in order to do what, produce a 60-second slur 
that called everybody who supported the CCRI a racist, that 
is name calling, but they didn't consider that negative 
campaigning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they paid him to do that, too.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: That is right.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think it is important for 
people to realize how much is working against elected 
officials to do the wrong thing, you know, to make bad 
decisions, even when they are really well grounded in their 
faith when they arrive, they are still going back to their 
districts all the time, everything in Washington trends 
towards making the wrong decisions. The consultants, who 
just basically they worked on a congressional staff once and 
now they have the great position of telling other people 
what to do, I mean, they are not necessarily qualified to 
tell candidates how to run a good campaign. The 
consultants, the atmosphere of Capitol Hill.

<p>

Without the real active involvement of people out 
in the country, that will prevail, without, first of all, 
the faith and then the really active involvement of people 
out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It involves people.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
bring you more about the battle to protect pro-family 
issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
with Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marjorie Dannenfelser, president 
of the Susan B. Anthony List; and political expert Marty 
Dannenfelser of Family Research Council.  And we would also 
like to hear from you, so you can please call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Ambassador, we were just talking about the fact 
that it is not so often that our issues are not advanced; 
they are not even -- you know, no one takes the time.  No 
one wants to do the fight, giving up before we even get 
started.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think you see a lot of 
that.  In fact, it is induced in a way by the media, and 
then it affects the minds of folks.  I thought it was a real 
disease on the Dole campaign, where they seemed very anxious 
to give up, I mean Scott Reed giving an interview to The New 
Yorker a week and a half before the campaign ended, that 
came out the day before the election, saying that, "I told 
Bob Dole every day, I put the poll numbers in front of him 
and said, 'You know, Bob, we might not win this one.'"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I am thinking, what a thing 
for a campaign manager to be doing.  And the very night of 
the election, Nelson Warfield, two hours before the 
California polls closed, issued a statement praising Bob 
Dole for his courage in defeat.  And I am thinking, this is 
crazy, what is he up to?

<p>

But there was this mentality of preemptive 
surrender, and I am glad, actually, that at a personal level 
-- his staff apparently was very defeatist, but Dole went on 
fighting right to the end, and I think his willingness to 
put up a strong fight, not to back off and kind of collapse 
the way, unhappily, Bush did in 1992 was very important in 
helping Republicans to keep the Congress, because it buoyed 
up the party around the country psychologically; it helped a 
lot in California to keep things from getting out of hand 
there; and I think it helped to maintain the sort of 
firewall that prevented Clinton's victory from expanding 
into control of the Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It could have saved the House and Senate.

<p>

We have a caller on the line from historic Valley 
Forge, Pennsylvania.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE (PA) CALLER: Oh, hi.  How are you?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi. Thanks for joining us.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE CALLER: When they wanted the Jews to 
repent, they showed the bodies, shriveled, and when they 
wanted people to send to Ethiopia, they showed the bloated 
bodies.  Why aren't Christians putting up billboards with a 
manger scene, with an empty manger, with the words, "I'm 
sorry, Joseph, we couldn't afford him"?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good point.

<p>

Marjorie, you work on this pro-life issue.  What 
kinds of messages do you find really motivate people when 
you are working on them?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was very touching, 
and that was a beautiful way to put it.

<p>

I find, and we have a unique stance at the Susan 
B. Anthony List among PACs.  We really require of our 
candidates that they do two things, that they project the 
justice of changing laws to protect the unborn, and they 
project the mercy and the compassion that we have to reach 
women where they are.

<p>

I mean, the reality of this issue is that women 
have abortions, and when we have women in public office who 
are talking to women on their own terms and saying that they 
have a sense for where they are -- I mean, I think it is 
very important.  It is very important to have that 
connection, and I think it is important to have women 
discussing it in those terms.

<p>

I think what resonates the most, frankly, just on 
a debate level -- I think that ad is a great idea that the 
caller called in with -- but is, what is it?  You know, 
whenever I am debating the issue, what is an abortion?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are you choosing?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: What is it? I mean, what is 
that "thing"?   You have to address that before you can move 
on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take one more quick caller.
We have on the line Kay from Wyoming.  Kay, do you have a 
question or a comment for our distinguished panel?

<p>

RIVERTON (WY) CALLER: I do. I have a couple 
things.  First of all, on the issues, our issues do not lend 
themselves easily to sound-bite campaigning, and until we 
break through that format that we are permitted, we are 
going to have problems getting our point across.

<p>

Dr. Keyes was pointing out about the polls, and 
you have to remember, the American press uses polls as a 
weapon, not a tool.  They try to use polls to change 
people's opinion or to frame it.  They don't use it for a 
measuring device.

<p>

My question, also, is -- the big question is, did 
the RNC learn anything this time around, and what are they 
going to foist upon us in 2000?  Are we going to have 
another left-leaning candidate and more empty issues?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, hours of conversations have 
gone into that.  I would have to say one thing, though.  I 
think that is the strength of NET as a network, to have an 
expanded conversation, and radio shows like yours.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes. Well, I think with 
respect to the RNC, we are just at the beginning of what is 
going to be, I believe, a very intense battle within the 
Republican Party between the grass roots, which I believe is 
overwhelmingly Reagan conservative -- pro-life, morally 
conservative, fiscally conservative, interested in 
reclaiming power from the central government and rebuilding 
the institutions of local self-government and civil society. 
I think that is the essence of the true conservatism at the 
grass roots in the Republican Party.  That is going to be 
pitted against the party elitists, the people who controlled 
the podium at the convention this time around, the people 
who had planned consistently a strategy aimed at dumping the 
moral issues, at emphasizing money above everything, and at 
trying to promote Colin Powell, Christine Whitman, others 
who basically represent the abandonment of the Republican 
Party's moral heart. We are at the beginning of that 
struggle.

<p>

I think that for the caller and for others around 
the country, what they have to realize, I think, is that in 
the next several years, we are going to have to commit 
ourselves at the grass roots to lighting fires that can be 
seen from every horizon so that nobody in the Republican 
Party structure or leadership can mistake the true sentiment 
that exists in the party at the grass roots, because it is 
going to require a lot of action; it is going to require a 
lot of persistence and perseverance on the part of people 
who are moral conservatives to keep the Republican Party 
where it belongs and to do what is necessary.  By the year 
2000, we must transform the leadership of the party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: On that point, I think the 
caller identifies a problem for pro-family conservatives 
that people in the major news media, the three or four major 
television networks, the newspapers on the Eastern -- you 
know, we know the newspapers, <i>New York Times</i> and others -- 
do not agree with us on these cultural issues.

<p>

But a candidate, particularly a candidate for 
President of the United States, has a unique opportunity to 
speak directly to the people.  Alan Keyes has done that, 
Ronald Reagan did that. Ronald Reagan faced a very hostile 
press.  We do hear some revisionist history from the press 
now about how nice they were to Ronald Reagan.  But those of 
us who remember the Reagan Presidency know otherwise.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Bob Dole and Jack Kemp had that 
opportunity in this campaign, and they had a moderator in 
those debates who was really a very fair-minded journalist 
who gave them some open-ended questions like, "Tell us about 
Clinton's character," or, "Tell us about the moral crisis in 
the country today," between the questioners from the 
audience in the second Presidential (debate), and they had a 
minute and a half or so to articulate these positions, and I 
don't think they did it.  They came around in circles back 
just repeating economic theory and things like that, and it 
was just absurd.

<p>

The other thing is, federal candidates can 
completely control the content of their advertising.  They 
are getting $60 million in federal funds to run a campaign. 
They can choose to do a 30-second spot, they can choose to 
do a one-minute spot, they can choose to do a five-minute, 
or Ross Perot did some half-hour spots, and they can speak 
as short or as long, within certain limits, as they want to, 
and as long as their resources will hold out, they need to 
identify the message and articulate it to the people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to demand that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And Bob Dole obviously didn't 
do that, and he paid the price for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

We're going to have to talk more about this in a 
second.  Following this commercial break, we will continue 
our discussion about yesterday's election results and how 
they affect you.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to discuss 
how yesterday's elections affect pro-family issues is 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, a steadfast leader in the pro-family 
movement, both inside and outside the beltway.  Also with us 
are Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser.  Marjorie is the 
president of the pro-life PAC, the Susan B. Anthony List.
Marty heads Family Research Council's government relations 
efforts.  We are taking your calls at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Coming back, Marty, a lot of us have been talking 
about who is going to be RNC chair.  Haley Barbour says he 
is stepping down.  Is this the kind of power struggle that 
pro-family people need to watch?  Where is the leadership 
going to come from?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there are many different 
factions of people around the country, and people have 
formed their own coalitions.  They will look at who the 
members of the Executive Committee of the Republican 
National Committee are in the 50 states around the country 
and try to formulate a strategy for reaching them.

<p>

I think that is something; if people can have an 
influence on that process, it is probably worth doing.  But 
I don't think we should allow ourselves to become fixated on 
that, because the ultimate way that you nominate a candidate 
is at the grass-roots level, is to send delegates to the 
national convention, and it is the delegates who ultimately 
nominate the candidate -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People who manage leadership.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and then the candidate who 
sets the tone for the party and for the convention and for 
the campaign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Bush tone kind of was in our mouth this time.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I do think it is important, 
though, right now to try to work towards someone who is not 
going to be pushing what was, as I said, a conscious 
strategy of jettisoning the moral issues, which Haley 
Barbour was very open about.  I mean, he went around the 
country telling everybody who would listen for a while there 
that we had to get that pro-life plank out of the platform, 
we had to put these issues aside, and they were divisive, 
and all of this.

<p>

We don't need that.  What we need is someone who 
is going to articulate in a persuasive way the reasons for 
the positions that the Republican Party takes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: TO explain what we believe.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Exactly, and to do it in a way 
that will make sense to people and make them realize that 
the things we talk about are the issues.  They are not 
separate from the issues, as the media tries to imply.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take a quick caller.  We have 
John on the line from the great state of Texas.  John, hi.
Do you have a comment or a question?

<p>

MIDLAND (TX) CALLER: Good evening. How are you 
doing?  I've got a quick comment, and then I've got a 
question for Alan.  I've heard all day long on the radio 
that women voted for Clinton because of abortion rights.  If 
that's true, I really feel sorry for a lot of these women.
I have Catholic friends -- I am Catholic and I even have 
Catholic friends that I know voted for Clinton, and I really 
feel sorry for them.

<p>

Alan, I was also at <i>Cornerstone</i>. I voted for you 
in the primary, and I saw you on TV last night, and you said 
something about you weren't a good speaker and you cheated.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Me?

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Keep on cheating, brother. We love it. We love you.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, I was joking.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Where does your show originate from?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: The show originates from 
Rosslyn, Virginia.  We are on 35 stations now around the 
country and building.  So, hopefully, we will reach into 
your area sometime soon.  I hope so.

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Thanks a million for your show.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Can I comment for a minute, 
though, on this gender gap thing?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, the gender gap.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Before we even start to take it 
seriously.  I think it's a phony issue.  I do not believe 
there is a gender gap.  I think the gender gap is in fact a 
false symptom of something else.  And the simple fact of the 
matter, which nobody wants to really dwell on but which is 
the truth, is this:  Take Hispanic and black women out of 
the mix, and the gender gap evaporates.  It is not there.

<p>

And what does that mean?  It means you don't have 
a gender gap.  The gender gap is actually a symptom of the 
fact that we have large minority groups, Hispanics and 
blacks, who are captives of the Democratic Party; that 
amongst the white electorate, Republicans and Democrats 
compete pretty evenly still in terms of their ability to win 
the allegiance of voters; but that when you continue to get 
these lopsided majorities amongst Hispanics and blacks for 
Democrats, that produces a distorted outcome.

<p>

I think that is a very telling fact.  I am going 
to refuse to talk about this gender gap thing anymore 
because I think it is all a lie.  If one alteration makes 
the gap go away, that means that the true cause of the gap 
is not gender, it is something else, and this something else 
in this particular case is in fact racial politics, the 
politics of terrorizing minorities, which I think has been 
once again practiced in this election year by the Democrats.

<p>

But I also think it is going to change, because 
the Democrats have lost their base in the Congress which 
they used to buy off the leadership in the minority 
communities, and I think, over time, without the gravy 
train, they are going to have a very hard time continuing to 
dangle things they can't deliver in front of a coopted 
leadership, and people in the community are going to say, 
"Well, wait a minute.  We'd better start making our peace 
with these Republicans because, otherwise, we won't be part 
of the political process anymore."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is a fascinating analysis, 
because in <i>USA Today</i> and a Wirthlin poll I saw today all 
agree with that statement that you just made, that when you 
take minority women out, all the other things kind of break 
out evenly.

<p>

And in fact, Marty, is it not accurate that we 
have seen women more pro-life than men, generally, that 
women are more motivated for their concern for life?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There are. There are more 
women who seem to vote on that issue, but on balance, more 
of those women vote on the pro-life side than on the other 
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I don't know.  I think it is 
tremendously insulting to women to say that if you are of a 
certain gender, you are automatically going to vote -- you 
are going to have this opinion on this, this opinion.  We 
are thinking individuals that differ on all sorts of things, 
and it is more -- my vote has more to do with my core 
beliefs, what I believe in; also, my situation.  We have a 
family.  You know, things like that, not because I am a 
woman, because I am a human being.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think you are right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: You know, the thing that I 
found striking, two things were true.  One, the lie about 
the gender gap very much influenced the thinking of the 
strategists in the Dole campaign to such an extent that they 
made foolish errors. The Susan Molinari pick was the 
stupidest thing they could have done for keynote speaker, 
except maybe for Colin Powell.  But why?  Because they 
wanted to reach out to Catholics. And what did they do? 
They put a pro-abortion Catholic on the podium who 
absolutely insulted the convictions and work of the 
Catholics who would lean toward Republicans because of their 
pro-life sentiment.  It was insane.

<p>

So Bob Dole ended up getting all the votes of pro-abortion Catholic 
women, right?  That's why he won the election.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: That's right, absolutely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: He couldn't get those votes, 
but the votes he could have gotten, the strongly committed 
pro-life Catholics, were instead insulted by this notion 
that a pro-abortion speaker speaks for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: See, that is what is funny about 
that.  There was no big tent until Ronald Reagan pulled in 
pro-life Catholics and working-class Americans who felt that 
the Democratic Party was becoming liberal and insulting to 
their values.

<p>

The big tent -- I mean, you hear the Haley 
Barbours and Romsfields(?) of the world talking about it.
You would think they created it rather than they just 
benefitted from coming under the flaps.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, they didn't even 
understand it.  They are still talking as if the big tent 
has something to do with money.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And it does not. The big tent 
had to do with the fact that the moral culture of the 
Democratic Party was hijacked by radical left-wingers who 
moved away from the traditional values of the American 
people and lost a lot of people amongst the union workers, 
amongst the ethnic groups, amongst the Catholics, who simply 
were not going to abandon their faith and their principles.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We will come back in a second.  When 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take more calls and continue 
our discussion with tonight's special guests.  Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to tonight's live 
edition of <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
I am honored to be joined by Ambassador Alan Keyes and 
Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser, both long-term political experts.

<p>

We would also like to hear from you.  You can 
reach us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

We have a caller on the line, Robert from 
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Robert, hi.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE (NM) CALLER: Well, good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good evening.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: This is the first time I have 
watched your show.  I have watched NET for a while.  But I 
like it so far.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, good. Thanks.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: I have two questions.  One 
you have actually partially answered.  Maybe Alan could add 
more to it.  That is, why did the Catholic vote go the way 
it did?  Two, what do you think is going to happen to the 
Republican hierarchy after actually -- I mean, it is pretty 
much common knowledge that they picked Bob Dole, they gave 
it to him, they got him through the primaries, and he lost 
the White House.

<p>

And then I have a comment, if I may.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why don't you give us your comment 
really fast and then let's get to Alan's answers.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: Oh, okay.  Over the years I 
have dealt and struggled with abortion.  When it first came 
about, I went, "Yippee."  Then as I grew older and wiser, I 
realized that something was wrong here.

<p>

But the argument for abortion has always been, 
you're killing a baby, and that's true.  But I have taken on 
another tactic.  I have looked at these people who are pro-abortion, 
and I said, what gender actually benefits from 
abortion?  And the answer is men.  Men only benefit from it.

<p>

I am beginning to hear a little more about this, 
or talk this way in the media, not very much.  Do you think 
that -- or maybe my suggestion would be that you people 
would take the same course and that abortion does not 
benefit women.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting.  Polling data 
indicates that single men are the biggest proponents of 
abortion, which I think there is a little self-interest 
there.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, definitely.  I think they 
are very anxious to escape their responsibility toward their 
children, and so they are willing to kill the child and 
burden the woman with this awful psychological burden for 
the rest of her life that is involved in this, and we are 
not protecting.

<p>

In terms of the Catholic vote, one, I think we 
always have to remember that we are dealing with a situation 
where Catholics were overwhelmingly voting for Democrats 
until Ronald Reagan came along, and even Reagan's success 
meant that we moved from, what, 20 percent of the Catholic 
vote or less up to around 40, and even during Reagan, this 
is what we reached.  So we are not talking yet, at least, 
about getting the majority of the Catholic vote.

<p>

But I think, as I said, one mistake that was made 
in this election was that Bob Dole thought he was going to 
reach out to Catholics.  They said, "Oh, you've got to reach 
out to the Catholic vote."  And, of course, there was a 
great opportunity.  The Catholic hierarchy, for the first 
time that I can remember, actually came forward in an 
election year against a sitting Democratic President, and 
they were more Catholic than Democrat.  And for those of us 
who are Catholics, this was breathtaking, and I was so 
pleased to see it happen.

<p>

Now, what did that mean?  It meant a great 
opportunity, but to do what?  To reach out to pro-life 
Catholics and pull them in more strongly into the Republican 
cause.  And so what does Bob Dole do?  He chooses Susan 
Molinari, a pro-abortion, outspoken, rabidly pro-abortion 
Catholic, to give the keynote speech, and he thought this 
was going to help him with Catholics.  He's insane.

<p>

What it did, I think, was to take a lot of people, 
and I know, because as I went around the country speaking, I 
have found it infuriated a lot of people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, it did.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: They just felt deeply insulted 
that he simply didn't understand what was going on, who they 
were, and as a result, I think he actually may have hurt 
himself at that point and not really recovered in terms of 
the perceptions of a lot of the pro-life Catholics and I 
think, also, pro-life Christians who were not Catholic, who 
just felt like, what is this man trying to tell us?  Doesn't 
he understand who his people are?  And the answer, I think, 
was, unhappily, no, he did not, or at least his advisers 
didn't.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think that Bob Dole is 
fundamentally an honest and decent person, but his whole 
aura throughout this campaign seemed very calculating.  The 
debate over abortion in the Republican platform was very 
much, now we're going to have it this way, I'm going to do 
it this way, and we have to reach out to the moderate women 
and we can't offend them, so we're going to have this 
tolerance language in there.

<p>

And then he never talked about CCRI for a while 
until, all of a sudden, the last few weeks of the campaign, 
he acknowledged, yeah, we're going to talk about that 
because that's a wedge issue.  And then he didn't answer the 
question when Jim Lehrer asked him about Bill Clinton's 
character during the debate in front of 40 or 50 million 
people, and then he decided to go out on the campaign trail 
and conduct a discussion with the people in his audiences, 
"Should I get tough in the next debate?" and so on.

<p>

Just everything looked so calculating that people 
had to start wondering, well, what does this guy really 
believe in?  I think that is what came across, that every 
position he seemed to be taking was based on some political 
calculation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than on what he believed.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And it may very well be that 
Bill Clinton made his share of calculations, but at least 
when he was out on the stump, he was talking about how 
issues connect with people's personal lives.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Ironic as it may seem, I think 
some people -- and I am not saying they were right in this 
-- but they seem to prefer a sincere liar to an insincere 
honest man.  And I have to tell you that it's a dilemma, 
isn't it?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But don't you think that argues for 
something that I think we would be in agreement about, that 
people should stand up for something?  I think we would call 
them to stand for pro-life, pro-family values, but the 
politicals and the Dan Rathers and the Peter Jenningses say, 
"Don't stand for that much because that really offends 
people," when clearly, it draws them.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think the chief problem 
among candidates is just wanting to be liked.  It is a very 
basic human need.  But if you are not driven by your core 
beliefs, that just takes over.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I also think the media is very 
manipulative, because we were talking earlier about negative 
advertising.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And the truth of the matter is, 
when you actually look at election results, challengers and 
others who are faced with tough fights, they only win when 
they are able to show people that an incumbent is not voting 
their views and values.

<p>

Now, the media calls that negative.  It is 
actually just truth-telling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right. It's a report card.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: If somebody has gone to 
Congress and voted in a way that betrays the values of their 
constituents -- you have liberals like a Barbara Mikulski 
pretending when they go to the Eastern Shore of Maryland 
that they are conservatives and respect family and all of 
this, meanwhile voting for everything that people there 
hate.  Well, if you want to beat somebody like that, you've 
got to tell people what she is about and what she stands 
for.  And they want to stigmatize that as negative 
advertising, and the only time -- the only time -- when that 
sort of thing is really, really bad, in their eyes, and you 
absolutely must not do it is when you are telling the truth 
about Democrats.

<p>

Now, of course, if you do the same thing and fill 
your commercials with lies, which is what the AFL-CIO did, 
they told untruths about the Republican Congress, but that 
was not characterized as negative advertising.  It's 
amazing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't that funny?  Demagoguery was okay.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As long it was on Medicare.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were fortunate the 
Democratic members of Congress, and to a certain extent Bill 
Clinton, that they had surrogates, in a sense, doing their 
dirty work for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Weren't they, though?  They had the union money.

<p>

I would love to talk a little bit more.  I would 
like to thank all my guests, and we are going to have to 
have you back.

<p>

More about how you can receive information 
regarding issues affecting you and your family when <i>Straight
Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you 
would like to receive more information about Family Research 
Council, our guests this evening, or the topics we

<center><h2>***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>    Two topics today put together with the assistance of Tim
Lamer back in our Alexandria, Virginia office:
<ol>
<li>CNN and ABC praised the likely choice of Jack Kemp as VP
nominee by contrasting him with most conservatives who are
"mean" and "haters." 
<li>CBS reporter Linda Douglass filed a story Friday night in
which she argued that the appearance that Dole is "under the
thumb of religious conservatives," what Dan Rather referred to
as "the hard right of the Republican Party," could doom his
campaign.
</ol>
<p>
<ol>
<dd><li> On Friday's CBS This Morning, Russ Mitchell asked RNC
Chairman Haley Barbour: "Now the 1992 convention was called,
even by some Republicans, divisive and mean-spirited. How will
this convention be different?"
<p>
<dd>    Hours later on CNN's Inside Politics Bill Schneider praised Jack
Kemp by impugning conservatives: "He is a rare combination -- a
nice conservative. These days conservatives are supposed to be
mean. They're supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked a minute
ago about the frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp
is buoyant, he's effusive, he's inclusive of everybody in the
country, not just in the Republican Party. He puts a different
face on that ticket."
<p>
<dd>    Then on Friday night's World News Tonight Cokie Roberts also
insulted Republicans while calling Kemp a good choice: "He's
very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive, reaching out to
minorities, to women, being for immigration, for affirmative
action. And I think that's very important for this particular
convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen somewhat dour,
and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with a big smile
on his face saying you all come, and I'm going to cut your taxes
while I'm at it is not a bad thing for the Republicans."
<p>
<dd><li>Dan Rather introduced a Friday night Evening News piece:
"For many self-described Christian conservatives and other
members of what is generally known as the hard right of the
Republican Party, they've been pretty much having their way at
the San Diego convention, and the Jack Kemp news late today was
one more cause for celebration. But there could be pitfalls
ahead for the party, as we hear now from Linda Douglass."
<p>
<dd>    Douglass began: "It already has been a triumphant week for
religious conservatives, led by the Christian Coalition. Then
came word of another victory, the prospect of Jack Kemp as Bob
Dole's running mate."
<p>
<dd>    Following a soundbite from Ralph Reed, she continued: "The
Christian Coalition has gotten what it wanted here, even forcing
Dole to back down from his offer of tolerance to supporters of
abortion rights. Religious conservatives say they now hold the
key to a Dole victory in November....But veterans of past
Republican presidential campaigns warn Dole runs the risk of
appearing to be under the thumb of religious conservatives. Some
analysts believe Gerald Ford was hurt in 1976 by giving in to a
conservative faction. Doug Bailey, who advised Ford then, said
Dole must be careful."
<p>
<dd>    Yes, careful not to offend the media and be impugned as 
"mean-spirited haters." -- Brent Baker

<TITLE>Water Companies Column</TITLE>
<META name="description" content="Thirst for Private Water Grows">
<META name="keywords" content="FREE, Reason Foundation, Water, Companies, Privatization, Health, Progressive Era">
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>4/3/96</P><H1>Thirst for Private Water Suppliers Grows</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>Water is precious to life on earth.  Healthy organisms, ecosystems, and weather cycles depend on it.  A sufficient supply of clean water is the critical first step to improving public health in every society.   Just because everyone needs water, however, doesn't make managing it easy.  Developing countries are struggling for water.  The <A HREF="http://www.worldbank.org">World Bank</A> says $600 billion is needed in the next decade to avoid water shortages.</P>

<P>Even though Earth is mostly water, only about 1% of it is available freshwater.  And with global water consumption tripling since 1950, some claim it's only a matter of time before the strain on  the world's water supply becomes too great:  29 years according to Paul Ehrlich, Sandra Postel, and Gretchen Daily.  If you live where the Colorado River used to drain into the sea, or where the Aral Sea once existed, the time may already be now.  How we manage scarce water resources is increasingly vital, for public health as well as the health of wetlands, salmon runs, and other ecosystems.  That makes water delivery systems among the most important enterprises.</P>

<P>America's water management ideology flowed from the Progressive Era doctrine of a century ago.  Political leaders used tax-exempt government bonds to fund facilities and enabled bureaucracies to provide their burgeoning cities with water. As a result, 85% of Americans drink water from government-owned companies.  Public water companies, they thought, could easily, efficiently, and reliably supply municipal water.</P>

<P>The Progressives were wrong.  Time, and a recent study of California's water industry by the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A>, has proven them wrong.  The Reason Foundation surveyed private and public water companies in California and discovered that both offered comparable services.  To provide those same water services, however, the government-owned companies relied on tax exemptions and subsidies.</P>

<P>The private companies fended for themselves, and did so more efficiently.  Their water cost consumers only three-fourths that of public water.  Inefficiencies of government-owned water companies go beyond cost to consumers.  Their operating expenses per connection were 21% higher.  They required more than double the number of employees per connection.  Accordingly, salaries of public water companies ate up almost three times as much of the operating revenue as the private companies.  Public companies also spent nearly double their private counterparts on maintenance.</P>

<P>The good news for Californians is that even their wasteful government water companies are more efficient than some third-world water companies.  Most Latin American utilities require between ten and twenty employees per thousand connections (compared with 1.62 for private- and 3.49 for government-owned firms in Calif.).  No wonder that developing countries which are dominated by government-owned water industries &quot;require&quot; massive bailouts.  No wonder the specter of water shortages looms so closely.</P>

<P>The bad news is that 78% of Californians receive their water from wasteful public authorities.  The <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> finds that subsidizing public water passes no savings on to the consumer.  The subisidized inefficiencies effectively flush public funds that could instead be spent on more worthwhile undertakings or reduced taxes.</P>

<P>Public water companies are protected from competition.  Bloated payrolls, extravagant expenditures, and addiction to subsidized capital characterize government water works.  Government-owned agencies in California notoriously accumulated large cash and investment incomes.  The Irvine Ranch Water District, for example, invested $32.5 million in an apartment complex and another $12 million in two other real estate developments.  Allowing government agencies like water companies to speculate with public money leads to the financial nightmare that vexes Orange County today.</P>

<P>Privatization presents an attractive alternative in the U.S. and elsewhere.  England privatized its water industry in 1989.  French cities has been contracting their water systems since the 19th century.  Some international firms found great success in supplying water to developing nations badly in need of competent and competitive water systems.  In Buenos Aires, the government water authority was so inept that privatizing offered huge benefits.  Privatization has brought $4 billion in infrastructure investment, improved government pipelines that previously leaked half of their water, and resolved the chronic summer  water shortages.  This approach conserves the environment while promoting healthier and wealthier consumers in Brazil.</P>

<P>In America, municipal budgets are tightening.  Mayors increasingly seek new capital.  And proliferating environmental regulations make the water business ever more difficult for city bueaucracies.  These factors make change certain.  Privatization of much of the water industry is likely.  </P>

<P>Ironically, public water companies were intended to protect the sacred municipal water supply.  What really happens in socialized water systems, however, is something quite different.  Water and other resources are wasted and public health is at risk while political interests are protected.  Now, as Mr. Clinton claims the &quot;era of big government is over,&quot; we can find support for innovative ways to provide public goods.  It takes courage to overcome the outmoded Progressive thinking.  Fortunately, thanks to the <A HREF="http://www.reason.org">Reason Foundation</A> and others, the common sense to see the benefits of privatization is becoming more common. </P>

<h1>Cultural winds blow back to the future</h1>
<P> <HR WIDTH=50%>By Suzanne Fields<BR>
The Washington Times
<HR width = 30%>
 </CENTER>
 
<P>If Bob Dylan were to wet his finger and wave it above his head to measure which way the wind is blowing, he'd change the lyrics: &quot;The times, they are a'changin' - and changin' back.&quot;

<P>Cultural conservatives are finally feeling their influence at work in the mainstream culture. Cultural indicators for the boomers, now turning gray and 50, are changing, too.

<P>Not so long ago, a liberal was said to turn conservative when his daughter reached junior high. And why not? She enters a public junior high through a metal detector, and her boyfriend gets free condoms from the school nurse.

<P>Grade school has lesser but still troublesome risks. The younger kids might spend half the day learning their lessons in English and half of the day learning the lessons again in Spanish. The alternative, for those who can scrape up the money, is a private school at $12,000 a year, but even they have to be careful not to choose a private school where equally goofy ideas thrive.

<P>Neo-liberals often turn reactionary when their sons and daughters arrive at the elite campuses, such as Yale or Stanford, where &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; studies push out the great books. Chaucer, Milton and Shakespeare are too white, too male, and too dead. Columbus is demoted as a cultural hero because he set out for the New World without having filed an environmental-impact statement.

<P>Cultural conservatives still must climb several steep mountains, but they're on firmer footing than ever.

<P>Sponsors of several trashy daytime shows have cancelled their sponsorship, or are planning to, of the worst offenders. Crusaders William (&quot;Virtues&quot;) Bennett and Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Sam Nunn of Georgia, both Democrats, cite Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Sears and Mars as examples of sponsors taught to have a public conscience. The objects of their ire are shows &quot;that harm our country and our kids.&quot;

<P>The Lieberman/Bennett/Nunn coalition is taking out after the 16,000 buyers of local programming, who met last week in Las Vegas for the annual convention of the National Association of Television Programming Executives. They're especially targeting talk trash produced for broadcast during the after-school daytime hours.

<P>Although such cultural polluters are among the most damaging to our children, adults are getting a respite from some of the soft, gauzy &quot;gender&quot; liberalism spawned in the media. The New York Times Sunday magazine has cancelled its &quot;About Men&quot; and &quot;Hers&quot; columns which described emotions such as a mother's frustration in getting her son to play with teacups and her daughter to play with trucks (not guns, of course), or the embarrassment two lesbians felt at the raised eyebrows they provoked when they checked into a motel room for a night together.

<P>When feminists complained of a macho sensibility creeping into the &quot;About Men&quot; confessional columns, the editors moved into &quot;a tender phase,&quot; and published pieces in which men proclaimed: &quot;I do the dishes and love it.&quot; No equal time at the Times.

<P>We've come a long way from Alan Alda's oh-so-sensitive man now. (Alan who?) Even Phil Donahue, who once wore a skirt on his television talk show to show gender solidarity and introduced such sexually titillating topics as male strippers who performed live before his audience and mother-daughter strippers who didn't, is retiring from his show at the end of its 29th season in May.

<P>Even the first lady, a card-carrying liberal, looking for ways to express her tougher inner child, sounds like a cultural conservative - at least some of the time - in her book, &quot;It Takes a Village.&quot;

<P>She prescribes &quot;character education&quot; in the public schools, rejects &quot;permissiveness&quot; in raising children, rails against the lyrics of &quot;gangsta rap.&quot; She wants girls to remain chaste until 21, and celebrates the two-parent family over the &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; model.

<P>Whether the first lady is being disingenuous or hypocritical, she nevertheless senses what the maturing public wants to hear. You might say she knows which way the wind is blowing.

<title>The Algers: Back to the Future</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>The Algers: Back to the Future</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CBS show highlights successful owners of growing businesses</h3></center>
<p>
On the evening of June 16, CBS aired a program whose message was mainstream American: that talent, initiative, perseverance, and, usually, religious faith are the formula for business success. For an hour viewers saw an unusual sight: Hollywood celebrities unabashedly touting the virtues of free market successes.
A rerun from the 1950s? Hardly. It was the 48th annual Horatio Alger Awards. From the opening segment, Ray Charles's rendition of "America the Beautiful," Bob Dole and William Bennett couldn't have scripted a more tradition-friendly, role model-dominated hour.
<p>
As always, Algers were presented to persons who, like the award's namesake, have emerged from humble circumstances to make a name for themselves. Each story is magnificent non-fiction that shatters the myth that America is no longer the land of opportunity. 
<p>
This path, as viewers saw, knows neither gender nor color: among this year's honorees were a woman -- Ruth Fertel, founder of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain -- and two blacks: music entrepreneur Quincy Jones and Joe Dudley, who grew up in a three-room shack as one of eleven children and now runs the Dudley Products cosmetics company.
<p>
In videotaped biographical packages preceding their acceptance of the award, the winners discussed their success and their philosophies of life. By dint of hard work, Herbert Boeckmann wound up running the largest Ford dealership in America. This highly motivated achiever spoke movingly of how his father's charitable deeds had spurred his own efforts toward "help[ing] people help themselves."
<p> 
Qunicy Jones reflected: "I don't think God put us here to have everything go right every minute. That's why He's got those other funny words like 'discipline' and 'adversity.' That's what helps shape your character, and it sounds corny, but it's not corny, it's real."  
<p>
John Pappajohn, the president of Equity Dynamics, reminisced about growing up: "We didn't have much money, but we seemed to get along just fine." And he remarked, "I was recently asked by a young man who suffered adversity, 'What do I have to do in order to be successful?' I said, 'Have a dream, and be willing to pay the price in order to have your dream come true.'" 
<p>
Dennis Washington, who now presides over a business empire which includes construction, railroad, mining, and shipping companies, remembered, "We didn't have a lot of money...but the family was together. That means so much."
Looking back, Washington says, "The early part of your life, you may get [dealt] a bad hand, but, remember, that's a [short] period...and if you can focus on the future by finding something that you like to do, with luck and help from God, you're gonna have a good life." 
<p>
As traditional values-oriented as the Algers were, there was nothing politically partisan about them. (Even a brief appearance by Maya Angelou was non-PC.) The show was co-hosted by actress Markie Post and actor John Ritter, both of whom have been outspokenly pro-Clinton; nonetheless, they effectively articulated what the Algers represent. 
<p>
When Ritter, introducing one honoree -- Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula -- declared, "Values, beliefs, principles. You know, some call those old-fashioned, but to others, they're the surest sign of leadership," it was hard to imagine Charlton Heston doing it any better.
<p>
The Algers were produced for television by actor Don Johnson. Two years ago, on the occasion of the ceremony's first national telecast, Johnson told the Media Research Center that the awards are "based on good, old-fashioned, fundamental tools for success...Let's encourage success. That's what America's about." Again, like Post and Ritter, Johnson is not known as a conservative Republican. <p> 
The Algers will never be standard prime time fare, yet it's hard not to think that there's room for other programs like it. And perhaps some of prime time television's scriptwriters, who so often like to paint businessmen as society's villains, were watching and picking up ideas for inspirational business storylines.

<p>
<H3>Three items today:</H3>
<P>   
<OL>
<LI> <a href="#dole">Bob Dole</a> is losing. What's to blame? The fact that he's failed
to nail down his conservative base? No, ABC says -- surprise,
surprise -- that he's moved "too far to the right."
<li> A <a href="#reporter">White House reporter</a> for the New York Times will soon marry
a former Clinton Press Secretary turned liberal commentator.
<li> <a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> urges prayer for children because of the welfare
reform bill. 
<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="dole"></a>
<h3>1) </h3><dd>It could be argued that Bob Dole is losing because he
lacks conservative passion, that conservatives don't trust that
he'll follow through on his conservative promises. But that's not
a view ABC took Monday night. On the September 23 World News
Tonight reporter Dean Reynolds explored why Dole is behind in
Michigan's 8th congressional district, the Lansing area. In 1992
the networks didn't blame conservatives for Bush's impending loss
until October. This year ABC made an early start.
<dd>
    Reynolds found people happy with the economy and cynical
about the political process. Reynolds explained: "The same
cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton, seems to work
directly against Bob Dole with many voters here calling his 15
percent tax cut idea a political gimmick."
<dd>
    Following a soundbite from a teacher who asserted that you
can't cut taxes without increasing the deficit and who then
denounced Newt Gingrich, Reynolds relayed: "Many of the voters we
spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government shut down,
for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for attempts to trim
Medicare specifically."
<dd>
    Reynolds then aired a soundbite from Ron Bell, a man on golf
course: "I think that anybody that came out as strong as Mr.
Gingrich did when he first came out regarding Medicare was
committing political suicide and I think the Republican Party
took too long before they tried to quiet him down."
<dd>Reynolds: "And Ron Bell is a life-long Republican."
<dd>    Interviewer, off camera: "Your party. Did it move too far to
the right?"
<dd>    Bell: "Yes, far too far to the right."
<dd>    Reynolds: "That may explain why Dole is having trouble
winning over women voters."
<dd>    Woman in restaurant: "I am a Republican and I'm having some
troubles with the platform because I'm pro-choice."
<dd>    2nd woman in restaurant: "I think abortion is not a political
issue. It has no business in politics."
<dd>    Reynolds: "And where there is support for Dole, it often
sounds lukewarm."
<dd>    3rd woman in restaurant: "I will support Dole and most
probably vote for him, but it would have been nice if we had a
different candidate.

    Reynolds concluded his story: "Across Michigan's 8th
district, from the city streets to the fields of corn, the Dole
campaign is struggling, trailing and has six weeks to catch up."
<dd>
    So busy portraying Dole as "too far to the right," Reynolds
failed to consider that maybe voters don't believe his tax cut
promise because Dole has a long record of raising taxes over
conservative objections. Reynolds also failed to look at how
Reagan and Bush managed to win with a pro-life message.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>21. What does FRC think should be done to combat 
pornography?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) National standards for the determination
of obscenity should be developed.  (2) The law should require
compensation for the victims of pornography.  (3) Obscenity should
be treated as contraband.  (4) Strict liability should be the
legal standard for child-porn possession and distribution.  (5)
Computer networks should be family-friendly.  (6) Cable porn should
not be available on anything other than an opt-in basis.  (7)
All child porn should be made illegal:  pseudo, morphed, sketched,
or written.  (8) Indecency laws should be updated to include cable
and satellite transmission.  (9) Ordinary citizens should have
legal standing to seek injunctions against pornographers.  (10)
Pornography should be banned from U.S. government property, such
as on military bases both in America and abroad.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The policy steps listed above can
be taken to strengthen the hand of law enforcement against obscenity.
In 1970, the U.S. Postal Service identified 25 mail-order companies
across the country which sent unsolicited, sexually-explicit material
to homes across the country.  By March 1988, the number had grown
to 100 such companies.  Sex movies now make up more than 27 percent
of national video rental revenue.  Rentals and sales of adult
videos soared to $2.5 billion in 1994, and one analyst predicted
a 15 percent increase in that figure when 1995 figures become
available.

<p>

Pornography is also rampant on the worldwide computer system called
the Internet.  In June 1995, a team at Carnegie-Mellon University
released the results of a quantitative analysis of more than 900,000
items on the Internet.  The results:

<p><ul>

<li>83.5 percent of pictorial images available on Usenet newsgroups
devoted to images are pornographic;

<p>

<li>More than 48 percent of all &quot;downloads&quot; from 
&quot;adult&quot; commercial outlets are child porn;

<p>

<li>The two most-frequently-accessed picture categories on the 
&quot;adult&quot; market are child porn and bestiality.

</ul><p>

Dr. Dolf Zillman of Indiana
University, who has conducted research on attitudinal changes
caused by &quot;soft-core&quot; pornography, wrote, &quot;Whatever
the specific contents of standard pornography, there can be no
doubt that effects are created, and consistently so.  There can
be no doubt that pornography, as a form of particularly male entertainment,
promotes the victimization of women in particular.&quot;

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The enforcement of laws against obscenity and
the development of more legislation to protect our communities
from pornography in all its forms will result in a more family-friendly
world in which to raise children.  When parents and their children
enter the world of television, movies, radio, cyberspace, video
stores, and magazine shelves, the landscape will no longer resemble
fields of land mines.  Women will be protected, as will the institution
of marriage itself.  The deterioration of neighborhoods which
pornography brings will be reversed.  Incidents of date rape and
sexual harassment will be significantly reduced.

Baden</P><P>THE University of Washington has just suffered a $12 million budget cut. Political pressures within the university are to spread the pain by giving each college and program a proportional cut. With each unit suffering, say, a 2.4 percent reduction, no one has a strong incentive to mobilize to protect their special, provincial interest.</P><P>       Such caving-in minimizes short-run pain but gradually erodes quality. To avoid this erosion, hard choices must be made. It would be ethically and intellectually irresponsible to pretend these choices away and wait for better times, perhaps after the next president is appointed. While there's no unambiguously happy ending, at least we'll have a better reading of people's character as the process unfolds.</P><P>     Our budgetary shortfall is neither transitory nor local. Universities' golden age has passed, but our expectations lag reality. As David Goodstein, vice provost at Caltech noted, universities are on the threshold of &quot;the permanent era of constraint.&quot; Federal and state governments are reducing aid. They have tight budgets and electorates resist further tax increases. After years of tuition growth, some falling enrollments, and the expenses of increasing diversity, many schools cannot maintain current budgets of existing programs. This is most evident in California but these pressures are nationwide.</P><P>     Like other large complex organizations, units within universities are often run with an eye toward the benefits of those in them, not only for their stated purpose. When tough decisions are being made, we should expect the affected faculty and administrators to carefully weigh the expected impact of those decisions on their own well-being. These considerations of self interest often trump both the social value of their programs and the interests of students in general. Given human nature, it will not be otherwise.</P><P>     Hence, when universities face cutbacks, an adverse selection process goes to work. And here's the unhappy result: Those with the sorriest prospects on the outside (or at other universities) have the greatest incentive to keep their present positions. University politics often get especially nasty as projected losers attempt to discredit the university's leadership. An important principle of political economy becomes evident - last guys don't finish nice.</P><P>     A Ph.D. does not grant immunity from the labor market. Unless protected from market forces, by tenure for example, professors are usually paid an amount roughly equal to their value outside. This is why the salaries in medical schools are substantially higher than those in medieval studies, higher in computer science than in classics, higher in economics than in ecology. Some are paid less than their social contribution, and many find this unfair, but this is how the world works.</P><P>     It doesn't require training in economics to understand this process. Those with poor options elsewhere will fight the hardest to maintain their positions. They argue that the pain should be shared equally and programs spared. They find many arguments why their program should be saved and they mobilize pressures to retain their existing budget share. Given the stakes, it would be naive to expect any other behavior.</P><P>     But not all resistance is self-serving. We face the classic elements of tragedy when legitimate values collide and people face competing, inconsistent obligations. Some people in programs slated for elimination are no doubt highly dedicated and competent. Most will sincerely believe that their program is more valuable to the university stakeholders than some others being retained. And in these terribly important cases, there is no clear and objective standard of evaluation.</P><P>     This is not an easy time to be the president of a great university. Cuts cannot be avoided. Because of rigidities and scale requirements, the responsible decision is to cut marginal programs out entirely. The pressures are to share the pain and keep all alive but on short rations. The universities that remain in the top tier will focus their resources on the high-quality programs. The president has the responsibility to take the grand view and maximize quality.</P><P>     Only in Lake Wobegon are all departments and programs above average. Every large first-rate university has some second- or third-rate departments, schools and programs. When crunch time comes, they should go. This is the most intellectually and ethically responsible policy. Good leaders of great universities must select by quality and contribution to excellence. Since we can't have everything, we should resist political pressures and keep the best and most valuable. It requires great character, intelligence and judgment to do this. The demonstration of such qualities is the positive feature of the classic tragedies.</P><P>     William Gerberding, president of UW, was courageous when he announced a cut of faculty and departments. For the long-run future of a great university, Gerberding made the right decision. The question is, will he be able to implement it?</P><P>       When a drought hits and feed gets short, the rancher can choose from two strategies: put all stock on short rations, or as my grandfather would say, &quot;It's time to put wheels under the poor cows and take them to market.&quot; He knew that herd quality would suffer if we didn't cull now. University presidents face the same reality.</P><P>_____________</P><P>  John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.</P><P> </P><!--FOOT--><HR>

<P> 
<P> 
Monday's coverage of the Republican convention was a near carbon  
copy of the themes emphasized over the weekend. Viewers of Monday's  
morning shows heard repeated questions about why the Republicans excluded  
pro-choice voices. On the evening shows and in prime time coverage  
they heard references to the GOP's harsh, and extreme platform.  
Several reporters used retired General Colin Powell's speech as a  
foil to contrast his themes against the media-promoted image of the  
1992 convention. 
<P> 
Looking at the bright side of the Jack Kemp pick, on Today 
Monday morning NBC's Tim Russert argued it might prevent the  
GOP from employing a certain strategy: "This may be an enormous  
public service. If Jack Kemp's presence on the Republican ticket  
neutralizes the race issue, if the race card is not played in 1996  
because of Jack Kemp, he will have achieved more than any national  
figure in a long time. In 1988, the Willie Horton ad. Jack Kemp has  
said that was just absurd."

A Scary, Harsh, Extreme and Radical Republican Platform  
Not Even Counting Abortion.

On CBS Lesley Stahl declared without supporting information: "On  
the platform, women find that extreme. It's turning them off." 
Dan Rather asked Jack Kemp if he agreed that the platform is "harsh,  
extreme, even radical."  
<P> 
Exclusion of Pro-Choicers the Number One Concern of Reporters. Today's Katie  
Couric posed seven questions about abortion, even demanding that Dole's  
daughter Robin explain her abortion views. She asked Senator Kay  
Bailey Hutchison: "Do you still believe you can call the Republican  
Party an inclusive party?" See page 3. 
<P> 
Reporters Dismiss Dole Tax Plan as Failed Reaganomics. "Do you worry  
about the budget deficit ballooning as a result?" CNN's Bob Franken

<CENTER><H2><a name="the media's">The Media's</a> Exclusionary Rule</H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
Conventioneers Battered with Abortion Questions All Day 
<P> 
The networks stayed on message in harping on Republican exclusion  
of pro-abortion podium speakers. Just after noon Pacific time  
CNN's Charles Bierbauer asked Congressman Sam Brownback of  
Kansas: "But haven't some of those who might feel that abortion  
rights defensible, haven't they been excluded?" Candy Crowley  
asked pro-abortion Sen. Arlen Specter: "Do you think there is  
ever going to be room on the Republican ticket for someone like  
you?" 
<P> 
On NBC's Today on Monday, Katie Couric posed at least seven  
abortion questions.  To Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "You know a  
lot has been made of the Republican Party being a very inclusive  
party, one that can embrace the views of various people. Given  
the way the platform has worked out vis a vis abortion, and the  
fact that some of these Republican governors are not speaking  
because they felt, as if they were being censored. Do you still  
believe you can call the Republican Party an inclusive party?" 
<p> 
During the 1992 convention, Couric only asked Clinton's mother  
Virginia Kelley puff questions: "I also read in the many things  
that have been written about your son and his childhood that he  
used to walk to church alone with a Bible under his arm.' But  
Couric felt compelled yesterday to ask Dole's daughter Robin:  
"You all don't agree on all things political. I know you differ  
with him in terms of his views on abortion. Do you have  
discussions? Do you talk about it, talk it out, exchange views?" 
<P> 
But CNN exemplified an ironic new twist: excluding or downplaying  
conservatives wasn't censorship, but cleverly manipulative stage  
management. Reporter Frank Sesno declared Monday afternoon: "The  
placement of the various speakers at this convention is very  
purposeful and during this session, during this afternoon, some  
of the more hard line conservative speakers, such as Sam  
Brownback, were placed. We're not going to hear that rough edge  
tonight in prime time. Sesno's tone grew sharper: "The keynote  
speech will be delivered by a woman by the name of Susan  
Molinari. She is someone who is here with a very deliberate aim,  
and that is to take a belt sander to some of the sharper edges of  
the Republican Party." 
<P> 
ABC's Peter Jennings told Monday's San Diego Union Tribune:  
"Whenever a political party goes out of its way to restrain,  
isolate, or box in other voices , and both parties do it , then  
you almost invariably attract the attention of journalists." But  
Jennings ignored the Democrats' spiking of Bob Casey in 1992.  
Whether he lives up to his own statements this year will be  
tested in two weeks in Chicago.  

<CENTER><H2><a name="buchanan">Buchanan</a> "Destroyed" Bush </H2></CENTER>

<DD>  
Following Colin Powell's speech, reporters quickly pointed out the difference between this convention and  
the "divisive" Houston convention in 1992.   
<DD>  
Andrea Mitchell declared on MSNBC: "There's a real interesting contrast here because Pat Buchanan set  
the tone for the Houston convention four years ago with the same prime time starring role on the first night  
of the convention and that of course was the speech that many people feel destroyed George Bush's chance  
of winning re-election because it set a very narrow, exclusive and mean-spirited tone and tonight we had  
the contrast of Colin Powell."  
<DD>  
On Monday's Good Morning America, host Charles Gibson couldn't let the issue die: "It is this convention  
that is going to be harmonious. The Republicans are determined that there will be no repeat of Houston  
1992, which many saw as a harsh and divisive convention." While never mentioning that raising taxes  
could have cost Bush the election, ABC's John Cochran opined on World News Tonight: "The one thing  
that Bush did not have to tell Dole is that at all cost Dole should try to prevent a re-run of that bitter  
divisive convention four years ago in Houston, that so badly damaged Bush's chances for re-election. Dole  
knows that only too well."

<P> 
<P> 
<P> 
With the GOP showcasing the inoffensive lineup of former  
Presidents Ford and Bush as well as retired General Colin Powell,  
the networks made sure viewers learned that the Republican  
platform still upheld the party's ideological hard line. 
<P> 
NBC's David Bloom announced an amalgam of antis on Monday's  
Nightly News: "But not a word today from Bob Dole about the tough  
anti-immigration, anti-affirmative action, anti-abortion platform  
adopted this afternoon at the convention hall." Later in the  
show, NBC's Lisa Myers ended a story: "One Dole strategist has a  
different standard [of convention success]. He said he'll  
consider this convention a hit if the viewers end the week  
thinking Republicans aren't quite as scary as they thought." 
<P> 
"Even some Republicans describe the current platform as quote,  
harsh, extreme, even radical. Do you see it that way?" Dan Rather  
asked Jack Kemp on Monday's CBS Evening News.  
<P> 
During prime time, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl added: "The whole  
purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is to  
diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's what's  
turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the  
convention, the Republican convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was  
yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin  
Powell, he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find  
that extreme. It's turning them off." 






<CENTER><H2><a name="gutless">Gutless</a> Moderates?</H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
In the August 19 Newsweek, Senior Editor Jonathan Alter gave pro- 
abortion Republicans his recipe for political success. In a piece  
titled "The Passion Gap," he wrote: "Pro-choice Republicans  
insist it's their party, too. But the high-minded moderates are  
too polite to take on the hard-charging right. Until they do, the  
GOP may never truly win over the country." 
<P> 
The crux of Alter's wisdom? Attack your most loyal voting block:  
"This is now the fifth nominating convention in which the GOP has  
applied an anti-abortion litmus test. Ronald Reagan signed an  
abortion-rights law as Governor of California, then changed his  
position in time for his presidential campaigns. George Bush was  
such a supporter of family planning as a congressman that he was  
called 'Rubbers,' but by the 1980s had flip-flopped. Bob Dole is  
pro-life but has gone back and forth so many times on platform  
language and planks that he has raised basic questions about his  
leadership. If he can't stand up to a Phyllis Schlafly, how would  
he handle a Saddam Hussein?" 
<P> 
Alter closed by holding up the Democratic Party, the same party  
that shut Governor Bob Casey out of its  1992 convention for his  
pro-life views, as an example of the big-tent the GOP should  
emulate: "The only real way to change the Republican Party is  
for...a pro-choice candidate to run for President in  
2000....Sometime soon a compelling moderate Republican will take  
a leaf from the successes of centrist Democrats and enter a few  
primaries. Then we'll find out if the Republicans can finally  
pitch that big tent they like to talk about."

<CENTER><H3><a name="corporate">Corporate</a> Welfare Watch</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Two reporters cheered Colin Powell's denunciation of corporate  
welfare last night, but they failed to mention which party tried  
to reduce it or how NBC is a recipient. 
On MSNBC, correspondent Andrea Mitchell never reflected on the  
hard choice her own network made when NBC decided to make money  
in prime time by joining up with PBS for convention coverage:  
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin  
Powell's speech is that he did talk about the hard choices and he  
said, 'Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have  
to give up corporate welfare as well and that entitlements are  
the real issue.'" 
<P> 
PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to Gary Bauer after Powell  
left the podium: "You heard the reaction in the room at the  
conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that  
when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the  
wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you  
think this crowd is really receiving this message." 
<P> 
The House Republicans tried to eliminate the Commerce Department,  
a fact not raised by either reporter.

Jonathan Alter's Conventional Wisdom Watch in the August 19  
Newsweek should be renamed Cliched Wisdom Watch for this well- 
worn slap at Ronald Reagan. Alter gave Reagan an up arrow: "'96  
GOP theme is `win another one for the Gipper' , and his big  
deficits, too."

<CENTER><H3>Tax Plan Declared Failed Reaganomics</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
The offering of tax cuts is universally seen as good politics,  
but that doesn't mean reporters won't try to make them unpopular.  
Bob Dole's new tax cut proposal and selection of Jack Kemp as his  
running mate may be making headway in the polls, but journalits  
are trying to put on the brakes. For reporters all tax cuts are  
bad.     
<P> 
Brand new CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart declared  
Monday: "It will be interesting to see if Bob Dole, who'd been  
skeptical of supply-siders like Jack Kemp in the past, can sell  
this to the American people without being perceived as a  
hypocrite." Other reporters assumed that supply-side economics is  
a failed doctrine and that tax cuts will "balloon" the deficit as  
they allegedly did in the Reagan years: 
<P> 
Just before noon Pacific time on Monday, CNN's Bob Franken asked  
George Shultz on the convention floor: "I wanted to talk to you  
about the fact that you worked with Republican Bob Dole on his  
economic plank. Were you pleased that there were tax cuts in  
there, and do you worry about the budget deficit ballooning as a  
result?" 
<P> 
On Inside Washington just before Dole released his plan, Newsweek  
Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas declared: "There are millions  
of quotes from Bob Dole all through the '80s saying, Look, you  
can't just cut taxes and expect the economy to do much better.  
Now he's screeched around, 180 degrees, and he's sounding like a  
pie-in-the-sky, Reaganomics professor. It's, it doesn't suit his  
character and he's giving up some high ground. Now Bill Clinton  
looks like the responsible guy." 
<P> 
Headline in the August 5 USA Today: "Dole's Tax Plan Could  
Backfire, Experts Say: Deficits, interest rates could rise."  
NBC reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5,  
Nightly News: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did  
worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan."  
Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" minutes later: "They  
say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as they did  
during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by  
future generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." 
<P> 
Minutes after Dole's tax cut address that day, U.S. News & World  
Report Senior Writer Susan Dentzer suggested on CNN that the  
people didn't care about fiscal realities: "I think it's going to  
sell very well among those who, for one thing, think that  
government is taxing them too heavily and don't have a  
calculator, don't particularly care about the details of federal  
fiscal policy and don't particularly want to add up the  
dimensions of the problem or stare into the future that we know  
we face." 
<P> 
<P> 
Newsweek reporter Howard Fineman stressed in the August 12 issue  
that Dole "risks his most cherished asset: his credibility...Now  
he's embracing supply-side economics, years after it came (and  
went) in GOP circles. So late in his career , so late in his  
campaign , it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag that  
the annual deficit on his watch , and that he's a champion of  
fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole." 
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="reality">Reality</a> Check:</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Monday's Investor's Business Daily pointed out: "Just turn to  
page 369 of the 'Economic Report of the President'...A table  
shows that receipts from individual income taxes rose to $446  
billion in fiscal '89, President Reagan's last budget, from $286  
billion in fiscal '81, the year Reagan began to slash personal  
rates. That's a 56 percent gain. Annualized, tax receipts grew  
faster than the period's average 4 percent inflation. The problem  
was clearly NOT a fall in revenues. It was the other side of the  
ledger: Spending grew even faster. Look at the 'total outlays''  
column in the same table. Spending rose to $1.143 trillion in '89  
from $678 billion in '81. That's a 69 percent gain. It's no  
surprise that Clinton, a professional politician, would brush  
over such inconvenient facts. Media figures who claim to have no  
hidden agendas, on the other hand, have no excuse."  
<P>
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="inside">On Inside</a> Washington:</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
Evan Thomas, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief: "I think 
this is really disappointing. 
<P> And more advice from the left from Thomas: "Maybe pandering  
works,  
but the polls don't show that. The polls, I think, even Dole's  
own  
polls show that most people reject this tax cut because they  
don't  
believe it. They got conned in the 1980s by Reagan, they got a  
tax cut, 
but they still got a, it didn't do what he predicted it would do 
to the economy. They're in a highly cynical mode, I don't think 
they believe his pandering. In fact, if you ask the question, 'Do 
you approve a tax cut if it would increase the deficit?' only 11 
percent of the country, according to one reputable poll, went 
for it, so I think it's lose-lose." 

<CENTER><H2><a name="millionaire">Millionaire</a> Anchors Tag GOP Delegates As Out of Touch with Middle America</h2></center>
<P> 
<P> 
Early in Monday's PBS/NBC coverage, Tom Brokaw asked: "The big question, of course, what is the  
Republican Party these days?...Well on the floor of this convention hall, they are overwhelmingly white  
and male, male by a factor of about two to one...The largest single income group, more than 38 percent of  
the people here earn more than $100,000 a year." Some additional examples from Monday of how the  
networks created an image for viewers of an out of touch elite gathered in San Diego: 
<P> 
Ed Bradley on the CBS Evening News last night: "For the most part they are white, male, and they are  
older than the average American. They are also more conservative than the average American. They are  
also wealthier , about a third of the delegates earn more than $100,000 a year." 
<P> 
Dan Rather in prime time: "Delegates in this convention have been selected, inspected, detected,  
categorized by the press, the pols, the pros, and the pollsters. We know they're mostly male,  
overwhelmingly white, mostly well to the right politically, and almost one in five of these delegates is a  
millionaire." 
<P> 
CNN's Judy Woodruff to Susan Molinari: "We look at the statistics of how many women delegates. What?  
43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women this year. What sort of signal does that  
send to the country, you think? 
<P> 
Woodruff again last night: "We talked to Jack Kemp a little while ago and asked him about, among other  
things, the fact that not only not just the language in the platform , only three percent of these delegates are  
African American. Only 36 percent of these delegates are women. This is not a convention that is  
necessarily representative even of the broader Republican Party, the people who vote Republican, much  
less the electorate overall." 
<P> 
So, will these reporters apply equal treatment to the unreprersentative Democrats gathering in Chicago in a  
few days?  <p>

<H1>The brutal assault on a good reputation</H1></CENTER>

<P>There's an axiom of Arkansas politics that it takes two generations for a family to get back its reputation after someone in the family gets himself elected governor.

<P>Poor Arkansas. The state may never regain its reputation for square dealing and straight shooting - which is actually how most of its sons and daughters, among the most honorable and decent people on earth, deal with one another.

<P>The stereotype of the barefoot hillbilly, with his jug of corn whiskey slung over one shoulder and his long rifle (with which he could put out the eye of a panther at a hundred yards) over the other, has been succeeded by the stereotype of the country lawyer/banker/chickenplucker who could and would pick his neighbor's pocket at a hundred feet.

<P>Many Arkansawyers will tell you, almost tearfully, that if Bill Clinton's reckless personal behavior and irresponsible abuse of the facts has embarrassed the nation, he has humiliated his home state. Hillary has done her part, too, though she gets an asterisk beside her name because she's from Illinois, not Arkansas.

<P>Only last week, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the one-time Arkansas securities commissioner who Mrs. Clinton didn't remember talking to about the troubles Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was having with the state, testified that well, yes, they did have a conversation and it lasted fully five minutes.

<P>Naturally nobody did anything wrong or said anything inappropriate. But we know enough now about how the first lady operates - &quot;there's hell to pay when she doesn't get her way&quot; - that we can guess how that conversation went. Mrs. Schaffer, who was then Miss Bassett, understood that Hillary was the wife of the governor - or &quot;Bill,&quot; as she referred to him in the correspondence telling an assistant to warn the governor that the feds were closing in on Madison S&amp;L -and she was in no position to do anything more than salute the wife. Madison, of course, was the reliable Clinton family piggy bank.

<P>If the rest of the country is getting a little weary of it all, we saw the strain begin to show on the Clintons and their entourage, and their paid pleaders, last week.

<P>Some of the dwindling band of Clinton acolytes among the reporters and commentators, yearning for one more invitation to sup at the White House, naturally went gaga over the president's tribute to the first lady before his State of the Union address at the Capitol. But not all. One of the exceptions, Mark Shields, the PBS commentator, observed that the salute to Hillary was a tribute that the president owed the first lady because she had swallowed hard and stuck by him at the first insinuations that his character was not all that it should be. Now that insinuations have been made against Mrs. Clinton's moral and ethical reputation, payback is only fair.

<P>You didn't have to be Sigmund Freud to detect and understand that icy stare that Mrs. Clinton shot back at her husband after he paid tribute to her as &quot;a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great first lady.&quot;

<P>But unless Mrs. Clinton is unique as an American wife, a woman merely amused by the tales of her husband's heroic sexual adventuring, cutting a swath a mile wide through their friends and employees, she is particularly annoyed now when the tsunami of ethical and moral questions rolls toward the White House and it is she, and not he, who may be asked to drown and to be cheerful about it. She's entitled to wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning to wonder why the faithful wife must sacrifice herself to protect the pact made 25 years ago at Yale Law School to experiment on a guinea pig called Arkansas en route to important things in Washington.

<P>How galling now that she, who has taken such pride over the years in her part in the destruction of Richard Nixon, punishing him for covering up a third-rate political burglary, should now see similar punishment looming for covering up a third-rate bank robbery in a place no longer of any consequence to the Clintons.

<P>The White House, and Democrats generally, get red in the face at comparisons of Whitewater (or &quot;Wifewater,&quot; as the Economist calls it) to the Watergate scandals of nearly a quarter of a century ago. Such comparisons sting because they are so exquisitely apt. Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, perhaps the most faithful of all the Clinton liege men, sneers that comparing Whitewater to Watergate, the Clintons to Nixon, is &quot;like comparing a jaywalker to the Boston Strangler.&quot;

<P>Then Mr. Hunt reaches for the analogy himself: Susan Thomases, he writes, has dispensed &quot;more bad advice to a White House than anyone since Chuck Colson.&quot; Mr. Colson, of course, was convicted of Watergate cover-up crimes. He repented and found forgiveness in the blood of Christ. Any Methodist in Arkansas could explain the difference.

<i>"Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a Russian 
television reporter said today that this is as tightly controlled 
as anything the Communist Party ever put on, Tom." <p>
-- Reporter 
David Bloom from the convention floor to anchor Tom Brokaw, 
August 14 NBC Nightly News.</i><p>
<center><h2><a name="finally">Finally Find a Republican They Like, But Still Attack 
Rest Elizabeth Dole: "Masterful"</h2></center><p>

It took until the third night, but Wednesday evening the networks 
finally found a Republican they could respect: Elizabeth Dole. 
However, they still spent yesterday morning and evening 
disparaging speakers who had criticized President Clinton and 
questioning the credibility of Jack Kemp for changing his 
position on affirmative action and immigration.<p>

"Absolutely powerful performance," gushed Dan Rather after 
Elizabeth Dole finished her reflections on Bob Dole’s life. "It 
was masterful," agreed Tim Russert on NBC where Tom Brokaw 
explained: "In the language of this summer, ladies and gentlemen, 
that was a gold medal performance." ABC’s Peter Jennings 
pronounced it "an unquestionably brilliant piece of stagecraft by 
Mrs. Dole."<p>

Yesterday, network viewers also heard:<p>

Jack Kemp has "damaged his credibility" by altering his positions 
on affirmative action and immigration. Lesley Stahl asked if he'’s 
“selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?" ABC suggested it 
“fights the very image that he’s built for himself as an 
independent thinker." Kemp adjusted two views, all of Clinton’s 
are usually in constant motion. Will networks focus on that in 
Chicago? <p>

Networks come to Clinton’s defense and say Tuesday night speakers 
went too far in their “harsh” criticism of Clinton. CBS insisted 
Susan Molinari went after Clinton "with a vengeance" and Good 
Morning America's Elizabeth Vargas claimed "some of the harshest 
words were from Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bryant 
Gumbel wondered if anyone is "seeing any evidence" of tolerance 
from Republicans. And NBC’s Maria Shriver asked "how ugly" 
Republicans will make the fall campaign. <p>

Reporters may like Elizabeth Dole, but they still hold a grudge 
against Marilyn Quayle. ABC’s Michel McQueen recalled the 
"strident tone" of her 1992 convention address as NBC’s Tom 
Brokaw also charged last night that Mrs. Quayle was "too 
strident." <p>

<center><h2><a name="gop">GOP</a> Criticized for Attacking Clinton*s "Eating Habits";
Decrying "Bash Bill Night"</h2></center><p>
Journalistic sensitivity to any attacks on Bill Clinton quickly came through loud and clear Wednesday morning and night. "GOP Unleashes An Attack On Clinton Over Character and His Economic Policies," charged The New York Times.<p>

"Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the President," Bryant Gumbel began Wednesday's Today.<p>

NBC*s morning crew stuck to the Democratic line in their questions. Gumbel asked Tim Russert: "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it or quite the contrary?"<p>

Today's Katie Couric inquired of Republican Charles Black: "Chris Dodd of the DNC says this is a huge con game. That the way you're portraying the party as this moderate inclusive party just doesn't gibe with say, the platform, and some of the attitudes of members of the GOP. How do you address that?" Couric asked Pat Buchanan: "Your speech at the 1992 Republican convention, where you talked about a religious war, was considered by many to be very polarizing, a real turn-off, self-righteous, superior, exclusionary. Do you regret giving this speech?"<p>

CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot declared: "It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

Over on Good Morning America, news anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted: "Some of the harshest words were from Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who tried to paint the President as a tax and spend liberal." GMA co-host Charles Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." ABC's Vargas didn't shy away from stereotyping: "But in addition to a gender gap, Republicans have had problems attacting minorities, a party that has traditionally been home to the angry white man."<p>

Last night NBC*s Lisa Myers demanded of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "Some of the focus groups which had watched your speech...voters found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect do you think you went too far?"<p>

Calling conservatives "extremists" has been a Democratic mantra for two years, but NBC*s Maria Shriver asked Dole California campaign chairman Ken Khachigian: "You said coming out of this campaign, Clinton is going to have 80 days of hell, that we are going to take Clinton down in California, that we are going to take him down hard. How ugly is this going to get?" No uglier than the media in San Diego.<p>

<center><h2><a name="clinton">Will</a> Clinton Be Held to the Same Standard in Chicago?</h2>
<h3>Jack Kemp, the Political "Acrobat"</h3></center><p>

The choice of Jack Kemp as Dole's running mate prompted the media to point out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified those two views to reflect the party's platform, the media are accusing him of abandoning principle.<p>

While reporters portray President Clinton's flip-flops on every issue as "moving to the center," they don't see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to 
attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, in prime time last night CBS's Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?"<p>

Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility?"<p>

On World News Tonight ABC's Jackie Judd asserted that "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She then looked at his affirmative action change, noting "that left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned." She concluded: "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker."<p>

<center><h2><a name="cheese">Want</a> Some Cheese With Your Whine? </h2>
<h3>Koppel Cops Out of San Diego</h3></center>

Ted Koppel is angry. As quoted by Martha Moore in the August 14 USA Today, he complained that convention planners always exert as much control over coverage as possible, but this year, "`I think the politicians are ahead,'" says ABC's Ted Koppel, who took his Nightline show back to Washington today, two days early. `They have more control over what we put on the air this week than they have ever had before.'"<p>

Just how successful have planners been? According to USA Today ABC filled a bit over half of their broadcast on Monday, 34 minutes out of an hour, with actual convention proceedings. On Tuesday, ABC aired even less of the convention, 26 out of 66 minutes broadcast. ABC filled the rest with interviews, analysis and ads.<p>

Koppel sounded like a restless child in his Tuesday Nightline announcement: "This convention is more of an infomercial than a news event. Nothing surprising has happened, nothing surprising is anticipated. Frankly, we expect the Democratic convention in Chicago to be much of the same. Indeed the only reason we were planning to originate these Nightline broadcasts from Chicago in another couple of week was a sense of fairness. And then it occurred to us that perhaps we should learn from our experience. There was a time when the national political conventions were news events of such complexity that they required the presence of thousands of journalists , but not this year. If anything important happens we will certainly have an adequate staff here to cover it and we will send an equivalent unit to Chicago. But we don*t all have to be here so most of us from Nightline are going home tomorrow."<p>

Such is the sad state of American journalism: Koppel's Nightline broadcast five stories about Tonya Harding in 1994, many more about O.J. Simpson, but will only turn in two on the 1996 Republican convention."<p>

Reporters couldn't help but praise Elizabeth Dole, but Marilyn Quayle 
still hasn't lived down the media's feminist fury over her 1992 convention 
speech. On Tuesday night, ABC's Michel McQueen said: "I ran into Marilyn 
Quayle today, who gave a speech in 1992 that was kind of a 'peel the 
paint off the walls' speech that was described later on as contributing 
to a rather strident tone of the '92 convention. She told me she was 
shocked by the way it was received afterwards."<p>

After Dan Quayle's speech last night, NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled: "Marilyn 
Quayle, who spoke at the convention four years ago, and many people 
thought that her speech was too strident, talking about the place 
of women, critical of the feminist movement in this country at the 
time."<p>



<center><h2><a name="rapping">Rapping</a> Reagan's Film</h2></center>
<p>
Remember Bill Clinton's "Man From Hope" video during the 1992 Democratic convention? The sugary-sweet film was shown on all the networks and was widely praised for adding insight into Bill Clinton. But the Republican*s equally sweet video of President Ronald Reagan on Tuesday night touched off a round of media carping as to the video*s value as news.
<p>
As James Bennet reported in Wednesday*s New York Times, Jeff Zucker, Executive Producer of NBC coverage, said: "Let me say if I had to do it again, I would really give that a second thought...I*m not as convinced, Monday morning quarterbacking myself, that it was as newsworthy as I thought going in."
<p>
CBS officials clucked about their decision to pass over the video, hoping for more of a movie of the week flavor. "Lane Venardos, a CBS vice president, sounded equally comfortable with his decision to ignore the film almost completely. "We decided on news value alone not to run it," he said. "There was not one scintilla of new information." Mr. Venardos said convention planners had promised the video would include "new pictures of the former President, never-before-seen post-Alzheimer's-onset pictures."
<p>
<h3>Clinton: Fiscal Conservative</h3>
<p>
In the August 19 edition, Newsweek's six-million-dollar "anonymous" author, Joe Klein, declared the GOP faithful "entered their convention on a mild, quasi-delusional wave of enthusiasm. The rest of us will be forgiven for yawning: the Dole tax cut stands, to all but hard-core taxophobes, as a transparent and rather pathetic bit of politics. He wants to cut $548 billion over six years? And balance the budget? Does anyone actually believe this? The trouble is, after all the deficit reduction of the past few years, there isn*t much non-incendiary matter left on the federal level to cut."
<p>
Time's George Church sneered: "Getting people not to think might be helpful, particularly since some of Dole's numbers do not seem to add up." Church concluded: "A case could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill Clinton."
<p>
<h3>Candace Capitalizes</h3>
<p>
On Wednesday's Today, NBC's Jamie Gangel did a feature on  Candace Gingrich which painted a very unsympathetic portrait of the lesbian*s half-brother Newt: "Gingrich went on to call Candace a sinner. He's also compared homosexuality to alcoholism and is against legislation that would protect gays from being fired because of their sexual orientation." 
<p>
Gangel said to Candace: "You're being very polite about the fact that your brother says terrible things about homosexuals....He doesn't return your phone calls. He doesn't answer your faxes. He doesn't respond to his own sister. That's okay with you?"
<p>
Gangel never attempted to understand how the Speaker might feel: that Candace has capitalized on her half-brother's fame (complete with a guest star appearance on Friends by making him look insensitive, and that replying to any call or fax might lead to another batch of negative publicity.
Gangel simply claimed: "Candace says she is not trying to hurt her brother. She just wants equal rights and hopes people will learn to accept gay relationships."
<p>
<h3>Kemp's flip flops.</h3>
<p>
	When Bob Dole announced his choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate, the media quickly pointed out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified his views to reflect those of the party platform, the media is accusing him of flip-flopping.
<p>
	On CNN's coverage of the convention, political analyst Ken Bode was quick to attack Kemp: "Today Jack Kemp did a double back dive ten degree of difficulty on the issues of immigration and affirmative action." Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, CBS' Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole."
<p>
	While reporters consider President Clinton's flip-flops "moving to the center," they don*t see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On the August 14 CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn*t that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility."
<p>
	The questions were no different on the floor of the convention. On the August 14 World News Tonight, ABC's Jackie Judd got her angle from a liberal California delegate, claiming Kemp had "abandoned" that wing of the party. She started her story: "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions to get in line with Bob Dole." It's not so unusual for a vice-presidential candidate to accommodate the views of the presidential candidate, but Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he*s built for himself as an independent thinker."

<h3>Speaking of Infomercials...</h3>
<p>
As network stars grumble about the tightly scripted "infomercial" the GOP convention has become, perhaps they should remember the infomercial-like tone some reporters employed to promote the Clinton-Gore ticket at their New York City convention in 1992:
ABC*s Jim Wooten introduced the convention on July 13, 1992: "That*s the ticket. Not a liberal in sight and that*s the picture Clinton wants the convention to leave with the country. Democrats happily moving from their liberal past to their centrist future...So Clinton and his moderates have captured the Democratic Party for the moment."
<p>
In the next morning's New York Times, reporter David Rosenbaum echoed ABC: "The views that dominated the party for so long, what was proudly called liberal, are hardly in evidence in Madison Square Garden this week...Mr. Mondale, who in 1984 was the last down-the-line liberal to win the Democratic presidential nomination and who lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan in November, said he was resigned to the change."
<p>
On the evening of July 14, 1992 Dan Rather announced: "Delegates approved the Clinton-Gore center-of-the-road Democratic Party platform, trying to move the party closer to the voters around the malls in America*s suburbs."
<p>
CBS This Morning reporter Bill Plante touted Clinton's momentum: "Everything seems to be going Clinton's way. They couldn't be happier here. They say that the candidate*s numbers are improving every day. They have their moderate platform. And things are just generally where they would want them to be."
<p>
Peter Jennings claimed on July 15, 1992: "He's become a little more disciplined, Bill Clinton, but you know he loves a crowd. And he has, don*t want to get carried away here, but he has the kind of hands people respond to."
<p>
From the floor of the convention NBC's Maria Shriver merely tried to get Elizabeth Glaser to repeat her nasty attack on Ronald Reagan: "You place responsibility for the death of your daughter [from AIDS] squarely at the feet of the Reagan administration. Do you believe they are responsible for that?"
<p>
Before savaging Barbara Bush in August, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff asked Hillary Clinton: "The Clinton campaign has been saying that this is a week that they were trying to tell the American people more about who Bill Clinton really is...What is it that you think the American people should know about your husband that they may not know or may not understand?"<p>

<h2>***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</center></h2><p>

<center><h3>    One item today: <p></center></h3>
A Media Reality Check '96 fax report released Wednesday 
afternoon. Back on June 22, 1992 CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn 
announced: "Making headlines this morning: Bill Clinton comes up with a 
plan for the economy. Tax the rich, cut the deficit, and help just about 
everyone else." That's not quite how reporters have greeted Bob Dole's tax 
cut plan. In this report we compared and contrasted how media outlets which
have tried to discredit Dole's proposal were the very same outlets which
praised Clinton's economic and health plans.<p>
    The following is the text of the report put together by Tim Graham with 
the assistance of Tim Lamer and the rest of our crew in Alexandria: <p>

<center><h3>The Voodoo Gap: The Media's Partisan Economics</center></h3><p>

<i>SAN DIEGO, CA</i> -- Bob Dole's tax cut proposal was quickly denigrated by 
reporters as the unwelcome return of irresponsible Reaganomics, but the 
outpouring of media skepticism about Dole's tax proposal in no way resembles 
the national media's salesmanlike reaction to Clinton proposals in 1992 and 
1993.<p>

"Raising questions about how Bob Dole's going to cut taxes and balance the 
budget is fair," said MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III. "What's not fair is 
attacking Dole's credibility after you've swallowed Clinton's bizarre fiscal 
estimates whole. After passing on the fantasy of a self-financing Clinton 
health plan and 1,000 descriptions of Medicare `cuts,' the media ought to
think about their own credibility on budget matters before they pretend to be 
nonpartisan skeptics of Dole." Among the outlets with a bad case of partisan 
economics:<p>
 
NBC. Reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5, 1996 Nightly News:  
"Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and 
many are skeptical of Dole's plan." Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" 
minutes later: "They say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as 
they did during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by future 
generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." NBC did not note as 
columnist James Glassman pointed out Tuesday, that according to Clinton's own
Economic Report of the President, tax revenues increased from $601 billion in 
1983 to $991 billion in 1989, but spending rose from $808 billion in 1983 to 
$1.143 trillion in 1989.<p>

Clinton often drew praise. NBC reporter Lisa Myers raved on the February 18, 
1993 Today: "The President deserved great, great credit for having the courage 
to come forward with a plan to deal responsibly with the deficit." NBC's Andrea 
Mitchell worried about his image on the May 2, 1993 Meet the Press: "This is 
the first President in a generation who had the guts to try to do something 
about deficit reduction and take on health care, and somehow he's not selling 
that. He's still being perceived as an old-style Democrat."<p>
 
CBS. Reporter Linda Douglass declared on the July 23, 1996 CBS Evening News: 
"Dole will have to tread carefully as he promotes his tax cut. Each of the 
proposals he's considering would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and 
Dole will have to convince voters that won't drive up the deficit."<p>
 
But on the September 15, 1993 Sunday Morning, Douglass simply passed on 
Clinton's notion of paying for 37 million uninsured Americans' health care -- 
with a cigarette tax: "They have a very elaborate plan to pay for this 
revolution in health care. It doesn't provide for much new in the way of 
taxes, just a sin tax, cigarette tax. They claim the money's going to come 
from savings in spending." The Clinton health proposal was estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office to cost $784 billion in its first seven years.<p>

U.S. News & World Report. Senior Writer Susan Dentzer was the first to 
condemn Dole's tax cut on CNN just minutes after Dole was finished: "The old 
joke among economists is that an economist who's stuck in a ditch gets out
of it by assuming the existence of a ladder, and there are a fair amount of 
assumptions of existences of ladders in this plan that really, I think, under
intense scrutiny, are not going to bear out." Appearing on Nightline a few 
hours later, she called the Dole plan "a free lunch."<p>
 
Dentzer, on the other hand, applauded Clinton's micromanagement of the 
economy in the March 15, 1993 U.S. News: "Amid a broader economic plan that 
has its share of flaws, Clinton's well-crafted stimulus is a piece worth 
keeping...The sorts of spending the President has picked -- for example on 
education or on long-planned highway projects -- tend to create lots of jobs, 
many which carry high wages and benefits."<p>
 
Newsweek. Reporter Howard Fineman wrote in the latest issue that Dole "risks 
his most cherished asset: his credibility....Now he's embracing supply-side 
economics, years after it came (and went) in GOP circles. So late in his career 
-- so late in the campaign -- it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag 
that the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and that he's a 
champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole."<p>

Fineman had a different idea of who was responsible for the deficit on the 
October 11, 1995 Fox Morning News: "He [Clinton] really doesn't have to put 
numbers on the table. It's the Republicans who have said they're the 
revolutionaries. They're the ones with the responsibility."<p>
 
Time. Washington Bureau Chief Dan Goodgame declared on September 20, 1993: 
"The Clinton plan is surprisingly persuasive in supporting the long-time 
claim of the Clintons and their top health care strategist, Ira Magaziner, 
that [health] reform can be almost entirely from savings, without broad-based 
new taxes and with enough left over to reduce the federal budget deficit." 
But in the January 29, 1996 issue, Goodgame described the 1980s as "when top
tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's the reason supply-
siders are often described as optimists." <p>

<h2><a name="quote">QUOTE OF THE DAY</a></h2><p>

<i>"They listened to those reports of the people turning down the
dials when negative responses were made in San Diego. He did it
on the high road. He said this was to be a campaign of ideas, not
insults, no personal attacks. And I think a final thought, Dan.
This was a convention that was well-planned and well-thought out.
They had their themes and they hit the mark every day. And the
President hit the mark tonight."<p>
 -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley,
after Clinton's speech.</i><p>

<h2><a name="nasty">"Nasty</a> Little Scandal" Prompts Some New Clinton Scrutiny;
 Dick Morris Story Mars Pro-Clinton Euphoria<p></h2></center>

    The networks generally praised Bill Clinton's acceptance
speech last night, but earlier in the evening coverage
concentrated on the resignation of Clinton campaign strategist
Dick Morris after revelations of a relationship with a
prostitute. The Morris news forced some networks to discuss
issues suppressed the first three nights: Clinton's character and
whether Morris pushed him artificially to the right.<p>

    "Two of the best and brightest of their political generation,
both baby boomers," marveled Tom Brokaw of Clinton and Gore.
ABC's Sam Donaldson offered: "Clinton always gives a great
speech, and this was another one of them. But the record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind." <p>

    -- CBS and NBC evening shows led with Morris, but ABC's Peter
Jennings seemed annoyed that he had to even mention the
allegations. "Here in Chicago," Jennings began World News
Tonight, "the President has been fine tuning, as they say, the
speech he will be giving to this convention and to the country
tonight. And he has a lot to be pleased about. A very upbeat
convention. A very successful train trip here with rising poll
numbers to accompany it. And a very important set of statistics
about the economy today, which he will certainly point to as
evidence that the country should re-elect him. And then along
comes a nasty little scandal to take the edge off the good news
at least for one day." <p>

    -- Questions about liberal influences on Clinton. Tom Brokaw,
on NBC Nightly News, asked Tim Russert "Does this open the door
then...to some of the President's old friends, who are more left
of center than right of center?" Dan Rather to Ted Kennedy in
prime time: "Bob Dole said today with Morris gone President
Clinton has only around him now liberal aides, and that's going
to hurt him?"<p>

    --  Character issue raised on CNN and NBC, which were the
only networks to detail the Morris story. On the 7pm ET Inside
Politics, Judy Woodruff inquired of Vernon Jordan: "Does it say
anything about the President's judgment that he would turn again
and again over 20 years to a man like Dick Morris with the sort
of personal problems that he allegedly has?" As prime time began,
only CNN's Bernie Kalb and NBC's Lisa Myers noted the Star
reported Morris used a Clinton campaign hotel room and that he
allowed the woman to listen in on phone calls with Clinton.<p>

    -- The rank hypocrisy of Al Gore's speech Wednesday night
went unmentioned Thursday morning and evening. Gore said his
sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco
crusade, but in 1988 he boasted of growing and selling tobacco.
The only exception came on CNN's Crossfire which showed the 1988
clip of Gore.<p>

<center><h2><a name="ted">The</a> Orator of "Robert Bork's America" Goes Negative Again 
Ted Kennedy's Hit Speech Goes Uncriticized</center></h2><p>

    Reporters continued to miss the hypocrisy of Clinton's
proclamation of an "ideas, not insults" campaign when matched
with the attack-dog rhetoric of podium speakers. Last night, Ted
Kennedy used the exact same literary device that two weeks ago
fueled media criticism of Republican Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison. <p>

    Said Kennedy of the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish
list of the education-cutting, environmental-trashing,
Medicare-slashing, choice-denying, tolerance-repudiating,
gay-bashing, Social Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling,
government-closing, tax loophole-granting....minimum
wage-opposing Republican majority that dominated the delegations
in San Diego" <p>

    -- NBC's Lisa Myers asked Hutchison in San Diego: "Do you
think you went too far?" On PBS, Tom Brokaw said last night:
"Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in full voice after all these
years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the
liberal cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he
does every four years."<p>

    -- On CNN,Bernard Shaw asserted: "Sixteen years ago in New
York's Madison Square Garden, Sen. Edward Kennedy rallied the
Democratic Party. Tonight, he has done it again in Chicago." Ken
Bode added: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the
other party. You get it at any convention. Ted Kennedy does it as
well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."<p>

   -- CNN's Bill Schneider found code words: "What they're trying
to do is take advantage of Dole's age and portray him as sort of
out of it. He's kind of irrelevant. He's kind of a dupe. That the
ideas are the sinister ideas of Newt Gingrich, and even Jack Kemp
with his supply-side ideas." But that attack theme drew no
criticism.<p>

    -- Later, CNN's Judy Woodruff interviewed Kennedy: "Do you
really believe that the Republicans are as dangerous, that Bob
Dole is as dangerous, as you described in your remarks?" Bernard
Shaw queried: "You had a who's who of names tonight: Pat
Buchanan, Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Rush Limbaugh, Ralph Reed,
Pat Robertson. What were you driving at?"<p>

    -- On CBS, where Bob Schieffer asked Sen. Hutchison in San
Diego how she felt being "Attack Dog Hutchison," Dan Rather
interviewed Kennedy last night but failed to ask him about the
speech or its tone.<p>


<center><h2><a name="convention">Convention</a>-Inspired Ratherisms</center></h2><p>

    Special events often inspire the folksy aphorisms known as
Ratherisms: <p>

    This is your classic case of two pounds of politics in a
one-pound bag. This hall is only a third the size of the Houston
Astrodome, where the last Republican convention was held." -- 
Dan Rather, leading off Republican coverage, August 12.<p>

    -- "She's expected to hit President Clinton rhetorically with
everything short of a tire tube." -- Rather on Kay Bailey
Hutchison, August 13 convention coverage.<p>

    -- "It looks like California's Governor Pete Wilson is out of
the doghouse. You know from his view he's been put so far back in
the doghouse they had to FedEx him daylight." -- Rather during
August 14 Republican convention coverage. <p>

    -- "The Vice President of the United States, Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee, age 48, is about to give an address in which he is
widely expected to hit Republicans with everything short of a
window weight." -- During August 28 Democratic convention.<p>

    -- "The consensus in the hall is that Albert Gore has scored
with what Harry Caray, the famous Chicago baseball announcer,
might call a home run ball." -- Rather during CBS Democratic
convention coverage, August 28. <p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Dick Morris, Family Man</h3>

    Just a day before the Dick Morris prostitute story broke, USA
Today ran a profile. Susan Page's front page piece Wednesday
included this line: "He is a small man and a dapper dresser,
openly devoted to his no-nonsense wife."<p>


<h3>Moderate Liberalism</h3><p>

    Wednesday's New York Times insisted the Democratic Party
defined centrism, but the story listed some very liberal views.
The Democratic "platform takes a middle ground between the
unfettered capitalism and government-enforced morality es- poused
by Republicans and the welfare-state economics and Aquarian
values that once formed Democrats' image," reported David
Rosenbaum.<p>

    Four paragraphs later Rosenbaum summarized the "middle
ground" policies: "The Democrats call for government-paid
abortions for poor women, full civil rights for homosexuals, a
strong commitment to public schools, gun control, tobacco
regulations, a continuation of affirmative action programs and a
greater emphasis on environmental protection than on the
development of resources."<p>


<h3>Welfare Worries</h3><p>

    Clinton's promise to "fix" welfare reform didn't prompt
questions about his backing down on a promise. Instead, reporters
pressed from the left. On CBS last night Ed Bradley cornered U.S.
Rep. Ron Dellums: "I know you saw it not as welfare reform but
more as a budget cut. What does he have to do to fix it?" And,
"The President is expected to say tonight that he's going to
propose a $3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is
that enough?"<p>

<i>"We were just reminded in that moving film that we saw here of
your lifelong work as an advocate for children's causes. And yet,
late last week, your husband signed a welfare reform bill that as

August 26 interview</i><p> 

<center><h2><a name="Another">Another</a> Day of Questions from the Left
Liberal Delegates, But Party's Too Conservative</center></h2><p>

    Viewers of last night's network coverage could have learned
how Democratic delegates are outside the mainstream, but they
heard nothing about controversies like abortion, as the networks
again worried Clinton had gone too far right.<p>

    -- CBS and CNN attempted to make Hillary Clinton the martyr
of harsh San Diego attacks and ask her welfare questions from the
left. <p>

    -- Network reporters worried that the party has become too
conservative as they grilled Democrats for not opposing the
welfare reform bill. <p>

    -- ABC, CNN and PBS mentioned the liberal nature of the
delegates at least once, but not NBC or CBS in prime time. "We
know from our survey that these delgates are far to the left of
the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the
mainstream," ABC's Sam Donaldson declared last night. Unions also
got brief attention. Tom Brokaw referred to "a very unusually
high representation of labor down on the floor" and on CBS Dan
Rather also noted the labor angle.<p>

    -- Three networks mentioned tobacco funding of the
convention, but none noted the hypocrisy of Democrats taking
money from an industry they rail against. On CNN in prime time
Bill Schneider explained that the NRA and tobacco lobby are the
"least popular" special interests "and those are the two that the
Democrats are going to try to showcase as linked to the
Republican Party." On World News Tonight yesterday ABC's intrepid
Brian Ross cited a brunch cruise for delegates "put on by the
Brown and Williamson tobacco company" and how "Philip Morris has
the most extensive operation with the same group of back room
operatives who ran things in San Diego." NBC's Tom Brokaw
referred to a tobacco-sponsored event where delegates wore "Keep
the FDA off the farm" buttons. <p>

    -- Only two reporters questioned the authenticity of
Democratic claims to moderation. During the PBS-NBC joint
broadcast, Lisa Myers asked a delegate: "You have a President who
talks like a Republican, you have a platform that is so centrist
that some critics say it's a con job. Is this essentially,
though, a liberal party?" CNN's Judy Woodruff asked Bob Kerrey if
Clinton will go left after the election.<p>

    After scant attention Sunday, Democratic suppression of
abortion debate fell completely off TV screens.<P255D> In all of
Monday's prime time coverage no reporter or anchor raised the
topic, though Bob Casey, the pro-life former Governor of
Pennsylvania, gave a speech at another Chicago location on the
party's intolerance. <p>

<center><h2><a name="poor">CNN, CBS Ask First Lady About Harsh GOP Attacks, Welfare:
Poor Hillary, Wondering If It's Worth It</a></center></h2><p>

   In 1992, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff gave a soft convention
interview to Hillary Clinton in July, but blistered Barbara Bush
in August in Houston with a welter of accusatory questions about
the inappropriateness of Bush campaign tactics. On last night's
Inside Politics on CNN, Woodruff devoted her interview to
eliciting Hillary Clinton's responses to Republican attacks:<p>

    -- "Let me take you back to San Diego. Bob Dole said it
doesn't take a village, a collective, the state, which he said
has made mistakes in raising children, it takes a family. Is this
something that is going to become a major issue in this fall
campaign?"<p>

    -- "Also in San Diego, former president George Bush told the
delegates he `worked hard,' I'm quoting here, `to uphold the
dignity and the honor of the presidency, to treat it with
respect. And then he added, quote, `it breaks his heart, when the
White House is demeaned, the presidency diminished.' Does that
hurt coming from your immediate predecessor?"<p>

    -- "He then went on, Mrs. Clinton, he made a point of saying
that his wife, Mrs. Bush, quote, `unquestionably upheld the honor
of the White House.' Is that an insult to you?"<p>

    -- When Mrs. Clinton failed to answer sharply enough,
Woodruff insisted: "But he was clearly drawing a contrast
there...you're not hurt?"<p>

    Stories of Mrs. Clinton's rough-house approach to politics,
such as her reported role in firing and lodging criminal
accusations against seven workers of the White House Travel
Office, did not prevent CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart
from also presenting the First Lady as the beleaguered martyr of
unfortunate Republican attacks: <p>

    -- "In the San Diego Republican convention, you were the
subject of much conversation, and I think the target, I think
many would say, of some very serious attacks."<p>
 "Do you ever, seriously, in the White
House, when all the doors are closed, do you ever say `Is this
worth it'?"<p>

    Diaz-Balart also asked the First Lady two welfare questions
from the left: <p>

    -- "One thing you care very deeply about is children, and
even your supporters that work for children's rights have
criticized President Clinton's decision to okay the welfare
reform bill. What were your conversations with him when he was in
that period of really making a determination?"<p>

    -- "What would you say to the people in the Children's
Defense Fund [the liberal group she used to chair] who have
criticized it? What is your response to them?"<p>

    Woodruff also peppered the First Lady with welfare reform
questions, all six of them from the left. Here are three, another
is the quote of the day.<p>

    -- "Your close friend, Marian Wright Edelman of the
Children's Defense Fund, said the President's signing and this is
a quote, 'makes a mockery of his pledge not to hurt children,'
she said, 'it will leave a moral blot on his presidency and the
country that will never be forgotten.'"<p>

    -- "But if the bill is so flawed, why sign it? Why not work
to fix it, and sign it later?"<p>

    -- "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again
just now, said that much of the time she kept her disagreements
with the President to herself in private, but there were times
that she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there
ever come a time with you, and if not welfare reform, then what?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="networks">Democrats and Clinton Have Gone Too Far to the Right?
Networks Worry Democrats Not Liberal Enough</a></center></h2><p>

    Last night network correspondents worried how wise it has
been for Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party to have moved to
the right and, in so doing, abandoned their liberal princples.
Tom Brokaw placed the party, which fought Republican efforts to
slow the rate of growth of government, to the right of center.<p>

    -- During PBS-NBC coverage, Margaret Warner asked Andrew
Kohut of the Pew Research Center: "Does the President pay any
political price for turning his back on traditional liberalism,
that is, among enthusiasm among traditional Democrats?"<p>

    -- Later during NBC's solo time, Tom Brokaw interviewed VP Al
Gore and then observed to NBC's Tim Russert: "The Vice President
was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the Republicans,
we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first
place. But since 1994 they have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by the
name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to
be more pragmatic."<p>

    -- On CBS, Dan Rather asked Jesse Jackson: "Bill Clinton's
been running pretty hard to the right, so far that some Democrats
now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?" <p>

    -- Talking to Tom Hayden, Ed Bradley of CBS wondered:
"Senator Hayden, there are people who say the Democratic Party
has become very pragmatic in an effort to win this election,
they've given up their principles. Your response to that?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="For">For</a> Second Day, Focus is on Evils of Welfare Reform
"Slightly Terrified" of New Democrat Promises</h2></center><p>

    Just as on Sunday, last night the networks repeatedly pressed
Democrats from the left on Bill Clinton's signing of the welfare
reform bill. A PBS reporter wondered if it meant the dismantling
of the "safety net that took so long to put together."<p>

    -- CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Illinois Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun: "How does it feel, tell us, you voted against the
welfare reform bill, you're now obviously very supportive of the
President, tell us do you feel that he sort of betrayed some of
those values that you expressed. How can you go forward now and
support him after his decision to sign that welfare reform bill
into law?"<p>

    -- HHS Secretary Donna Shalala got it from the left during
PBS-NBC coverage as Tom Brokaw inquired: "If you were a poor
single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the
right things, but there aren't many jobs for people who have real
skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the next
two years?"<p>

    -- Earlier in the evening, Elizabeth Farnesworth of PBS
grilled White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes: "We're
looking tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are.
Did the President turn his back on fundamental Democratic
principles when he signed the welfare bill?" She also forwarded a
liberal argument: "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing
the welfare bill is unraveling the safety net that took so long
to put together?"<p>

    -- ABC's Jeff Greenfield highlighted bewilderment in network
ranks about the acceptance of Clinton's retreat from liberalism
on the issue. Interviewing Congressman Charles Rangel, he asked:
"Congressman it used to be said that when the Democrats make a
firing squad they form a circle, they love to rebel against an
incumbent President, and you have the welfare bill and the move
to the center. You're from one of the most liberal cities in the
country, why is the dog not barking in the night? Why are you
staying with the President given that discontent?" <p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></h2></center><p>

<h3>Harsh or Enthusiastic?</h3><p>

    Bill Clinton and Bob Dole attacked each other on Sunday, but
for CBS This Morning, only Bob Dole was harsh. Sandra Hughes
reported Monday: "Dole's big moment yesterday came when he
stormed Chicago, and launch-ed a harsh attack against the man of
the hour there, Bill Clinton." <p>

    But a few minutes earlier Bill Plante reviewed Clinton's
train trip, admiringly noting that "at each whistle stop Mr.
Clinton threw himself enthusiastically into campaign mode,
leaning deep into every crowd and lacing his remarks with
partisan fire." <p>

    So are the Democratic candidates avoiding harsh personal
attacks? On Good Morning America co-host Charlie Gibson asked
Senator Christopher Dodd: "You said the other day that `I got the
word out,' that I don't want to hear personal attacks against the
Republicans at this convention. Yesterday on his train trip the
President accused Republicans of blackmail to get their budget.
Al Gore, yesterday, accused the Republicans of ignorance and
audacity, talked about the two-headed monster of Dole and
Gingrich. Dick Gephardt, the leader of the House, of the
Democrats, talked about Republican extremism, said they're
radicals. Talk about getting the word out?"<p>


<h3>Gumbel's Gripe</h3><p>

    Monday Bryant Gumbel couldn't stop from taking one more shot
at Republicans for an image he helped create. Interviewing
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley on Today, he queried: "The
Republicans, as you know, took a lot of criticism for the
scripting of their convention and for presenting an image that
was contrary to their platform. How do you figure this convention
is going to be different?"<p>
<h3>Ignoring Casey's Case</h3><p>

    Former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, banned from the
Democratic convention podium for the second party gathering in a
row, gave an impassioned pro-life speech yesterday at Chicago's
Fischer Center. Despite a reported heavy media presence at his
speech (which he wanted to make at the convention), none of the
networks aired the Casey speech story on last night's evening
news shows. <p>

    In his new book Fighting For Life, Casey remembered the 1992
platform hearings: "There were many Democrats, I said, who
opposed our party's embrace of the radical pro-abortion lobby.
Often it seemed the Democratic National Committee had become
little more than an auxiliary of NARAL -- the National Abortion
Rights Action League."<p>

    On Monday's Nightline, ABC's Chris Bury gave Casey 15 seconds
of fame: "The Democrats in Chicago, like the Republicans in San
Diego, have tried to script any spontaneity right out of the
program. Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, whose strong
anti-abortion views defy the party's position, had to find
cameras outside the convention hall."<p>


<h3>At Hillary's Side</h3><p>

    As a CBS camera panned the United Center last night it came
upon a man standing beside Hillary Rodham Clinton. Dan Rather
identified him: "The gentleman in the dark suit to the right of
the frame, who was just framed out, Les Moonves of CBS. And the
chant takes up `four more years.' The lady, the First Lady from
Chicago with the smashing smile, is age 48. She and President
Clinton have been married for 20 years." Moonves's job with CBS?
President of the entertainment division.<p>

<center><h2>Media Research Center's Media Reality Check '96</h2>
<p>
<h3>Brokaw Attacks Clinton from Left</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 16, 1996
<p>
One item today: Tom Brokaw challenges President Clinton from
the left in the premiere of "Internight," the 8pm ET interviewshow on the new MSNBC cable network.
<p>
Here are two questions posed by Brokaw in his live July 15 interview:
<p>
    > Brokaw: "Let's talk for a moment about welfare. The
Republicans have a bill that they think you will sign, on the
Hill. It eliminates the federal guarantee of cash assistance for
poor children in this country, a guarantee that we've had in
place since the early 1930s. Are you prepared to have that
happen?"
<p>
    Clinton: "Depends on what else is in the bill."
<p>
    Brokaw: "But you can foresee the possibility that we'll take
away the ultimate safety net of no federal cash assistance to
very poor children?"
<p>
And a couple of segments later:
<p>
    Brokaw: "Mr. President, before we get back to the internet
questions, I wanted to follow up just for a moment on welfare if
I can. If in fact you sign the Republican bill that's likely to
come down from the Hill, all the projections show that that will
push, at least short term, more than a million youngsters in this
country below the poverty line. That's a high risk for youngsters
in this country who are already in peril."
<p>
Another network, another pile of bias to document. -- Brent

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><img src="/heritage/staff/pics/kickoff.gif"></center><p> 
<h3><center>Dr. Edwin J. Feulner Remarks for Town Hall Launch<br></h3>
<h4>June 29, 1995<br></h4></center>

<p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><p><b>[Town Hall President Tim Butler introduced Dr. Feulner]</b>

<p>Dr. Feulner:<p>
Thank you, Tim, for that kind introduction and welcome to all of you here today as we write another chapter in the unfolding and never-ending story that is democracy in our great nation.  We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, it has been created to serve people. To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue; an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who is interested.

<p>And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.

<p>Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families and communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.

<p>But in Thomas Jefferson's time, in the days of John Adams and Ben Franklin, communication was not a simple matter and so through print -- through the power of the written word -- the intellectual underpinnings of a revolution were laid.

<p>Two hundred years ago, the pamphlets of Tom Paine and so many others were the home pages of a network of idealists that became a movement... that became a revolution... that became a nation.

<p>Thomas Jefferson once wrote James Madison that a "little rebellion now and then is a good thing and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."  In 1994, the winds of political change once again blew across the land.

<p>I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation has been instrumental in creating Town Hall as <i>the</i> conservative meeting place on the Internet, but I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, we will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.

<p>On the Senate front, Bob Dole continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country. In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a leader -- a man of action and accomplishment.

<p>On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.

 <p>We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole and Speaker of the House -- Newt Gingrich.


<p>Thank you both for joining us.  We are all honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to conjure up someone who ought to know.  Please welcome the father of inventions, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.


<p>Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboard?


 <p>Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors?

<p>[Ben Franklin: <i>Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny; and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentleman, on a count of three.... one.... two.... three.... start your engines.</i> ]

<p>Feulner: Ladies and gentlemen, Town Hall is officially launched.


<p>Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, Mr. Franklin. Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations whose vision and creativity have spurred them to join this innovative effort.  I am very pleased to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.  As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall.
<p>

<ul><p>First, please welcome, David Keene, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/">American Conservative Union</a>.

<p>Next shades of the Boston tea party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.

<p>It is also a great pleasure to welcome the President of <a href="/empower/">Empower America</a> -- Bill Dal Col.

<p>Following Bill is Gary Bauer, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/">Family Research Council</a>. Welcome aboard, Gary.

<p>Next, Town Hall is privileged to house <a href="/lead-inst/">The Leadership Institute</a>, headed by Morton Blackwell.

<p>Now, one of our newest additions, Grace-Marie Arnett, Executive Director of the <a href="/taxcom/">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>.

<p>We are also delighted to have with us, <a href="/nmp">National Minority Politics</a> and its distinguished publisher, Willie Richardson.

<p>Following Willie is John O'Sullivan, Editor of <a href="/nationalreview>National Review</a> magazine.

<p>I am also very pleased to introduce the President of the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, Karen Kerrigan. Come on up, Karen.

<p>Next we are pleased to announce the addition of the <a href="/wash_times/">Washington Times National Weekly Edition</a> to the ranks of Town Hall and its Editor-in-Chief, Wes Pruden.

<p>Finally, I am very proud to welcome, the <a href="/yaf/">Young America's Foundation</a> and its president, Ron Robinson.</ul>

<p>It's a great starting line-up but only the beginning of a fast-growing community. Thank you all for being here today.

<p>I am now very happy to be able to give all of you the opportunity to hear from our two wonderful leaders here today. It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- Newt Gingrich.

<p><b>[Gingrich speaks]</b>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for those wonderful words.  It is my great privilege to introduce to you now the outstanding Majority Leader of the United States Senate -- Senator Robert Dole

<p><b>[Dole speaks]</b>

<p>We are honored that both of you have been with us today. Thank you for that great vote of confidence and thanks to all of you for coming today.

<p>You, too, are now a part of history but this historic day isn't over. As you see, we have terminals set up for any or all of you to try your hand at surfing the Net, and there are Town Hall Net guides available to help you navigate uncharted waters.

<p>Also, this afternoon there will be a lecture series featuring a number of conservative and industry leaders followed by question and answer periods. We hope you'll take advantage of this opportunity to begin the debate. Thanks again for coming, and I hope we'll be talking soon -- at <a href="/townhall/welcome.html.cgi">www.townhall.com</a>.

<i>"You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the
needs and cares of the people. Now, how do you reconcile that
with a President who has just signed a quote 'welfare reform
bill' which by general agreement is going to put a lot of poor
children on the street?"<p>
-- Dan Rather to Chris Dodd during an
interview on the August 25 CBS Evening News</i><p>


<center><h2><a name="Weekend">Weekend</a> Shows Fail to Apply GOP Level of Scrutiny
Democrats Not Portrayed as Intolerant, Extreme</h2></center><p>

    Unlike Republicans two Sundays ago, Democrats yesterday did
not come under assault from the networks over their intolerance
on abortion. While the subject was raised a few times, the
networks spent more time raising liberal criticisms of the
welfare reform bill President Clinton just signed. Findings from
weekend coverage:<p>

    -- Democrats faced about one-third as many questions about
abortion and the exclusion of dissenting speakers. Two weeks ago,
the Sunday morning shows asked 27 questions about the GOP split
on abortion and the failure to allow Gov. Pete Wilson to speak.
Interviewers asked only 10 questions yesterday, perhaps because
unlike inviting pro-choice Wilson and pro-life Bay Buchanan weeks
before, pro-life Democrats like Gov. Bob Casey were not booked,
despite Casey's Friday Wall Street Journal op-ed attacking the
"intolerance" of a "gag rule party." CNN's Late Edition asked
only two questions, compared to 11 posed to the GOP; NBC's Meet
the Press asked six questions, compared to nine for the GOP.
ABC's This Week with David Brinkley had two questions instead of
four, and CBS's Face the Nation offered zero abortion questions,
compared to three in San Diego.<p>
 
    -- No mention of corporate contributions to the Democratic
convention, not even of the hypocrisy of accepting funds from
tobacco companies while Clinton attacks them with rhetoric and
new regulations. Two weeks ago on Meet the Press, David Broder
twice asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour about the hypocrisy of
accepting corporate money for the convention while promising
campaign finance reform. On the Friday, August 23 World News
Tonight, however, ABC's Brian Ross did do a story on the top ten
corporate contributors to the DNC, including "a labor union under
federal investigation for its ties to the mafia."<p>

    -- No questions were posed about how unions have taken over
the Democratic Party. A Washington Post survey of Democratic
delegates found 34 percent belong to a union. Friday's Wall
Street Journal noted that "more than 400 delegates -- roughly one
in ten -- will be members of the National Education Association."
But that failed to generate questions about who controls the
party. <p>

    Only 21 percent of GOP delegates said they were part of the
religious right, but in San Diego CBS worried about their having
too much influence. On Sunday August 11, Face the Nation guests
got five ominous questions. "There are a number of Republicans
who are very uncomfortable with what they feel is the power, the
control that the conservative religious right has. Are you
concerned about that?" CBS reporter Phil Jones asked Texas
Governor George W. Bush.<p>

    -- Democrats called too conservative, charged from the left
with going too far on welfare reform.



<center><h2><a name="Just">Just</a> as in San Diego, Networks Attack from the Left
Network Stars Line Up for Welfare Status Quo</center></h2><p>

    The networks came at Republicans from the left on abortion in
San Diego, and on Sunday they also came at Democrats from the
left. By concentrating on liberal complaints about welfare
reform, reporters helped Bill Clinton's effort to portray himself
as a centrist. Dan Rather wondered if the party had gone "too far
to the right?"<p>

    -- Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal set the tone of liberal
anger on Saturday night's CNN Capital Gang: "Jesse Jackson and a
few others will complain and I think a majority of the delegates
here privately agree with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that
supporters of this bill, quote, 'will take this disgrace to their
graves,' end quote. They know Bill Clinton put his own political
interests ahead of the well being of little children." <p>

    --  Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert demanded of DNC
General Chairman Chris Dodd: "It's an issue of morality to many
people, and how can you defend a President who basically said to
the Congressional Democrats: Listen, that's your view, but I'm
doing this, because -- was it politically expedient?"<p>

    -- Talking with Democratic strategist James Carville later in
the show, Russert reminded viewers that he once toiled for former
New York Governor Mario Cuomo: "But the Democratic Party for
sixty years, James Carville, fought for a minimum guarantee
payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that. Don't you
have to draw the line someplace and say 'I'm a Democrat and this
is what I stand for'?"<p>

    -- On yesterday's Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver
asked Chicago Mayor Richard Daley: "The party looks a lot more
united right now. But we have a sense that there are some
underlying divisions and particularly this week with the
President signing a welfare bill that a lot of people think is
going to put children into poverty. And I guess the question is
that in a city like this, aren't you scared about what is going
to happen? Aren't you afraid you are going to have a lot of
hungry children?"<p>

    -- Minutes later while interviewing Indiana Governor Evan
Bayh, Braver pictured the Democrats as being too conservative: "I
just wondered what you think is the really big difference between
the Democrats and Republicans in this election? What would make
people go Democrat when it seems like the Democrats are moving so
close to Republican positions?"<p>

    --  Last night Dan Rather joined the chorus, inquiring of
Braver on the CBS Evening News: "Rita, how worried are the
Democrats about protests from some here that the party is running
too far to the right, particularly on welfare reform?"  <p>

<center><h2><a name="Benchmarks">Benchmarks for the Week to Come:</a>
A Look Back at San Diego</center></h2><p>

    Before the networks begin their prime time coverage in
Chicago, here's a brief summary of how they covered the
Republican convention in San Diego. <p>

    -- Labeling. Republican delegates, speakers, and candidates
were described as conservative more than three times as often as
moderate, but reporters also used more extreme labels than
moderate labels. The networks employed 46 conservative labels
(including 16 references to extreme conservatism) to only 13
moderate labels.<p>

    -- Agenda of Questions. Reporters posed more than seven times
as many questions from the liberal agenda as they did from a
conservative agenda: 51 questions from the left, compared to only
six questions from the right.<p>

    -- Controversies. Reporters referred to the Republican
Party's split on the abortion issue, including Gov. Pete Wilson's
"disinvitation" to speak, on 55 occasions in prime time. In 1992,
the Democrats' spiking of Gov. Bob Casey surfaced only six times
(once on NBC, five times on CNN). ABC and CBS never acknowledged
the Casey flap.<p>


<center><h2><a name="Sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Unpopular Koppel</h3><p>

Most people think Ted Koppel was wrong to leave the Republican
convention early, a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll found. On
yesterday's Fox News Sunday, host Tony Snow reported that when
asked if Koppel was "justified in leaving," 52 percent said no,
31 percent responded yes and 16 percent were undecided. On
Tuesday of the GOP gathering, Koppel announced Nightline would
leave because "this convention is more infomercial than a news
event." <p>


<h3>Moderate" Democrats?</h3><p>

"Return to Chicago: This Time, the Democrats Embrace Moderation"
declared the headline on the front of the Sunday Washington
Post's convention section. Four pages later the Post headline
over a story on a survey of delegates read: "Delegates Leaning
More Liberal Than Their Leader or the Rank and File." Indeed, 82
percent favor affirmative action, 65 percent are against a
balanced budget amendment, 72 percent oppose "reducing spending
on social programs," but 65 percent want less defense spending.<p>


<h3>Hillary the Revolutionary</h3><p>

Sam Donaldson identified Hillary Clinton's problem on yesterday's
This Week with David Brinkley: "I think much of the opposition to
Hillary Rodham Clinton is the fact that she is a strong-willed
woman doing things in a man's arena, and we men don't seem to
like that." <p>
After George Will pointed out that politics is the arena of many
women, from Margaret Thatcher to Indira Gandhi, Cokie Roberts
retorted that she's been an "agent of change" and "it's very
difficult for the world to accept people who have been
revolutionaries."<p>

Baden</P><P>IT is easy to understand why some people find banning private log exports an attractive idea. Superficially, it appears to save jobs, reduce domestic timber prices and slow environmental degradation caused by logging. But there are good, ethical reasons why a ban makes little sense. In later columns, I will discuss the likely economic and environmental consequences of a ban.</P><P>       Government exists to promote harmony and foster prosperity. These goals are hard to attain if political power is used to strip some people of their property to benefit others. Such actions eventually hurt everyone for they erode the foundations of a free society. When property is taken for legitimate public purposes, owners should be compensated for their losses. This is not to happen if private tree farms are prohibited from selling logs abroad. The prohibition surely feels like plunder to those who may suffer it.</P><P>     Protection from political coercion must remain our paramount concern even if raw log exports cost a significant number of Northwest jobs, a far from certain outcome. Liberals and conservatives who understand the social value of the market process understand this. A productive and cooperative social order requires property rights that are secure from arbitrary seizure or reduction in value. Even if a ban on the export of private timber would save jobs, the process it legitimizes leads to increasing conflict and to ethical erosion in relationships among citizens.</P><P>     Some politicians face strong incentives to prohibit timber owners from selling their logs to foreigners. They seek political gain by playing on people's fears that global commerce means the loss of jobs and security. Politicians flirt with a destructive game when they try to generate campaign contributions and electoral support by favoring one group or person at another's expense. Yet, average citizens remain unaware of the unintended consequences of these actions.</P><P>     Opportunistic behavior, not compassion, explains the export ban. This is no accident. In politics, duplicity accompanies opportunism and honorable behavior is a severe liability. Honorable politicians are like vegetarian coyotes in that they face a great handicap when competing with their red-meat opponents.</P><P>     Although many of us are disgusted with pork-barrel politics, we often reward our representatives with re-election when they secure our pork. Congress loses respect but our representative is well-regarded. It is easy to rationalize socially destructive behavior by someone we know well. People often see their representative as a good person who must compete in an institution where principles are a liability. The institution brings out their worst and causes many to flee national politics.</P><P>     Everyone has good reason to oppose political opportunism. The reason is simple: Politicians who will steal for you will also steal from you. History shows that politicians are rarely bought, but often rented until someone is willing to pay more. This is why it is so important to reward politicians who are true to their principles. (And why so many of us are offended by the hypocrisy of &quot;conservatives&quot; who advocate governmental subsidies for the rich.) When government can arbitrarily constrain property rights and freedom to trade on our own terms, no one is safe. Even if intentions are pure and ends legitimate (e.g., saving jobs), relying on coercion to impose an uncompensated loss is neither ethical nor wise.</P><P>     In economics as in ecology, we can never do just one thing. We cannot predict the mischief that will arise to confound our intentions when we use politics to generate private benefits for one by taking from another, e.g., taking markets from owners of private timber. The more government becomes the granter of special opportunities and special privileges, the more people will seek them from government. And they always come at others' expense.</P><P>     An export ban may preserve jobs in timber processing while destroying those in shipping. It may even harm Northwest mill workers as disinvestment occurs and private timber investment shifts to the Southeast and abroad. More generally, we create an environment in which no one's property, income, or job is safe when we legitimize transferring resources among citizens by stripping or attenuating the property rights of one group to benefit another. We create the Founding Fathers' nightmare: a political economy of plunder.</P><P>     When constitutional protections of individual rights and limits on government power are respected, they serve us admirably. These protections - embodied in the takings, contract and commerce clauses, provisions for impartial trials, and the safeguards in the Bill of Rights and later amendments - are designed to shield us from the predations of government. The U.S. Constitution was designed to foster a political economy of justice with respect for other's possessions. Society becomes less civil and less productive when we stray from this design.</P><P>     The ban on log exports would cause economic and environmental harm. This is important and I'll discuss these problems in my next column. But most of all, the ban violates fundamental ethical principles that underlie our Constitution and our nation. Arbitrarily taking something of value from one group and giving it to another can only undermine liberty and security. The export ban may be good short-term politics but it is pregnant with mischief.</P><P>__________ </P><P> John A.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>16. What is FRC's position on the Legal Services 
Corporation?</h2></center>

<p>

To protect American families and businesses from frivolous, damaging
litigation and to end the annual waste of millions in taxpayer
dollars, FRC believes that the Legal Services Corporation should
be defunded.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> The complete defunding of the Legal Services
Corporation.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The Legal Services Corporation
was founded in 1965 with the purpose of expanding welfare benefits
to the poor through test cases and impact litigation.  That and
much more occurred as the program was commandeered by left-wing
lawyers with anti-family agendas.

<p>

The family is the foundation of society, yet in case after case
LSC has attempted to make the individual, instead of the family,
the basic unit of welfare policy.  This goal undermines the family
by replacing parents (especially fathers) with welfare programs
and discouraging self-reliance in favor of federally-funded dependency.

<p>

Examples of legal services' hostility to the family are legion.
They include:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1994, the National Center for Youth Law, a major LSC grantee,
played a key role in overturning California's parental consent
law on abortion.

<p>

<li>In 1993, Karla and Leland Swenson were forced to sell their
home to fight the Idaho Legal Aid Society's effort to seek custody
of their adopted son for the sister of the boy's biological father.
Neither of the boy's biological parents was seeking custody.

<p>

<li>In 1995, Lehigh Valley Legal Services of Pennsylvania tried
to give a teenage rapist custody of a child he fathered by his
rape of a 13-year-old even though a psychologist concluded he
would endanger the child.

<p>

<li>Also in 1995, Legal Services of Greater Miami joined forces
with the ACLU and homosexual activists to fight for a homosexual
couple's bid to adopt a child.

</ul><p>

Congress has already called for LSC's phasing out by 1998, starting
with a 30 percent funding cut for fiscal 1996 from $400 million
to $283.5 million.  In addition, several restrictions have been
placed on LSC, prohibiting its grantees from filing class-action
lawsuits except with the approval of the Corporation.

<p>

Legal services lawyers will no longer be allowed to represent
prisoners, illegal aliens, and public housing residents being
evicted for drug-related crimes.

<p>

Unfortunately, restrictions can be circumvented.  Several grantees
have already set up new groups to receive LSC grants while using
non-federal or private grants to carry out continued assaults
on the family.  The inclusion of the Cohen amendment in the omnibus
spending bill was a victory for LSC.  It allows grantees to comment
on legislation as well as become involved in legislative rulemaking
-- a major loophole for legal services lawyers to engage in lobbying
activities.  As these incidents show, nothing short of the outright
abolition of LSC will solve the problem.

<p>

The private bar can and must assume responsibility for meeting
the needs of poor Americans for legal services not covered by
public defender programs across the United States.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Defunding the Legal Services Corporation will
provide protection to the American family, slow the expansion
of the welfare state, and cut federal spending by billions of
dollars over the long-term.  It will help get politically-motivated
&quot;public interest&quot; lawyers off Americans' backs and shift
power and money back to local governments -- and the American
people.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>25. What is FRC's position on the United Nations' Convention
on the Rights of the Child?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child
poses threats to the institution of the family.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> No U.S. ratification of the U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The United Nations was created
in 1945 in the shadow of the Second World War as an attempt by
the victorious democracies to establish an international body
to safeguard the peace and promote human rights.  The U.N. has
attempted to give voice to the common aspirations of the world's
people.  In the past two decades, however, the U.N. has expanded
its agenda in ways that pose direct threats to the traditional
family.

<p>

Among the most threatening is the U.N. Convention of the Rights
of the Child, which was approved by the U.N. General Assembly
in 1989.  One prominent theme from the Convention is the notion
that children ought to be protected from the power of their parents.
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
For example, Article 12 grants children &quot;the right to express
views freely in all matters.&quot;  Would Article 12 permit parents
to restrict their children from getting tattoos, or talking back
to authority figures?  Article 15 guarantees children the &quot;freedom
of association.&quot;  One can envision a law that prevents parents
from restricting a child's choice of friends.  Conceivably, Article
14's freedom of religion could prevent a parent from taking a
child to church when he would rather not go.  Under Article 13,
a child has the right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information.&quot;
There are no exceptions to this right, not even for parents who
would like to keep pornography from their children.

<p>

The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, signed the
treaty in 1995, and it will become law in this country if the
Senate ratifies it by a two-thirds vote.  The required vote in
the Senate does not seem likely now, because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
In fact, Sen. Helms has introduced a Senate Resolution which
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators have co-sponsored this resolution.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> As an international treaty, the U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child would be co-equal with federal statutes,
and possibly the United States Constitution.  If the United States
were to ratify the treaty as it stands, it would become not only
an international obligation, but also a domestic obligation potentially
regulating the most intimate details of American family life.

BADEN</P><P>           THE Shoshone National Forest near Dubois, Wyo., is an important part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. But the forest has maintained a money-losing logging program. In any rational system, the ecological, recreation, watershed and wildlife values would easily trump logging in the Shoshone.</P><P>       Even the purely economic cost of logging the Shoshone exceed the benefits. In 1991, for example, the Forest Service lost $557,000 on the Shoshone while selling 13,000,000 board feet of timber. If we include road and other associated costs, some of which the Forest Service ignores entirely, the losses go up to $1,857,000. Since timber likes to grow where it's warm, wet and low, and the Shoshone is high, dry and cold, these losses cannot be corrected by more efficient management. Rather, fundamental reform is in order. A recent event inspires such reform.</P><P>       Stephen Gordon ranches near the Shoshone and grazes cattle on its lands. He recently sent the Forest Service a $100,000 check as a down payment for rights to a timber sale in the Shoshone's Brent Creek drainage. But with rights to the timber he would keep it standing, not cut it. He pledged an additional $200,000 and agreed to replenish his federal grazing permits in favor of wildlife. Further, to benefit wildlife habitat, he offered to donate a conservation easement on his ranch to the government. All this if only the Forest Service would agree to forgo a money-losing sale.</P><P>     Both the Wyoming Fish and Game Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service urged the Forest Service not to cut the drainage, saying that it is a critical migration corridor for elk and important to the Yellowstone grizzly population.</P><P>     But the Forest Service returned Gordon's check. It did not offer an economic rationale for rejecting his offer. Nor did it dispute that the area was critical wildlife habitat. District Ranger Brent Larson replied that Gordon proposed &quot;creation of a de facto wilderness area. We can't do that.&quot; The Forest Service saw their multiple-use mission as requiring that they provide logs to local mills even when other values are much higher.</P><P>     The Forest Service budget is increased when it interprets multiple use as a mandate to lose money and sacrifice habitat. It has become a parasitic bureaucracy. Its arcane budgeting and decision-making process are governed by a political calculus that dominates economic and ecological standards.</P><P>     Can we imagine new institutional arrangements that are sensitive to changing values and open to scientific findings? Could we design an organization that would responsibly weigh the costs and benefits of alternative actions? Can we accommodate offers like Gordon's?</P><P>       When dealing with political economy, we should separate hopes from expectations. With this cautionary note, I propose that we build upon our centuries of common-law experience and create a Shoshone Biodiversity Trust. Like a museum, nonprofit hospital or private college, the trust would be run by a board of trustees, respected and knowledgeable volunteers who accept fiduciary responsibility. The trust's sole purpose would be to manage the former national forest land, land that did not support a viable timber industry but was logged at a loss due to political pressures.</P><P>     Environmental scientists and local, regional and national leaders could comprise the board. The trust would be granted a charter by Congress and would have to act within the confines of this charter, obeying previously established wilderness designations and protecting proscribed riparian areas. Beyond that, it would be free to set its own course.</P><P>     Each forest endowment board would run solely on its own revenues. No more federal handouts. Each would have access to a full array of income-generating mechanisms: grazing permits, recreation fees, gifts and even timber sales where they made economic and ecological sense. The board would return 25 percent of revenue from recreation or commodities to counties and local communities, just as the Forest Service now does.</P><P>       The remainder could be used in any way that furthered the trust's mission. It could study wildlife populations, maintain trails, buy more land or buy winter range for wildlife. If this experiment is successful it may be replicated on other forests. Some would likely promote intensive recreation uses, such as mountain biking, while others might focus on primitive recreation and wilderness areas.</P><P>     Entrepreneurship exists in the nonprofit as well as the for-profit world, The Nature Conservancy and the North American Elk Foundation are highly successful examples. These organizations creatively respond to new interests and understandings. A Shoshone Biodiversity Trust can follow their lead. With such trusts we can better preserve shared values, allowing each forest to fulfill its mission and maintain its ecological endowment.</P><P>_______________</P><P> John A.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>20. What is FRC's opinion of pornography?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC strongly opposes pornography, especially child pornography.
Pornography has a corrupting influence on individuals, turns
natural desires into unnatural cravings, and reduces human beings
to anonymous tools for the stimulation and gratification of those
cravings.

<p>

Contrary to a widespread perception, pornography no longer consists,
if it ever did, primarily of soft air-brushed photos of smiling
young women in various states of undress, or of movies depicting
cheerful, consensual coupling.  Exploiting the phenomenon of customer
desensitization, today's pornographers have turned to themes such
as bondage, mutilation, torture, bestiality, and others.

<p>

Does pornography contribute to rape, battery, and child molestation?
Supporters of pornography say it does not, but the evidence suggests
otherwise:  studies have shown that exposure to pornography
leads to a generalized predisposition toward violent and sexual
acts.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>29. What is FRC's position on informed consent for women's
reproductive health decisions?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that women have the right to be fully informed about
both immediate and future risks to their physical and emotional
health, especially with regards to induced abortion.

<p>

<b>Actions Needed:</b> (1) Require that all health care professionals,
especially counselors and practitioners working in family planning
clinics and public health departments, effectively communicate
to their patients or &quot;clients&quot; the risks involved in
abortion, e.g., the increased risk of breast cancer for women
who have abortions.  (2) Require that all abortion clinics (as
well as other medical facilities offering abortions) perform an
ultrasound exam on abortion-minded women in order to (a) confirm
pregnancy and (b) to educate the woman about what the abortion
procedure entails. (3) Require post-abortion counseling centers
or other physicians to be integrated within protocol in order
to achieve true informed consent.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> It is routine public health practice
that patients be informed of all their risks before undergoing
a medical procedure or receiving medication of any kind.  However,
while technology has rapidly advanced and more data have been
acquired in the field of women's reproductive health, the abortion
industry and family planning clinics have not been regulated to
the same degree as hospitals and other health care facilities.
As a result, it is dubious that women are truly receiving all
the information they need to make fully informed decisions about
their reproductive health.

<p>

For example, women are currently not advised of the possibility
that induced abortion increases their risk of breast cancer, especially
if they have borne no other children to full term.  And yet, there
are more than 20 epidemiologic studies spanning the last two decades
which show a link between abortion (induced or spontaneous) and
breast cancer.  Indeed, the prestigious <I>Journal of the National
Cancer Institute</I> published a 1994 study which found that women
who have had an abortion before age 18 are 150 percent more likely
to develop breast cancer.  Women who have had an abortion after
age 30 increase their risk of breast cancer by 110 percent, and,
regardless of age, abortion increases the risk of breast cancer
by 50 percent.  With approximately 1.5 million abortions taking
place in the United States every year, 40 percent of which are
repeat abortions, and with one in every nine American women developing
breast cancer in their lifetimes, it is remarkable and highly
unethical that women are not informed of such risks.

<p>

In addition, there is ample evidence to suggest that many women
undergoing abortion suffer from post-abortion grief or trauma.
Indeed, support groups such as Project Rachel and organizations
such as American Victims of Abortion exist because of the emotional
scars post-abortive women bear.  Yet women are not being informed
of their risk of experiencing post-abortion grief nor are referrals
to any of the aforementioned organizations being given as part
of the typical abortion clinic's protocol.

<p>

Furthermore, achieving true informed consent becomes even more
important as several abortion clinics are currently using new
experimental abortifacients, such as the off-label usage of the
anti-cancer drug methotrexate in combination with the prostaglandin
cytotec.  Neither of these drugs is approved for the use of abortion,
yet several abortionists are regularly offering these drugs to
their patients, even though there is little research available
to prove their safety or efficacy.

<p>

Beyond providing appropriate counseling regarding abortion's physical
and emotional risks, abortion clinics should also be required
to give each abortion-minded woman an ultrasound exam in order
to confirm pregnancy and better explain the abortion procedure
to the woman.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Achieving true informed consent will (1) require
abortion clinic counselors to devote more time to each counseling
session, (2) require abortion clinics to purchase ultrasound equipment
and employ staff who are knowledgeable in operating the ultrasound,
(3) require that the most up-to-date research on the safety and
efficacy of abortion techniques, the physical and emotional risks
involved with abortion, and information about post-abortion grief
organizations are available for all clients.  Abortion clinics
will also need to come under the jurisdiction of a medical regulatory
agency in order to make certain that they are adhering to the
standards of true informed consent outlined above.  While these
regulations will require providers of abortion to alter their
practices, the standards are absolutely necessary to achieve the
overriding goal of protecting women's health and giving women
all the information they need to make an informed choice.

<CENTER><H2>Letting Government Polluters off the Hook</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
For reporters, industry is always the polluter; government is always the 
protector. When it's government programs, such as subsidies for pesticide-using 
farmers, that encourage pollution, reporters are silent.
<P>
Robert Hager's August 8 NBC Nightly News story was a case in point. He began: 
"The purity of the water we drink, the air we breathe, the food we eat. For two 
decades the Environmental Protection Agency has led the clean-up." From 
corporations pouring dioxin into the Great Lakes to protection of wetlands, 
"which prevent flooding and permit wildfowl to breathe." According to Hager, 
House efforts to rein in the EPA would bring "the first big slowdown in 
environmental clean-up since the 1970s."
<P>
But what if the government is the culprit? Take the Everglades. As Jonathan 
Tolman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) points out, the U.S. sugar 
program, by subsidizing sugar production, is responsible for much of "the 
increased phosphorus contamination of the Everglades which is disrupting the 
unique nature of the ecosystem." Tolman also lit into the USDA peanut program, 
which not only "costs consumers $500 million a year in higher peanut prices," 
but increases pesticide use by permitting peanuts to be grown in just a handful 
of counties.
<P>
Elimination of farm subsidies has been advocated by environmentalists of all  
political stripes, from the free-market CEI to the liberal Wilderness Society. 
Only reporters are letting government off the hook.

<p>
<h3>More Hate Radio; Dole Fuels "Racial Divides"</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 12, 1996 
<p>
Four items today:
<ul>
<li>A Time magazine reporter attributes the First Lady's problems
not to any wrongdoing but to the fact that "Mrs. Clinton has
changed the role of First Lady."
<li>Eleanor Clift charges that the evil "right-wing mafia" are
fueling "hate radio."
<li>Newsweek's Joe Klein finds a bright spot in the public's lack
of concern over controversies dogging the Clintons: It may lead
to the end of such distracting scandal-mongering. 
<li>NBC portrays Bob Dole's lack of appearance at the NAACP
convention as "an insult to African-American voters" which "may
reinforce...racial divides along party lines."
<p>
> 1) This quote was picked up by MRC analyst Gene Eliasen fromthe June 28 Washington Week in Review. Time magazine Washingtonreporter Michael Duffy thinks the First Lady is surrounded bycontroversy because she's doing so much more: "I also think thatMrs. Clinton has changed the role of First Lady so much, youknow, by getting so involved and so active and paid such a highprice for it."
<p>
> 2) Appearing on CNN's Larry King Live on Monday July 1,
Eleanor Clift offered this explanation as to who is to blame for 
the Gary Aldrich book: "One thing we haven't really mentioned is
the people who are surrounding Mr. Aldrich and in fact they are
members of what I would call the right-wing mafia. I mean they
were there for Paula Jones and they are fueling a lot of what we
hear on hate radio." MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens found thatquote.
<p>
> 3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this conclusion to
Newsweek Senior Editor Joe Klein's July 8 piece on filegate: "But
if Clinton does survive this pounding, it may mean the revulsion
against the `-gate' phenomenon -- 20 years of ever-diminishing
scandals -- is now more intense than the disgust caused by any
individual charge. If so, it would be the President's most
memorable public service." 
<p>
    Funny how he didn't feel that way until the scandals hit a
Democratic President.
<p>
    > 4) After summarizing Bill Clinton's attack on Dole over the
assault weapons ban, on the July 10 NBC Nightly News reporter Jim
Miklaszewski proceeded to review the controversy over Bob Dole
not addressing the NAACP convention. Here's the last two-thirds
of his Wednesday night story as transcribed by MRC intern Jessica Anderson:
<p>
Miklaszewski: "No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as
no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to speak to the
convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he was already
committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball game. To those
at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<p>
[Woman at NAACP convention: "When you want to be President of the
United States of America, you cannot afford to write any American
off."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Back in Washington, Dole's Democratic critics had
a field day."
<p>
[Rep. John Conyers, Jr., (D) Michigan: "He's saying, 'I don't
care about the black vote in November,' and I think that the
black vote in November will not care about him."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "That already appears to be the case. The latest
NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton has a lock on the
African-American vote; only five percent would vote for Bob Dole.
[On-screen visual shows Clinton with 87 percent and Dole with
five percent, plus or minus seven percentage points.] But even
Colin Powell believes that Dole should have made an appearance."
<p>
[Gen. Colin Powell (Ret.): "I wish he didn't have a scheduling
conflict. I think it would have been useful for him to present
his views to the NAACP."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "It would have been a tough crowd."
<p>
[Anonymous man: "I think he made the right move he didn't come
because perhaps he might get booed."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Nevertheless, by not showing up here, Bob Dole may
reinforce those racial divides along party lines and fuel the
anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential campaign
Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC
News, Charlotte."
<p>
So, when Bill Clinton fails to address a Christian Coalition
convention that's an insult to all Christians? -- Brent Baker

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>10. How does FRC believe we can improve the public education
system in America?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that America must restore decision-making authority
over school policy and finance to parents, locally elected school
boards and taxpayers, relieving them of the layers of bureaucracy
that hinder education renewal.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> The federal role in education, now amounting
to several hundred programs, should be terminated and the billions
of dollars spent annually returned to taxpayers.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Education has been traditionally
-- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.
But since the U.S. Education Department was created in 1979,
it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand
its range and influence.  Today, more than 760 education programs
exist in 39 federal agencies, totalling $120 billion in annual
expenditures.

<p>

A new height of federal intrusion into local education was reached
with the passage of Goals 2000 in 1994.  Goals 2000 prescribes
to states how they will run their educational systems and meddles
in their curricular issues by creating national standards and
assessments.  But Goals 2000 also pushes a liberal social agenda,
covering everything from prenatal health care systems to mandatory
community service to comprehensive health education.

<p>

Goals 2000 must be repealed as the first step toward restoring
local schools in America.  Republicans in the 104th Congress demonstrated
their commitment to eliminating wasteful, inappropriate federal
programs and to improving education by seeking to end Goals 2000.
The House voted to eliminate funding for the program in FY '96,
and the House Budget Committee resolved to do so again for FY '97.

<p>

As control has been seized by the centralized education bureaucracy,
local apathy has increased, just as Alexis de Tocqueville predicted
over 150 years ago.  Liberals seek to dictate parental and community
involvement in education through federal law, ignoring the fact
that their own cumbersome programs choke off any meaningful participation.

<p>

Only when the federal role in education is ended will we see a
revitalization of the community involvement that characterized
schools before the advent of the education bureaucracy.   The
proposal to free schools from federal control received a hearty
response in the 104th Congress, where some 120 members of the
House sponsored the Back-to-Basics bill, the first concerted effort
to shut down the U.S. Education Department bureaucracy in the
last decade.

<p>

As part of their freedom to participate fully in their children's
education, parents should be permitted to choose a safe and effective
public, private, religious or home school.  When parents freely
choose the kind of education they seek for their children, employers
will get the qualified employees they want, and policymakers will
see the healthy schools they envision coming to life as a result
of competition.

<p>

Blaise Pascal told us that seeking to obtain by one means what
can only be achieved by another is tyranny.  We have witnessed
in the past three decades an ever-expanding attempt to solve educational
problems from Washington, D.C.  The resulting nationalization
of education has only exacerbated the problems of local schools.
Parents, teachers and schools must be freed from the burdens
of the federal education bureaucracy.  Only then will America
experience the educational renewal that will keep this nation
a leader in the 21st century world.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The elimination of the federal role in education
will allow state and local education to flourish without regulatory
bondage, reestablish the authority of parents and taxpayers over
education, and bring about the education renewal parents desire
and their children need for future success.  Tax relief will allow
families to increase their buying power for current educational
services and to save for future educational needs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>26. Does FRC support the adoption of a $500 per child tax
credit for every American family with children?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC supports the adoption of a $500 per child tax credit for every
American family with children.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> FRC has been calling on Congress
to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average
family of four contributes nearly 25 cents on every dollar in
income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government -- this
is compared to two cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of
this, the per child tax credit was designed to help offset the
extraordinary erosion in per child income tax benefits over the
last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief
should be a top priority in the ensuing debate in Congress and
in the presidential debates.  The $500 per child tax credit was
vetoed by President Clinton as part of the balanced budget package.
FRC believes that per child tax relief should be the centerpiece
of any tax reform package.

<p>

Many critics and lukewarm supporters have expressed concern about
offsetting the revenues lost to such tax cuts.  In recent years,
the Heritage Foundation and others have developed ways to offset
generous pro-family tax relief with significant cuts in federal
spending programs.  These proposals have considerable merit --
as do proposals which would seek to offset the &quot;cost&quot;
of pro-family tax relief over the long haul by raising the retirement
age for various federal entitlement programs.

<p>

Streamlining government and permitting families to keep more of
their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing
purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy
and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax
relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the
budget and make government more efficient.  Of course, pro-family
tax relief also sends to families the message that their dedication
to their children is invaluable to America, as they are the next
generation of American citizens.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Tax relief for families with children will strengthen
the American home and its finances, place real limits on the growth
of government and its wrongheaded attempts to redirect family
life, and underscore that the best &quot;investment&quot; in children
is made by mothers and fathers who, indeed, &quot;know best.&quot;

rhetorical gambles here, where Bob Dole may have taken the
risk of coming across more as the preachy grandfather than
the grown-up he most wants to be, and that could turn off
some voters." <p>

-- ABC s Michel McQueen just after Dole's
acceptance speech last night.<p></i>
  
<h2><a name="speech">Dole's Speech</a> Performance Praised by Most, But... 
ABC: Dole s "A Preachy Grandfather"</h2></center>
  
    Bob Dole speech coverage featured praise for his delivery,
but the networks were critical of its content. <p>
  
    -- ABC condemned it as "preachy," and NBC called it "tough."
Just after Dole finished, ABC's Michel McQueen warned that he
may have come across as a "preachy grandfather" [see Quote of
the Day below]. Sam Donaldson called it "a red meat speech"
and a "a very tough speech, I mean, Bob Dole says that
violent criminals will have their lives made a living Hell,
he'd pursue terrorists to the ends of the Earth, I think he s
going to dash the teachers  unions into the sea." NBC's Lisa
Myers described it as "the best speech I ever saw Bob Dole
give," but colleague David Bloom said "this was a very tough
speech, Bob Dole calling himself combative for country, but
the people down here, the partisans loved it."<p>
  
    -- CNN went to Wolf Blitzer for a Democratic response just
four minutes after Dole finished. Gene Randall then demanded
Dole campaign manager Scott Reed respond to that spin: "Let
me just run by first what George Stephanopoulos said about
the speech. Even before it was over he called it, 'The most
negative, partisan, divisive acceptance speech since
Goldwater in 1964.'"<p>
  
    -- In Dole's speech CNN's Bernard Shaw discovered the
beginning of a nasty campaign: "I ve maintained that this
campaign is going to be one of the nastiest, bare-knuckled,
direct to the gut campaign's in America s political history.
Listen to this one sentence, quote 'It is demeaning to the
nation that within the Clinton administration a core of the
elite never grew up, never did anything real, never
sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the
power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving
schemes.'"<p>  
    -- One day after Ted Koppel left San Diego, Nightline covers
the convention, talking with a focus group; reporters discuss
GOP inclusiveness.<p>
  
    -- A Video Contrast: In 1992 ABC and CBS ran bios of Clinton;
but nothing for Dole this year. NBC ran part of Clinton's
video, but none of Dole's. <p>
  

<h2><center><a name="diversity">So Much for Network Bio Diversity
The Man from Hope vs. Russell's Own</a></h2></center><p>

    Four years ago at the Democratic convention in New York, ABC's 
Peter Jennings explained the quandary biographical films present
to the networks. "I'm not precisely sure what to call it," 
Jennings said, "but it's the Democratic Party's film 
about Bill Clinton's life, and it's something we try to 
come to grips with every four years when the party decides what
its view of the candidates is." ABC's 1992 resolution: "We 
think it's usually more prudent to give the assignment to a
reporter." Reporter Jeff Greenfield then introduced viewers to
Bill Clinton's life story.<p>

    CBS did the same. Dan Rather told viewers: "The delegates are 
now watching a film about Bill Clinton, prepared by the Clinton
campaign. We asked correspondent Richard Threlkeld to look at the
film and report on it." NBC aired the final three minutes of the
"Man from Hope" film. This year, CBS only showed the last 30
seconds of the Republicans biographical film for Dole and didn't
assign the story to a reporter. NBC aired nothing. ABC skipped
the film so it could check in with Brit Hume with President
Clinton in Wyoming, with the vital news that Clinton claimed he
wasn't watching the convention.<p>

    Bob Dole's life story would still be news to many Americans. 
<i>U.S. News & World Report's</i> Gloria Borger noted in the 
June 3 issue that "A Harris poll last month found that 59 percent
of Americans don't know Dole has a disibility." They must watch
too much television news.<p>


<h2><center><a name="CBS">Paula Zahn Insists CBS Coverage Has "Been Abundantly Fair"
But CBS Impugned GOP as "Extremist"</a></h2></center><p>
  
    Wednesday night Marc Morano, best known as the Rush Limbaugh
TV show's "man in Washington," confronted several network
reporters with his camera and microphone. Asked about liberal
bias, CBS correspondent Paula Zahn responded:<p>
  
    "Those of us who work for organizations like CBS News take
great pride in being fair and I think if you look at this
Republican convention, our coverage, you ll agree that we
have been abundantly fair." Well, Morano asked, what about
the use of extremist labels? "I don t think I ve used the
word extremist once since I got here on Saturday," the former
CBS This Morning co-host insisted. "Obviously, labels, I
think are very limiting and we have to be very careful about
how we use that."<p>
  
    She may be able to restrain herself, but her colleagues are
not so professional. On Monday's CBS Evening News Dan
Rather asked Jack Kemp: "Even some Republicans describe the
current platform as quote, 'harsh, extreme,' even 'radical.' 
Do you see it that way?"  <p>
  
    Lesley Stahl, later that night in prime time, claimed: "The
whole purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is
to diminish the image of this party as extreme, because
that's what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main
speaker at the convention...was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling,
his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin Powell,
he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find that
extreme. It's turning them off." <p>
  
    But Zahn is far from innocent. Take a look at a question that
she posed on the July 5, 1995 CBS This Morning to Pat
Buchanan: "Even your sister concedes, although some
supporters might like what you have to say about the economy
and these very specific issues you just mentioned, they re
very turned off by some of your social policies. And you know
you ve got political enemies out there calling you an
isolationist, a bigot, you re anti-gay, and some even go as
far as saying that your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi
Germany. How are you to win them over?"<p>

The Distorted Week in Review<a/></center><p></h2>
  
    So what have viewers across America heard about the
Republican convention? At week s end, here s a collection of
the most biased quotes from the networks:<p>
  
    -- "He [Kemp] is a rare combination 'a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They're
supposed to be haters.'" <p>
<i>-- CNN analyst Bill Schneider, August
9 Inside Politics.</i><p>
  
    -- "Ronald Reagan will still have to learn how history will
judge his time in office -- the deficits, the Iran-Contra
affair. But for the members of this party, there is no more
beloved figure." <p>

<i>-- Tom Brokaw just after Nancy Reagan's
emotional thank-you following a video tribute to Ronald
Reagan, August 12 NBC convention coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "You know a lot has been made of the Republican Party
being a very inclusive party, one that can embrace the views
of various people. Given the way the platform has worked out
vis-a-vis abortion, and the fact that some of these
Republican governors are not speaking because they felt as if
they were being censored. Do you still believe you can call
the Republican Party an inclusive party?" <p>
<i>-- One of seven
abortion questions posed by NBC's Katie Couric to Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, August 12 Today.</i><p>
  
   -- "Women have not responded well to a message that at times
has been considered too harsh, too mean." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Michel
McQueen, during August 13 coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "It was grand TV, well-scripted, well-staged, craftily
designed for a broadcast image of tolerance and diversity
that's starkly at odds with reality." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Jim Wooten on
Colin Powell s address, August 13 World News Tonight.</i><p>
  
    -- "The right to abortion has never been an overwhelming
issue for women at election time. But this fight within the
Republican Party has many women questioning how far this
party will go to limit their rights."  <p>
<i>-- ABC s Peter Jennings,
August 13.</i><p>
  
    -- "Although his speech was generally well-received, the
reception was restrained, and there were boos whenever Powell
steered away from the right. Though they booed and also
heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of inclusion
throughout the first night of their convention. We can expect
more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996." -- <p>
<i>Today
co-host Bryant Gumbel.</i><p>
  
    -- "Do you think -- this is a party that is dominated by men
and this convention is dominated by men as well...Do you
think before tonight they thought very much what happens in
America with rape?" <p>
<i>-- Tom Brokaw to rape victim Jan Licence
who had just addressed the convention, August 13.  </i><p>
  
    -- "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is
dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean." <p>
<i>-- NBC's Tim Russert
previewing Hutchison's August 13 speech.</i><p>
  
    -- "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want
much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on
President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating
habits." <p>
<i>-- ABC Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson,
August 14. </i><p>
  
    -- "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so
loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking
tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it,
or quite the contrary?" <p>
<i>-- Gumbel to Tim Russert, August 14
Today.</i><p>
  
    -- "Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a
Russian television reporter said today that this is as
tightly controlled as anything the Communist Party ever put
on, Tom." <p>
<i>-- NBC reporter David Bloom, August 14 Nightly News.</i><p>

<h3>Bryant the Killjoy</h3><p>
  
    As the rest of the media conceded the success of Elizabeth
Dole's Wednesday night speech from the floor, Today co-host
Bryant Gumbel grumbled Thursday morning: "Yeah, I guess some
would say it was cool. Others would say it was calculating,
huh?" <p>
  
    Later, Gumbel added: "In keeping with the softer image that
Republicans are trying hard to project at their convention,
Elizabeth Dole last night did her impression of Oprah
Winfrey, and in a fashion that supporters would call
heartfelt but others would call hokey, Liddy Dole sang her
husband s praises to the delegates." <p>
  
  
<h3>Ending With a Bang</h3><p>
  
    ABC's Brian Ross filed stories all week long on the corporate
money lavished on the GOP, but his Thursday World News
Tonight report focused on a surprising target: "Very much in
the middle of the mix are the giant media corporations, like
CNN, whose multi-million-dollar merger has yet to be formally
approved by federal regulators. Time Warner gave more than
$100,000 to be an official sponsor of the convention."<p>
  
    Former <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Dwight Morris told Ross
media companies shouldn t use the conventions to lobby, and
Ross noted: "But that didn t stop CBS lobbyists from giving
the Republicans thousands of dollars to help pay for the cost
of food and liquor in the skybox belonging to Republican
Party Chairman Haley Barbour." <p>
  
    Ross even reported on his own bosses: "Last night, the ABC
hospitality suite was a lobbyist s dream. With visits from
Congressman Tom Bliley, the chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, which handles telecommunications issues. And then
from the #2  man in the House, Majority Leader Dick Armey,
who could be seen with top ABC executives, including the ABC
lobbyist, who insisted he wasn't lobbying." We look forward
to an equally revealing set of nightly reports from Chicago.<p>
  
  
<h3>William's Wimps</h3><p>
  
    <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Bob Davis wrote an article for
the Thursday morning edition on MRC Chairman Brent Bozell and
the Media Reality Check '96 effort in San Diego. Davis found
notable hostility at CNN to Bozell: "His criticism is mostly
background noise,  says CNN political director Tom Hannon."
Davis asked CNN analyst Bill Schneider to explain his claim
last weekend that "conservatives are supposed to be haters"
and Jack Kemp "is a rare combination: a nice conservative."
Said Schneider: "I wasn t name-calling. I was making an
analytical point." He added that he calls liberals wimps, but
"they re so wimpy, they don t complain. When you talk about
mean conservatives, the wrath of God comes down on you."<p>
  
    But a look into the Nexis news data retrieval system finds
something different. Schneider quoted criticism of Colin
Powell s "wimpout" on abortion in 1995. The only other uses
of "wimp" in the last five years were three nearly identical
references in 1992 and 1994 to the 1988 Bush-Dukakis
campaign. Schneider declared on November 1, 1994: "Michael
Dukakis got beaten up by the wimp, which proved he wasn't
tough enough for the job."<p>

<title> Tax Limitation Amendment</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<br>
<center>
<h2><i>Tax Limitation</i></h2> <br>		             
</center>

Although April 15th is always an important day in the Unites States, this year, this day will earmark a hopeful turn of events.  The Tax Limitation Amendment, one of the first reform acts of the 104th Congress, will go to the House floor on April 15th.  Sponsored by over 166 Representatives, this amendment would require Congress to have a two-thirds majority vote in each house to approve tax-rate increases. <p> 

Senator Kyl (R-AZ) is the driving force behind the amendment for the Senate.  Senator Kyl has proposed that if this bill passes it would need ratification by 38 states in order to become the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <p>

One of the key factors to passing this bill would not only make it harder for Congress to raise taxes, but would force lawmakers to prioritize government spending.  The bill was written to encourage the elimination of lower priority programs to pay for new proposals as opposed to seeking finances through raised taxes. <p>

Recent surveys and studies have shown that the majority of American voters support the Tax Limitation Amendment.  The bill has also received tremendous backing from many high profile organizations, such as the American Conservative Union, the Christian Coalition, Citizens Against Government Waste, Family Research Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. <p>

Below is a layout of the proposed bill and some of the key reasons why it would stabilize tax laws: <p>

 <p> <br> <br> <br> 
					
					<center>April 15 Floor Vote </center> <p>

Section 1.<p>
	Any bill to increase taxes by increasing the rate or base of any tax may pass only by a two-thirds majority of the whole number of each House of Congress. <p>

Section 2.<p>
	Waiver during periods of declared war or imminent and serious threat to national security declared by a joint resolution.  Any provision which passed subject to the waiver shall last no more than 2 years. <p>

Section 3.<p>
	All votes will be roll call votes. <p>

<p> <br>  <br> 

				 <center>	Talking Points </center> <p>
<ul>
<li>The Kemp Commission on Tax Reform endorsed a 2/3rds super-majority requirement for tax increases. It is an essential part of any tax reform.<p>

<li> One-third of all Americans live in a state with tax limitation in their constitutions: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.  Other states are pursuing similar measures. <p>

<li> In the last decade, taxes in non-super-majority states went up 104%.  In super-majority requirement states, tax revenues went up only 87%. <p>

<li> In the last decade, spending in non-super-majority states went up 102%.  In states with the super-majority protection, spending increased only 95%. <p>

<li> It must be more difficult for future Congresses to raise taxes. Because federal benefits tend to be targeted at specific groups, special interest groups consistently come together to effectively lobby for more spending.  Taxes, on the other hand are spread among many millions of people who would find it difficult to band together as an interest group. The built-in pressure in a democracy is toward more spending.  The super-majority provision successfully balances the pressure. <p>

<li> Four of the last five major tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds super-majority.  Those taxes added an additional $666 billion to the tax bill for the American taxpayer. <p>

<li> On Day One of the 104th Congress, the House voted 279-152 for a super-majority requirement to raise income taxes -- 11 votes shy of two-thirds.  This important protection, though, only applies during the 104th Congress, and only to the House. <p>
</ul> <p>

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>22. What can be done to promote premarital sexual abstinence
and responsible sex education?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> National and local acknowledgment of parents
as the primary sex educators of their children.  National and
local publicity for and support of grass-roots initiatives which
promote abstinence and secondary virginity, especially those which
are faith-based in their approach.  Local school boards that cooperate
with parents to determine which, if any, sex education curriculum
should be implemented.  Most importantly, parents that give special
attention to personally teaching their own children about sexual
abstinence.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In recent years, encouraging premarital
abstinence has not been a national priority.  Rather, parents
have often had to single-handedly defend their values to their
children against the onslaught of media, school sex education
programs and school-based clinics, federal family planning initiatives,
and the rhetoric of national leaders which irresponsibly condone
out-of-wedlock sexual activity and attempt to separate premarital
sexual behavior from its inevitable and devastating consequences.

<p>

While there are many federal initiatives which promote &quot;family
planning&quot; and other types of sex education which undermine
the pre-marital sexual abstinence message (i.e., Title X of the
Public Health Service Act, the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage
Pregnancy, etc.), only Title XX of the Public Health Service Act
has devoted any monies and resources to promoting sexual abstinence.
Title XX funding has hovered around $6 million for several years
now, but only about one-third of these monies are dedicated to
abstinence education programs (as opposed to the nearly $200 million
appropriated for Title X alone).  More recently, $75 million was
appropriated for abstinence education in the welfare bill, but
President Clinton vetoed the measure.

<p>

While the Family Research Council supports measures that would
promote pre-marital sexual abstinence, FRC is firmly committed
to the principle that those who are best equipped to guide our
nation's children towards sexual abstinence and other moral and 
character values are their parents first and their community second. 
We believe that the proper role of the government and the media is 
to acknowledge the primary role of parents and to support their 
efforts.

<p>

Promoting premarital sexual abstinence makes good sense in a day
and age when out-of-wedlock pregnancies, illegitimacy, abortion,
and sexually-transmitted diseases are rampant, especially among
the young.  Not only does premarital abstinence help young people
to successfully avoid these physical and societal scourges, it
also increases the likelihood that they will experience an enduring
marriage, sexual satisfaction, and emotional and psychological
health.

<p>

For those young people who do not have the benefit of an intact,
two-parent home,  community programs which promote abstinence
are vitally important.  For example, the Washington, D.C.-based
<I>Best Friends</I> program has successfully helped more than
400 girls aged 10-18 to preserve their virginity and rise above
the teen motherhood and welfare dependency to which so many of
their peers have fallen victim.  In addition to <I>Best Friends</I>,
church-based initiatives such as <I>True Love Waits</I> and school-based
programs such as <I>Teen-Aid</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>Teen Choice</I> have all been effective in helping young people
make a commitment towards premarital sexual abstinence.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Enabling parents, churches, and communities to
promote and encourage pre-marital sexual abstinence will strengthen
the American family, especially in the long-term as today's abstinent
young people grow up to form healthy marriages and families. 
Promoting abstinence will also help reduce the incidence and prevalence
of sexually-transmitted diseases, out-of-wedlock pregnancies,
illegitimacy, and welfare-dependency.  Furthermore, the focus
on parents and grass-roots community activism away from government
directives will cost taxpayers less money and will result in better
outcomes for our nation's youth, families, and local communities.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>11. What solutions does FRC see for affordable health 
care?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that families should have access to affordable, portable
health care and insurance for families.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Enactment of tax-free medical savings accounts
(MSAs) as an important cost-saving and freedom-of-choice component
of any health care reform measure.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> A radical overhaul of our nation's
health care system, which is one of the finest in the world, is
not necessary.  Rather, there are certain aspects, such as affordability
and portability, that are amenable to reform without inviting
wholesale federal interference in health care.  Tax-free medical
savings accounts (MSAs) for working families and individuals,
as passed in the House-Senate Balanced Budget Act and the House
health care reform package, constitute one such reform.  MSAs
are similar to IRAs in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit
may be set aside for certain medical expenses.  MSAs are controlled
by individuals and families, not by governments or insurance companies.
MSAs usually supplement high-deductible (catastrophic) health
insurance coverage, helping to cover lower-level medical expenses
before the insurance deductible is reached, co-payments, and other
qualified expenses.  Because families and individuals are directly
responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard
against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping
to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, families reap
the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of
practicing good health habits, for any monies not spent by the
end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income,
or kept in the account for future health care needs.  Since most
individuals spend less than $2,000 per year on medical expenses,
funds in the account would be portable and available in-between
jobs, at the next job, or when bigger unexpected medical costs
come up in the future.

<p>

Companies that offer MSAs have found that they are most popular
among lower-income families.  Under conventional insurance plans,
low-income employees typically have to meet their $250 or $500
deductible with after-tax dollars before they can access their
insurance.  A single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year
may find it difficult to meet the deductible when rent, transportation,
taxes, grocery bills and other needs for her children are pressing.
An MSA allows these low-income earners first dollar coverage,
permitting them to get medical care when they or their children
need it.  This feature alone could significantly reduce 
the level of emergency room utilization for non-emergency care.
Low-income wage earners would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage
for medical care up to the amount in their MSA.

<p>

MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because
MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those
not expressly covered within the insurance policy, a family has
more flexibility to choose health services and providers and has
more portability of coverage.

<p>

More and more private sector employers are offering MSAs to their
employees, with great response, even though our federal tax code
discriminates against this practice.  Fifteen states have passed
laws granting favorable tax treatment to MSAs.   In March 1996,
the House of Representatives passed an MSA provision that would
allow comparable tax treatment to other forms of employment-based
insurance, as part of their health care reform package, H.R. 3103.
A similar Senate bill, S. 1028, did not contain an MSA provision
so this issue must be worked out in a House-Senate conference
committee.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> MSAs empower families to make their own health
care decisions by choosing their own doctors and spending their
own money for such care.   MSAs are a bipartisan solution and
a practical free-market alternative to address the problems of
escalating health care costs and lack of portability between jobs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>18. What does FRC do to support military families?
</h2></center>

<p>

FRC created the Military Readiness Project (MRP) to oppose the
induction of homosexuals into the military because their known
presence destroys morale and personal privacy and introduces sexual
tension into the barracks.  FRC opposes attempts to subvert the
law barring anyone with homosexual &quot;propensities&quot; from
military service.  The MRP has been actively engaged in providing
&quot;friend of the court&quot; briefs in key federal court cases
dealing with this issue.

<p>

The Family Research Council believes in the unique gifts and capabilities
of women, and opposes the pitfalls of a military that is gender
blind.  Some combat exemptions have already been eliminated, but
if the erosion continues, women may be placed in direct combat
roles &quot;on the same terms as men,&quot; a position supported
by barely a quarter of the American people.  The country -- and
its women -- are not well-served by placing women in combat positions.
FRC has worked hard to maintain a combat exemption in today's
military.

<p>

FRC has also tackled the issue of pornographic materials sold
in taxpayer-supported military stores.  The Family Research Council
sees this practice as one that undermines military discipline
and is at odds with the fundamentals of leadership and service.

BADEN</P><P>           KILLING WOLVES is a dramatic and highly controversial wildlife management practice. Alaska has recently proposed this as a way to boost caribou, moose, and deer populations for tourists and hunters.</P><P> But many people find gunning wolves from airplanes offensive and are outraged.</P><P>     The logic underlying the killing seems clear, but the issues are complex. Wolves do kill caribou, elk and moose - especially their young. Reducing wolf populations should increase the numbers of these ungulates, but by how much? There are bitter disputes among scientists over the size of predator impact upon prey populations.</P><P>     According to Dr. Fred Wagner, Director of the Ecology Center at Utah State University, wildlife managers see three options:</P><P>       --  First, with no controls, predators and prey will reach a long-run equilibrium with low numbers of both.</P><P>     --  A second option - elimination of predators - allows herds to rise dramatically in the short term, but in the long run small populations result from degraded habitat.</P><P>     --  The third way is to moderately decrease predator numbers, providing a sustainable rise in ungulate populations. Alaska seems to follow this third, moderate control option, thereby enhancing big-game hunting.</P><P>     But the link between predator and prey is questioned by some scientists. They contend that herbivore numbers are primarily determined by habitat, that predators play only a marginal role in determining numbers of caribou, moose and elk. Only renewed habitat, such as that created by fire, can significantly increase populations. And regardless, they say, accurately determining the &quot;optimal&quot; wolf populations is hard to achieve.</P><P>     What precedents do we have for wolf-control programs?</P><P>       Yellowstone Park is a prime, if discouraging example. Wolves were deliberately eliminated from the Yellowstone ecosystem decades ago. Like most well-intentioned interventions in ecological and economic systems, the results have been different and more severe than anticipated.</P><P>     Elk populations in the Park have erupted, causing massive over-grazing and the prospect of mass starvation during severe Rocky Mountain winters. Whole plant and animal species have been decimated, drastically changing the park's ecology. What will be the results in the delicate Arctic tundra?</P><P>       Wolf controls have been tried in Alaska but without great success; bears, not wolves, were found to be taking the largest share of ungulates. So wolf numbers may, or may not, significantly impact prey numbers in Alaska.</P><P>     And as Dr. Kenneth Raedeke, a wildlife specialist at the University of Washington observes, &quot;having a brown bear control program, even in Alaska, is not (politically) acceptable.&quot; This gets to the heart of the matter: the nature of political decision-making. The decision to control wolf populations was made on the basis of political power, not science, economic efficiency or environmental sensitivity. Wolves, apparently, are thought to be politically acceptable targets while bears are not.</P><P>     In Alaska, Gov. Walter Hickel and special-interest groups such as the Alaska Outdoor Council, a coalition of outfitters, hunters</P><P> and bush pilots, have used the levers of political control over natural resources to their advantage, regardless of ecological effects. They want to make it easier for hunters to kill moose and caribou by increasing their populations, even though, as the director of Alaska Division of Wildlife Conservation admits, &quot;there are no real shortages of big-game animals in Alaska.&quot; This is the predictable result of bureaucratic management in a political environment.</P><P>     As public-choice economics teaches, more than ecological concerns are being sacrificed to special interests.</P><P>     The consequences, while clear for the wolves, may be equally bleak for Alaska's reputation for its important tourist economy. The state has already received &quot;hundred of letters&quot; protesting the plan. Last week, the National Parks and Conservation Association canceled its 75th anniversary board meeting scheduled for Anchorage. A decline in tourism may match the decrease in wolf population.</P><P>     By responding to a small, vocal constituency, Alaska's government may have damaged a far broader, but less-well-organized and focused group. This decision once again illustrates the pitfalls of political-bureaucratic natural resource management, where special interests can run the decision-making apparatus to their benefit while ignoring the costs imposed on many.</P><P>     The Alaskan wolf example demonstrates that sound environmentalism must recognize the dangers of political management. In a greener political economy, environmental management should be guided by science and constrained by economic realities. We can learn from Alaska. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>The fault-lines of today's divorce policies</FONT>
<P><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR>
The Washington Times
<HR width = 30%>
</CENTER>

<P>Once upon a time a private eye could build a flourishing business with a cheap camera, a good skeleton key and an appetite for the prurient, setting up a married man in a compromising position with a woman not his wife. A quick snap and the photograph was on its way to his lawyer.

<P>Not only would the &quot;unfaithful&quot; husband pay a premium for these fraudulently scandalous photos, artlessly staged, but his &quot;betrayed&quot; wife could appreciate them, too. She wanted a divorce as badly as he did and they had to prove someone's sexual infidelity to get one.

<P>Other scenarios were not so hypocritically benign, with the private eyes sneaking around hedges at the Bide-Away Motel, an out-of-the-way apartment or house, all to get the goods on someone's private pleasures.

<P>&quot;No-fault&quot; divorce became the simple-minded cure for all this. No-fault divorce, an erroneous label stolen from a no-fault automobile insurance policy, suggests that marriage is a little like a traffic accident, with the same high speed that bends the colliding parties out of shape but without the body and fender shop to put everything aright again. The intent of the law was to make divorce easier, more humane and less hypocritical for both parties. Feminists quickly saluted it as a means of asserting their independent rights.

<P>This was OK when both parties wanted the divorce. The law merely reduced employment opportunities for professional snoops. But many times no-fault divorce put the wife at a severe disadvantage, enabling her husband to make a unilateral decision which overnight reduced her standard of living, whether she had a job or not.

<P>State Rep. Jessie F. Dalman, a Republican, introduced a bill Feb. 14 in Michigan - with a bow to St. Valentine -  to repeal no-fault provisions when one spouse still wants to preserve the marriage. This places Michigan on the cutting edge of the movement to think again about the preservation of the terms of endearment. Other states are moving that way, too.

<P>In the Michigan bill, unilateral divorce would be repealed, with certain obvious exceptions - if the party wanting the divorce could prove the other spouse abusive, addicted, adulterous or in prison. At the least, judges would move more slowly in granting a divorce when half of the loving (or not-so-loving) couple wants to remain in the state of bliss.

<P>Every state now has some form of &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce. This approach has been especially unkind to women and children. Maggie Gallagher, in her forthcoming book &quot;The Abolition of Marriage,&quot; demonstrates how no-fault divorce literally allows one spouse to get away with murder, the &quot;murder of a marriage.&quot; Unilateral divorce radically alters the legal and moral basis of marriage: &quot;Today, while it still takes two to marry, it only takes one to divorce.&quot;

<P>Ms. Gallagher makes the larger argument that no-fault divorce dilutes the marriage contract, rendering it considerably less binding than, for example, a contract to sell a car or a cow. When the law supports the one who flees commitment(s), more marriages &quot;irretrievably break down.&quot; Chalk up another victim of the iron law of unintended consequences.

<P>Women in the 1960s and 1970s who should have known better were brainwashed into believing that a man who wanted a divorce should no longer pay alimony, just child support. &quot;Let the wife eat the cake she bakes.&quot;

<P>Brian Willats, communications director of public policy for the Family Forum in Lansing, Mich., a think tank that studies family issues, supports the Michigan bill because he thinks it strengthens the leverage of the &quot;virtuous spouse,&quot; the one who lives up to the marriage vows and doesn't want to break them. It tips the balance of power to the steady spouse, reducing the clout of the wandering spouse seeking greener pastures.

<P>This also restores a missing solemnity, a certain dignity, to the idea of the marriage contract. We've all heard, ad nauseam, the litany of ills that follow the single divorced parent, the poverty that attaches itself to the spirit as well as to the pocketbook, to society and to the family.

<P>When two people no longer want to stay together, they ought to be able to split their blanket. But not so fast: If one spouse objects, he or usually she should get an opportunity and a little more time to seek a reconciliation. If it takes two to say &quot;I do,&quot; shouldn't it also take two to say &quot;I don't&quot;?

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>14. What does FRC think can be done to restore the sanctity
of human life?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that society must acknowledge and restore the sanctity
of human life for those born and unborn.  Society must protect
innocent unborn children and mothers facing a crisis pregnancy
from government funding and promotion of abortion in the U.S.
and abroad, and protect the elderly from physician-assisted suicide
and euthanasia.  We can accomplish these goals through various
protective measures through all branches of government:  executive,
legislative, and judicial.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Enactment of specific pro-life legislation,
such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and other measures
that protect unborn children from abortion, reduce the overall
number of abortions, and restrict taxpayer funding and sponsorship
of abortion.  Encouraging the President to appoint, and the Senate
to confirm, pro-family judges who believe that unborn children
have an inalienable right to life and deserve full legal protection.
Adopt a human life amendment to the Constitution.  Encourage
policies to restrict physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Thomas Jefferson said:  &quot;The
protection of human life and happiness, and not their destruction,
is the first and only legitimate object of good government.&quot;
However, the unborn child is not considered a &quot;person&quot;
according to seven members of the Supreme Court in the <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> decision (1973).  Since the legalization of abortion
through all nine months of pregnancy in 1973, there have been
more than 33 million abortions.  One-third of these were performed
on teenage girls.  Out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually-transmitted
diseases [particularly chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomarvirus
(HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)], and abortion rates
have all dramatically increased since that time.  Abortion is
never a healthy solution to a problem pregnancy.  To that end,
government and, principally, communities and churches, must encourage
and promote public policies and programs that reduce the demand
for, and total numbers of, abortions; promote adoption; promote
parental involvement; and offer practical assistance to teens
and women in a crisis situation.  Our tax dollars should never
fund or actively encourage abortions using taxpayer dollars or
fund organizations with pro-abortion policy goals or objectives.

<p>

Opinion polls consistently show that the majority of Americans
oppose most abortions.  A 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN
and <I>USA Today</I> found that 65 percent of Americans believe
that abortion should either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot;
or &quot;legal under certain circumstances.&quot;  A January 1995
CBS/<I>New York Times</I> poll found that 60 percent believe that
abortion should either &quot;not be permitted&quot; or have &quot;stricter
limits.&quot;

<p>

Specifically, the president should sign the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, a bill that would limit a particularly horrible late-term
abortion method that is basically infanticide.  Congress should
adopt, and send to the states for ratification, a human life amendment
that applies the protection of the 14th Amendment to unborn children
and assures recognition of their fundamental, individual right
to life.  In addition, various government agencies, such as the
Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of
Health, Department of Education, State Department, and Agency
for International Development must not indirectly or directly
fund or encourage abortions, fund domestic or international organizations
that promote or perform abortion as a method of family planning,
fund &quot;comprehensive&quot; school-based health clinics, fund
or encourage abortion-related research on drugs like RU-486, or
promote or fund physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Promoting the sanctity of human life is vital
to maintaining a great nation and strong civil society.  We see
in alarming crime rates and shocking killings the inevitable result
of abortion cheapening human life.  Society and political parties
must recognize the value and inherent worth of each individual
person from the moment of conception to natural death.  Unborn
children, the infirm, the handicapped and the elderly must all
be protected.

mean policies.<p>
3) Just about everyone in Hollywood showed up at or served as
host for President Clinton's 50th birthday bash Sunday night. One
major celebrity shouted that "Dole sucks!"<p>

 1) Sunday afternoon Dan Rather interviewed President Clinton
for that night's 60 Minutes. Dan Rather started out by asking:
"Some of your staff members, not by name, have been saying, 'yes
the President thinks Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a
pretty good leader in some ways, but, say they, he's been
captured by the extremists in the Republican Party, the radical
part of the Republican Party, including Newt Gingrich. Is that
what you think?"<p>

    Rather showed Clinton video of criticisms from Bob Dole and
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison at the Republican convention. Almost
apologetic, Rather noted, "You said your hope is it can be fought
out on the issues, but one more thing from the convention, then
I'll give you a chance to respond to it. As you must know,
whether you watched the convention or not, the Republicans fired
a number of shots at the First Lady. Some samples. Former
President Bush said, quote, 'Mrs. Bush upheld the honor of the
White House, and did it with class and style and caring and
love.'....I don't know of anyone in the convention who didn't
take that as a difference of the present First Lady and the
former First Lady."<p>
    
    After Clinton responded, Rather implored: "Don't you get mad,
Mr. President, when this sort of thing happens?"<p>

     2) And before you forget the media's animosity toward the
Republican convention, here's a portion of a commentary piece in
Friday's USA Today by Jill Nelson, a former Washington Post
reporter: <p>
    "I found it hard not to cringe. I was embarrassed by the
specter of everyone's favorite black man, Colin Powell, lecturing
us on why he became a Republican and referring to a  divine
providence that gave us this land.' Tell that to the Native
Americans who were slaughtered in the name of 'divine
providence.' I felt manipulated, not moved, by Nancy Reagan's
tribute to her Ronnie as some sort of caring everyman,
considering that under Reagan the rich got richer, the national
debt skyrocketed, and working Americans were left holding the
bag."<p>

    3 ) Sunday night the Democratic Party held a series of
birthday parties in New York City and around the country for
President Clinton. The Washington Post's Lloyd Grove reported
Monday that in addition to emcee Whoopi Goldberg that attending
celebrities included Tony Bennett, Carly Simon, Jon Bon Jovi,
Aretha Franklin, and James Earl Jones. <p>

    Monday's New York Post added these names to the celebrity
list: Leslie Nielsen, Tim Conway, Ted Danson and Mary
Steenburgen. The New York Post's Cindy Adams reported: "The party
was beamed around the country by satellite so other celebs could
get a chance to host a shindig of their very own: In L.A.,
Nicolas Cage and his wife, Patricia Arquette, played host. In San
Francisco it was Michael Keaton, who has never, ever done
anything political before. In Baltimore, it was Valerie Harper;
in Boston, Judy Collins; in Nashville, L.L. Cool J; in Denver,
C.C. Wayans...."<p>
 
    The Washington Post's Grove relayed that at one of the NYC
bashes, "Comedian and morning television host Rosie O'Donnell
entertained the crowd by shouting, 'Dole sucks!'"<p>

    A very inclusionary and tolerant message. -- Brent Baker.<p>

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>15. How does FRC view immigration reform?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the immigration laws should reflect this country's
heritage as a &quot;nation of immigrants&quot; while also placing
emphasis on fairness and orderly procedure, recognizing that regulation
is necessary to protect our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Actions Needed:</b> (1) Support measures which halt illegal
immigration, e.g., increasing border patrols, halting welfare
payments to illegal aliens, permanently denying readmission to
aliens who are caught illegally residing in the U.S., etc.  (2)
Support pro-family measures regarding legal immigration, e.g.,
reuniting nuclear families first before other family and work
categories, enforcing policies which hold U.S. citizens and residents
financially responsible for the family member(s) they &quot;sponsor&quot;
for entry into the U.S., deporting and permanently excluding aliens
who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and providing
asylum to victims of religious persecution and/or coercive population
control policies.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Immigration reform is badly needed
in order to correct the unwise policies of the past (i.e., providing
amnesty to all illegal aliens) and to provide a framework to meet
present and future challenges, especially those which address
the ever-growing problem of illegal aliens crossing into the U.S.

<p>

The problem of illegal immigration must be addressed on the principles
of ensuring adherence to the law and administering justice.  The
United States must not reward illegal aliens whose first act in
this country is to break the law.  Thus, we support efforts to
halt illegal immigration by increasing border patrols, enforcing
the expedited deportation of illegal aliens, increasing criminal
penalties for those who create or distribute fraudulent identification
documents, and permanently denying readmission to aliens who are
found to illegally reside in the U.S., among others.

<p>

In terms of legal immigration, the United States should preserve
its policy of welcoming legal immigrants, acknowledging the fact
that we are a &quot;nation of immigrants.&quot;  However, in recent
years, public opinion has been antagonistic towards immigrants
-- both legal and illegal -- due to the influx of illegal immigrants
and the notion that legal immigrants are not &quot;paying their
own way&quot; once they enter the U.S.  Thus, we support policies
which help legal immigrants &quot;play by the rules,&quot; such
as deporting and permanently excluding aliens who are convicted
of felonies, and enforcing &quot;sponsorship&quot; policies which
hold U.S. family members financially responsible for those immigrants
they sponsor to enter the U.S.

<p>

Finally, the United States must preserve its commitment to refugees,
particularly those who are victims of religious persecution or
coercive population control policies.  We support current U.S.
policy which does not impose a numerical limit on refugees because
America needs the flexibility to respond appropriately to future
humanitarian crises and because refugees currently comprise only
about 8 percent of total immigration to the U.S. every year. 
Most important of all, the United States must maintain its tradition
of moral leadership, reminding other nations that adherence to
universally-recognized human rights matters.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The American people already want immigration reform.
Implementing wise immigration reform policies -- halting illegal
immigration and regulating legal immigration -- will be vital
in order to restore Americans' confidence in the immigration system
as well as in changing the current negative public perception
about immigrants as a whole.

<H3>Three items today:</H3>
<P>   
<OL>
<LI><a href="#dole">On Tuesday Bob Dole</a> called Clinton a tax and spend liberal. Covering Dole's speech, CBS asserts that the "ex-deficit hawk" must "do more than criticize." NBC says Dole's latest themes reflect a "campaign of fear."
<LI><a href="#hillary">A federal report concludes that Hillary Clinton deliberately "deceived" federal regulators,</a> but the broadcast networks don't report on the report.
<LI><a href="#donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> and a USA Today reporter charge that their media colleagues are going easier on Clinton than they did on Reagan and Bush. 
</OL>
<a name="dole">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Before the Economic Club of Detroit</FONT> on Tuesday Bob Dole
said Bill Clinton is a liberal bent on raising taxes. ABC's World
News Tonight on Tuesday (September 24) didn't mention the speech. 
<P>
On the CBS Evening News, Phil Jones charged that supporting a
tax cut means Dole is no longer concerned about the deficit.
Jones also worried that criticizing Clinton isn't the right
strategy. 
<P>
<DD>Jones reported: "The former Senator argued that voters have a
choice between two different visions of government."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He wants families to pinch their pennies so government can
spend more money. I've got a new idea. I want the government for
a change to pinch its pennies so the families will not have to
pinch theirs."
<BR><DD>Jones: "The ex-deficit hawk returned to the centerpiece of his
campaign, a 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>Dole: "I know the critics say you can't do this, you can't cut
taxes and balance the budget. What they're really saying is that
they cannot do it."
<BR><DD>Jones: "Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing
President Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason
for this attack. But between now and election day the Republican
nominee has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole
plan."
<P>
After showing some of the same tax soundbites from Dole, on
NBC Nightly News David Bloom ran a clip of a new Clinton ad which
criticizes Dole's Senate record, emphasizing Dole's length of
service. Bloom then charged:
<BR><DD>"So now Dole who's complained about Clinton's campaign of fear is
taking a similar tack."
<BR><DD>Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to the
White House."
<BR><DD>Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame. David Bloom, NBC News, Detroit."
<P>
<a name="hillary">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) "FDIC Report Says Mrs. Clinton's Work Was Used to
Deceive,"</FONT> declared the front page Washington Post headline on
Tuesday. The news was also played above the fold in The
Washington Times. But neither the Monday or Tuesday night ABC,
CBS or NBC evening shows mentioned the development. 
<P>
Post reporter Susan Schmidt's lead: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
drafted a real estate document that was used by an Arkansas S&L
to 'deceive' federal regulators in 1996 and pay more than $300,000
in questioned commissions to one of her law firm's well-connected
clients, a federal inspector general concluded yesterday. The
strongly worded report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
inspector general found evidence that Clinton and her former law
partner Webster Hubbell were involved in dealings on behalf of
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan that they have told federal
investigators under oath they cannot recall."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3) An expert media observer</FONT> who had up close, insider
access to how the media covered Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election
campaign says reporters are going a lot easier on Clinton this
year. The expert: Sam Donaldson. With Brit Hume out ill last
week, Donaldson returned to the campaign trail for the first time
since Reagan's years. And things have changed, USA Today's Peter
Johnson reported Monday (September 23):
<BR><DD>"Have the boys on the bus lost the fire in their bellies, the
one that fueled their cries of 'Mr. President! Mr. President!'
during President Reagan's years in office? ABC's Sam Donaldson
isn't saying, exactly, but suspects something's going on. Except
for CBS' Rita Braver, 'I have heard no reporter trying to ask the
President any question,' Donaldson said Friday....
<BR><DD>"What's this, Sam? Reporters going easy on Clinton? 'You're not
going to get me in a fight with these guys. They're my friends,'
said Donaldson, who covered the White House from 1977 to 1989.
'But there seems to a change in attitude or a different attitude
toward covering the President.'"
<P>
A USA Today reporter agrees. In his "Politics" column on
Monday, Richard Benedetto wrote:
<BR><DD>"As President Clinton's re-election campaign rolled through
six states in four days last week, it did so virtually unimpeded
by a White House press corps known for setting up roadblocks now
and then....He was left free to make a string of feel-good
speeches that won great play in the media and gave the desired
impression that the Clinton campaign is on a roll....
<BR><DD>"In 1992, a tough White House press corps rightly kept
President Bush's feet to the fire on domestic issues he would
rather have downplayed. But the 1996 crew appears less aggressive
with Clinton."
<P>We're bringing them to our side, one reporter at a time.

<dd>
1) Having earlier found ABC News had committed fraud, on
Wednesday a federal jury in North Carolina awarded Food Lion $5.5
million in punitive damages for an undercover story aired on Prime
Time Live in 1992. Instead of filing a very hard to win libel
suit, which would have required Food Lion to prove malice, Food
Lion sued for fraud and trespass based upon how ABC producers
misrepresented themselves to get hired.<p>
<dd>
Food Lion obtained video outtakes which showed how ABC misled
viewers, but network stories Wednesday night insisted the accuracy
of ABC's story was beyond argument and, therefore, the decision
would have a chilling effect.<p>

On the January 22 CBS Evening News Dan Rather announced:<p>
<dd>
"A federal jury in North Carolina ordered ABC television today
to pay the Food Lion supermarkets five and a half million dollars
in punitive damages, that's in connection with an undercover news
investigation that proved to be true. But ABC News producers
covered their true identities to get jobs at Food Lion and jurors
decided that amounted to fraud."<p>
<dd>
After soundbites from two jurors, Rather continued:
"The ABC report accused Food Lion of selling spoiled food and
other unsanitary practices. Important to note that the truth of
the report was never at issue in the lawsuit, not even challenged,
only the journalistic techniques. ABC is appealing the verdict and
ABC News President Roone Arledge says, and I quote, 'If large
corporations were allowed to stop hard-hitting investigative
journalism, the American people would be the losers.'"<p> <dd>
The network in question, ABC, gave a fuller view of the issues
involved. Reporter John McKenzie began his story:<p>
<dd> 
"The jurors had already found ABC guilty of fraudulent job applications and
trespassing. Today's award, they said, was meant to send
journalists a message." Following two juror soundbites McKenzie
allowed Chris Ahearn of Food Lion to assert: "This case was about
wrongdoing on the part of ABC and the jury agreed with Food Lion
that ABC broke laws and today they agreed that ABC needed to be
punished for that illegal activity."<p>
<dd>
A bit later in the piece ABC News President Roone Arledge
expressed the widely held all or nothing media view:<p>
<dd>
"From the beginning, Food Lion has never been able to attack
the story itself. They have gone about attacking us because of the
way we gathered it. The reason that the award today is outrageous
is that this is precisely the kind of story for which
investigative techniques like these are appropriate."<p>
<dd>Arledge failed to consider another spin: Undercover reporting
that accurately and fairly documents wrongdoing is fine, but the public
doesn't approve of the media abusing its power and then delivering a
distorted story.<p>
<BR>
On NBC Nightly News Tom Brokaw declared:<p>
<dd>
 "NBC News In Depth tonight, Food Lion versus ABC -- punishing the messenger..."
    But reporter Bob Faw proceeded to provide the only story of
the night which explored why the media have turned off the public.<p><dd>
Faw began: "Insisting it had broadcast the truth, ABC said every American
should be troubled by the decision. One..."<p><dd>
    Bill Jeffries, ABC lawyer: "that vastly exceeds the actual
damages incurred by Food Lion."<p><dd>
    Faw: "That, said jurors, misses the point."<p><dd>
    Juror: "They're going to have to go about gathering the news
in a different way. You can't misrepresent yourself just to get
the news."<p><dd>
    Faw: "What we love on television, we condemn in the jury box."<p><dd>
    Faw went on to explain that the public believes the media
violate people's privacy, have a superior attitude and employ
trickery. Faw ran a soundbite from Richard Jewell and then let
former Senator Alan Simpson assert that investigative reports are
not done to reveal the truth but "to draw blood."<p><dd>
    Faw explained: "And, when like ABC, the press piously
proclaims that the ends justify the means, the public and jurors
say no, it does not."<p><dd>
   <b><I> MRC Chairman Brent Bozell</I></b>: "There's a growing sense of
alienation between the public and the press."<p><dd>
    Faw: "A public which ironically continues to say it wants the
media to catch the bad guys. Now, say investigative reporters,
that will be harder."<p><dd>
    Jane Kirtley: Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press:
"A decision like this is going to have a great chilling effect on
news organizations pursuing stories like this."<p><dd>
    Faw: "A decision where jurors said candid camera yes, sucker
punch no."<p><dd>
    Tom Brokaw then interviewed Newsweek's Jonathan Alter, who
insisted: "This is an alarming case because what it suggests is that you
can do a report that is substantially accurate and still be
penalized for it. And that can set a chilling precedent for
stories that news organizations want to do that might cause a lot
of opposition on the part of the subjects of the story."<p><dd>
   
 Instead of considering whether ABC went too far, Brokaw asked:
"Is there any doubt in your mind that we have to work a little
harder at getting the public to understand just what we do and why
we do it?"<p><br>
<a name="2"><dd>
2) But just how "true" and "accuate" was ABC's story? In the 
January 20 New Republic William Powers reported that "as part of the 
suit, Food Lion had obtained the full forty-five hours of hidden-camera
videotape shot by the Prime Time Live producers, of which only
about ten minutes wound up in the segment." Food Lion contended
that "ABC producers and editors used a combination of staged
events and selective editing to fit a pre-conceived story line and
systematically fabricate a story to deceive the public."<dd>
    Powers explained: "In one case found in the outtakes shown by
Food Lion in court, an ABC employee sold a piece of moldy kielbasa
sausage to two other ABC employees, while both parties to the
transaction filmed it with hidden cameras."<p>
<dd>
    Food Lion could not release this video while it was evidence,
but AP reported that after Wednesday's verdict they distributed a
highlight tape to reporters. <p><dd>
    Powers suggested why news magazines have an incentive to
exaggerate what they discover: 
<dd>
    "These hidden-camera investigations are costly, and it's hard
for producers to go back to the office and say the sorts of things
newspaper reporters tell their editors all the time: 'the story
didn't really pan out'....Unlike newspapers, the networks don't
have subscribers who will be back for the next edition no matter
what, and they can't bury a less than fab story on page B-19. They
have to draw in a large audience for every show, or risk losing
ratings and advertisers. And they do so by painting broad,
sensational strokes."<p><dd>
    For more on ABC's manipulations, see item #5 below.<p><br>
<a name= "3">
<dd>
3) In addition to the $5.5 million, the jury demanded that
Rick Kaplan, Executive Producer of Prime Time Live at the time of
the Food Lion story, pay $35,000. Food Lion had argued that Prime
Time producers had benefitted personally from the story. As
reported in the January 8 USA Today: <dd>
    "Food Lion's Mike Mueller said Prime Time Live employees who
worked on the story got big raises. Producer Susan Barnett, he
said, got a raise from $49,400 to $70,000 the day after she was
named in the suit in 1993. Producer Lynne Dale's pay rose from
$72,900 in 1992 to $100,000 in 1993. Other salary figures, to
which ABC did not object, showed that in 1993, former Executive
Producer Rick Kaplan made $700,000."<p>
<dd>
    Kaplan may soon take a top slot at CNN. Kaplan is now a
special events producer for ABC Television. He left Prime Time
Live in 1994 to become Executive Producer of World News Tonight
where he remained until about a year ago. <p><dd>

    Back on January 3 The Washington Post's John Carmody reported
that Kaplan "is being eagerly sought to take over a major job at
the 24-hour channel," elaborating that "speculation in Atlanta has
Kaplan being put in charge of all CNN programs and program
development."<p><dd>

    As examined in MediaWatch a few years ago, Kaplan is a Friend
of Bill who advised Clinton during the 1992 campaign -- a time
when Kaplan was working for ABC News. Here's an except from the
front page story in the January 1994 MediaWatch:<p><dd>

Kaplan, Executive Producer of Prime Time Live since 1989, advised
Clinton in 1992. When the Gennifer Flowers story broke in
February, "Clinton called Kaplan for advice," Los Angeles Times
reporter Tom Rosenstiel recounted in his campaign book Strange
Bedfellows. On the way to the airport, Clinton made another call
to Kaplan and the "night ended for Kaplan at 4am, when Clinton
called one last time."<p> 
Rosenstiel reported that Clinton "was considering doing 60
Minutes. If you do, Kaplan said, it should be with Mike Wallace or
Morley Safer or Ed Bradley. Otherwise tell them forget
it....[Voters] are going to remember that you stood up to Mike
Wallace."<p> 
Two months later as Clinton's campaign floundered in New York,
aides suggested an appearance on the Don Imus show. "The
appearance was clinched," CNN producer Matthew Saal recalled in
the January 1993 Washington Monthly, "when Rick Kaplan... called
the radio show host to see if he could get the pair together. The
answer was yes."<p> 
Kaplan's closeness has impacted coverage. In a March 11 Prime Time
Live story, Sam Donaldson explained that he added a positive
remark at the end of a pre-election Clinton interview because
Kaplan said "the overall [interview] atmosphere was too tough." In
the March 21 Washington Post Magazine, David Finkel quoted Kaplan
as he watched Donaldson's interview: "I'd just like to do this one
over again...I'm getting angry watching this...You didn't treat
Bush this way."<p> 
Kaplan kept up his cozy relationship after the election. He
"played golf with Bill shortly before the inauguration and watched
movies with both Clintons at the Governor's mansion," Jacob
Weisberg reported in the April 26 New Republic.<p><BR>
<a name= "4">
<dd>
4) While Kaplan may soon join CNN's ranks, the cable network
has just landed another network liberal: Garrick Utley. The New
York Post's Josef Adalian reported that Utley, Chief Foreign
Correspondent for ABC News since 1993, will work out of CNN's New
York bureau starting next month. Before ABC Utley spent 30 years
with NBC News as a reporter, anchor and for a little while, host
of Meet the Press.<p><dd>

    What views does Utley hold? Well, some quotes run in past
issues of Notable Quotables show he's not very conservative.<p><dd>

    Utley anchoring the October 17, 1992 NBC Nightly News:
<dd>    "When I covered Bush's 1980 primary campaign against Ronald
Reagan, he opposed Reagan's economic program. He called it 'voodoo
economics' -- said it wouldn't work. But then of course, Bush
agreed to be Reagan's running mate. For eight years, he supported
policies which, it is now widely acknowledged, contributed
mightily to our excesses then and our economic problems now; above
all, America being held hostage by debt. George Bush went along to
get ahead, and it worked. He became President. Now Ronald Reagan
is in happy retirement in California, and President Bush is left
to pay the price. The price for supporting something he did not
believe in to begin with. He knows it -- knows it is now too late
to do anything about that fateful bargain he entered into twelve
years ago. Going along to get ahead made George Bush President.
Now it may unmake him. The ancient Greeks wrote about this sort of
thing. They called it tragedy." <p><dd>

    Utley anchoring the January 25, 1992 NBC Nightly News:<dd>
    "Yes, times are tough because of mistakes we made in the past,
including voodoo economics supported by George Bush, among
others."<p> <dd>

    And to think that on Sunday's 60 Minutes Ted Turner complained
about how Rupert Murdoch infected the Fox News Channel with a
conservative tilt. -- Brent Baker <p>

<dd>
1) Many of you received two or three copies of the last 
CyberAlert. You aren't on our list more than once, CompuServe 
just sent out multiple copies, some blindcopied and some not. 
CompuServe is unable to tell me when this problem will be 
resolved and is not providing any short term solution, though 
they assure me it is "a high priority of the mail developers." 
This has been a problem for over a month now.
<br>
<dd>    
Everything works fine for those with a CompuServe address. I 
thought about sending this message CC to everyone since that 
would eliminate the long double-spaced list, but many e-mail 
systems (including AOL) put the Apparently To list after the 
message and CCing this would put all the addresses up top.
<br>
<dd>    
I have made my displeasure known to CompuServe, but three 
work days have passed since the last CyberAlert and the problem 
has not been resolved. Given the timeliness of the Gingrich/cell
phone and Paula Jones material and the fact that many of you have 
e-mailed to say that while annoying you'd rather get than not get 
CyberAlerts, I'm going ahead with today's edition.  
<P>
<a name="2">
<dd>
2) A husband and wife active in Democratic politics by 
"coincidence" come across and record a cellular conversation 
among House Republicans. Even if the recording of the over the 
air broadcast is legal, the Democratic activists violate the law 
by passing the tape to a third party -- a top House Democrat, 
Rep. Jim McDermott. Instead of alerting authorities or refusing 
the tape, it ends up in the New York Times. 
<br>
<dd>    
But what most interests the media? Not exploring this series 
of immoral, unethical and/or illegal events. No, the networks 
worry that this controversy is "distracting" the focusing from 
Gingrich's ethics. 
<p>
<dd>
On Monday night's CBS Evening News (January 13) Dan Rather 
introduced a story by focusing not on the ethics of Democrats but 
on how Republicans are guilty of trying to change topics:  
<br>
<dd>    
"On Capitol Hill the House today was supposed to begin making 
full disclosure of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ethical 
violations and tax problems. It didn't. And what's more, now 
there's an added ethics allegation based on what Gingrich said, 
in what he thought was a secret telephone call, which Democrats 
say is proof that Gingrich violated a promise to the House ethics 
committee not to mount a political damage control effort. But 
Republicans tried to shift the focus today away from what 
Gingrich actually said. Bob Schieffer has the latest."
<p>
<dd>
The next night, on the January 14 CBS Evening News, reporter 
Wyatt Andrews demonstrated how easy it is to tune in a cellular 
call and reviewed how the Martins claimed they caught the call, 
then concluded his piece: 
<br>
<dd>    
"...So now the Martins could be charged with a crime. 
Congressman James McDermott, who leaked the tape, could be 
charged with a crime and ironically, in the ways of Washington, 
mini-tapegate has for five days sidetracked substantive ethics 
charges against the Speaker of the House."  
<p>
<dd>
Wednesday night coverage of tapegate? Not a word on ABC's 
World News Tonight, CBS Evening News or NBC Nightly News.
<P>
<a name="3">
<dd>
3) Not all sexual harassment is an evil that must be 
immediately redressed -- at least according to Time magazine's 
Margaret Carlson. Discussing whether the Supreme Court should 
delay the Paula Jones case until after President Clinton leaves 
office, Carlson opined on the January 12 Fox News Sunday:
<br>
<dd>    
"It also depends on the degree of harm. In fact, she didn't 
lose her job, she got her promotions. There's no claim of harm."
<br>
<dd>    
Not quite the media view of Anita Hill who took ten years to 
make her charge.
<p>
<dd>
The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Monday. That 
night on the CBS Evening News Rita Braver reviewed the history of 
the case: 
<p>
<dd>    
Braver began: "It was the women's vote that clinched the 
presidency for Bill Clinton and he prides himself on being a 
committed feminist. So the charges made by Paula Corbin Jones go 
straight to the heart of who Bill Clinton is. Because she claims 
he is the kind of man who would take advantage of a young woman, 
who would sexually harass her..."
<p>
<dd>
Question: If this long-scheduled case goes "straight to the 
heart of who Bill Clinton is" then why didn't CBS explore this 
subject last fall, BEFORE the election?
<p>
<dd>
Braver continued: "...But last fall, in a groundbreaking 
article, respected law reporter Stuart Taylor tracked down 
several new witnesses whose testimony persuaded him that Jones 
was probably telling the truth. And he noticed something else: 
women's groups who like Bill Clinton's policies had failed to 
rally to Jones's cause." 
<p>
<dd>
Taylor's story, with the new witness accounts, came out in 
late October. If the article was so "groundbreaking" why did CBS 
wait over ten weeks to report anything about it? 
<p>
<dd>
On Monday's NBC Nightly News Jim Miklaszewski noted in his 
overview of the case that when Jones first made her charges "Most 
mainstream media barely touched it. Others, like Newsweek's Evan 
Thomas, fell for the White House spin." 
<br>
<dd>    
Following a soundbite from Thomas, the Mik continued: "But an 
investigation by American Lawyer magazine showed that Paula Jones 
appeared to have a strong case for sexual harassment, even 
stronger than Anita Hill's claim against Justice Clarence Thomas. 
Reporter Stuart Taylor blames the media's initial negative 
reaction to Jones on political and cultural bias."
<br>
<dd>    
Taylor: "She was widely dismissed in the back rooms of the 
press conversations as Southern trailer park trash. Why should we 
listen to her."
<br>
<dd>    
Miklaszewski: "And by the time Jones' case hit the Supreme 
Court she made the cover of Newsweek."
<br>
<dd>    
Thomas: "If you really look at the facts of the case she is 
worth taking seriously."
<br>
<dd>    
Miklaszewski: "Paula Jones's attorneys say there's still time 
to cut a deal and avoid a trial if President Clinton would 
apologize. The President's lawyers had no comment."
<p>
<dd>
As with CBS, Taylor (who was on Meet the Press Sunday) made 
his first Nightly News appearance two and a half months after his 
article appeared. It's nice that some in the media are 
acknowledging their bias, at least with this issue, but may I 
suggest that their failure to report anything about Taylor's 
story reflects a continuation of that bias more than two years 
after Jones filed her suit in May 1994. 
<P>
<a name="4">
<dd>
4) Wednesday's Washington Times and USA Today carried 
stories on how Vice President Al Gore admitted to the AP that he 
used "a poor choice of words" when he insisted an April 1996 
fundraiser at a Buddhist Temple was nothing more than a 
"community outreach" event. The AP noted that three days before 
the event the DNC sent Gore a memo explaining how he should 
"extend appreciation for participant support and inspire 
political and fundraising efforts."
<p>
<dd>
Network coverage for this admission of earlier false 
statements? A full story by Brooks Jackson on CNN, but no mention 
on the Tuesday or Wednesday ABC, CBS and NBC evening news shows.
<P>
<a name="5">
<dd>
5) Appearing on CNN's Larry King Weekend on Saturday, 
January 4 NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell suggested the issue 
of large donors staying overnight at the White House will become 
a big issue in 1997. As transcribed by since-departed MRC intern 
Jessica Anderson, Mitchell asserted:
<br>
<dd>    
"I've been working on that story and I kind of think that 
even though Republicans in the past have had their big 
contributors and have abused the soft money contributions, the 
money that doesn't have to be accounted for, people understand 
the selling of the Lincoln bedroom. You know, when the Lincoln 
bedroom becomes the Motel 6, that resonates with the American 
people."
<p>
<dd>
How will this "resonate" with the American people when the 
story Mitchell claims she's "been working on" has yet to be 
reported by her? The Washington Post revealed the Motel 6 
arrangements in a front page story on Sunday, December 15. Today 
show that morning and the next: no mention. There was no NBC 
Nightly News Sunday night on the east coast, but the next night 
NBC did run a Mitchell piece on Clinton's defense fund returning 
donations. On December 17 Mitchell contributed another story on 
the defense fund. She didn't do another political story until 
January 3, but still no mention of the Lincoln Bedroom.
<P>
<a name="6">
<dd>
6) The Motel 6 story isn't the only Clinton scandal news 
ignored by NBC Nightly News. The day after Christmas the 
Democratic National Committee released a huge pile of documents 
on their fundraising activities. The papers showed how foreign 
donors to the DNC got special access to the White House and 
Clinton. The New York Times ran a big piece on the December 27 
front page. The Washington Post ran a lengthy story on December 
29. 
<br>
<dd>
The December 26 CBS Evening News led with the revelations and 
followed up with another story the next night. But not ABC or 
NBC. Neither ABC's World News Tonight or the NBC Nightly News 
uttered a word either night about the latest embarrassing 
revelation for Clinton. On December 27 ABC did run a story on 
Newt Gingrich losing support. John Cochran concluded: "Everyone, 
Republican and Democrat alike, agrees Gingrich is fortunate that 
his troubles have come over the holidays when most Americans 
aren't paying much attention." When it came to Clinton, ABC wasn't 
paying attention.
<p>
<dd>
Examining the same papers, in a front page USA Today story on 
December 30, reporter Tom Squitieri relayed: 
<br>
<dd>   
"The documents also show that Democrats were ready in case 
questions arose about the strategy [of coordinating DNC, White 
House and Clinton-Gore campaign activities to maximize 
fundraising.] For example, those caught in scandals were advised 
'don't lie' in one DNC memo. Next they were to 'announce an 
internal investigation, independent investigation or white paper 
to examine the matter' in order to buy time. Finally, they were 
to 'impugn the source,' the DNC advised."
<p>
<dd>
Network coverage of this cynical and divisive plan? Zilch. 
<P>
<a name="7">
<dd>
7) Dan Rather was the guest on Monday's Larry King Live on 
CNN (January 13). Here's a very illuminating exchange:
<br>
<dd>    
Larry King: "I'm told by our producers, that a lot of calls, 
so rather than make it microscopic here, are complaining about 
advocates being hired by television stations. Shapiro was on one 
side in the Simpson trial, he's hired. Stephanopoulos is now at 
ABC -- that we're not getting balance."
<br>
<dd>    
Dan Rather: "I think that's a valid criticism. I'm concerned 
about it. Look, a Bill Moyers came out of the Lyndon Johnson 
White House and became one of the great journalists of all time."
<br>
<dd>    
King: "But a major liberal, self-confessed."
<br>
<dd>    
Rather: "Ah, is he? I don't want to get into that, but he was 
terrific. I do think, personal opinion, it's gone too far. Here's 
what concerns me. In some cases, and I don't exclude CBS News 
from this criticism, what happens is they're brought on to, and 
they're allowed to give their opinion on the air and we don't say 
this is their opinion. They go into some political or highly 
partisan ideological rant, from where I sit. I have no objection 
to that being done, but I think it needs to be clearly labeled 
and also the other side or other sides need to be given a chance. 
I think this is valid criticism. I'm glad to hear the public is 
picking up on it."
<p>
<dd>
Good to hear that after 15 years as anchor Rather has finally 
noticed that the "public is picking up" on media bias.
<p>
<dd>
Back in 1989 PBS re-ran an anti-Reagan 1982 CBS Reports 
special narrated by Moyers. After the show, Moyers announced: 
"The documentary has held up as both true and sadly prophetic. 
While Congress restored some of the cuts made in those first 
Reagan budgets, in the years since, the poor and the working poor 
have born the brunt of the cost of the Reagan Revolution. The 
hardest hit programs have been welfare, housing and other anti-
poverty measures...Meanwhile, rich people got big tax breaks. And 
the middle class kept most of its subsidies intact. As a result, 
the Reagan years brought on a wider gap between rich and poor."

<dd>
Even Larry King realizes that's liberal.

     1) CompuServe has solved the problem that led to all those 
Apparently To lines that many of you received in the last four 
CyberAlerts. I've tested messages to two non-CompuServe e-mail 
addresses I have and all seems to work as it did before this 
problem arose in mid-December. 
<BR>
<DD>    
	Since the last CyberAlert my computer, on which the address 
list is saved, died. As a result, with the help of interns Joe 
Alfonsi and Jessica Anderson, we've restored the list from a 
couple of weeks old back up copy. But, some of you may now get 
two copies and others who had unsubscribed may be on the list.  
Please reply and we'll fix the error.
<BR>
<DD>
<P>
<a name="2">
    2) The January 10 New York Times ran a transcript of a 
December 21 phone call among top Republican aides and 
Congressmen, including Newt Gingrich. At least one participant 
was on a cellular phone in Florida, allowing someone there to 
pick up and record the call. 
<BR>
<DD>
    Anyone can monitor any communications in the airwaves from 
phone calls to police dispatching, but it's always violated 
federal law to divulge information you hear to a third party or 
to use it to evade law enforcement officers. However a few years 
ago Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 
which specifically banned the sale of equipment that could 
receive cellular frequencies (though it is still legal to listen 
in since any such ban would never stand constitutional 
challenge). Although the ECPA is really meaningless since the way 
scanners work allow you to easily overcome this block, the New 
York Times must know that by publishing the transcript in 
probable violation of both communications and phone wiretap laws 
it helped facilitate a felony by who ever gave them the tape. Law 
enforcement officials must get a warrant before they can tape 
cellular calls.
<BR>
<DD>
    But the ethics of the New York Times' isn't what 
concerned Dan Rather Friday night. He stuck to Gingrich. On the 
January 10 CBS Evening News Dan Rather announced: "In Washington 
not just one but two bizarre new twists in the Newt Gingrich 
ethics and tax case. One could further delay public disclosure of 
the details of Gingrich's ethics violations and tax problems at 
an open hearing. The other raises a whole new ethics question 
about Speaker Gingrich. At issue, what he allegedly said in a 
secretly recorded telephone call. From Capitol Hill, Bob 
Schieffer is your guide to these latest twists and turns." 
<BR>
<DD>
    Schieffer reported: "Adding to the turmoil, the New York 
Times got a tape, apparently picked up by a police scanner in 
which Gingrich and top lieutenants are heard on a cell phone 
planning a public relations campaign to counter committee 
allegations, something Gingrich had promised the committee he 
would not do."
<BR>
<DD>    
	Following a soundbite from Republican Congessman John Boehner, 
Schieffer did mote that "Judiciary committee chairman Henry Hyde 
and other Republicans cried foul and urged the Attorney General to 
investigate where the tape came from."
<P>
<a name="3">

    3) On Monday the Supreme Court will hear arguments as to 
whether a President can be subjected while in office to a civil 
lawsuit. When decided later this year the Court will determine 
whether Paula Jones can proceed with her sexual harassment suit 
against Bill Clinton. Sunday's Face the Nation, This Week and 
Late Edition are scheduled to take up the Jones case, but...
<BR>
<DD>
    Three weeks before the Speaker vote the networks began 
running stories on ethical charges surrounding Newt Gingrich. The 
networks have provided no such coverage in the weeks leading up to the 
Jones case. Through Friday night the network evening news shows 
had yet to do a story on Paula Jones, though the January 7 CNN 
Inside Politics ran a piece by Bruce Morton on media coverage of 
her case that included a soundbite from the MRC's Tim Graham. 
Tonight (Saturday) neither ABC's World News Saturady or the NBC 
Nightly News mentioned Jones. (The CBS Evening News did bring on 
consultant Laura Ingraham to discuss the topic.)
<BR>
<DD>
    Still, on Friday's (January 10) Washington Week in Review on 
PBS host Ken Bode asserted: "Paula Jones, of all the things the 
Clinton White House faces - Filegate, Travelgate, Asian money  -- 
this is the one the White House seems most worried about. The 
coverage of the Paula Jones case languished until the American 
Lawyer magazine ran this cover story by Stuart Taylor called `Her 
Case Against Clinton.' And this week Newsweek put Paula Jones on 
the cover."
<BR>
<DD>
    Yes, Newsweek did put Jones on the cover this week, but the 
Stuart Taylor piece on the controversy Bode says "the White House 
seems most worried about," did not generate a single broadcast 
network news story other than a portion of one ABC story. Back on 
October 31 ABC's World News Tonight ran a story by Jeff 
Greenfield on why scandals don't hurt Clinton. Among the reasons 
he listed was liberal bias and to illustrate he allowed Stuart 
Taylor to charge: "Imagine if Paula Jones or someone just like 
her made allegations, just like this, with evidence just like 
this, against Jesse Helms or Newt Gingrich." In the American 
Lawyer Taylor concluded that "the evidence supporting Paula 
Jones's allegations of predatory, if not depraved, behavior by 
Bill Clinton is far stronger than the evidence supporting Anita 
Hill's allegations of far less serious conduct by Clarence 
Thomas."
<P>
<a name="4">

     4) While on the non-coverage topic, MediaWatch Associate 
Editor Tim Graham suggested a review of how the media in 1994 
treated the Jones charge. 
<BR>
<DD>
    The June 1994 MediaWatch Study detailed the differences in 
reaction to Anita Hill and Paula Jones. MediaWatch examined the 
ABC, CBS and NBC evening shows, plus the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour 
and CNN's World News. MediaWatch explained: "On Sunday, October 
6, 1991 Anita Hill's story broke. In the five days before 
hearings began (October 6-10), all the networks led with Hill 
every night except CNN, which led with the story three times...
The five programs aired 67 stories in five days...
<BR>
<DD>    "When Paula Jones announced her charges on February 11 this 
year [1994], only ABC reported the story -- for 16 seconds. That's 
67 to 1. None of the evening shows touched it again until May 4, 
the day The Washington Post ran its long-delayed investigation of 
Jones. CNN's Wolf Blitzer led World News with it. ABC and CNN 
read brief stories on May 5. On May 6, the day Jones filed suit, 
all five networks covered the story, but none led the newscast 
with it. Only ABC and PBS did more than one story. In the first 
six days of the Jones story -- May 4-9 -- the networks reported 15 
stories, or less than three stories a day, for a Hill-Jones ratio 
of 67 to 15."
<P>
<a name="5">

     5) Dan Rather announced on the January 8 CBS Evening News: 
"In Miami today an armored truck overturned on an overpass and 
its doors flew open. Millions of dollars in bills and coins 
spilled out and before police could get control of the situation, 
hundreds people moved in and helped themselves to as much cash as 
they could grab. No tally yet on how much was actually lost."

    Rather provided a straight-forward report. But not ABC's 
Peter Jennings who felt compelled to put the story of thievery 
into a moral relativism/sociological analysis that suggested 
the thieves were justified: 
    "In Miami today, in the poor section of the city called 
Overtown, an armored car carrying a great deal of money flipped 
over during the morning rush hour. The police describe what 
happened next as pandemonium."
    Then, as viewers saw video of the scene, Jennings continued:
"It is a poor and needy neighborhood where the Brinks truck 
turned over and the money came tumbling out."
    Police officer: "Apparently, the word has spread that 
something like Pennies from Heaven."
    Jennings: "Quarters actually, along with the bills. Four 
hundred thousand dollars is missing according to Brinks. And 
while keeping any of the money certainly constitutes theft, many 
people here thought it was clearly more about need and good 
fortune."
    Man: "I think the whole neighborhood's up here this morning. 
I did deserve it. You know, these hard working people don't make 
enough money. God sent a truck."
    Jennings: "A Brinks team came in to recover what they could -
- they're the ones with the shovels -- but people were still 
searching by hand several hours later."

<P>
<a name="6">
     6) On NBC's Tonight Show with Jay Leno Wednesday night 
(January 8) ABC's Sam Donaldson compared Newt Gingrich's 
political strategy to Lenin's murderous tyranny: 
    "You know, the real smart guys are the ones who don't walk in the 
room and say, 'I'm the smart guy, I'm so brilliant.' They walk in 
the room and they let you find it out for, and you come in and 
say, 'Hey, you're a smart guy,' and they say, 'Oh, no, no, not 
me,' and then they . . . [trails off] Newt Gingrich's problem, 
I've always thought, he's like Lenin. They both made a revolution 
by shooting people -- Newt shot Democrats, Lenin shot everybody -- 
and then they didn't have sense enough to stop shooting once they 
won. So, I mean, once you win, you say, 'Okay, now I've shot all 
your relatives, but you're a good guy, let's work together.' 
Instead, Newt shut down the government and kept on trying to 
shoot Democrats."

    Imagine the reaction if Newt joked about how Bill Clinton 
acted like Hitler.  

<P>
<a name="7">
     7) It's barely been a week since the networks began 
providing ratings for their entertainment shows to help guide 
parents. But what do the ratings really mean? Most shows have 
been tagged as "TVPG" with fewer getting the more mild "TVG" to 
identify shows okay everyone to watch or the "TV14" rating for 
shows producers feel is inappropriate for those under 14.
<BR>
    CBS rates the Late Show with David Letterman a "TVPG." I'm a 
big Letterman fan and at 11:35pm ET it's aimed at an adult/older 
teen audience. So, is TVPG the correct rating for a show which 
included the following comedy bit Friday night?
<BR>
<DD>    During the letters from viewers segment Letterman read one 
which asked: "Is Andy Rooney older than the Statue of Liberty?"
Letterman said that the question provided an opportunity to 
introduce a new segment called "Biff Henderson, Resident Genius."
    Biff Henderson, a stagehand, then responded: "Dave, let me 
ask you a question. Do you have a mirror?"
    Letterman: "A mirror, no, not on me, why Biff?"
    Biff Henderson: "Because I want to see if I look like I give 
a rat's ass."
    Letterman: "That doesn't sound much like Biff Henderson, 
Resident Genius."
    Biff Henderson: "Oh, I'm sorry Dave. I thought we were doing 
Biff Henderson, Quick-Witted Son of a Bitch."
<BR>
<DD>
    You have to be 16 to sit in Letterman's Ed Sullivan Theater 
audience.

<a name="1">
1) "Conservatives dislike Gumbel so much that he's a regular
in the Media Research Center's bi-weekly Notable Quotables, a
compilation of comments by the 'liberal media.'" So noted USA
Today's Peter Johnson in a January 2 front page story. After a
quote from the MRC's Brent Bozell on Gumbel's ideology, Gumbel
defended himself but in so doing more than confirmed that he's a
dedicated liberal:
<BR>
<DD>    
"I don't know if I have a liberal bent,' Gumbel says. 'But if
it is fair to say it's very difficult for a black man in this
country to be of a conservative bent. That's a fair statement.
It's very difficult to be an African-American male, and have an
African-American son who is going to be 18 years of age, and hear
things like cops want to crack down and send more to prison, to
hear calls for tougher statutes, less welfare, less programs for
the poor, and less things for people of color. If that says I'm
not conservative, so be it."
<BR>
<DD>   
One wonders how welfare reform or arresting criminals will personally
impact a millionaire and his law-abiding family.
<BR>
<DD>   
The compilation of Gumbel quotes sent with the last CyberAlert
has led to some significant play for the quotes, including a
Washington Times editorial on Friday and a column Sunday in the
Ft. Worth Star-Telegram by WBAP's Mark Davis.
<P>
<a name="2">
2) In the midst of NBC's Friday morning (January 3) Today
tribute to Bryant Gumbel (which featured a lot of kissing among
men), Gumbel's replacement, Matt Lauer, offered some effusive
praise. As caught by MRC analyst Jim Forbes, Lauer asserted: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"I'm gonna tell you that in my opinion and many other opinions
you are the best interviewer on television, you are fair, you are
compassionate, you're probing, you always do the right thing. You
have shown me and created such a terrific example and set such
high standards for me. But most importantly beside from the
professional things you've done for me, I thank you for your
friendship. You have been my best friend over these past four
years and I'll miss working with you every day but I know we'll
see each other a lot."
<P>
<a name="3">
3) Clueless in Chicago. James Warren, Washington Bureau
Chief for the Chicago Tribune appeared on C-SPAN's December 27
Washington Journal, by coincidence the same day The Washington
Times ran MRC Chairman Brent Bozell's column on the Best Notable
Quotables on 1996. MRC intern Joe Alfonsi transcribed the
exchange. 
<BR>
<DD>    
Brian Lamb observed: "Chicago Tribune again is in the news
this morning in Brent Bozell's column. Now if you knew that,
do you know Brent Bozell?"
    James Warren: "I know who he is, yeah."
    Lamb: "Do you know what side of the political fence he 
comes down on?"
    Warren: "Yes."
    Lamb: "What?"
    Warren: "Yes. Very, very, very right of Brian Lamb."    
    Lamb: (Laughter) "Anyway, he has a column in the 
Washington Times and the headline is, 'Quotes of note for 
the past year' and I just want to read you the first 
paragraph. 'On September the 5th the Chicago Tribune issued this 
remarkable correction. Quote, In her Wednesday commentary 
column, Linda Bowles stated that President Clinton and his 
former campaign adviser Dick Morris both were guilty of 
callous unfaithfulness to their wives and children. Neither 
man has admitted to being or been proven to have been 
unfaithful. The Tribune regrets the error.' It goes on to 
say, 'Now if that strikes you as just about the dumbest 
quote you ve heard all year, then you would be agreeing with 
the panel of 57 judges who bid adieu to 1996 by selecting 
the Media Research Center's ninth annual Best Notable 
Quotables, noting the years worst reporting.'"
<BR>
<DD>    
Warren then responded, but confused Bozell with Bowles and
missed the whole concept that the quote of interest was the
Tribune correction, not the Bowles column: "If that's the best Mr.
Bowles could come up with, slow year. Linda Bowles is a syndicated
columnist who runs in the Tribune occasionally. That's one I
missed."
<BR>
<DD>
Since that last CyberAlert, the "Best of" quotes were the focus
of a December 29 Ray Archer column in the Arizona Republic, and
the entire editorial space in the December 31 New York Post and
January 1 Manchester (NH) Union Leader. Plus the topic on many
radio talk show hosts.
<P>
<a name="4"> 
4) On the December 28 Capital Gang on CNN Time's Margaret
Carlson asserted "If we didn't have Newt Gingrich having 
brought down Jim Wright on, on, I think, picayune, as picayune as
this, then I think there would be less hostility towards him at
this moment."
<BR>
<DD>   
Andrew Ferguson of The Weekly Standard countered: "Jim Wright
was trying to line his own pockets in the most sordid, squalid
sort of way...."
<BR>
<DD>   
Referring to Gingrich, Carlson shot back: "But he was lining
his own personal power pockets, which is just as bad."
<BR>
<DD>
A bit later Carlson said: "Jim Wright sold books to, you know,
people coming to his speeches and Newt Gingrich took money for
needy children and used it for his college course."
<BR>
<DD>
The next day on Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver
asked U.S. Rep. Chris Shays (R-CT): "Not just maybe from a
technical point of view, but you had the Speaker, somebody who led
the assault on Jim Wright, he never ended up getting prosecuted,
he never broke the law. Doesn't the Speaker's credibility kind of
get diminished by this and doesn't he become a symbol of somebody
who broke the rules as opposed to somebody who followed the rules?
Doesn't this give you a credibility problem?"
<BR>
<DD>
As Robert Novak pointed out last week, the "took money from
needy children" charge is preposterous. To avoid the lengthy
process of creating a foundation to produce a television show,
Gingrich simply took control of a foundation aimed at helping
children, but which was inactive and had no money.
<BR>
<DD>    
Wright may not have gone through the criminal system, but he
resigned when his pocket-lining was revealed. As a December 30
Washington Times editorial explained, "To get around a House limit
on honoraria for speaking engagements, Mr. Wright and a long-time
crony set up a phoney book publishing deal in which Mr. Wright got
an astonishing 55 percent royalty...The Speaker's office then
encouraged organizations to buy the book in bulk as a quid pro quo
for an appearance...The committee found that Mr. Wright improperly
pocketed $54,600 from 1984 to 1987 from this ruse."
<P>
<a name="5"> 
5) As they always do at the end of the year, the Associated
Press surveyed newspaper editors and broadcast news directors to
determine the top 10 stories of the year. Number 6 on the list:
"Welfare Ends." In AP's story on the poll reporter Helen O'Neill
began the welfare item: "Acknowledging that the new law was
'seriously flawed,' President Clinton signed it anyway, ending
welfare as we know it." After summarizing the key changes, O'Neill
provided this less than balanced assessment of its impact: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"Supporters said the new law would get people on their feet,
but criticism came from many quarters: from states that said they
couldn't meet the deadlines, from social workers who said the new
system will plunge more people into poverty, from three top
federal officials who resigned in protest. 'I think a lot of
people will start starving,' said Shawn Cornett, a 22-year-old
welfare recipient in Kentucky."
<P>
<a name="6">
6) CBS News can report whatever it wants, but Walter
Cronkite doesn't think the First Amendment should apply to
everyone. Asked in the December 28 TV Guide "What do you think of
the Internet?" Cronkite offered this contradictory response (Read
this all the way through, especially the last sentence):
<BR>
<DD>    
"It's at the moment highly dangerous; I hope that we pacify it
in the near future. A three-page, very slickly done presentation
alleged that I was drunk in an Orlando restaurant and spit in a
man's soup. And no way to trace it whatsoever. It seems to me that
these sources of so called information should have to identify
themselves. There should be a sense of responsibility placed upon
them to stand behind what they report. I just abhor any form of
censorship, but I do not think there's anything wrong at all with
banning anonymous information."
<BR>
<DD>
Hey, we're not all as gullible as Pierre Salinger. 
<P>
<a name="7">
7) In the James Brady "In Step With" interview in Sunday's
(January 5) Parade magazine Brady profiled Today weather reader Al
Roker. Brady related what prompted Roker to lose weight: "Let's
get down to the real news: losing all that weight. 'I'm 5 feet 8
and weight 255 right now, down from 310,' said Al. 'Last February
I was dressing one morning, and my daughter came in and said, 'You
have enormous breasts.' So I went to a gym."
<P>
<a name="8">
8) Update: The "Apparently To..." problem many of you are
experiencing is caused by a "bug" in CompuServe's new mail
software that we were switched to in mid-December. I have had
conversations with Customer Service about trying to rectify this
inability to blind copy outside of CompuServe, but they are unable
to tell me how soon this will be resolved. In some cases the BC
names are being listed as CC. On the bright side, this is not a
problem with all e-mail software and some services, like AOL, bury
the list so most on AOL have probably never noticed it.
<BR>
<DD>    
Thanks to the over 100 of you who made me aware of the problem
and provided examples which I was able to forward as evidence to
CompuServe Customer Service. For those concerned about the
security of their e-mail address I am sorry and I delayed this
CyberAlert hoping the problem could be resolved. But, keep in mind
that it's the same group of 40 to 50 recipients who are seeing
your address each time, not new names each time or the whole 1,200
name list.

1) At the top of the Time magazine Man of the Year special
that CNN ran Monday night (December 23) at 10pm ET the Time
editors who picked the AIDS researcher explained why some others
were not chosen. As transcribed by MRC analyst Steve Kaminski,
our news division Officer in Charge this past week, here's what
Time Deputy Managing Editor James Kelly asserted: 
<BR>
<DD>    
"Netanyahu was a possibility because his election was quite a
surprise. He had a lot of people hoping that he would in fact
grow in the job and become a peacemaker and so far that hasn't
happened."
<p>
<DD>
This very week Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has agreed to
follow the peace treaty and turn over another town, Hebron, to
the Palestinians. Meanwhile, as Jeff Jacoby, the Boston Globe's
conservative columnist pointed out December 26, the Palestinian
Authority (PA) continues to violate the Oslo Accords. On December
11 members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
fired into a car and killed a Jewish mother and her 12-year-old
son. Yasir Arafat refuses to let Israel prosecute the gunmen
despite, as Jacoby noted, "the explicit mandate of the Oslo
Accords which...obligates the Palestinian Authority to arrest and
extradite criminal suspects. (Israel has made 27 extradition
requests since the accords were signed. The Palestinian Authority
has denied them all.)"
<p>
<DD>
The accords also demanded that the PLO eliminate from its
charter the plank calling for the extermination of Israel. The
PLO has yet to comply. Sounds like it's Arafat who needs to "grow
in the job and become a peacemaker." 

<P>
<a name="2">
2) Under the headline "Clinton Budget to Offer Tax Relief:
Proposal Would Avoid Trims in Social Security Increases," the
December 25 Boston Globe ran a piece from Martin Crutsinger of
the Associated Press. In the eighth paragraph the AP Washington
bureau staffer wrote:
<BR>
<DD>    
"The President has called a balanced budget the top priority
of his second term. An attempt to accomplish that feat last
winter ended in bitter deadlock with the Republican-controlled
Congress."
<p>
<DD>
Gee, now that's why Clinton refused to sign the budget
resolutions. He wanted to balance the budget and those nasty
Republicans wouldn't let him.   

<P>
<a name="3">
3) In the December 23 Time magazine President Bruce Hallett
reported in his To Our Readers box: "Last month the New York
Association of Black Journalists honored us with four awards."
Among the winners: "National correspondent Jack E. White for the
second consecutive year received two prizes: one for 'overall
excellence in writing and reporting,' the other for his column,
Dividing Line."
<BR>
<DD>    
Hallett quoted White's reaction: "The goal in my column and
in other stories is to examine and expose some of the nonsense
that Americans continue to believe about race. Generally, whites
tend to downplay the extent of their racism -- and blacks tend to
overplay it. We could use a lot more openness and honesty."
<p>
<DD>
Well, let's go the Best Notable Quotables of 1996: The Ninth
Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting and see for what quote
White won the Timothy McVeigh Award (for blaming conservatives 
for violence).
<BR>
<DD>    
"The torching of black churches throughout the South
punctuates the ugly rhetoric of the Buchanan campaign....In fact,
all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to Pete
Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting white
resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of the New
Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder if their
coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past 18 months,
while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative
action, more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern
and Border states have been torched....there is already enough
evidence to indict the cynical conservatives who build their
political careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of
race-baiting. They may not start fires, but they fan the flames."
<BR>
-- Time national correspondent Jack E. White, March 18 issue.
<p>
<DD>
White should know a lot about "nonsense."

5) By my count Bryant Gumbel has co-hosted Today just seven
mornings in December, but I assume he'll be back most of the
December 30-January 3 week, his last. USA Today "Inside TV"
columnist Peter Johnson reported December 23 that CBS and ABC and
are fighting to land Gumbel: "ABC News is considered the front-runner, 
but ABC News chief Roone Arledge says not to count out NBC, which he 
predicts will make 'a major move to keep him.' Gumbel 'is terrific. 
Anybody would love to have him.'" Anybody, that is, interested in 
promoting liberals and denigrating conservatives.
<p>
<DD>
Below is the December 30 edition of Notable Quotables, the
MRC's bi-weekly compilation of the latest outrageous, sometimes
humorous, quotes in the liberal media. This week: A special good-bye 
salute to Bryant Gumbel, our bountiful Babylon of biased bombast. 
<P>
<center><i>December 30, 1996 (Vol. Nine; No. 27)</i></center>
<P>
<center><b>BYE-BYE BRYANT:</b> Gumbel's Years of Liberal Advocacy</center>
<P>
<b>Editor's Note:</b> January 3 will be Bryant Gumbel's last day after
15 years as co-host of NBC's Today. Here are highlights from 1989
through 1996. 
<p>
<center>1989</center>
<p>
"Blacks have looked at the past eight years and seen this
administration retreat from civil rights, retreat from
affirmative action, make South Africa no priority, continue to
see a greater disparity economically between blacks and whites,
foster a spirit of racism that hasn't been seen in 20-plus
years."<br> 
-- To Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater, January 19
Today.
<P>
"Largely as a result of the policies and priorities of the Reagan
administration, more people are becoming poor and staying poor in
this country than at any time since World War II."<br>
-- July 17 Today.
<p>
"This test is not going to tell you whether you're a racist or a
liberal."<br>
-- Previewing his prime-time special The Racial Attitudes and Consciousness Exam, 
 September 5 Today.
<p>
<center>1990</center>
<p>
"It is certain the President won't mention the T word, and yet
taxes are very much at the heart of what all our potential
solutions are. How long can both sides pretend that a hike's not
needed?"<br>
-- January 31.
<P>
"The missteps, poor efforts, and setbacks brought on by the
Reagan years have made this a more sober Earth Day. The task
seems larger now." <br>
-- April 20 Today.
<p>
"The bottom line is more tax money is going to be needed....It's
a Wednesday morning, a day when the budget picture, frankly,
seems gloomier than ever. It now seems the time has come to pay
the fiddler for our costly dance of the Reagan years."<br> 
-- Gumbel leading off Today, May 9.
<p>
<center>1991</center>
<p>
"Tonight the NBC News program Expos, looks at incidence of sexual
harassment in [federal low-income] housing....Well, I guess
that's where the problem began. Actually, it was when the budget
was taken out of the affordable housing market during the Reagan
years and thus, the problem came about."<br> 
-- To reporter Michele Gillen, September 20 Today.
<p>
Reporter Lea Thompson: "...So you can't depend on government
police to do this for you. We did find this flammable sleepwear
everywhere we went."
<br>
Gumbel: "Lea, Lea, real quick. Why is the government abdicating
its responsibility on this? Is this another holdover from the
Reagan years and the cutbacks?"
<br>
Thompson: "Absolutely. And somebody's gotta do something."<br> 
--Exchange on Today, November 13.
<p>
<center>1992</center>
<br>
"The boom years following World War II saw the economy take off,
giving rise to the growth of the great American middle class. The
rising standard of living meant homes, cars, TVS, college for the
kids -- all in all, a piece of the American dream. But in the
Reagan years, economic erosion set in, so much so that the middle
class now finds itself in ever-deepening trouble."<br> 
-- January 22 Today.
<P>
"We keep looking for some good to come out of this. Maybe it
might help in putting race relations on the front burner after
they've been subjugated so long as a result of the Reagan years."
<br>
-- On the Los Angeles riots, April 30, 1992 Today (Gumbel refused
to condemn the rioters).
<p>
<center>1993</center> 
<p>
"It's early yet, but for at least trying to address the deficit
in a more serious fashion than anyone in 12 years, what kind of
early marks do you give Bill Clinton?"<br> 
-- To author Gerald Swanson, March 17 Today.
<p>
"In the greedy excesses of the Reagan years, the mean income of
the average physician nearly doubled, from $88,000 to $170,000.
Was that warranted?"<br> 
-- To the AMA's Richard Corlin, March 31 Today.
<p>
"If I'm a young black man in South Central L.A., where poverty is
rampant and unemployment is skyrocketing, I see that Washington's
promises of a year ago have gone unfulfilled, I see that perhaps
for a second time, the court's inability to mete out justice in a
blind fashion, why shouldn't I vent my anger?"<br> 
-- To U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), April 15 Today.
<P>
<center>1994</center>
<P>
"It's been written that being black in America is like being a
witness at your own lynching. Why didn't your experience make you
more resentful than you are today?"<br> 
-- To criminal-turned-Washington Post reporter Nathan McCall, March 22 Today.
<P>
"We've got an awful lot to talk about this week, including the
sexual harassment suit against the President. Of course, in that
one, it's a little tough to figure out who's really being
harassed." <br>
-- Today, May 10.
<P>
"You're aligned to a party which owes many of its victories to
the so-called religious right and other conservative extremists
who are historically insensitive to minority concerns. That
doesn't bother you?"<br> 
-- To U.S. Rep.-elect J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), November 9 Today.
<P>
<center>1995</center>
<p>
"You called Gingrich and his ilk, your words, 'trickle-down
terrorists who base their agenda on division, exclusion, and
fear.' Do you think middle class Americans are in need of
protection from that group?" <br>
-- To about-to-be House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, January 4 Today.
<p>
"Janet Reno has asked for an independent counsel to investigate
charges against HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros. Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown is being investigated. Questions have been raised about
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. Agriculture Secretary
Mike Espy resigned under pressure, as did Surgeon General
Joycelyn Elders. The Clinton White House seems to be having a
hard time retaining high-profile minorities particularly. Do you
think, Senator, they are being held to a higher standard in
Washington than their white predecessors?"<br> 
-- To Senator Ted Kennedy, March 15 Today.
<p>
"This comes at a time when Republicans are looking to gut the
Clean Water Act and also the Safe Drinking Water Act. What are
our options? Are we now forced to boil water because bottled
water is not an economically feasible option for a lot of
people?" <br>
-- To Natural Resources Defense Council lawyer Erik Olson, June 1 Today.
<P>
"Two weeks after his acquittal, we'll see how O.J. Simpson is
still being treated as if he were guilty."<br> 
-- October 16 Today.
<p>
<center>1996</center>
<p>
"While he appeared to be empathetic, his policies caused enormous
suffering for those who were least able to afford it."<br> 
--Referring to Ronald Reagan on the October 10 MSNBC InterNight.

<li><a href="#1"> In October Tim Russert called a Clinton scandal development
"dead serious."</a> On Friday he called another revelation "deadly
serious." But, again, it's hardly big news on NBC.
<li><a href="#2"> ABC's Cokie Roberts insisted nobody can "not be appalled"</a> at

<li><a href="#6"> Eleanor Clift announced her year-end awards.</a> She bashed Dornan

</ol>
<p>
<a name="1">
<dd>
1) To set up today's first item we need to review a comment
from Tim Russert and media coverage from late October. On October
25 a panel of judges authorized independent counsel Kenneth Starr
to investigate whether former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum
lied about his knowledge of Hillary Clinton's involvement in the
FBI files matter.
<br>
<dd>    
On the October 28 Today, NBC's Tim Russert insisted: "This is 
dead serious. I mean the ethical problems of the Clinton Administration 
are now troubling even to the most partisan Democrats."
<br>
<dd>        
So how much emphasis did the networks give this "dead serious"
development? The CBS Evening News didn't mention the news. On
ABC's World News Tonight anchor Forrest Sawyer read a brief item.
And how did Russert's NBC, where he is Washington Bureau Chief,
treat a story that he insists can't be dismissed nine days before
election day? NBC Nightly News offered viewers only a brief item
read by anchor Brian Williams. 
<p>
<dd>    
Now, fast forward to the Friday Today show of December 20.
Katie Couric interviewed Russert at about 7:20am. After asking
about Newt Gingrich she turned to the President and the decision
of Justice Department officials to probe Clinton's defense fund. 
<br>
<dd>        
Russert explained:
<br>
<dd>        
"Career officials in the public integrity section. Yesterday,
another bombshell. They we're not only going to look into
President Clinton re-election campaign fundraising, they're going to
look into fundraising for his legal defense fund. And they
subpoenaed documents throughout Washington. This is deadly
serious, Katie. It is career, professional investigators in the
Justice Department who are going to prove their independence. And
this investigation into the President's campaign and legal
campaign fund is going to be exhaustive and people at the White
House are quite concerned this morning."
<p>
<dd>    
Well they needn't worry about TV network coverage. The 7am
Today newscast didn't mention this development nor the front page
Washington Post story that day which revealed how Clinton had
included in a fundraising gathering the head of the Chinese arms
manufacturer accused of smuggling weapons into the U.S. But Today
dedicated three minutes to two stories on OJ. In fact, the defense
fund subpoena development was overshadowed by the Newt Gingrich
case. Here's a network evening show breakdown:
<p>
<dd>    
ABC's World News Tonight: On December 19 ABC ignored the
defense fund subpoenas, but did find time for a brief item on the
status of Newt Gingrich. On December 20: nothing.
<br>
<dd>        
CBS Evening News: On December 19 CBS aired a full Phil Jones
story on Gingrich followed by a brief mention from anchor John
Roberts about Clinton. On December 20 CBS was the only one of the
three networks to air a full story on the Chinese arms dealer.
<br>
<dd>    
NBC Nightly News: On December 19 NBC's Tom Brokaw relayed a
short item on Clinton followed by a full story on Gingrich from
reporter Lisa Myers. On December 20 anchor Brian Williams showed a
clip of Clinton commenting on the Chinese arms dealer during his
press conference that day after announcing the latest cabinet
picks. But no full story on NBC on either development.
<P>
<a name="2">
2) On the same theme (of what's big news on Sunday morning
isn't always reported on network newscasts), on the December 22
This Week George Will recalled the December 15 Washington Post
story on how Clinton is "treating the Lincoln Bedroom as Motel 6."
Cokie Roberts chimed in: "It's offensive. It's offensive to
anybody. I mean nobody can look at that and not be appalled."
<p>
<dd>    
Nobody apparently except producers for ABC's World News
Tonight, which failed to report the revelation of how large
contributors get a night in the White House. 
<P>
<a name="3">
3) The December 9 CyberAlert reported how in his first piece
for the New Republic William Powers, a former Washington Post
reporter, showed how the networks underplayed the Clinton
character issue during the campaign. Other reporters have not
appreciated his analysis. Powers and Newsweek's Jonathan Alter
are exchanging a series of memos on the Slate magazine Web
site (www.slate.com). 
<br>
<dd>        
In his December 11 shot Alter called the Powers piece
"ridiculous," contending Clinton's ethics got plenty of coverage.
On December 13 Powers responded: "I am sincerely stunned, and more
than a little intrigued, by the way you and other media watchers
have reacted to my debut New Republic piece. I seem to have broken
some secret, unspoken rule of the club. Your collective tone is of
incredulous disdain, as in: 'Whooooaa, what's up with this new guy?
He's got some ridiculous idea that the coverage of the Clinton
scandals was inadequate. Can you imagine? Must be some raving
right-winger. Is he insane?'"
<p>
<dd>    
Well, welcome to the club Mr. Powers.
<p>
<dd>    
In his December 17 retort, Alter dismissed Powers's series of
examples of under coverage: "As for Filegate, do you honestly
believe that Newsweek, or any other news organization, wouldn't
have loved a good, juicy Craig Livingstone story to liven up
October? Of course we would have. But what are we supposed to do -- 
make one up?"
<p>
<dd>    
Alter should read MediaWatch. As we reported in our October
Study, the networks largely ignored Filegate. On September 25
Senator Orrin Hatch revealed a six month gap in the log which
listed who at the White House accessed the FBI background files.
CNN's World Today did a story and it got one mention on ABC's Good
Morning America. But zilch on CBS and NBC as well as World News
Tonight.
<br>
<dd>        
On October 4 the Senate released the deposition of Mari
Anderson, a former aide to Livingstone. She verified that pages
were missing and that, in contradiction to Livingstone's testimony,
he knew they were getting files on Republicans. The Washington
Post put it on page one, but nothing appeared in the morning or
evening on ABC, CBS or NBC. CNN did note it on The World Today.
<P>
<a name="4">
4) Here's Number 7 from the December 23 Time magazine "Worst
Public Performances of 1996."
<br>
<dd>        
"Robert Dornan. B-1 Bob went ballistic after narrowly losing
his House seat in Orange County, California, to Hispanic financial
analyst Loretta Sanchez. Threatening to sue her for election
fraud, Dornan called Sanchez a 'liar' and said  the whole thing
stinks to high heaven.' Of course, sour grapes were to be expected
from the former fighter pilot who once grabbed a fellow
Congressman by the collar and called him a 'draft-dodging wimp.'
Sanchez's campaign manager, John Sullivan, spoke for many when he
said of Dornan, 'He's been, and continues to be, a national
disgrace. All we can say is Adios.' The bad news is that Dornan
will now have more time for his second job as Rush Limbaugh's
substitute host."
<P>
<a name="5">
5) A question listed in "Walter Scott's Personality Parade"
in the December 15 Parade, the Sunday newspaper magazine, asked
"if the federal budget was ever in the black?" The Parade writer 
explained that Louis Fisher, a political scientist with the Library 
of Congress, reported that there's been a surplus in 27 budgets this 
century. "The other years showed deficits, but most were manageable 
until 1981, when 'President Reagan's plan to increase defense 
spending while cutting taxes threw the deficit into the $200 billion 
range,' says Fisher."
<P>
<a name="6">
6) On this past weekend's McLaughlin Group Newsweek's
Eleanor Clift showed that the gap between the official White House
line and what she mouths is near impossible to quantify. The Group
issued its year-end assessments. Here are a few from Clift:
<p>
-- Biggest Winner: "Linda Sanchez who toppled Bob Dornan, the
scourge of all thinking people. And also awakened us to the power
of the Hispanic vote, even in Republican stronghold Orange
County."
<br>    
-- Most Decisive Campaign Moment: "Sadly, the flap over the
Indonesian campaign contributions. The only thing that moved the
polls all year. Probably cost the Democrats control of he House."
<br>    
-- Turncoat of the Year: "Sherrie Rowlands, the lady of the
night who ratted on Dick Morris and tarnished what would otherwise
have been a big win for him." 
<br>    
-- Fairest Rap: "My fairest rap is like Clarence's [Page], that 
Ken Starr is a partisan Republican. True, true, true." 
<br>    
-- Most Original Thinker: "David Kessler, who came up with the
scientific rationale for the President to launch a war on tobacco."
<br>
<dd>    
John McLaughlin: "So you appreciate that?"
<br>
<dd>        
Clift: "I appreciate it. He called tobacco a drug, an
addictive drug."
<br>
-- Man/Woman of the Year: "I'm going to give it to Madeleine
Albright who broke a very thick glass ceiling, with the help of
President Clinton, and she did it solely on the basis of her
qualifications. Nobody can say she didn't deserve that job,
Secretary of State by the way."
<p>
<dd>    
That's not quite the line many liberals in the media took when
President Bush tapped Clarence Thomas.
<p>
<dd>    
This is the last CyberAlert until after Christmas. So, from
the Media Research Center and the CyberAlert team, Merry Christmas
and/or Happy Holidays.

<H3> 1)</H3><DD>Ronald Reagan left office more than seven years ago,
but he's still fodder for liberal TV script writers. At the
beginning of Wednesday night's Rockford Files movie special on
CBS, "Jim Rockford" (a private investigator played by James
Garner, for those of you who missed the 1970s), arrives at a
birthday party for the father of a former girlfriend he hasn't
seen for 15 years. 
<DD>
Upon seeing Rockford, the father says to him: "I was glad to
hear Megan say that you might show. Hey, I bet the Reagan years
were good to you, huh? S&L investigations, defense contractor
fraud."
<DD>
Rockford responded: "Matter of fact."

<H3>2)</H3><DD>A few hours earlier Wednesday night (September 18) Dan
Rather opened the CBS Evening News: "Bob Dole unloads his
strongest attack yet blaming President Clinton personally and
directly for rising drug crime."
<DD>
He then began the show with this assessment of the themes of
each candidate that put Clinton in a more positive light: 
<DD>
"Bob Dole and Bill Clinton targeted each other today, on
each other's turf. In California Dole gave star billing to
President Clinton in a new attack blaming both the President and
Hollywood for what he says is a lax attitude on drug abuse.
President Clinton's theme today was let's protect the
environment, parks and public lands together. He used the Grand
Canyon as his backdrop to declare almost two million acres of
Utah off limits to developers."
<DD>
Reporter Phil Jones reported on Dole and included some doubt
about the effectiveness of Dole's anti-drug slogan and concluded
by noting that "only eleven percent blame the Clinton
administration for the [drug] problem." Rita Braver then
reported on Clinton move "to stake his claim as the
environmental President." But Braver didn't include any
consideration of how Clinton's move was an anti-property rights
land grab. ABC and NBC at least aired soundbites from upset Utah
Senator Orrin Hatch, but CBS aired no dissenting voice.

<H3>3)</H3><DD>Thursday night's (September 19) InterNight on MSNBC
looked at the San Jose Mercury News story that the CIA 
coordinated cocaine sales in Los Angeles in the 1980s through a
Nicaraguan to pay for the Contras. The guests: the reporter
(Gary Webb), Jesse Jackson, a lawyer for a drug dealer,
Washington talk show host Joe Madison and his buddy, the wacky
as always Dick Gregory. The premise of course is that if the CIA
hadn't provided the drugs the residents of South Central would
not have become addicted to crack.
<DD>Here are a few of host Ed Gordon's less than probing
questions:
<DD>
    -- To Jesse Jackson: "Does it bother you that indeed, and I
think this is where you're going, the hypocrisy that might be
that those who backed the Contras at that time and said it was
for freedom fighters and the like would indeed turn their back
on this country's problems?"
<DD>
    -- To Dick Gregory: "Dick, I know that this is nothing new
to you in the sense of trying to keep people alert to what may
be going on across this country as relates to the government,
but as you compare it to things you've seen and heard in the
past where does this fall?"
<DD>
    -- To Joe Madison: "As Dick was saying, a conspiratorial
thing, something that is genocidal that many African-Americans
whisper and talk about that, or was it simply an economic
situation that they thought this was a quick way to make money
to send to the Contras?"

<H3>4)</H3><DD>Study, from the front page of the September MediaNomics 
published by the MRC's Free Market Project:
<DD><B>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Do Not Deficit Chicken Hawks</B>
<DD>"At the Republican convention, Bob Dole pledged to cut income
taxes by 15 percent, balance the budget, and leave Social
Security and Medicare untouched. Tough-minded reporters believed
none of it and shared their skepticism with a national
television audience," writes the Weekly Standard's David Frum in
the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<DD>But then, according to Frum, "Two weeks later, the Democrats met
in convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth
about their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al
Gore's words, of wanting to `give health insurance rip-off
artists a license to change Medicare, to let this program for
our seniors wither on the vine. That's why they want to replace
Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.' Those remarks are
blatantly untrue, both about the Republican plans and about
Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing."
<DD>Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax
rhetoric than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media
Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about
either tax cuts or Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World Today during the
month of August. The MRC's findings: While network journalists
were ardent deficit hawks when reporting on tax cuts, they lost
their deficit-cutting zeal when Democrats denounced Republican
Medicare plans.
<DD>There were a total of 24 stories during the month that
questioned whether Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the
budget. Only two stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could
erase the deficit while not advancing Medicare reforms in his
second term.
<DD>The reaction to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same
across the networks. "Since Dole would leave Social Security,
Medicare, and defense untouched," reported CBS News
correspondent Phil Jones, "it's still unclear what would be cut
in order to pay for his tax cut." According to CNN's Gene
Randall, "Bob Dole has produced an economic plan that is getting
mixed reviews even from Republicans. The bipartisan Concord
Coalition on Sunday warned against election-year tax-cut
Santas."
<DD>NBC's Mike Jensen offered that "most analysts say it's not good
economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth of the tax cuts would be
paid for by an expanding economy, but the rest would have to
come from spending cuts, and those haven't been spelled out
yet." Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran claimed that "if
critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to budget deficits of the
size of those dating back to the Reagan era, then his campaign
simply isn't going to worry about it for now."
<DD>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics columnist
Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post, pointed
out that in the upcoming years "the only way to avoid (or
minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced
benefits and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On
Medicare, the Republicans proposed precisely such a
shift...Clinton's demolition of this effort confounds the CBO's
sensible advice."
<DD>
Only two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare
alone could be compatible with balanced budgets. "A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade," ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. "So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit
reductions will be impossible to sustain." ABC's Jeff Greenfield
reported that "with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in
about 15 years, those entitlement programs could take every
single dollar of the budget."
<DD>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters concerned about how
to "pay for" automatic Medicare spending increases. If Bill
Clinton won't reform Medicare in his next term, why aren't
reporters asking him which taxes he will raise?

<h3> Quote of the Day:</h3>
"Governor, looking at this platform writing the last week, what
in the world is good in there for a moderate Republican or an
independent voter in this country?" -- CBS correspondent Phil
Jones to Texas Governor George W. Bush, August 11 Face the
Nation.

<h3> Front Page story, Monday, August 12, 1996:</h3>
<p>
<h3>Call GOPers Mean, Intolerant & Hard Line
Media's Unwelcome Greeting</h3>
<p>
Republicans and conservatives came under media assault in the
days  and hours before they assembled at the San Diego Convention
Center. The intolerance of conservatives, their hard line stance
on abortion  and mean-spirited nature were the dominant themes of
weekend coverage  on the networks. Though VP nominee Jack Kemp
largely escaped condemnation,  network analysts used praise of
him as an opportunity to impugn conservatives overall.
<p>
<h3>Inside today's edition:</h3>
<p>
Mean-spirited and hateful  Republicans. CBS, CNN and ABC all
refer to "mean-spirited" conservatives. The Wall Street Journal's
Al Hunt tagged the  platform as "mean-spirited." CNN's Bill
Schneider charged that "they're  supposed to be haters" as "most
conservatives these days," such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
"come across as mean." CNN's Judy Woodruff  said that at least
Kemp does not like the idea of "yanking money away  from welfare
mothers with small children." See page 2.
<p>
Intolerant Republicans Bar Wilson from Speaking. On four Sunday
network mornings shows
Republicans were pounded with 22 questions about why pro-choice
Governors Pete  Wilson and Bill Weld were not going to be allowed
to speak. That's  a dramatic contrast to what happened in 1992
when the networks virtually ignored the Democratic Party decision
to bar pro-life Governor Bill Casey from speaking to their
convention. Wilson apeared on ABC, but  the network didn't
interview Casey in 1992. See page 3.
<p>
"Rogue Elephants" Take Over GOP and Spell Sure Defeat. Using
labels to paint delegates as extremists, CBS aired several
stories about the ominous takeover of the Republican Party by, in
Dan Rather's words, "the hard right." CBS reporter Linda Douglass
worried that if Bob Dole appears to be "under the thumb of
religious conservatives" he'll go down to defeat. See page 4.

<h3> Page Two story, Monday, August 12:</h3>
<p>  
<h3>GOP Called "Mean" & Conservatives Dubbed "Haters"
TV Analysts Turn Nasty</h3>
<p>
A  "mean-spirited" and "divisive" convention attended by "haters"
is how some network reporters and analysts, especially CNN s Bill
Schneider, have described the Republican convention and
conservatives over the past few days. Often, the comment came in
backhanded insults in stories praising Jack Kemp s tolerance.
Here, in date order, are some specific examples:
<p>
CBS s Russ Mitchell. On Friday s CBS This Morning, co-host Russ
Mitchell asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour: "Now the 1992
convention was called, even by some Republicans, divisive and
mean-spirited. How will this convention be different?"
<p>
CNN's Bill Schneider. Hours later on Inside Politics Bill
Schneider, CNN s polling analyst, praised Jack Kemp by impugning
conservatives: "He is a rare combination a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They re
supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked a minute ago about the
frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp is buoyant, he s
effusive, he s inclusive of everybody in the country, not just in
the Republican Party. He puts a different face on that ticket."
<p>
ABC s Cokie Roberts. Then on Friday night's World News Tonight
Cokie Roberts also insulted Republicans while calling Kemp a good
choice: "He s very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive,
reaching out to minorities, to women, being for immigration, for
affirmative action. And I think that s very important for this
particular convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen
somewhat dour, and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with
a big smile on his face saying you all come, and I m going to cut
your taxes while I m at it is not a bad thing for the
Republicans."
<p>
CNN s Al Hunt. On the August 10 Capital Gang Saturday night Al
Hunt, Executive Washington Editor of The Wall Street Journal,
disparaged the platform while praising the Kemp pick: "But, you
know, privately the Democrats know that this is an enlightened
choice, whatever Chris Dodd may say publicly. Jack Kemp is gonna
not only excite this convention, but he cuts across regional,
racial and generational lines, across all of America, and I think
that he and his incredibly attractive family are going to add
lustre and intellectual firepower. Now there are some risks. He
has a few flaky views, the gold standard for one, and more
important, Jack Kemp is a can-do optimist who cares about all
people and that s going to put him at odds with a platform that
is protectionist, mean-spirited, anti-immigration, insensitive to
racial minorities."
<p>
CNN s Judy Woodruff: During live coverage Saturday of the VP
announcement in  Russell, Kansas,  Judy Woodruff declared: "On
welfare, up through the last few years, he s advocated more
moderate policies than those that were passed this month by the
Republican-controlled Congress. Jack Kemp does not like the idea
of taking money yanking money way from welfare mothers with small
children."
<p>  
CNNs Schneider. On Saturday s Inside Politics Schneider again
impugned conservatives as he praised Jack Kemp s tolerance: "Kemp
also has a rare combination of qualities. He s a nice
conservative. There haven t been too many of those since Ronald
Reagan. Most conservatives these days come across as mean [video
of Newt Gingrich] or intolerant [video of Pat Buchanan]. Kemp is
tolerant and inclusive. He has an excellent relationship with
minorities. He showed real courage two years ago when he came out
against Proposition 187, the punitive anti-illegal immigration
measure in California. Kemp is not a hater." 
<p>
So most conservatives are? Sounds like a bit of mean-spirited
name calling on behalf of the media.

<h3>Page 3 story, Monday, August 12, 1996</h3>
<p>  
<h3>Networks That Ignored Casey Dive Into GOP Controversy
The Fascinating Wilson Flap</h3>
<p>  
ABC's Cokie Roberts asked Dole adviser Donald Rumsfeld on This
Week with David Brinkley yesterday: "We just heard Jim Wooten
talking about [California Gov.] Pete Wilson not talking at this
convention. Governor Weld is also not talking at this  
convention. Republicans for years have been talking about the
Democrats not allowing [then-Pennsylvania Gov.] Bob Casey to talk
at their last convention. What s different here?" What s
different is that the lack of speaking assignments for Weld and
Wilson are spurring major media interest. 
<p>
Just during the Sunday morning interview shows, the networks
asked 22 questions about exclusion of pro-abortion Republicans.
During the entire Democratic convention week in 1992, Casey s
predicament drew absolutely no mention from Cokie s network, nor
any attention from CBS; NBC aired just one interview with Gov.
Casey, as did CNN, which added four other mentions of the
underplayed controversy  in prime time. Yesterday, 11 questions
about the GOP s  exclusion of moderates were posed on CNN s Late
Edition, compared to five on NBC s Meet the Press, four on ABC s
This Week, and two on CBS's Face the Nation.
<p>
If pro-choice forces cannot prevail, then why even hold a
convention asked one morning show host last week. Today co-host
Matt Lauer asked Gov. Wilson on  August 8: "You said a second ago
that the majority of Republicans across the country are on your
side on this issue, but the majority of people who ll attend this
convention are not. Why then even hold the convention if it
doesn't express or represent the views of the majority of people
in the party?"

<h3> Page Three, Monday, August 12, 1996</h3>
<p>  
<h3>Sixty TV Stories on the GOP to One for the Democrats
Abortion Plank Imbalance</h3>
<p>  
As the surf arrives on San Diego s beaches, once again the
national media are hanging ten on their favorite convention
story: Republican fratricide over the platform s abortion
plank. Since April 30, when Governors Weld, Wilson, Whitman, and
Pataki declared their intention to challenge the platform s
traditional pro-life plank, the networks have focused like a
laser beam on the story, while ignoring any debate within the
Democratic party:
<p>
>From April 30 to August 9, the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, and
NBC) have favored the Republican side of the story by 60 to 1.
They  aired 30 full stories on the evening newscasts, to only one
ABC World News Tonight story on the Democratic abortion debate on
June 12. The network morning shows have aired another 30 full
stories or interview segments on the GOP abortion debate, to
nothing on the Democrats. (That doesn t include five anchor
briefs on the evening shows and 34 anchor briefs on the morning
shows.)
<p>
CNN's evening newscast The World Today aired seven full stories
and ten anchor briefs on the GOP pro-life plank, to only one
anchor brief on the Democrats. CNN s Inside Politics was
intensely interested in the story, with 38 full stories or
interview segments on the GOP to two segments on the Democrats.
<p>
Perhaps the dramatic imbalance of stories will change when the
Democrats hold their platform hearings? Wrong. The Democrats
already held their platform hearings (on July 10 and 11, then
concluding on August 5) with absolutely no notice from ABC, CBS,
or NBC. You also couldn't read about them in Time, Newsweek, or
U.S. News & World Report. Even daily newspapers such as the Los
Angeles Times and USA Today, with hundreds of pages of newsprint
to fill every week, spiked the story.
<p>
Judd, June 12: "An ABC News survey shows that a third of
Democrats oppose all or most abortions, but centrists and
liberals have no intention of surrendering any ground." Judd
dismissed the threat of pro-lifers actually leaving the party:
"The issue of abortion has not splintered the Democratic party
because those who couldn t live with the party's position
bolted years ago." She concluded: "So given their reluctance to
publicly fight with the party mainstream, abortion opponents will
probably be seen, but not heard at their party's convention this
summer."

<h3> Page Four, Monday August 12, 1996, page 4</h3>
<p>
<h3>Networks Worry About Ominous Party Takeover by Christians
"Rogue Elephants" No More</h3>
<p>
Colin Powell and Susan Molinari are set to deliver major speeches
to the Republican convention, but network news reporters over the
weekend portrayed the Republican Party as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Christian Right, painting that as an ominous
development. 
<p>
On Friday, August 9, Dan Rather introduced a CBS Evening News
piece by asserting: "For many self-described Christian
conservatives and other members of what is generally known as the
hard right of the Republican Party, they ve been pretty much
having their way at the San Diego convention, and the Jack Kemp
news late today was one more cause for celebration. But there
could be pitfalls ahead for the party, as we hear now from Linda
Douglass."
<p>
Douglass began: "It already has been a triumphant week for
religious conservatives, led by the Christian Coalition. Then
came word of another victory, the prospect of Jack Kemp as Bob
Dole's running mate." Following a soundbite from Ralph Reed, she
continued: "The Christian Coalition has gotten what it wanted
here, even forcing Dole to back down from his offer of tolerance
to supporters of abortion rights. Religious conservatives say
they now hold the key to a Dole victory in November."
<p>
After a soundbite from the Christian Coalition s Ralph Reed,
Douglass continued: "But veterans of past Republican presidential
campaigns warn Dole runs the risk of appearing to be under the
thumb of religious conservatives. Some analysts believe Gerald
Ford was hurt in 1976 by giving in to a conservative faction.
Doug Bailey, who advised Ford then, said Dole must be careful." 
The same night on PBS s Washington Week in Review host Ken Bode
claimed that "it turns out that this platform committee that met
is a far more conservative group of delegates, than we've
seen even in Republican conventions of the past."
<p>
On Sunday s Face the Nation, CBS correspondent Phil Jones seemed
obsessed with the topic. Jones asked Governor George Bush, "There
are a number of Republicans who are very uncomfortable with what
they feel is the power, the control that the conservative
Religious Right has. Are you concerned about that?" Jones also
accused Pat Robertson of swallowing the Republican Party: "A lot
of moderate Republicans have watched what s going on here in the
last week in the writing of the platform, and they say you
people, you, Pat Robertson and your wing of the Republican party,
Christian conservatives, have taken over."
<p>
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them," warned
Dan Rather on last night s CBS Evening News. Taking a look at the
Texas delegation, reporter John Roberts found that "so far the
rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots: winning the
platform battle over abortion and heavily influencing Bob Dole s
choice for Vice President." 
<p>
Employing some extremist labeling, Roberts said that "hardline
anti-abortionists" tried to keep Texas Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison from becoming a delegate. But in the end, Roberts
assured viewers, the conservatives really won't win: "This
exercise in gaining political influence may turn out to be just
that: an exercise. Bob Dole says he has not yet read the party
platform and even if he does he says he will not feel bound by
it. And it could be a case for the Texas delegation of
winning the battle but losing the war. Their views against
abortion are in contrast with the majority of Americans who
support a woman s right to choose. That could turn out to be a
contentious issue come November."

<p>
<h3>Chancellor Reality Check</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 14, 1996
<p>
One item in this MRC Alert: 
<p>
> John Chancellor is being praised for his fairness, but a reviewof his commentaries show he used his position to promote liberalideas and attack conservatives.
<p>
As you may know, NBC News veteran John Chancellor passed away
at age 68 on Friday evening. From 1970 to 1982 he anchored the
NBC Nightly News, then provided commentary through 1993. During
the Johnson Administration he presided over the Voice of America.
His passing has generated a series of tributes to his
fairness and impartiality from his media colleagues. On the July
13 NBC Nightly News, for instance, anchor Brian Williams
observed: "He was a role model for all who care about truth,
justice and fairness. John Chancellor died last night of cancer,
two days short of his 69th birthday. He helped define what TV
news should be."
<p>
Let's take a look at the views expressed in some of his
Nightly News commentaries in the late 1980s and early 1990s:
<p>
    -- April 17, 1990: "The overall tax burden for Americans,
federal, state, and local, is actually quite low....The fact is
Americans could pay more taxes and the country wouldn't go down
the tube. Taxpayers don't believe this because they are being
conned by the politicians...The truth is that the United States
needs higher taxes and can afford them. Some political leaders
are now starting to say that, but until more say it, the country
will remain in trouble."
<p>
    -- August 21, 1991, on the Soviet Union: "It's short of soap,
so there are lice in hospitals. It's short of pantyhose, so
women's legs go bare. It's short snowsuits, so babies stay home
in winter....The problem isn't communism; nobody even talked
about communism this week. The problem is shortages." 
<p>
    -- March 12, 1992: "Greenpeace, the public interest
organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and
military, before and after the war, may be as high as 198,000.
Allied military dead are counted in the low hundreds. The
disparity is huge and somewhat embarrassing. And that's
commentary for this evening, Tom." 
<p>
    -- Election night, 1992, looking back at the Republican
convention: "I think that the convention -- and certainly all the
polling data indicates this -- offended a lot of women, offended a lot of people in the country who thought it was too religious
and too hard-edged." 
<p>
    -- February 16, 1993: "There is no mystery in how [the
deficit] can be brought down...the U.S. simply has to choose from
a menu of unpalatable options that include deeper cuts in defense
spending, tougher controls on medical services, higher taxes on
federal pensions, and a broad-based tax on energy or consumption,
preferably both. We know how to do this. Impose measures already
commonplace in other industrialized countries. The weapons are
there. It's the will to use them that's the problem."
<p>
    -- April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots: "It's not a
big surprise that the jury in suburban Simi Valley sided with the
white policemen. Just as it's no surprise that the blacks in
downtown Los Angeles rioted and people died....Politicians have
fanned these flames with code words about `welfare queens,'
`equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' Language designed to turn
whites against blacks. With two-party politics that favored the
rich and hurt everyone else."
<p>
    -- November 20, 1990: "Some say Ronald Reagan won the Cold
War by spending so much on defense that the Kremlin went bankrupt
trying to keep up. That won't wash. During Reagan's presidency
the United States itself became a bankrupt country."
<p>
    -- November 7, 1990: "The fact is that most government
spending cannot be cut. The way out of the mess is for the
government to raise some money through taxes and at last that's
being done. And there's encouraging news in the returns from
yesterday's elections. Six states from Massachusetts to
California rejected measures designed to limit taxation. Can it
be that the great tax revolt of the 1980s is coming to an end? If
true, maybe the country can get on with the business of balancing
its books in a sensible and logical way." 
<p>
    -- June 20, 1989: "Thousands may have been gunned down in
Beijing, but what about the millions of American kids whose lives
are being ruined by an enormous failure of the country's
educational system...We can and we should agonize about the dead
students in Beijing, but we've got a much bigger problem here at
home."
<p>
    -- Finally, here's the July 1990 MediaWatch newsbite on
Chancellor's 1990 book. He's no fan of Ronald Reagan:
<p>
Once anchor of NBC Nightly News, John Chancellor now offers his
opinions thrice weekly. His commentaries have recently been
distilled into a book on what's wrong with America, Peril and
Promise.
<p>
So what's wrong? The deficit, which he attributed to a Reagan
recipe of "big tax cuts, big increases in defense spending, and a
hair curling recession." Pardoned from blame: congressional mismanagement. And though federal revenues went up swiftly in the
'80s, Chancellor remembered only that "cuts in taxes and domestic
spending resulted in the first redistribution of income in favor
of the affluent since the 1920s and a reduction of the federal
government's obligation to the poor." Another Reagan error was
the Grenada liberation which Chancellor called "a sham triumph,"
a "tragicomedy," which "might not have been necessary."
<p>
Chancellor harped on America's faults for 130 pages, but
dedicated fewer than 40 pages to suggesting solutions. He called
his remedies to America's woes neither conservative nor liberal,
yet higher taxes remained the pillar of his plan. Another major
objective: mobilization of a national corps of volunteers because
"The poor and disadvantaged need help, especially after the
cutbacks in social services during the Reagan years."
<p>
I'll be sending another e-mail late tonight with some more
recent bias from Sam Donaldson and coverage of Dole and the
NAACP. -- Brent Baker

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>28. Does FRC support exemptions for women in 
combat?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC fully supports the armed forces exemption of women from combat
and near-combat assignments.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Re-impose combat exemptions for women and
reverse decisions to dramatically increase the number of women
serving.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, Congress rescinded female
combat exemption laws and then the Clinton administration opened
a quarter million previously closed combat and near-combat positions
to women.  These decisions were not prompted by military necessity,
and they hinder military readiness.

<p>

According to the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces, there are undeniable differences
in speed, strength and endurance between men and women.  Women
will always be in greater danger on the battlefield.  Women do
not have &quot;an equal opportunity to survive.&quot;  That's
why the most physically demanding combat assignments should go
to men.  Additionally, a downsizing military does not need women
when an ample pool of fully-qualified men is available.

<p>

Assigning women to combat also makes women vulnerable to a future
draft.  The 1948 Selective Service Act requires all 18-year-old
male citizens to register for a possible draft.  In the 1981 case
of <I>Rostker v. Goldberg</I>, the Supreme Court ruled that women
were excluded from selective service registration primarily because
the law exists to develop a pool of potential combat troops; women
at that time were not eligible for combat.  That argument is losing
credibility as more combat exemptions are being abandoned.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Removing exemptions for women weakens the military
and makes all women vulnerable to a future draft.

<p>

The military exists to perform the most physically demanding task
known to man: combat.  Removing exemptions so that more women
can serve in combat and near-combat is not a prudent readiness
decision.  It weakens America's combat power.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>12. What is FRC's response to the homosexual 
agenda?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that homosexuality is unhealthy, immoral and destructive
to individuals, families and societies.  <I>Compassion</I> --
not bigotry -- impels us to support healing for homosexuals who
want to change their orientation.

<p>

FRC opposes any attempts to equate homosexuality with civil rights
or to compare it to benign characteristics such as skin color
or place of origin.

<p>

The Family Research Council opposes sex education programs that
treat homosexuality and heterosexuality as equally desirable,
that teach that any sexual behavior between consenting people
is a human right, and that idealize homosexuality and the homosexual
lifestyle.  FRC also opposes attempts to make the adoption of
children by homosexuals an accepted practice.

<p>

Much of the data used to support claims by homosexual activists
is flawed:  the debate has been clouded by faulty research and
surveys taken out of context.  FRC supports efforts to promote
public policy -- based on scholarly research -- that undergirds
traditional values and families, rather than attempts to provide
special treatment for homosexuals.  The Family Research Council
applauds the efforts of men and women who provide counseling and
support for people who wish to leave the homosexual lifestyle
and find fulfillment in a healthy lifestyle.

important to note that the  company which buried the chemicals in the area, 
Hooker Electrochemical Company, encased them in a  thick protective tube of
impenetrable clay with  the intent of maintaining ownership of the land.
Unfortunately, the Niagara Falls Board of  Education, through threat of eminent
domain, effectively forced the company to sell the  land (for $1), despite the
company's warnings that the land was contaminated and not fit for  public use. A
public elementary school was built on the site, and city construction crews 
bulldozed through the clay seal, allowing the  chemicals into the surrounding
soil. Additionally, some of the land was sold off for  residential housing.
Thus, the problems at Love Canal  were the direct result of government
interference.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>17. What is FRC's opinion on the redefinition of 
marriage?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC opposes the radical redefinition of marriage and the erosion
of societal protections for marriage.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Passage of the federal Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA), continued enactment of state laws that define marriage
as the union of one man and one woman, and resistance to the institution
of  &quot;domestic partnership&quot; benefits and privileges to
same-sex or unmarried couples.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b>  Because of its crucial role, marriage
has a special status within the culture and the law.  Its essence
-- the joining of one man and one woman in a uniquely exclusive
legal, sexual, economic and spiritual bond with the procreation
of children as a desirable and common result -- had not been seriously
challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

Now, homosexual activists are on the verge of radically redefining
marriage and family through judicial fiat.  If they succeed, all
distinctions based on sex will fall, and the worst aspects of
the rejected Equal Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals
will gain the &quot;right&quot; to adopt children; schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexual sex is the equivalent of marital
love between husband and wife; employers will be forced to subsidize
homosexual relationships; churches will be pushed outside the
civil law; and government power will be directed against anyone
who believes that homosexuality is wrong.  Likewise, any government
institution of  &quot;domestic partnerships&quot; will harm the
moral order by raising homosexuality and fornication to protected
status, thereby undercutting societal support for marriage.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  
Despite widespread opposition within Hawaii (recent polls show
that 74 percent of Hawaiians reject same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;)
homosexual activists hope to impose their agenda through compliant
courts.  Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit
Clause calls for states to honor each other's licenses, homosexuals
are planning to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to
the mainland to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  More than 30
states now have efforts underway to protect marriage, and nine
-- Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma,
South Dakota and Utah -- have enacted laws protecting marriage.

<p>

At the national level, DOMA would protect the military, Social
Security and all federal agencies from radical redefinition of
wedlock, as well as protect states from having their marriage
laws invalidated by an adverse court ruling or enactment in another
state.

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several key cases involving
the homosexual agenda are being decided.  The Supreme Court recently
struck down a voter-approved Colorado state constitutional amendment 
to bar any city or county from enacting special rights
based on sexual orientation.  Several cases challenging the military's
ban on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.  In Georgia,
a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian fired from
her job at the state attorney general's office after she announced
that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  In New York, the
state's high court opened adoption proceedings to homosexual couples
and unmarried heterosexual couples, thus devaluing marriage and
jeopardizing children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> If marriage is radically redefined, or domestic
partnerships instituted, the entire moral code will unravel. 
Polls show that the American people overwhelmingly expect public
officials to defend marriage unequivocally.  This effort can advance
the cause of judicial reform, halt the judicial assault on traditional
morality and stall the homosexual activist agenda, which has gone
far beyond mere &quot;tolerance.&quot;

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  welfare category rather than in
the Medicare category. See the discussion under Medicare  in Rector and Lauber,
<CITE><U>America's Failed $5.4  Trillion War on Poverty,</U></CITE> Appendix
One. This  sum amounted to $15.5 billion in 1993; it represents 4 percent of
combined Medicare and  Social Security payments and 5 percent of total welfare
spending. Shifting it from the  welfare category to the Social Security and 
Medicare category would not significantly affect  the comparison in Chart 6.

equals the value of welfare  benefits from different programs for the average

</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="17">17</A></B></TT>    
Technically, the mother may be married  to a husband who works parttime at very
low wages and still be eligible for some aid under  the AFDCUP program. However,
if the husband works a significant number of hours per month,  even at a low
hourly rate, his earnings will be sufficient to eliminate the family's 
eligibility for AFDC and most other welfare.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="18">18</A></B></TT>     One
simplistic solution to the  dilemmas presented above would be to allow a 
welfare mother to retain all or most of her  welfare benefits after she has
taken a job or married  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  fully employed male. But this
approach would be unfair to working single mothers  and lowincome working
married couples who never went on welfare in the first place.  Moreover, low and
moderateincome parents would have  a huge incentive to enroll in welfare, at
least briefly, to become eligible for the  longterm continuing benefits. Such a
system would  devolve inevitably into one in which the majority of low and
moderateincome single  and twoparent families received substantial welfare
payments, raising the overall cost  of welfare by hundreds of billions of
dollars per year. Realistic welfare reformers must seek  to alter welfare
incentives in a more practical manner.

<P><TT><B><A NAME="42">42</A></B></TT>     For
example, modest work requirements  on males in the food stamp program have been
shown to reduce welfare rolls significantly,  cutting welfare costs by nearly a
third and immediately saving several dollars in welfare  expenditures for every
dollar spent operating  the work program. See data on the San Diego food stamp
workfare program in U.S. Department  of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service,

<P><TT><B><A NAME="43">43</A></B></TT>     There
should be no blanket twoyear  exemption from work requirements. Work
requirements which are imposed when a recipient  initially enrolls in welfare
are likely to have the strongest possible effect in reducing  welfare rolls
because they dissuade individuals from enrolling in welfare in the first  place.
Thus, serious work requirements mandated at the time of initial welfare
enrollment  are likely to be the most costeffective workfare programs.

Bill Pierce employed 25 salaried  professionals in his midwestern engineering
consulting business. Mr. Pierce also allowed  his workers to work flexible
schedules. During an investigation, the Department of Labor  declared that the
opportunity of flexible  schedules transformed Mr. Pierce's salaried workers 
into hourly employees subject to the FLSA's overtime provisions. DoL then
demanded that  Mr. Pierce pay his workers back overtime pay and penalties. The
result: Mr. Pierce had to  declare bankruptcy, and his employees lost their
jobs.

Curdling the cream in the Clinton coffee
</FONT></center>
<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. The front page of The Washington Times on the morning after New Hampshire was a caution correctly read in the White House, where, despite the hired bravado of the president's regiments of lawyers, the fog shrouding Bill Clinton's view of November grows thicker, the knot of fear in Miss Hillary's tummy expands to the size of an artichoke-y.
<br><dd>
<I>Buchanan wins New Hampshire vote/Stuns Dole;/Alexander a strong third</I>. This was the stuff of good cheer all around: dissension in the enemy's camp, a cracking coalition, rage in the ranks, mutiny at the officers' club. You couldn't blame the president and Miss Hillary for the smiles that sweetened their morning coffee.

<br><dd>
But here's the smaller headline that curdled the cream in that coffee: <I>Arkansas bankers indicted for loans/Fraud suspected in Clinton races</I>. The front page of The Washington Post, for once, offered scant solace: <I>Arkansas bankers indicted in scheme/to help fund 1990 Clinton campaign</I>.

<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

<br><dd>
The amnesia epidemic that has swept through the White House -- there's been nothing like it since the AIDS epidemic swept through San Francisco like Epsom salts -- continued Feb. 22 as Harold Ickes, with the rattled mien of a flustered Ichabod Crane, couldn't remember much about anything, beginning with why the White House only last week found another hundred pages of Whitewater documents it had said were lost. "Inadvertent," Mr. Ickes described it.

<br><dd>
One of the panelists noticed the notation, "DK Draft," and asked whether this meant that Donald Kendall, the president's lawyer for bank-robbery affairs, had written it. Mr. Ickes, in the White House refrain now so familiar to all, replied that he didn't remember. Of course.

<br><dd>
Mr. Ickes demonstrated the testiness and combativeness that White House aides cower before, particularly when he employs testiness and combativeness to protect Miss Hillary. Once he dropped his mask of toughness. Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina recalled that his father was known in FDR's Cabinet as "Honest Harold," and asked him, in the down-home vernacular: "If God had granted him to be in this room, would he say, 'Boy, you're doing a good job,' or, 'Son, you're with the wrong crowd, get out,'?"

<br><dd>
With an ever so slight crack in his voice, the son replied: "I think he would have approved of what I was doing, because we've done nothing wrong."

<br><dd>
Another panelist wondered about another passage in the notes which the White House has only now deigned to turn over to the Senate Whitewater committee: An investigation, said one notetaker, "may result in focus on friends and associates of the president, begin to 'squeeze' them, and some may be subject to indictment."

<br><dd>
Mr. Ickes, a labor lawyer in New York before he came down to help Hillary dismantle American medicine, insisted that not only did he not know who wrote the memo, he didn't even know what the term "squeezed" meant. How would a New York labor lawyer have ever heard about putting the "squeeze" on a witness?
<br><dd>
During a break in the testimony, Mr. Ickes' own pleader, the ubiquitous and expensive Uncle Bob Bennett, who is also the president's lawyer for bimbo eruptions, couldn't imagine why anyone would think his client had done anything wrong.
<br><dd>
&quot;I don't know what's wrong with that,&quot; he said of Mr. Ickes' answer. &quot;This is a big piece of cotton candy. You bite into it and there is nothing there.&quot;
<br><dd>
Expensive pleader or not, Mr. Bennett sounds as if he's having difficulty persuading himself. And over at the White House, the president's press agent, Mike McCurry, took pains to underscore the need for presidential aides to make sure they turn over all Whitewater documents. Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, &quot;doesn't want documents dribbling out. He wants everyone to turn everything upside down and produce whatever needs to be produced.&quot;
<br><dd>
Sure he does. But what he really doesn't want is anything to enhance the perception, now deeply ingrained in the Washington consciousness, that what the Clintons are producing is not documents but alibis, excuses, and yarns.
<br><dd>
This week the Senate must decide whether to extend the Whitewater committee's life and writ. Even Chris Dodd, the panelist from Connecticut and the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee (talk about your conflicts of interest) says he's &quot;troubled&quot; by the White House delays but naturally he sees &quot;nothing of substance&quot; to justify an extension. Says he, invoking an odd analogy: &quot;This has gone on longer than the O.J. Simpson trial.&quot; But everyone knows that if Bob Dole can't manage to win this one, he's outta here.

Adopted Children Fare Better than Children in Single Parent 
Households</a><br>
An Article By Gracie S. Hsu

<p>

Since joining the Family Research Council in September 1993, Gracie 
Hsu's research skills -- honed at the Johns Hopkins University -- 
have served as an asset to the work of the pro-family advocacy group's 
policy department.  In her current position as policy analyst, she is 
responsible for managing the Family Research Council's efforts in the 
fields of adolescent sexuality and life issues.  As part of FRC's 
outreach to the academic, media and legislative arenas, Miss Hsu's 
work consists of tracking, analyzing, and writing critical essays on 
new research, policy trends, and legislative initiatives concerning 
teen sexuality and abortion issues. She also represents FRC, 
explaining pro-family policy to audiences from capitol hill to the 
<i>CBS Evening News</i>. Her craftsmanship with the written word is 
a special skill she brings to FRC. As an op-ed writer, Miss Hsu 
(pronounced "Shoe") has been published in the <I>San Diego Union 
Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Orange County Register</I>, and 
other leading publications.

<p>

Miss Hsu began her work at the Family Research Council as a research 
assistant for health policy issues during the crucial first phases of 
health care reform.  Her project opposing abortion in health care 
reform contributed to U.S. Senate hearings on the subject. Prior to 
joining the Family Research Council, her research experience included 
work at Johns Hopkins on health issues and at the University of 
California at Los Angeles in a study of urban poverty.

<p>

Work in adolescent issues is also a task to which Miss Hsu comes 
well-prepared.  She served as a student health advocate under the 
University of California's Department of Student Health Services 
from 1990-1991, advising her peers on an individual basis regarding 
their various emotional and physical health concerns.  She also 
gained experience by participating in California's Watts Public 
Library Literacy Program, in which she worked as a tutor for inner 
city youth.

<p>

Miss Hsu graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with College Honors from 
the University of California at Los Angeles, receiving a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in English.  She went on to graduate <I>summa cum 
laude</I> with a Masters of Health Sciences degree from the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, 
Maryland.

<title>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</title>

<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Networks Pump Up Gas-Price Story</center></h3>
<p>
Given how closely tuned the media antennae are to the political world, it's no surprise that the recent bump in gasoline prices was big news. Politicians in both parties tried to make political hay out of the price increase. Few reporters questioned their rhetoric by pointing out that gas prices, by historical standards, are not high and that they would be even lower if it weren't for taxes and regulations.
<p>
CBS saw a capitalist conspiracy behind the price hike. Dan Rather sounded the alarm on the April 30 CBS Evening News: "It's the question every American driver is asking with every trip to the pump. Why is the price of gasoline going up and up and up? Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or possibly even something more sinister?"
<p>
CBS economics correspondent Ray Brady suspected the latter. After an industry soundbite defending the price hikes, Brady reported that "critics say those high pump prices come from gouging, [that] the industry deliberately let supplies drop." Brady also blamed Americans for "driving longer distances to work in popular gas guzzlers. And speeding; no more 55-mile-an-hour federal speed limit."
<p>
Curiously, in the very next story, CBS didn't hint at conspiracy when Clinton moved to keep beef prices high. According to Rather, "President Clinton is giving some election-year help to America's ranchers and farmers. The President took action today to try to boost cattle prices, which have fallen to their lowest level in ten years."
<p>
The other networks were a little more calm about the gasoline price hike. ABC's Brian Rooney, on the April 24 World News Tonight, blamed "a combination of unrelated events" for the higher gasoline prices. Rooney pointed out that "crude oil traders were predicting that the United Nations would partially lift the ban on Iraqi oil, which would have put more and cheaper oil on the market. When that didn't happen, the rush to buy from other sources drove the price up." Rooney also informed viewers that the long Northeastern winter contributed to the higher prices.
<p>
Over at NBC, Tom Brokaw said, on the April 30 Nightly News: "We don't have to tell you tonight that gas prices are still stuck at very high levels." Of the government investigation, correspondent Pete Williams said: "Some government economists are skeptical the investigation will turn up anything illegal." He also pinned blame on the weather: "They say prices are up because the severe storm from last winter drove up demand for heating oil, leaving less crude oil for making gasoline."
<p>
Rooney and Williams were correct, as far as they went. But were gas price really "at very high levels"? John Merline, in the May 7 Investor's Business Daily, looked at history for an answer. "After controlling for inflation," he reported, "a gallon of gas today costs 27 percent less than it did in 1949, and 23 percent less than a gallon did as recently as 1985." He pointed out that "even at the high pump prices posted at the end of April, the average national gasoline price is about the same as it was in June of last year."
<p>
Merline spotted the real story, that "today's prices would be lower still were it not for the substantial added cost imposed by government." Neither Brady, Rooney, or Williams mentioned, as Merline did, that "today, the combined federal-state tax is 37 cents a gallon. The federal tax stands at 18 cents a gallon, and the median state tax is 19 cents." 
<p>
"At today's prices," he added, "taxes alone account for more than a quarter of the pump price." Merline also explained that government regulations raise the price of gasoline at least four cents a gallon.
<p>
While Rooney and Williams at least didn't get the story wrong, they still didn't get the full story. Many network news viewers still may not know how much government adds to the price of gasoline.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>27. Does FRC support welfare reform?  Why?</h2></center>

<p>

To control the damage caused by federal welfare programs that
promote family breakdown and crowd out more compassionate alternatives
at the grass-roots (including private, faith-based programs),
FRC supports compassionate welfare reform.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> End the entitlement status of all cash
benefits that reward irresponsible conduct, particularly benefits
that are contingent on the birth of a child outside marriage;
end the federal tax code's marriage penalty on low- and middle-income
taxpayers; end the federal role in welfare -- both funding and
programmatic responsibility -- to maximize states' flexibility
to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral
requirements; revise the tax code to encourage charitable giving.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The current welfare system encourages
family disintegration and discourages personal responsibility
by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits regardless of personal
conduct.  The bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer
those benefits, in turn, tend to crowd out the voluntary organizations
that provide the real help -- the help that changes lives.

<p>

The culture of welfare dependency has reduced a potentially proud
and independent people to passive clients.  The current system
sends the message not that they are equal to the inevitable challenges
of life, but that they are helpless -- a different, less capable
group of citizens than those who can and do live by the rules.
Welfare bureaucrats say, &quot;You can't do this.  Let us do
it for you.  And pay us to do it with your vote, year after year.&quot;
Current policy empowers the bureaucracy at the same time it destroys
individuals, and children are inheriting not only material poverty
but their parents' poverty of the spirit.

<p>

It is not enough to say that certain kinds of welfare reform will
cause suffering.  Policymakers must come to terms with the degree
of suffering that is occurring now.  No one can expect to roll
back the tide until more children are growing up with an attentive
father in the home.  The overriding purpose of welfare reform
<I>must</I> be to reverse government policies that suppress the
natural human instinct to form families.

<p>

Policymakers can disapprove of personal decisions that jeopardize
children and yet still provide help.  Measures like the tax credit
for charitable contributions deserve support because the most
compassionate help comes from private individuals and organizations
that sponsor moral renewal at the same time they offer material
support -- on the premise that needy individuals are not clients
but fellow human beings.  Welfare policy should in no way jeopardize
the autonomy of the faith-based programs that have a proven track
record of rescuing lives when all other programs have failed.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Compassionate welfare reform will ensure that
more children have the opportunity to reap the benefits of stable,
two-parent families.  It will expand the freedom of individuals
to make rational, responsible decisions by eliminating the perverse
economic incentives of the current welfare system.  It will also
redirect dollars to those organizations that provide not only
material help but also love, concern, and an opportunity for personal
renewal.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>13. What is FRC's position on the military's homosexual 
ban?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the military should enforce the law  [10 U.S.C.
&#167; 654] that denies military service to homosexuals.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Rewrite the Pentagon's inconsistent method of 
implementing regulations which ignore the law's intent to deny service to 
homosexuals. Additionally, reinstate the question asking if a candidate 
is a homosexual, which the law permits to be asked of all recruits.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In 1993, Congress held hearings to determine
whether to keep the military's 200-year-old homosexual ban.  Experts
testified that homosexuals threaten unit cohesion and morale --
key combat components.  Their defining behavior is illegal in
the military, and as a category homosexuals create an unacceptable
health risk to themselves and others.  Science has found that
homosexuals experience higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases,
including the AIDS virus, and higher rates of drug abuse than
heterosexuals.

<p>

On November 30, 1993, President Clinton signed into law the military's
long-standing ban on homosexual military service.  The law [ 10
U.S.C. &#167; 654] Congress passed is very clear: no homosexuals
in the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the Clinton administration from
creating regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only
serve, but serve openly in the military.  This end run around
Congress has not gone unnoticed.

<p>

This spring, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
in <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> identified the regulatory loopholes.
In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both the law passed
by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations on homosexuals
in the military.  Six of that court's judges declared that the
administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly what the White House was up to in regard to 
&quot;implementing&quot; the law on homosexuals in the military.

<p>

Besides revising the regulations to be consistent with the law,
the services must also return to asking recruits about their sexual
orientation and past homosexual conduct. Asking the questions
kept honest homosexuals out and sent a clear message that to serve,
others must keep their homosexuality a secret.  In 1993, the Clinton
administration ordered this practice stopped.  The new law, however,
permits the Secretary of Defense to reinstate the questions. 
Asking new recruits and those reenlisting is a prudent step to
warn would-be service members that homosexuals are not eligible
for service in the military.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The law and the regulations are inconsistent.
This undercuts the constitutional authority of Congress to set
the rules and regulations for the military and puts the courts
in the position of having to force the executive branch to do
its constitutional duty to &quot;faithfully execute the laws&quot;
of the land.  Rewriting the regulations will result in the restoration
of a consistent policy that will survive constitutional challenge,
avert the manifold medical and morale-related problems occasioned
by the Clinton administration's social experimentation, and put
to rest an issue that has disrupted the clear and workable policy
that served the nation well for generations.

enrolls 44 million youngsters, and employs 3 million teachers (and  an equal

<Title>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </h2>
</center>
<p>
Journalists don't question Administration officials' defense of business pork 
The corporate welfare state has found presumably unwitting allies in the media. Despite the Clinton Administration's stated policy of being against federal subsidies for business, reporters haven't challenged Administration officials to explain their defense of business pork against budget cutters.
<p>
CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4 World News reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block." 
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, Undersecretary of the Commerce Department, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." He didn't ask Farmer if this made USTTA an example of corporate welfare. Bierbauer concluded his segment by saying that "tourists will continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
Another network reporter who let corporate welfare go unchallenged was John Roberts, who warned, on the June 25 CBS Evening News, of federal summer job programs being hurt by Republican budget cuts. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment."  Concluding his story, Roberts said: "[Labor Secretary Robert] Reich points out that one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs."
<p>
But, if that's the case, isn't a federal program that forces taxpayers to subsidize the training costs of businesses a prime example of corporate welfare, which Reich claims to oppose? Roberts didn't ask the Labor Secretary. 
<p>
A July 2 Washington Post story lacked similar insights. "Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence 'cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress," according to the Post.
<p>
"As Commerce Secretary, Brown has made U.S. exports a cornerstone of his department, leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets." The Post quoted Brown: "It's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the Cabinet table."
<p>
The Post didn't speculate that the Commerce Department may itself embody corporate welfare. Nor did the Post give any non-Administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "The current management of the Department boasts that it is especially effective in using its vast resources to help individual companies succeed in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," Weidenbaum said in his testimony to the House Commerce Committee.
<p>
"Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum said. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair." According to Weidenbaum, most American businesses and the American economy would be better off if the money spent by the Commerce Department went to lower taxes or reduce the deficit.
<p>
Remarkably, reporters who were quick to publicize the Administration's crusade to end corporate welfare aren't suspicious when the same Administration claims it can help private companies create jobs and train employees.

<title>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer 
NewsHour</center></h2>
Something unusual happened on September 28. The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, 
normally well known for balanced and fair coverage, gave a one-sided account of 
an important issue. David Gergen, now returned from his role as White House 
adviser, conducted a softball interview of economist Edward Wolff about wealth 
inequality which ignored many flaws in Wolff's analysis.
<p>
Gergen didn't challenge Wolff, author of a recent study on the subject for the 
20th Century Fund, when he claimed that "income of the average family has been 
basically stagnant for the last fifteen, twenty years, and has actually started 
to decline during the 1990s." Wolff said he saw "nothing that suggests that 
these forces are going to abate." Moreover, he blamed the stock market as 
"another factor which has caused wealth and inequality to rise."
<p>
Gergen could have asked Wolff to respond to critics of his study. Christopher 
Farrell reports in the October 9 Business Week what many economists have long 
maintained: "The consumer price index has been overstating inflation by at 
least a percentage point. If that's the case, then real wage gains are 0.8 
percent a year," rather than the 0.2 percent decline reported by government 
statistics. Farrell also reports that "the skill level of American labor is 
improving, with more workers getting the education and training employers 
require" and that in the past, that has produced more equal income 
distribution.
<p>
The August 22 Investor's Business Daily (IBD), meanwhile, points out a major 
flaw in Wolff's study. "Pensions account for about one-third of the average 
household's assets," the newspaper reports, and are "the way most Americans are 
invested in the stock market." But Wolff's study, according to IBD, excludes 
the value of pension plans. (See page 5.)
<p>
Instead of pushing his guest to answer these criticisms, Gergen asked softball 
questions like, "I take it from the tenor of your remarks, as well as your 
study, that you think this growing inequality as you found it is dangerous 
socially for the country?" Viewers have come to expect more from the 
MacNeil/Lehrer News-Hour.

<center><h2>Kudos</center></h2>
<p>
What would someone with one foot in the civil rights community and one in the business world think about proposals to raise the minimum wage? Reporter Michael Winsop, in the May 10 New York Times, sought to answer that question. He interviewed Robert Bobbitt, Sr., past president of the board of the Canton, Ohio Urban League and now an owner of four McDonald's franchises in Canton's suburbs.
<p>
Winsop explained that "being the boss changed Mr. Bobbitt's politics. Nearly a decade ago he began voting Republican. The Democrat's current push in Washington to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25 illustrates why." According to Bobbitt, "Before, I would have thought of the minimum wage as a social issue. Then you start working for yourself, and all the risk and responsibilities are on you."
<p>
Winsop told how Bobbitt and another businessman went to see their Congressman. "They explained that 60 percent to 70 percent of their employees were suburban teenagers, many living at home and working to pay for a car and insurance."
<p>
In the May 5 Washington Post, staff writer Steven Pearlstein poked holes in the conventional wisdom about falling wages. Pointing to studies showing falling wages, he wrote that "by measuring only cash wages, the median wage series ignores the fact that employees have been receiving a greater share of their compensation in the form of tax-free fringe benefits." According to Pearlstein, "Most economists now agree that the government's main inflation gauge, the consumer price index, overstates the rise in the cost of living. And because income data are adjusted by the CPI, the effect of overstating inflation is to understate income."
<p>
Kudos to Winsop and Pearlstein for showing underreported sides of economic stories.

<title>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of 
Debate</h2></center>
<center><h3>Minimum Depth on Minimum Wage</h3></center>

One of the key debates currently defining the differences between Republicans 
and Democrats is the argument over efforts to raise the minimum wage. Democrats 
argue that the government can legislate higher pay for those earning the 
minimum wage without harming anyone. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that 
by artificially raising wages, the government will cause employers to lay off 
workers.
<p>
On which side did the media weigh in? Media Research Center analysts reviewed 
all of the minimum wage stories on evening news shows (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC) and 
morning news shows (ABC, CBS, NBC). There were 36 stories and anchor reads 
about the debate. With a few exceptions, the networks took the side of those 
supporting a minimum-wage increase. For example:
Soundbite sources were almost twice as likely to be supporters of the 
minimum-wage increase than opponents. Out of 60 soundbite sources, 39 supported 
the minimum-wage increase, while only 21 were opposed to it. Several stories 
contained soundbites only from Democrats and their allies.
<p>
Bob Schieffer's April 25 CBS Evening News report, for instance, had soundbites 
from Democrats Maxine Waters, Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and two minimum wage 
workers whom the Democrats had brought to Washington for a news conference. 
"Democrats will keep the pressure up," Schieffer said. "They believe that 
Republicans are taking such a pounding on this they'll eventually allow a 
vote." He didn't tell viewers what Republicans believed.
<p>
This emphasis on supporters of the minimum-wage hike led some reporters to 
accept the Democrats' opinion that the wage could be increased without harming 
workers. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, on the April 17 Nightly News, a 
minimum-wage increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers now 
earning near the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, frozen since 1989." CNN's 
Kathleen Kennedy, on the April 24 The World Tonight, worried that "people 
earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon. Despite political 
pressure from both parties, House Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick 
Armey have virtually ruled out scheduling a vote on the minimum-wage increase."
The political horse-race aspect of the debate was emphasized far more than the 
economics of the debate. There were only three soundbites from economists; 
there were 46 soundbites from politicians. The networks were much more 
interested in who would win and lose politically from the debate than what the 
effect would be on the country. According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the April 17 
Nightly News, it was likely that "the most basic wage in this country affecting 
millions of workers and businesses will go up. But, who gets the credit?"
<p>
This weighed heavily on the minds of other reporters, as well. NBC's Jim 
Miklaszewski, on the April 24 Nightly News, predicted that "by digging in their 
heels, Republicans may also be digging themselves into a political hole." And 
ABC's Cokie Roberts, on the April 23 Good Morning America, said: "If the 
Republicans are stuck going along, then they want to get some credit."
Journalists were more interested in interviewing other journalists than in 
interviewing economists. The obsession with political angles reached almost 
comic proportions at times. On the morning shows, where live interviews are 
common, there were five such interviews of journalists about the minimum wage, 
but none with economists.
<p>
ABC's Willow Bay interviewed ABC's Sam Donaldson on a Good Morning America 
Sunday segment. ABC's Charles Gibson interviewed ABC's Cokie Roberts and ABC's 
Tyler Mathison on a Good Morning America segment. NBC's Bryant Gumbel 
interviewed NBC's Tim Russert on a Today segment. And CBS's Harry Smith 
interviewed The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes. None of these shows were 
interested in the insights of economists, however.
<p>
There was more skepticism of Republican motives than Democratic motives. Three 
stories suggested that Republicans opposed raising the minimum wage because 
their business allies opposed it. ABC's Carole Simpson, on the April 28 World 
News Sunday, reported that Republicans "say [a minimum-wage hike] is bad for 
small business." According to Bob Schieffer, on the April 17 CBS Evening News, 
Republicans "know polls show most Americans favor an increase, but many of 
their business allies oppose it." Neither Simpson or Schieffer suggested that 
Republicans may oppose an increase because it would hurt workers.
<p>
No reporter made the analogous charge against Democrats, that they support the 
increase simply because their labor allies support it. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, 
on the April 25 Today, did at least state that there was a principle at stake 
for the GOP: "They can stand their ground on principle on this issue, but lose 
ground in public opinion." He did not explain what that principle was, though.
The one study of the impact of minimum wage increases cited by reporters is one 
most economists disavow. The infamous Card-Krueger study, named after the two 
economists who directed it, was mentioned favorably in two stories. Card and 
Krueger looked at the impact of a minimum-wage increase in New Jersey, compared 
to neighboring Pennsylvania, which hadn't increased its state minimum wage. 
They found that there was no job loss in New Jersey due to the increase. Since 
this is one of the only studies to produce such a finding, it is often cited by 
advocates of increasing the minimum wage.
<p>
ABC's Tyler Mathison mentioned the study on the April 23 Good Morning America. 
NBC's Mike Jensen also mentioned it favorably on the April 26 Nightly News. 
Neither of them mentioned the well-publicized problems many economists found 
with the study's methodology. Jensen, in fact, used a soundbite from one of the 
study's chief critics, economist Richard Berman, but didn't mention his 
criticisms of the study. He even employed an Alan Krueger soundbite to refute 
Berman.
<p>
There were exceptions to the biased coverage. ABC's Bob Zelnick, on the April 
24 Good Morning America, pointed out that "if labor costs rise too much, many 
employers might simply fire workers or cut back on new hires." And while 
journalists usually don't bother to interview small-business owners about how 
political policies will affect them, several did interview them about the 
minimum wage. NBC's Tom Brokaw devoted an entire Nightly News segment to the 
concerns of a small business owner "in his own words."
<p>
By far the best interview segment about the minimum wage was Anthony Mason's 
interview of Republican Senator Don Nickles and Democratic Congressman David 
Bonior for the April 22 CBS This Morning. Mason challenged both politicians, 
and in so doing brought up points no other reporter mentioned. For instance, he 
asked Bonior: "After the last increase in the minimum wage, Department of Labor 
statistics show we lost some half a million jobs, I believe. Is this going to 
cost us jobs? Are we making a mistake if we do this now?"
<p>
He also asked Bonior, "Congressman, in the first two years of President 
Clinton's term, when you controlled Congress, this issue was never brought up. 
Why is it on the table suddenly now, when we're running up to an election? You 
had an opportunity to do something and it wasn't done then." Mason was the only 
reporter to look at what happened after past federal minimum-wage hikes and to 
point out that the Democrats didn't increase the minimum wage when they 
controlled Congress.
<p>
But for the most part, coverage of the minimum wage was overwhelmingly devoted 
to superficial political calculations, and even then, biased against those who 
opposed an increase in the minimum wage.

<h2><i>THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND THE ROLE OF THE FIRST LADY</I></h2>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
April, 1996</CENTER><P>
	Both Elizabeth Dole and Hillary Clinton represent a new kind of First Lady - independent, successful, and ambitious.   Laura Blumenfeld of the <I>Washington Post</I> claims that the traditional First Lady role is to stay out of politics, promote do-good projects, and smile.  But, that was then and this is now.  Hillary Clinton's active role was highlighted nationally when her "partner" named her head of the Health Care Task Force - at a cost to taxpayers of $14 million.  On the other hand, Elizabeth Dole intends to raise some $60 <b>billion</b> dollars for charitable organizations.  This is quite a difference from past First Ladies, and quite a contrast between the two front-running contenders.
<P>
	According to Representative Scott Klug (R-WI), the role of the First Lady will be "redefined in the next few years."  He's right. Barbara Bush was the last of a generation - the archetype of the grandmotherly, sophisticated hostess is gone.  She was a very strong lady, but was only interested in promoting her husband.  Her polls were always high because she avoided partisan politics, and issue debate.  Enter Hillary!
<P>	
On the campaign trail in 1992, Bill Clinton quipped "buy one, get one free."  Hillary was voted "Most Likely to Succeed" in high school, selected graduation speaker at Wellesley, and graduated from Yale Law School.  She served as a partner in the now infamous Rose Law Firm as well as held countless board positions from Wal-Mart to the Children's Defense Fund.
<p>
	Hillary's role model as First Lady is (not surprisingly) Eleanor Roosevelt.  But Hillary has gone beyond Eleanor's "pet" issues; she affects day-to-day policy and strategy.  She moved her office from the ceremonial East Wing to the working West Wing, and when Bill Clinton wanted Health Care reform, he turned to Hillary.
<P>	
But what is known of Mrs. Dole?  Here's a sampling of her personality and background.  Now, you can judge which type of First Lady you'd like at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>	
Elizabeth Dole is, as some say, the finest candidate in the race for President this year.  Many pundits have asked why she is not running herself instead of the Senate Majority Leader. At his victory rallies, she interacts exceptionally well with the crowd practically pushing him to follow her lead.  Her credentials are very impressive and speak for themselves.
<p>
	She can speak energetically and passionately about Bob's issues without any prompting or notes.  She has a warmth and southern charm to her that earned her the nickname "Sugar Lips" during the Reagan Administration.  In a 1983 <I>Business Week</I> article, Elizabeth Dole was compared to Jackie Kennedy as "a glamorous, feminine presence draped on a frame of steel." 
<p>
	As for her career, she has served as a Federal Trade Commissioner, the Secretary of Labor under Reagan,  the Secretary of Transportation under Bush, and is currently the President of the American Red Cross.  She has taken a leave of absence from the Red Cross to campaign for her husband.  When she did that in 1988, Peter Jennings declared that one of America's finest women in government was leaving.  
<p>
	Elizabeth intends to continue working as First Lady - she would be the first First Lady to keep a career.  Her answer to this country's problems is community and charitable organization, not bureaucratic task-forces.
<P>
	She has told <I>Ladies Home Journal</I> that she will lead a move to increase giving to churches, non-profits, and other charitable organizations by one percent, which translates into $62 billion dollars more going to those who are actually solving America's problems.  
<p>
	Both women represent the future of the First Lady; they are career-oriented and bright.  They still are devoted to their husbands, and to a large degree sacrifice their own potential successes for their men.  Both also have been accused of being the brains, the heart, or the masterminds behind their husbands' career.  Although they are, and would be, "working" First Ladies, Hillary is unpopular.  Liddy is not.
<p>
	The First Lady now represents America's working women who have to balance home, family, work, and career.  Hillary broke the mold, but who will get to expand and develop the role for the next four years?  What do you think?  Has Hillary set a good standard for those to come?  Has she improved or hurt the image of the First Lady?

<h3><I>Notable Quotations from a Founding Father – Washington</I></h3>
<p>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996</center><p>

February 22 marked George Washington’'s 264th birthday, 
and in the past year a new political magazine has appeared on newsstands with 
Washington’s first name on its masthead.   Yet we rarely hear about Washington’s  
thoughts on government.  He is more symbol than man.  True, he is, “First in war, first in 
peace, and first in the heart’s of his countrymen,” but what did he intend for our current 
government?
<p>


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprising, if you look at his presidential speeches, 
Washington does a good job of fleshing out the ideas upon which <a href="/heritage">Heritage</a> was founded in 1973: <b>free enterprise, limited 
government, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.</b>
<p>
<center><b>		George Washington on FREE ENTERPRISE</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>In his farewell address, Washington said we should, “cherish public credit,” and we 
should avoid the “accumulation of debt.”  He backed a balanced budget -- before it was 
popular.<p>
<li>According to the European bankers handling American credit, during Washington’s 
tenure, our credit rating went from “bankrupt” to as high as any other European 
powers.<p>
<li>In private life in 1785, in conjunction with the Maryland and Virginia legislatures, 
Washington organized the Potomac River Canal Co., which was likely the first 
development company financed with private and public capital.<p>
<li>Concerning trade, in his farewell address, Washington said, “our commercial policy 
should hold an equal and impartial hand” to all nations.   
</ul><p>
<center>	<b>	George Washington on LIMITED 
GOVERNMENT</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>Washington was a firm believer in the importance of checks and balances; he said in 
his farewell, we must “avoid the exercise of powers of one department to encroach upon 
another.”<p>
<li>He also was the first citizen-legislator, since he set the tradition of a two-term 
president.  He was “reluctantly drawn” into service from his home at Mt. Vernon, VA.
<p></ul>
<center><b>		George Washington on TRADITIONAL AMERICAN 
VALUES</b></center>
<p><ul>
<li>Washington said in his farewell, “Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to 
political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.”<p>
<li>He also had a strong desire to protect future generations. We cannot “ungenerously 
throw upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear.”<p>
<li>In his inaugural address, he commented that there was “an indissoluble union 
between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage.”<P>
 </ul>
<center><b>George Washington on STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE</b></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In 1790, Washington claimed that “to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual
      means of preserving peace.” <p>
<li>In his first annual address (it was not called the State of the Union back then), 
Washington said, “A free people ought not only be armed, but disciplined.”
</ul><p>


&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Our founding father believed and supported the basic 
principles of Heritage in his most memorable and important speeches.  Next time you 
think of General Washington, think beyond the Gilbert Stuart painting to the ideas of our 
nation’s past, present, and future.

MediaNomics noted recently that NBC's Lisa Myers has been emerging as one of 
the most original network reporters. During July, the trend continued.
<P>
Last month Myers reported again on sugar subsidies for Dateline. She pointed 
out that the program costs consumers while a limited number of sugar growers 
get billions in subsidies.
<P>
Then, in a Nightly News story, she returned to the Medicare debate. Myers 
reported again that most recipients receive much more in benefits than they 
paid into the program and that Medicare's explosive growth wasn't predicted by 
its founders.
<P>
Myers' fact-based reporting continues to clear up the often foggy enntitlements 
debate.

<h3>The Non-Farmer's Guide to Agriculture Reform</h3>
<P>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
March, 1996</center><p>Both houses of Congress have passed legislation, dubbed the Freedom to Farm Act, that would open up the American agricultural market by eliminating governmental interference.  The two versions of the bill will now go to a conference committee.  But what exactly is involved in this legislation and what needs to be changed in the conference committee?
<p>
<b>Why do we need Agriculture reform?</b> 
<p><ul>
<li>To take advantage of the substantially lower trade barriers GATT has created -  a new marketplace of 6 billion people.
<p>
<li>To make agricultural markets respond to the demand of the marketplace, not the demand of central government planning
<p>
<li>To breath new life into the rural economy and agricultural infrastructure
<p>
<li>To take advantage of our natural resource edge, and use all productive land to our nation's economic benefit 
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; See <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/bg1002.html">Backgrounder 1002</a>, "Freeing U.S. Agriculture to Take Advantage of the New Global Markets" for more information.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What's so wrong with the <b>current system?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The current system removes 15% of US acreage from production - if used that acreage could add $8 billion to gross farm income according to a 1994 report by the National Grain and Feed Foundation.
<p>
<li>American government-inflated prices make American exports the last products to be bought -- the "residual supplier."
<p>
<li>Restrictive agricultural policy during the 1980's watched worldwide consumption go up from 3.258 billion metric tons to 3.815 billion metric tons from 1982 to 1990.  Yet US exports went down from .187 billion metric tons to .176 during that same time.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What is the difference between the <b>House HR 2854</b> and <b>Senate S 1541?</b> See <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">Issue Bulletin 221</a>, "Agriculture Reform, Can House Succeed Where Senate Failed?"
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; House Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) called this legislation the mark of a "new direction"
<p>
<b>BOTH:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Replace subsidies for wheat, grains, cotton, and rice with fixed declining payments through 2002<p>
<li>Eliminate the Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) -  a program that along with the CRP removes 15% of all US farmland acreage from production.
<li>Put agriculture on a market orientated system
<p>
<li>Reauthorize the sugar and peanut provisions<p>
<li>Eliminate Farmer-Owned Reserve, which currently allows the government to control large stocks of surplus grain and dump them on the market in order to drive down commodities prices.<p>
<li>Allow farmers the freedom to decide what, where, and how to plant
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The <b>House bill</b> differs in that it:
<p><ul>
<li>Creates a commission to study future role of government in agriculture<p>
<li>Includes $200 million in cleanup for the Everglades -- thanks to Speaker Gingrich
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The <b>Senate bill</b> differs in that it:
<ul><p>
<li>Includes food stamp provision<p>
<li>Provides 300 million dollars in rural development<p>
<li>Returns to current law in 7 years without further action
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Why is agricultural reform a priority?
<p><ul>
<li>Two million farmers are currently without federal guidelines as planting season starts.  Farmers do not know if they can plant what they wish or what the government wishes.<p>
<li>Farm policy will not be reassessed for another 4 to 5 years which would put us at a further disadvantage with other GATT nations
</ul><p>
What else should be included in the legislation?
<p><ul>
<li>A deep cut in CRP, which is only capped in both proposals.  CRP is the Conservation Reserve Program that was authorized in 1985.  The program is intended to remove land that is highly erodible from production by renting it from farmers for ten years.  But 22 out of the 36 million acres in CRP today are considered to be among the highest classes of land.  Only 4% of the land actually qualifies as highly erodible.    The cut should be from the current 36 million acres to at least 15 million acres.<p>
<li>Eliminates the three-entity rule, a loophole by which farmers can get twice the benefits they deserve.<p>
<li>Phase out the sugar and peanut provisions -- free the entire market<p>
<li>Pass this as a individual agriculture act, save food stamps for welfare reform legislation and save Everglades cleanup for environmental legislation.<p>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a> writes that "for sixty years, Washington has tried to manage US agriculture" like a welfare state.  The changes which end the government's manipulation of production for major crops is historic. However, Congress' failure to enact significant reform in the area of peanuts, sugar and dairy means that they will have to finish the task of reforming agricultural policy in the near future.

<CENTER><H3>Medicare Reporting Improving, But...</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
In June, MediaNomics described how TV network news reporters were incorrectly 
characterizing Republican plans to slow the rate of Medicare's growth. During 
the study period, reporters called GOP plans "cuts" twice as often as they 
correctly called GOP plans "slowing Medicare's growth."
<P>
Since then, there has been a dramatic improvement in network labeling. Now, 
half of the time network reporters get it right labeling Medicare reform plans. 
Media-Nomics analysts reviewed all of the stories about Medicare on network 
evening newscasts from July 15 to August 15. In the 15 stories, there were 24 
references to either the GOP plan or the Clinton plan to reform Medicare. 
Twelve of the references labeled the plans "cuts" or "reductions." An equal 
number of references labeled the plans as slowing the rate of increase in 
Medicare.
<P>
There is, however, still some confusion. Many reporters now use the terms "cut" 
and "slow the growth" interchangeably, sometimes even in the same story. CNN's 
Catherine Calaway, for instance, on the July 25 World News, referred to 
Medicare "spending cuts," but then, two sentences later, said: "Both parties 
hope to slow Medicare growth, but Republicans would go further."
<P>
Her CNN colleague, Jill Dougherty, did the same four days later. On the July 29 
World News she reported on "Republican plans to cut the growth in Medicare 
spending," but then later in the story alluded to "the $270 billion in 
GOP-proposed cuts." On the next day's World News Dougherty again clouded the 
issue. After first reporting that "Republicans propose cutting Medicare's 
growth by $270 billion," she mentioned charges that "Republican cuts are just a 
cover for the $245 billion they want to give away in tax cuts." 
<P>
Later in the story she said the GOP was "intent on giving voters a balanced 
budget along with hefty tax cuts, and it's hard to see any way to do that 
without taking something out of Medicare."
<P>
The other networks were similarly sloppy. On the July 25 World News Tonight, 
for example, ABC reporter Rebecca Chase pointed out that "both parties propose 
slowing the growth of Medicare spending," but then later talked about how much 
they would "reduce" Medicare spending. At CBS, reporter Bob Orr said: 
"Republicans want to reduce the growth in Medicare spending by $270 billion 
over the next seven years, more the double the $124 billion reduction proposed 
by the White House." But as he was saying this, viewers saw a graphic on screen 
with the same numbers, only under the headline "Proposed Medicare Cuts." 
Viewers presumably must have wondered if Medicare spending was being cut or 
merely slowed.
<P>
The most frequently mentioned number in network Medicare stories was $270 
billion -- the amount by which Republicans propose to slow the projected growth 
of Medicare. It was cited by ABC's Rebecca Chase and Bob Zelnick, CBS's Bob 
Orr, CNN's Jill Dougherty (twice), and NBC's Joe Johns (although Johns called 
it a cut, saying seniors were "angry over Republican plans to reduce Medicare 
spending $270 billion.").
<P>
According to ABC's Zelnick, for example: "Republicans want to cut $270 billion 
from projected cost increases during that time." These reports (except for 
Johns') were true, as far as they went. But they still gave the impression that 
reform meant fewer dollars for Medicare recipients. A clearer way of phrasing 
it would have been: "Republicans would allow the program to grow by $105 
billion over the next seven years instead of the projected $375 billion."
<P>
Only one reporter, CBS's Rita Braver, pointed out that spending per recipient 
would increase over the next seven years under the Republican plan. On the July 
25 CBS Evening News, after running soundbites from Democrat politicians calling 
on Republicans to keep their "greedy" hands off Medicare, Braver put things in 
perspective: "Republicans argue they don't want to cut Medicare, just control 
its growth, spending only $6,700 per capita instead of $8,000 per capita  in 
2002." A graphic on screen clearly showed that spending under the Republican 
plan would increase from $4,800 per recipient to $6,700 per recipient in 2002.
While reporters have improved the accuracy of their Medicare reform labels, 
there are still some of the same weaknesses in Medicare reports that 
MediaNomics identified three months ago. In soundbite selection, for example, 
reporters still overwhelming favor politicians over economists and others who 
could give non-political angles.
<P>
Twenty-five soundbites were from politicians (14 Democrats and 11 Republicans), 
as well as a story-length interview of former Republican Senator Warren Rudman 
by NBC's Brian Williams on the July 27 Nightly News. Only three soundbites, and 
no lengthy interviews, were from economists. And two of those were in one 
story, a July 27 Nightly News report by NBC's Lisa Myers.
<P>
And when it came to the views of ordinary Americans, most reporters seemed to 
agree with NBC's Brian Williams who claimed, on the July 29 Nightly News, that 
the elderly "would be most affected by GOP plans to fix the cost of Medicare." 
There were seven soundbites from elderly Americans who benefit from Medicare. 
There was only one soundbite -- again in Myers' July 27 story -- from someone 
younger who supports today's retirees while knowing they will get less support 
in their old age.
<P>
Only three of the 15 reports, in fact, covered more than the usual political 
angles of Medicare. One was Braver's July 25 CBS Evening News report mentioned 
earlier. She was the only reporter to point out just how much more will be 
spent per recipient under Republican plans. 
<P>
Another was a July 25 World News Tonight story by ABC's Rebecca Chase. She told 
viewers that "Medicare spending has gone from $7 billion [in 1970] to $159 
billion today." She added that "spending, now rising 10 percent a year, must be 
controlled, because in another 15 years the great wave of baby boomers, the 
largest generation ever, will be eligible for Medicare." No other reporter told 
of those numbers.
<P>
The most informative story was Myers' July 27 Nightly News report. She touched 
bases every other reporter missed, such as the fact that the average recipient 
will receive over $100,000 more in benefits than he or she paid in Medicare 
taxes and that the Johnson Administration was almost $100 billion short in its 
projection of what the cost would be in 1990. She also interviewed a Medicare 
expert, rather than just politicians, and a worker whose taxes support 
Medicare, rather than just elderly Medicare recipients.
<P>
But most of the network Medicare reporting, while improving, is still hamstrung 
by a narrow focus on the politics of the issue and an unwillingness to 
distinguish between a cut and slowed growth. If reporters want to help the 
public understand the continually explosive Medicare issue this fall, they will 
focus less on the politics of the issue and more on the numbers behind the 
crisis.

<P>
Small, ugly Ferengi represent sci-fi series' vision of business owners
Many observers have noted the exceptional nature of the Star Trek shows. 
According to TV Guide, for instance: "The Star Trek series and films can, in 
theory, foster deeper understanding and better communication among people. But 
do they?" When it comes to race relations, the value of friendship, and the 
virtue of loyalty, the Star Trek shows do. But when it comes to business, 
economics, and the profit motive, they do not.
<P>
The only regular characters on the Star Trek shows who engage in commerce are 
the Ferengi. They are a small, ugly species. They care only about profit and 
seem to think that the best way to earn a profit is to cheat and trick 
customers, even each other. They are disdained by nearly every other species, 
which, it is made clear, have evolved beyond the profit motive.
<P>
The Ferengi have the highest profile role on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the 
third incarnation of the Star Trek series. Almost all of the show's non-Ferengi 
regular characters promote virtue and bring honor to their jobs. They lead 
admirable lives. Viewers, last season, saw the stoic Commander Sisko devote his 
life to his son and his crew. They saw Major Kira, a former terrorist, become a 
trusted crew member.
<P>
Odo, a Changeling (one who can change form at will) and the space station's 
head of security, defies his own aggressive species when they threaten his 
friends on the station. Viewers learn that Doctor Bashir chose medicine as a 
profession because it would allow him "to help people." Lieutenant Dax, Sisko's 
confidant, is reliable and wise. And Chief O'Brien puts the happiness of his 
wife, a botanist turned teacher, above his own happiness.
<P>
But then there's Quark, a Ferengi business owner on the space station. Quark 
runs a bar and gambling casino. He puts nothing ahead of profit, except perhaps 
saving his own skin. For instance, on the October 1, 1994 episode, Sisko is 
assigned to establish relations with a relatively unknown species. He wants 
Quark to go along on the dangerous mission because the Ferengi have done 
business with the species. Quark is reluctant and recommends sending his 
brother, Ram, instead. "Ram only has a son to think about. I have a business," 
Quark pleads.
<P>
On the October 15, 1994 episode, a Klingon is accidentally killed in Quark's 
bar. The bar had been doing poorly, but the killing attracts the morbid 
curiosity of onlookers. Quark, to keep their interest, concocts an elaborate 
story about how he killed the Klingon. Business booms, but Ram is worried about 
his brother's ploy. Quark remains steadfast: "Look at that crowd. How long has 
it been since you've seen that many customers waiting to get in here? This is 
an opportunity to turn everything around."
<P>
On the May 20, 1995 episode, Quark visits the Ferengi home planet and viewers 
learn that Ferengi women are not allowed to wear clothes, address men they do 
not know, and, most of all, earn a profit. Quark's mother is accused of all 
three and Quark is held responsible. The clear message: Everything about the 
Ferengi, including the pursuit of profit, is antediluvian. In the same episode, 
one of Quark's relatives decides to join Star Fleet. Quark is livid: "He's a 
disgrace to this family and to Ferengi everywhere. He should be here, helping 
us earn a profit, not in his room learning how to be more like a human."
<P>
On the February 25 episode, the Grand Nagus, who is the leader of the Ferengi 
people, is abducted and brainwashed by aliens. When he returns he seeks to 
reform the Ferengi way of life, to make Ferengi less interested in profit. 
Quark confronts the aliens, who explain their disgust of profit: "We found the 
concept aggressive, adversarial, dangerous. We could not comprehend how any 
species could lead such a barren existence."
<P>
Quark then threatens that if the aliens don't restore the Grand Nagus to his 
former self, more Ferengi would come and bother them. Only then do they agree 
to restore the Nagus. From what viewers see of the Ferengi, who could blame 
them?
<P>
Such depictions of the Ferengi are typical, and there are no positive business 
characters balancing such portrayals. On Star Trek, viewers see people of 
different races, even different species, working together for a common cause 
and putting others ahead of themselves. Unfortunately, business isn't part of 
this vision; rather it's seen as fit only for a small, ugly, less-than-evolved 
subspecies.

<center><h2>Editor's Note, by Burton Yale Pines</h2></center>
<center><h3>Post: Low Pay Not a Dead End </h3></center>

A nation of hamburger flippers in dead-end jobs.
<p>
That's almost always the dire outcome predicted by journalists when they cover 
America's fast-food industry. Such reporting, intended or not, tends to confirm 
and bolster the calls by politicians and academics for ambitious federal 
job-training programs and other measures that they claim are needed to lift 
unskilled Americans out of the minimum-wage trough.
<p>
Such reporting, sadly, misses one of America's major economics and business 
stories: The fast-food industry as the nation's most effective job-training 
program. 
<p>
One reporter, however, obviously has not missed the story. He's the Washington 
Post's Peter Behr who, in a September 11 page one article, profiles Le-Van 
Hawkins, a 35-year-old African-American Horatio Alger who now owns a $39 
million-a year business and who got his start where? At hamburger-flipping 
McDonald's. Throughout his perceptive report, Behr uses Hawkins' own successes 
to make the valid but almost always ignored point that fast-food jobs can be a 
great career beginning rather than a dead end.
<p> 
Behr explains how Hawkins, a high school dropout who had "a serious cocaine 
habit" and grew up in Chicago's notorious Cabrini Green housing project, was 
taught discipline and skills by his fast-food employers. At his first 
McDonald's job, writes Behr, Hawkins "became a walking encyclopedia on 
McDonald's procedures for dealing with burgers, pickles and fries. The lesson 
of getting the details right struck." These lessons were reinforced by 
subsequent jobs at Kentucky Fried Chicken and other fast-food outlets.
<p>
Citing an executive with Hawkins' firm, Behr tells his readers that there is "a 
career ladder inside the fast-food world, even if the bottom rungs don't reach 
very high. Workers who start out preparing food can advance to production 
leader, hourly shift manager and assistant manager." Some of the Hawkins' store 
managers, reports Behr, "earn up to $50,000 annually and will have the option 
to buy stock in the company."
<p>
Behr too notes the broader economic implications of the fast-food industry. He 
writes: "Fast-food franchises have long been islands of commerce in the often 
depressed sections of major cities." These typically inner-city franchises, 
says Behr, then "provide business for attorneys, accountants and suppliers in 
the community."
<p>
Behr's report is a needed antidote to journalists' prevailing low-view of 
low-paying jobs. Characteristic of this is Time's John Greenwald in the 
magazine's November 14, 1994 edition. Writing about high-salaried computer 
jobs, Greenwald remarked that they "bear little resemblance to the low-paying 
gas-pumping and fast food-making positions that the word 'services' has often 
brought to mind." This echoed Beth Belton's USA Today article of February 15, 
1994, talking about "low-paying jobs with few opportunities for advancement." 
TV viewers, meanwhile, would have heard ABC's Bob Jamieson, on the March 15, 
1994 World News Tonight, refer derisively to what he called "the low-paying 
service sector."
<p>
These and other journalists should study closely Behr's article. They then 
should investigate how poorly-educated Americans actually can learn job skills 
and work discipline. Their resulting articles could address the questions: What 
trains more workers -- government programs or fast food employers? Who does a 
better job of training? How long do most fast-food workers actually remain at 
the lowest-paying level? Such articles, at last, would begin educating the 
public that hamburger-flipping seldom is a dead-end job.

On May 2, the Clinton administration (and many reporters) busily played up the 
news that the economy had grown at a 2.8 percent rate. ABC's Brit Hume, while 
not downplaying the news, put it in political perspective.
<P>
Hume reported that Clinton economic advisor Laura D'Andrea Tyson called this 
"the second longest peacetime expansion since World War II, not mentioning that 
the longest was during the Reagan years, which the Clinton administration 
prefers to call the decade of greed." Hume pointed out that "she also did not 
mention that the expansion includes the last part of the Bush administration, a 
time Mr. Clinton always claimed was a recession."
<P>
Later that month, NBC's Mike Jensen reported another bit of good economic news. 
The giant companies that had been downsizing, Jensen said, have "finally 
started to rehire."
<P>
Unlike past reports on downsizing, Jensen interviewed a consultant who 
explained that the downsizing wave allowed companies to become more productive 
and profitable. The consultant, John Challenger, told viewers: "These companies 
are able to hire many people because of the downsizing decisions they made over 
the last few years."
<P>
Jensen even mentioned something rarely revealed in the news: "Ninety thousand 
new jobs were added to the nation's workforce every month on average for the 
last year, many of them at small companies." Jensen ended on a negative note, 
though. He said that many of these big companies are still downsizing their 
weaker divisions. "That's the new corporate America. Quick to fire, quick to 
hire, with American workers scrambling to find a job and to keep one." (See 
front page for why that's not the typical plight of workers.)

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Forbes Proposal Draws Media Fire</h2>
<p>
<h3>A Bumpy Road for the Flat Tax</h3>
</center>
<p>
The newest rage on the political scene is the flat tax. It has propelled the presidential candidacy of Republican Steve Forbes, causing most of the other GOP candidates to formulate a version of their own. The flat tax is a simple tax system with complex arguments both for it and against it. Covering such an issue is, therefore, a difficult task. To be fair and balanced, reporters at the very least must present the best arguments for it and against it. But so far, the best arguments for the flat tax have rarely made the news.
<p>
Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the flat-tax stories on network evening news shows (ABC World News Tonight, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News) and in national news magazines (Newsweek, Time, U.S. News & World Report) during the month of January. There were 16 stories which presented arguments for or against the flat tax. (There were more about the Forbes campaign generally.) In those 16 stories, arguments against the flat tax were presented 51 times, while arguments in favor of the flat tax were presented only 24 times.
<p>
Double Taxation. The argument against the flat tax most often presented -- 24 times in the 16 stories -- was that it would not tax interest income or investment income, and thus overly benefit the wealthy. For example, ABC's Dean Reynolds, on the January 29 World News Tonight, said the Forbes flat tax would mean "no taxes on inherited wealth or stock portfolios." Newsweek's Marc Levinson and Rich Thomas contended that "investment income would be tax-free." According to Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "There would be no capital gains tax, no tax on interest earned at the bank, or for money you've made through investments. A millionaire living solely on dividends or inherited money wouldn't have to pay any tax."
<p>
Only twice did a reporter point out that such a millionaire, under a flat tax, would in fact be taxed. Flat-tax proponents argue that investment income would indeed be taxed, but only at the corporate or bank level. As the Heritage Foundation's Dan Mitchell wrote in the January MediaNomics, under the flat tax "a corporation must pay tax on behalf of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends." Flat-tax proponents argue that, as in the case of withholding, savers and investors currently get less money because it has already been taxed, but still must pay an additional income tax on the money. Only Newsweek's Allan Sloan, in an anti-flat tax article, pointed out that currently "some [income], like corporate dividends, is in effect taxed twice."
<p>
Mortgage Interest. The next most common argument against the flat tax was that the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would hurt the middle class. Reporters cited such arguments 13 times in the 16 stories. According to the January 15 U.S. News & World Report, "Homeowners could see home values drop if mortgage interest payments and property taxes were no longer deductible." On the January 15 World News Tonight, Peter Jennings weighed in on the issue by only mentioning one side: "President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction."
<p>
Reporters mentioned counterarguments to such claims only three times. For instance, Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, said, "Forbes counters those arguments by saying the deduction won't be needed because homeowners will pay less in taxes, which will cause the economy to grow, which will cause interest rates overall to go down." No reporter mentioned that the deduction is actually regressive. John Berthoud of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution pointed out in the January 31 Investor's Business Daily that "80 percent of the break's tax benefits go to those with incomes over $50,000."
<p>
Federal Deficit. Twelve times reporters cited the claim of flat-tax opponents that the flat tax would greatly increase the federal deficit. NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 17 Nightly News, claimed that "the biggest loser would be the government. With a 17-percent flat tax, critics say the budget deficit could double." According to Jensen: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent."
<p>
Echoing Jensen, ABC's John Cochran, on the January 19 World News Tonight, said that "Forbes' opponents still say his version of the flat tax won't work, that it would increase the budget deficit at a time when Republicans are trying to eliminate it." U.S. News & World Report agreed: "The Treasury Department estimates that a flat-tax rate would need to be set at 21 percent -- not 17 percent -- to raise the same level of revenues as the current income-tax system does. Without raising this rate, the federal government would see its budget deficit rise, and this would add to Washington's fiscal woes."
<p>
Only half as many times -- six -- did reporters give the counterargument that the flat tax would not increase the federal deficit. Time's Dan Goodgame, for example, wrote that Forbes "assumes that tax cuts, even when financed by federal borrowing, will generate so much economic growth that they will quickly wipe out the deficit." Goodgame, though, dismissed such a belief as a "quasi-theology."
<p>
Noting that Forbes' 17 percent rate might be a revenue-loser for the government, some reporters wondered how Forbes would make up the shortfall. Newsweek's Allen Sloan asked: "How will he fill the gap? With economic growth and spending cuts. Details? Forbes isn't saying." Time's Goodgame criticized Forbes because he "declines to specify spending he would cut." It's true that Forbes has not been specific about spending cuts. But then reporters rarely give such reprimands to politicians who oppose slowing entitlement growth, but decline to specify how much taxes will then have to increase. Why the double standard for Forbes?
<p>
Charitable Contributions. Twice reporters mentioned the argument that a flat tax would hurt charities by removing the deduction for charitable contributions. According to ABC's Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "Charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible." The January 15 U.S. News & World Report similarly warned that "charities could lose donations if contributions were no longer deductible."
<p>
No reporter mentioned the counterargument that charities would not be hurt by a flat tax. John Berthoud's Investor's Business Daily article points out that "of $117 billion donated [to charities] in 1991, $56 billion came from non-itemizers. Of the $61 billion that was deducted, 54 percent came from Americans in low-to-moderate tax brackets. Thus, three of four dollars given to charity don't lead to a substantial tax benefit." Berthoud further noted that "top marginal tax rates dropped from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988, thus robbing the deduction of more than half its value. And the deduction for non-itemizers was eliminated in 1986. Yet charitable contributions rose" at a record pace.
<p>
Flat Tax Favorables. Only two arguments in favor of the flat tax -- its simplicity and its closing of loopholes -- were reported thoroughly. Seven times reporters made the case that the flat tax would make the tax code simpler. CBS's Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, pointed out "the simplicity of the plan. No accountants needed to tell you what you owe. No long forms to fill out." Six times reporters pointed out that the flat tax would close loopholes for special interests. Joe Klein, for instance, on the January 21 CBS Evening News, said: "[Forbes'] is a anti-Washington campaign, and that's how he sells the flat tax. He says, `I'll eliminate a whole lobbying industry, the industry that gets tax loopholes for special interests.' And that's the advantage of the flat tax."
<p>
But those were the exceptions. Most of the time arguments against the flat tax were presented without arguments in its favor meriting a mention. At times reporters, such as Newsweek's Allan Sloan, didn't try to hide their fondness for the politics of envy: "Taxing investment income at both the corporate and personal levels, as it's taxed now, may not be sound economics. But it's reasonably sound social policy, considering that most investment income flows to upper-income people." Sloan didn't mention that many investments, such as those in pension funds and mutual funds, are made by the middle class. 
<p>
At other times the opposition to the flat tax became absurd. NBC's Mike Jensen managed to find a middle class couple who claimed that the $3,146 tax cut they would get under the Forbes plan "is really not going to change our lives."
For such a simple policy, the arguments over the flat tax are quite complicated. Still, reporters should not bring up the arguments of flat-tax opponents unless they're willing to give flat-tax supporters a chance to respond.

<P>    Here's a benchmark to evaluate environmental policy: economic security and environmental protection go together. Conversely, when environmental policies thwart material wants, green goals languish.  Only when environmental policies foster economic security and productivity can we reasonably expect long term protection.  This understanding helps us protect environmental values.</P>

<P> Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and Garrett Hardins' &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; are bench marks of environmental history.  Both works were in process for years, noted only by a few professionals and by a elite audience.  In October of 1993 a new benchmark of environmental thinking was established at Airlie House, a conference center near Washington D.C.  Under the auspices of the Claiborne-Ortenberg Foundation, a group of 60 people from 20 countries met to reconsider environmentalism.  The group included anthropologists, field biologists, tribal leaders and donors.  </P>

<P> Their thinking is summarized in a brief, attractive booklet, The View from Airlie House.   They concluded that despite elaborate efforts, the conventional approach to conservation wasn't working.  One critical reason is strategic:  </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The chief strategy of conservationists for more than a century has been exclusionary and implicitly misanthropic....establish protected areas  ...and then safeguarding these areas by carefully limiting human use....The methods of this strategy have been proscription and enforcement--laws and penalties, wardens and guns, in some cases fences and gates....Biological diversity can't be preserved...by setting it aside within protected areas.
&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The participants identified five flaws in this approach.  First is the problem inherent to &quot;island ecology&quot;.  Small protected areas lose diversity over time.  Second, this protected area strategy is too costly and scattered to protect the world's biologically rich landscapes.  Third, governments lack the means to protect borders of sanctuaries.  Fourth, &quot;The protected-area approach, dependent on centralized power and top-down planning, has often robbed rural communities of their traditional user-rights over forests, waters, fisheries, and wildlife, without offering appropriate remuneration.&quot;  Hence, local people see conservation efforts as anti-development and anti-people.  </P>

<P> Finally, this strategy amplifies conflict.  &quot;Blockading rural people against the use of their own landscape without offering them viable alternatives will always, to the blockaded, seem perverse and intolerable.  And will always, consequently be futile.&quot;  Although the focus at Airlie House was upon the Third World, this is also a good but incomplete explanation of the origins of the Wise Use Movement in the American West.  The institutions that yield anti-protection sentiments throughout the Third World operate in the rural areas of the US and Canada.</P>

<P> The approach developed at Airlie is based on a series of case studies from around the world.  It features positive local participation, not proscription and enforcement alone.  It seeks ways to make local communities the beneficiaries and custodians of conservation efforts.  The phrase &quot;community-based conservation&quot; captures the essence of their approach.  </P>

<P> Earlier conservation efforts to protect public goods were based on exclusion and enforcement.  This approach isn't viable over the long term.  Communal use rights and systems of tenure are ignored.  Resources go to the politically favored.  This is the prevailing outcome when ever politicians can buy favor by granting access to natural resources.  </P>

<P> What's true in America is even stronger in third world nations.  Absence secure tenure, rural communities lack standing in decision making.  As a result, they lack incentives to manage for sustainability.  Their incentives are to consider short term interests and immediate gain.  Over the long term, environmental protection is impossible with out recognition of property rights and markets.  </P>

<P> It will be difficult for many greens, however sincere or intelligent,  to accept the View from Airlie, i.e., the positive linkage between use by local people and the  protection of biodiversity.  In today's environmental culture economy and ecology don't often mix.  The Foundation for Deep Ecology wants us to ignore the laws of economics.  Unfortunately for them, economic behavior seems &quot;hard wired&quot;  into our nature by the evolutionary process.  </P>

<P> But fortunately, well off, well educated people normally consider environmental quality an essential goal for a responsible culture.  According to Evert Ladd of the American Enterprise Institute, nearly three quarters of American voters consider themselves environmentalists. </P>

<P> Politicians who ignore this pervasive pro environmental feeling are in peril.  Voters did not reject environmental goals in the 1994 election.  Rather they found  repugnant the statist, bureaucratic, command-and-control means to green ends exemplified by the EPA's approach to wetlands and its management of Super Fund sites.  </P>

<P> Free market and free trade advocates are also challenged by the View from Airlie.  Strong local communities are often eroded by international trade.  Local markets involve personal relations and feelings.  Can they be protected from the relentless workings of the market process at the international level?  It's not clear that the answer is yes.  The drive toward bottom line efficiency usually erodes traditions--including the sense of place so critical to preservation.</P>

<P> The View from Airlie offers an innovative perspective on effective and viable protection of ecological values.  This is progress.  We've tried command and control and found it wanting.  It's time for community-based conservation and for rethinking environmentalism.  </P>

<h2><i>TIME TO TEACH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A LESSON</I></h2>

April, 1996</CENTER><P>
	Last week, 40 of the nation's governors met in Palisades, NY to discuss our educational system for the first time in seven years.  Louis Gerstner, the chairman of IBM, and host of the summit declared, "Our educational system is broken."  And education today is an issue on the minds of voters.  According to a recent Gallup poll, education is the top priority voters have in choosing whether or not to support a candidate.

	The summit was intended to push higher standards for core subjects from within the states, but the bigger issue that the governor's are not discussing is the future of the <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a>.
<p>	All of the GOP candidates for President last fall supported the elimination of the Department of Education.  From Dole to Gramm to Buchanan to former Secretary of Education Alexander, the GOP insisted that education was the responsibility of parents and localities.  Here are some interesting historical points about the evolution and role of the Department of Education -- and reasons why its elimination is on Congress' radar screen.
	<P>
<b>...IN THE BEGINNING</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a> was created in 1979 not long after another useless department, the Department of Energy.  Speaker Tip O'Neill demanded "We need a <b>special</b> department of Education."  He then got his wish, but has it worked?  Has our educational system improved?</ul>
	<p>
<b>RESULTS?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>In 1978, 8% of 8th graders failed to complete high school.  Enter the DOE.  Just in the nick of time, too.  In 1992, that percentage has <b>increased</b> to 12.
	</ul><p>
<b>	RED TAPE ELIMINATION?</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Representative Frank Horten (R-NY) stated, "It  [The DOE] does not create a new education bureaucracy.  In fact, it reduces bureaucracy."  Hold on, creating a cabinet department makes less red tape?  According to the Tax Foundation, the Department of Education spends out over 350 million dollars a year for  <b>internal management</b> alone.
</ul><p>
<b>	LOVE HURTS</b>
<p><ul>
<li>But you and I on the outside cannot see the good that results from the day-to-day operation of insiders within the department.  Not exactly.  The two most prominent former Secretaries of Education, Bill Bennett, and Lamar Alexander, have testified in front of Congress that the DOE produces, "bad ideas, harmful practices, needless expenditures, obsolete programs, and dysfunctional regulation."</ul><p>
	
<b>MICROMANAGEMENT FROM BIG BROTHER</b>
<p><ul>
<li>Virginia Governor George Allen claims that, "our recent experience suggests that concerns about federal bureaucratic interference cannot be lightly dismissed."  He is referring to a lawsuit that he is involved in against the Department of Education.  The lawsuit hinges around whether or not a local school can expel a "special" student with excessive behavioral problems.
	</ul><p>
<b>ALERT THE PRESS: SCHROEDER AGREES WITH US</b>
<p><ul>
<li>This issue has never been a conservative/liberal coalition-builder, but even Pat Schroeder claims, "The Department of Education will meddle in <b>everything</b>."  And it has Ohio Governor George Voinovich claims the Department of Education's management is "highly prescriptive and heavily regulated."  
</ul><p>
<b>	STRINGS-ATTACHED MONEY</b>
<p><ul>
<li>The claim is that the feds do so much for education that they have a right to interfere with you idea of how your children should be educated - after all, aren't the feds paying the bills?  Try again.  According to the <I>National Journal</I>, however, <b>less than 10%</b> of education money comes from the federal government.  The Department of Education's programs are as former Rep. Bob Michel said so "irrelevant to the needs of American children," that school districts in a quarter of the states have refused federal funds to avoid implementing federal mandates, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy. Governor Allen suspects that the US government costs local schools more in regulation than it spends on the schools.
	</ul><p>
	The Department of Education stands in the way of real education reform and school choice.  Bob Dole says, "Put parents back in charge of our schools."  He's right about this.  According to Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, education is "a local issue, and it must remain a local issue."  For those of you who still like the DOE, could you answer a question that former Senator S.I. Hayakawa asked at the inception of the DOE.  "How [does] this department make our children literate?"  It does not.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</title>

<H2><center>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>No Skepticism Toward College Costs</h3></center>
<p>
Imagine that there's a product or a service that has gone up in price by 239 percent over the past fifteen years and whose cost continues to increase well ahead of the rate of inflation. Imagine further that the company that produces the product or service blames consumers for the steep price increases. Would reporters accept such an excuse at face value? The CEO of the company would surely be seen sweating before the cameras of 60 Minutes or getting stern lectures from Nightline's Ted Koppel, right?
<p><b>
Not if the product is a college education.</B><br>
The same reporters who are quick to expect the worst -- and demand government action -- when businesses raise prices show a curious lack of curiosity about the shocking rise in college tuition rates over the past several years. In stories about tuition hikes, reporters almost never question the price increases. And they never, ever, bring up the explanation many conservatives and economists point to: government education subsidies help cause the price hikes.
<p>
The most recent example of this lack of skepticism came when President Clinton proposed a $1,500 tax credit for students in their first two years of college. On June 4, the day Clinton announced his proposal, no network report even hinted that it might cause tuition increases. CBS's Rita Braver, for example, merely said that it was "aimed at attracting all students into post-high school education." Peter Jennings called it "the latest giveaway in presidential politics." (That's what they always call tax cuts.) Jennings did point out in the next story that "college expenses are growing at twice the rate of inflation." But he didn't ask why or suggest that some argue Clinton's proposal would add to the problem.
<p>
This is part of a long pattern in network reporting on higher education. Media Research Center analysts reviewed all 23 stories about higher education financing on the ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC news shows between June 1, 1995 and June 1, 1996. No reporter in any of the stories mentioned the argument that federal aid helps fuel the escalation in tuition costs.
<p>
To be sure, reporters often do point out that tuition costs are increasing dramatically. Many of the stories on higher education focus on families trying to deal with such costs. ABC's Tyler Mathison, on the July 12, 1995 <i>Good Morning America</i>, reported that with costs so high, "it's no wonder more and more American families are borrowing to pay the bills." Many stories are helpful to consumers by pointing out which colleges are the best buys.
<p>
But reporters rarely ask why college costs are rising. And when they do, they accept, without challenge, answers they would never accept from industry. Example: CBS's Susan Spencer, on the May 2, 1996 48 Hours. A college administrator told her that he would like to cut costs, but it might hurt the reputation of his school. "So most colleges aren't even trying to cut tuition," Spencer reported. "People might think the quality of education had been cut as well."
<p>
CBS had a different attitude toward the recent gasoline price increases. Dan Rather wondered: "Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or something more sinister?" The networks have also demanded explanations for price increases of other products, such as gasoline or breakfast cereals. But the ivory tower is above such questioning.
<p>
This omission leads to biased reporting of education policy proposals. CNN's Bobbie Battista, reporting on a speech by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the June 1, 1995 Inside Politics, said: "Mrs. Clinton also tweaked those who benefited from the U.S. education system and now want to cut it...She didn't name names, but presidential candidate Phil Gramm, who wants to abolish the Department of Education, went to college thanks to government-sponsored loans." And in hundreds of stories over the past year, Bill Clinton repeated his claim that cutting federal aid to students was "extreme" without being asked why taxpayers must continue to finance higher education's largesse.
<p>
Only one network reporter even suggested the tuition price increases may not be justified. Former CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, on March 12, pointed out that "the private sector, in terms of business out there, has done all this cutting over the last ten years or so to become more competitive." He asked consumer reporter Hattie Kauffman: "Are colleges doing that at all?" But even Smith didn't point out the argument that colleges and universities are shielded from such efficiency because of government subsidies.
<p>
Had he read an article by John Hood of the John Locke Foundation, in the May, 1995 issue of Reason, he might have. "Is land for classrooms that much more expensive? Is there a shortage of people becoming professors, bidding up the wages of those currently in colleges and universities? Do books cost more than they used to?" Hood asks. "The short answer is maybe -- but the cost increase in higher education far outpaces increases in any of those expenditures."
<p>
According to Hood, there are so many government subsidies at even private colleges and universities that "tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education. The 'costs' themselves are essentially arbitrary." Hood explains that federal aid is given to a student based on how much costs exceed the student's "expected family contribution." Since colleges and universities know the average expected family contribution, they can increase tuitions and make more students eligible for aid. "Families will pay more, but a good portion of the tuition hike will be picked up by the government. Hence, colleges and universities can get more money for providing exactly the same service."
<p>
Proof? Hood looks at history. "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges," he claims. "Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges." He points out that revenue from Pell grants rose by more than 25 percent between 1985 and 1992 and that state level grants rose by 15 percent. All the while, college administrators were complaining about "cutbacks" in federal aid and using that as an excuse to raise tuition.
<p>
But network reporters don't challenge college administrators about their continuous price increases. Apparently, when it comes to higher education, greed is good, or at least not worthy of criticism.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Report on Victims of Products, Not Litigation</title>
</head>

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Networks Report on Victims of Products, Not Litigation</center></h2>
<p>
Reporters Rail Against Legal Reform
<p>
Most observers of the media will agree that if there is one group to which almost all reporters are partial, it's victims. Reporters are eager to cover those who have been injured wrongfully or who have suffered injustices. Such profiles are commonplace in stories about nearly every political issue and often send powerful signals to viewers and readers about which side of an issue deserves sympathy.
<p>
Often this biases stories against free market policies. It is easy, after all, to interview those who get government benefits and who will, at least in the short term, suffer if the benefits are reduced. It's not as easy to interview a young person whose future is being mortgaged to pay for the government programs.
<p>
Current Congressional efforts to reform the U.S. legal system, therefore, present the media with an exceptional opportunity to be balanced. There are clear, identifiable victims on both sides of the tort reform issue. On the anti-reform side are those who have been harmed by a defective product and for whom the courts may be the only redress.
<p>
On the pro-reform side are the small business owners who have been forced to lay off workers or even go out of business because of frivolous lawsuits; as well as small business owners who have caved in to settlement demands in frivolous cases because they could not afford to defend themselves in court.
Despite this clear opportunity, reporters dropped the ball. Media- Nomics analysts reviewed every story about legal reform on each TV network's evening newscast during the first five months of this Congress. While reporters more than adequately covered the plights of those who have had to sue companies because of defective products, they did not interview or focus on a single small business owner or other victims of frivolous lawsuits. Reporters were also completely uninterested in exploring the economic costs of the current legal system.
<p>
Of the 19 legal reform stories that aired, eleven focused on neutral facts about recent Congressional action on legal reform, eight were explicitly critical of such reforms, and no story was critical of the status quo. Six of the eight stories critical of reform described how the status quo helps victims of defective products or medical malpractice. None probed how the status quo may hurt those who are targets of frivolous lawsuits.
<p>
The soundbites were similarly skewed. No business owner, small or large, was interviewed for a soundbite; only two representatives of business associations were interviewed. Five lawyers, by contrast, were interviewed for soundbites, as were four representatives of trial lawyers associations and five representatives of self-described consumer groups. Six stories carried soundbites from victims of defective products; none carried soundbites from victims of frivolous lawsuits. No story featured an interview with an economist, who could have told viewers of the economic benefits of legal reform.
<p>
Bob Faw's May 2 NBC Nightly News story was typical. "62-year-old sheet metal worker Ben Jones was a victim, not just of cancer, but of medical malpractice," Faw reported. "Four years ago doctors at this Fort Worth hospital bungled. Instead of removing Jones' cancerous left lung, they removed his healthy right lung." According to Faw, "The doctors also lied about what they had done and by the time Jones found out, it was too late. He died painfully and unnecessarily."
<p>
Faw interviewed the victim's widow, son, and attorney, plus a member of the American Medical Association (AMA). While the AMA member did point out that much of the money from malpractice awards goes to lawyers, Faw nonetheless concluded by wondering if "efforts to reign in lawyers will end up hurting the Jones'."
<p>
Similarly, on the March 10 CBS Evening News, Art Rascon profiled the case of a Florida boy who because of doctors' mistakes has been in a vegetative state for the past ten years. Because of a Florida law stating that damage awards over $200,000 must be approved by the state legislature, Rascon explained, the boy's family hasn't received any money. "So little Justin still lies in bed," Rascon concluded, "the victim of not only a tragic medical mistake, but of a legal and political system that has yet to resolve the fate of this 11-year-old boy."
<p>
One reporter, ABC's Tim O'Brien, seemed especially hostile to reform. On the March 7 World News Tonight, O'Brien downplayed worries of a litigation explosion and said that "making the loser pay the winner's legal expenses may reduce the number of lawsuits, but most consumer groups insist only the wealthy could sue." O'Brien only interviewed representatives of the Association of Trial Lawyers and of Consumer Action.
<p>
Two days later, on the March 9 World News Tonight, O'Brien again interviewed a narrow range of sources, this time only a representative of Public Citizen, a consumer group backed by trial lawyers. O'Brien and his source, Public Citizen's Joan Claybrook, tried to play down the abuse of punitive damages in product liability lawsuits.
<p>
According to O'Brien most of the large awards which make headlines are later reduced on appeal. "Consumer groups insist the mere threat of punitive damage awards benefits the public," O'Brien said. He never gave the other side: The mere threat of punitive damages also causes many wrongfully accused firms to settle cases because it's cheaper than litigating, even if they win.
<p>
On the March 13 World News Tonight, O'Brien focused on what effect legal reform would have on malpractice lawsuits. His story focused on Willie King, a patient who had the wrong foot amputed by doctors. Viewers heard from King, his attorney, and the president of the Trial Lawyers of America. Said O'Brien: "[King's] lawyer says Congress should be making doctors more accountable for mistakes, not less."
<p>
Missing from O'Brien's story was, for instance, an economist who could have told viewers that large malpractice awards cause everyone's insurance rates to go up. Reporters in general ignored economists who could have informed viewers of the economic benefits which most experts think legal reform would usher in.
No one on either side of the debate would argue that those injured by faulty products shouldn't have the right to seek redress in court; and Faw, Rascon, and O'Brien were not wrong to focus attention on such victims. 
<p>
But legal reform is a complex issue. As with most other political issues, the economic ramifications of legal reform have not been explored by reporters. And anecdotes about victims of defective products and services were not balanced by reports on another set of victims whose stories need to be told: the wrongfully accused small business owners who are often hurt by the current system. Viewers need to know that there are victims on both sides of the legal reform issue if they are to be well-informed.

<BR><DD>We received an interesting invitation to a video conference in Washington honoring Women's History Month, titled &quot;Sexual Harassment 1996: Scholarly Definitions &amp; Everyday Realities.&quot;

<BR><DD>And wouldn't you know that Anita Faye Hill, who charged she was sexually harassed by Clarence Thomas, is the featured special guest panelist. The video conference will take place March 27 at the Biz Net Studios in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Building.

<BR><DD>We're told that Paula Corbin Jones, who has brought sexual harassment charges against President Clinton, will not be participating.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Kooks on kooks</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Democrats are finding that the World Wide Web is an effective means for distributing news, information and even a political jab or two to a large audience.

<BR><DD>Taking a peek at one of the Democratic Policy Committee's well-designed Web pages - http:// www.randomhouse.com/site/ election96/carville/ - we find links to such items as the &quot;Ridiculous Republican of the Week,&quot; the &quot;Republican Hatchet Job of the Week,&quot; the &quot;Republican Myth of the Week&quot; and, last but not least, the &quot;Republican Kook of the Week.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Say anything</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>It's an election year, and President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore certainly aren't fooling anybody, but for the sake of the youth of our nation, that's OK with Sen. Orrin G. Hatch.

<BR><DD>&quot;President Clinton has let the country down because of his failure to lead on the drug issue,&quot; the Utah Republican said. &quot;We have gone from a 'just say no' program under President Reagan to pleading with President Clinton to just say something.

<BR><DD>&quot;If the president is finally beginning to speak out more because it is a political year - I know he just held a conference on some aspects of this problem - then I say it is better late than never. I commend him for it.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Bunning and the boys</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Pitcher-turned-congressman Jim Bunning is one of four baseball greats elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The Kentucky Republican, 64, won 224 games with the Detroit Tigers, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates over 17 seasons.

<BR><DD>Rep. Henry J. Hyde, Illinois Republican, got to deliver the news about the future Hall of Famer's election to the House.

<BR><DD>In doing so, he told the story of when Mr. Bunning was pitching against the New York Yankees, who had a first-base coach named Bob Turley, &quot;a former pitcher who was very skilled at stealing signs. Every time Jim would throw a fastball, Turley would whistle, and the batters knew what the pitch was,&quot; Mr. Hyde noted.

<BR><DD>&quot;Now, the first batter up was Bobby Richardson, and Jim got him out. The second batter up was Tony Kubek, the shortstop. Jim got him out. The third batter stepped in, Mickey Mantle, and Jim walked over to the first-base coach, Turley, and he said, 'If you whistle, I am going to hit him right in the back with a pitch.'

<BR><DD>&quot;Jim took the mound. He got his sign, and he was at the top of his windup when Turley whistled. Jim decided to cross everybody up. He threw a slider. It got away from him, and hit Mantle right in the back. Mantle headed toward the mound with his bat, but decided better of it, and trotted down to first base.

<BR><DD>&quot;The next batter was Yogi Berra. Yogi stepped in, pounded the plate, looked at Jim Bunning and said, 'Hey, Jim, if Turley whistles, I ain't listening.'&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>The Wright stuff</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper, who was the oldest member of Congress when he died in 1989 at 88, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1937. A liberal, he was on Capitol Hill to fight for Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and against Ronald Reagan's conservative revolution.

<BR><DD>Last week, Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, North Dakota Democrat, recalled the week he first set foot in Congress and walked into the office of Mr. Pepper, &quot;and I saw something I have not forgotten.&quot;

<BR><DD>On the wall behind Mr. Pepper's desk, the senator remembered, &quot;was an autographed picture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. And it was autographed, 'To Congressman Claude Pepper,' by Orville Wright. ...

<BR><DD>&quot;Then, hanging just above that, was a picture of Neil Armstrong setting his foot on the moon, autographed, 'To Congressman Claude Pepper.'&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>We got you, boys</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>A tremendous audience of 250 people showed up for a news conference recently at which the national retail sales tax was unveiled. The legislation would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, the federal income tax and inheritance taxes, replacing them with a retail sales tax of about 15 percent.

<BR><DD>Republican Reps. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana and Dan Schaefer of Colorado are co-sponsors of the legislation, although fellow Rep. Sonny Bono, California Republican, dropped by to see why the big audience.

<BR><DD>Introducing the former Hollywood entertainer, Mr. Tauzin noted: &quot;You know, when Sonny wrote the song 'I Got You, Babe,' it was really the theme song for the IRS.&quot;

<BR><DD>To which Mr. Bono quipped: &quot;Billy and Dan, you guys have got a lot of courage for sponsoring this legislation, because you know you're going to get audited!&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Pork alert</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We've just examined the 1996 Congressional Pig Book, released by Citizens Against Government Waste.

<BR><DD>&quot;Rolling out the pork barrel and having a barrel of fun has long been one of Washington's more unseemly traditions, and few indeed have shown the will to resist its temptations,&quot; notes the 600,000-member, nonpartisan organization in the introduction.

<BR><DD>First, the criteria for pork: requested by only one chamber of Congress; not specifically authorized; not competitively awarded; not requested by the president; greatly exceeds the president's budget request; not the subject of congressional hearings; and serves only a local or special interest.

<BR><DD>Second, a few examples of pork 1996-style, followed by CAGW reaction:

<UL>
<LI>$395,000 awarded in conference for rice modeling at the University of Arkansas and the University of Missouri. &quot;Uncle Ben, not Uncle Sam, should be funding this research.&quot;

<LI>$3.75 million by the Senate for wood-utilization research from Maine to Oregon. &quot;How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if he had $3.75 million?&quot;

<LI>$1 million by the Senate for outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers.

<LI>$1 million by the Senate for research on the brown tree snake. &quot;The Brown Tree Snake, which is found only in Guam, has not been discovered to be life-threatening to humans, nor does it have the ability to survive in North America.&quot;
</UL>
<p><center><b><font size=5>Real death</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>A government notice states: &quot;According to the National Center for Health Statistics, tobacco, diet and alcohol are the three leading causes of actual death in the U.S.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Talk about reporters</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Carrie Klein, a former aide to Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, Oregon Republican, compiled the congressional index that appears in the 1996 Media Studies Journal, published by Columbia University. One portion notes:

<BR><DD>&quot;Number of journalists accredited to the Senate and House press galleries: 7,142.

<BR><DD>&quot;Ratio of journalists to congressmen: 16:1.

<BR><DD>&quot;Ratio of journalists to senators: 71:1.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Sweet dreams</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Sen. Jesse Helms, North Carolina Republican, was on hand at the White House March 12 to witness President Clinton sign long-awaited legislation to tighten sanctions against Cuba.

<BR><DD>Emerging from the signing ceremony, Mr. Helms encountered a horde of reporters in the White House driveway, one of whom pointed out: &quot;You know, the Cuban government says repeatedly that this law is going to have no impact, that in reality the other governments are not going to pay attention to what it says, on the contrary it's illegal because it goes against NAFTA and GATT. What's your impression? Do you think -&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Well,&quot; interrupted Mr. Helms, &quot;will you deliver a message to the Cuban government for me?&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the reporter, &quot;I can't -&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Dream on!&quot; Mr. Helms told the Cuban government.

<BR><DD>&quot;... but I'm sure they're hearing it,&quot; the reporter said.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Sea to shining sea</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We've intercepted a memo from the U.S. Coast Guard commandant's office that says Transportation Secretary Federico Pena &quot;has requested that the department commemorate Earth Day, April 22, 1996, with a celebration that reaches across the country from headquarters to our field units.&quot;

<BR><DD>It continues: &quot;This is an ideal opportunity to recognize every individual's role and responsibility and to reinforce one of the Coast Guard's most important missions, 'Protecting Our Environment.' This year's theme is 'Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.'&quot;

<BR><DD>The memo directs all field units &quot;to plan and participate in Earth Day festivities either by conducting Earth Day observations at your units ... or by contributing to local community Earth Day celebrations.&quot;

<BR><DD>It also requests that each unit provide in advance to the commandant's office a list and description of planned Earth Day activities.

<BR><DD>The Earth Day tradition was launched in the United States in 1970, shortly after the Cuyahoga River caught fire.

<p>
With job insecurity garnering headlines in the U.S. and many demanding that the government "do something" about it, few reporters have looked overseas to see what happens when governments try. Time's Jay Branegan did. According to Branegan, in the April 15 issue, "The rich benefits that have made Europe a sweet place to work have clogged its economic arteries. Call it Eurosclerosis -- the combination of a staggering tax burden and a blanket of regulations that smother new businesses and entrepreneurship."
<p>
Branegan's evidence: "Europe's unemployment rate of 11 percent is twice as high as the U.S.'s, and its job creation chart is a flat line. Over the past three years, the U.S. has created 8.4 million new jobs, Europe none. Significantly, many of those new American jobs pay higher than average wages, and as many as 60 percent are managerial or professional." Branegan also pointed out that high minimum-wage laws in such countries as France mean "many [Frenchmen] aren't working at all. Joblessness among young people, hit hardest by minimum-wage laws, is roughly twice France's overall unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent." Something for reporters to keep in mind as American politicians debate raising the U.S. minimum wage.
<p>
On the March 26 CBS Evening News, correspondent Ray Brady reported on one form of government spending that has largely escaped the budget ax -- corporate welfare. Specifically, Brady looked at federal subsidies for ethanol. According to Brady, "Critics, even those within the U.S. government, say the virtues of ethanol are way overstated. At a time when the government is cutting on social programs, they question why it's still handing out subsidies to the ethanol industry, subsidies that amount to nearly $800 million a year."
<p>
Brady recounted how "ethanol was born of desperation during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, when gasoline prices soared and lines pressed for miles. But now gasoline is plentiful, much cheaper to produce than ethanol. And today, ethanol accounts for just over one percent of all U.S. energy consumption." And while "ethanol does reduce some pollutants, the Congressional Budget Office says it contributes to others, such as ozone pollution."
<p>
Why, then, does the subsidy continue? "Many point to the lobbying of corn growers and generous political donations to both parties by Archer Daniels Midland, the world's largest producer of ethanol, and a major beneficiary of the government's subsidies." According to Brady, the ethanol industry has "racked up $6 billion in subsidies, courtesy of the American taxpayer."
<p>
Kudos to Branegan and Brady for practicing journalism at its best, with Branegan looking at the results of programs politicians are proposing and with Brady questioning programs neither political party wants questioned.

<H1>Marking the End of an Era of Crisis Entrepreneurship</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>


<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE>, Vice President Al Gore writes in the book's Foreward, discusses &quot;compelling and urgent questions that must be answered.&quot;  He calls it the sequel to the first enviromental benchmark, <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  He's wrong.  </P>

<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> marks the end of an era of public susceptibility to ill-founded hysteria and crisis entrepreneurship.  Unlike Al Gore, serious and intellectually honest environmentalists demand factual and logically consistent foundations for reform.  Hype and posturing are pass&eacute; in the environmental policy arena.</P>

<P>The book's authors are Theo Colburn, John Peterson Myers, and Dianne Dumanoski, two zoologists and a former reporter, respectively. This &quot;scientific detective story&quot; is provocatively subtitled &quot;Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, And Survival?&quot;  It charges synthetic chemicals (found in PVC pipes, Tupperware, and Tide) with disrupting hormones.  They allege hormonal disruptors are responsible for all manner of ecological, psychological, and social ills, ranging from illiteracy to &quot;lesbian&quot; seagulls.  Their solution?  Ban synthetic chemicals.</P>

<P>The book's timing is immaculate.  It comes as the National Academy of Sciences convenes to discuss hormone disruptors.  It arrives on bookshelves just in time for April 22, Earth Day.  <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> has a sexy title, a fetus on the cover, and a dramatic detective story inside.  It is PR masterpiece.</P>

<P>Yet it's flopping.  Reputable responders trash the book.  The <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com"><CITE>New York Times</CITE></A>, <A HREF="http://update.wsj.com"><CITE>Wall Street Journal</CITE></A>, <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com"><CITE>Los Angeles Times</CITE></A>, <CITE>Washington Post</CITE>, and <CITE>Washington Times</CITE> have criticized the book for all manner of flaws, from hysteria mongering to junk science and from faulty logic to poor writing.  It's a sign we're making progess.  Here's why.</P>

<P><CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> will not become the next <CITE>Silent Spring</CITE>.  That's good news for those of us who rank environmental quality among our highest priorities.  We learn more from failure than success, and this failure offers important lessons for environmental reformers.</P>

<P>People in the environmental movement are far more sophisticated today than in 1962.  They recognize that greens attract both &quot;crisis entrepreneurs&quot; and genuine advocates for the public interest.  These crisis hustlers generate new support by touting an emergency and then providing avenues down which people can parade their good intentions and express their sincerity by sending money.  Conservative, quiet groups such as the Isaak Walton League and American Forestry Association lose to those that emphasize drama, apocalypse, and urgency at the expense of intellectual integrity.  </P>

<P>But hysterical environmentalism ultimately backfires.  Greenpeace International's mission against chlorine is an excellent example.  Their anti-chlorine campaign led to Peru reducing the chlorine it added to its water supply.  The result?  A cholera epidemic swept through insufficiently chlorinated water supplies, taking far more lives than the chlorine ban could possibly have saved.</P>

<P>Colburn and friends deride the cancer scare of the early 1970s for turning cancer into &quot;the ultimate measure of our fears.&quot;  They see our preoccupation with high cancer rates as &quot;more myth than reality.&quot;  Scientists and regulators in the &quot;War on Cancer&quot; wasted precious time and resources.  Colburn recognizes the perils of overstating cancer threats.  Ironically, she tells us that, compared to cancer, hormone disruptors pose a far greater danger.  Disruptors may destroy humankind.</P>

<P>But, after a few scares, people become jaded and cynical.  Short-term opportunism thwarts constructive outcomes.</P>

<P>Such opportunism may work in the short-run, but it antagonizes scientists and policy analysts.  For example, <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> greatly exaggerates the scientific consensus regarding declining sperm counts.  The book's misleading science invites criticism and undermines its alleged purpose.  It's immediate supporters are likely to feel as foolish by the autumn of the year 2000 as those who predicted global cooling should today.</P>

<P>Also, environmentalists can learn that benefits normally imply costs.  Only when they recognize both, and acknowledge inescapable trade-offs, can they recommend constructive and effective policies.  This is not a cost-free world.</P>

<P>But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> considers only the negative effects of synthetic chemicals.  It offers no appropriate responses.  If plastics, pesticides, and paints merely sabotaged our biochemistry, Colburn's recommended ban might make sense.  But synthetic chemicals are integral to modern civilization precisely because of their benefits.</P>

<P>Good public policy must incorporate the risks, benefits, and harms of each issue. Lorenz Rhomberg, Ph.D. of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis writes, &quot;a crash program of [hormone-disruptor] control and cleanup will divert precious resources from other pressing environmental problems.&quot;  Colburn ignores these trade-offs.</P>

<P>Sincere, sophisticated and sensible environmentalists shun chicanery and irresponsible reforms.  They see these proposals are more dangerous than the synthetic chemicals Colburn pillories.</P>

<P>Insisting that chemicals be presumed guilty of hormone disruption until proven innocent by chemical manufacturers is terribly foolish.  Even undergraduates should know one can't prove the negative.  Anyone can always claim we simply haven't looked hard enough.  By requiring chemical manufacturers to do the impossible, she dooms the beneficiaries a modern chemicals to the 1800s.  Failing to acknowledge the huge benefits of modern chemistry is naive or disingenuous.</P>

<P>Savvy Americans expect misguided policy proposals from even gifted scientists.  We understand that for PR firms image trumps truth.  We expect and understand when crisis entrepreneurs with Greenpeace incite panics to build budgets.  But why do smart scientists recommend pathologically unwise policies?</P>

<P>When scientists leave the lab and enter the policy arena, thier body temperatures and IQ scores often seem to converge.  A future scientific detective story may explain this tragic phenomenon.  But <CITE>Our Stolen Future</CITE> already has the answer:  hormone disruptors. </P>

<title>Labor Money Is OK</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Labor Money Is OK</h2></center>
<p>
Jackie Judd's report on the June 14 ABC World News Tonight warned of the close-knit nature of the relationships between, as anchor Peter Jennings put it, "politicians and the industries they are supposed to oversee." So far, so good. But their look at the ties of big business overlooked another group: Big Labor. 
<p>
Jennings introduced Judd's report: "Many politicians still like to wine and dine and travel on somebody else's tab." Judd focused on Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings, Republican Senator Larry Pressler, and House Republican Pat Roberts, who all accepted free travel from industries for which they chair committees. Of Hollings, Judd said: "As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he took half a dozen trips courtesy of industries his committee oversees." And of Roberts, Judd said: "The American Crop Association hosted him at the swanky Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, and the Dairy Foods Association flew Roberts to Miami for a four day trip."
<p>
Judd's findings were worthy of reporting, but she didn't go far enough. As with most stories about the influence of money in politics, Judd's only looked at business. Labor groups also finance junkets for those in Congress and spend lavishly on campaigns, but viewers were left in the dark about their activities. 
<p>
Judd also didn't ponder why industry finds it necessary to lobby in the first place: often to defend their turf from encroaching government power. What Judd sees as industry's cozy cronyism may be simply a method of survival in a regulatory age.

<h2><i>The Energizer Secretary: She keeps going, and going...</h2></i>
<P>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
March, 1996


</CENTER>

<P>

	Hazel O'Leary has been embroiled in scandal after scandal since she became Secretary of the <a href="http://www.doe.gov">Department of Energy</a> under President Clinton, but it may finally catch up with her as a <a href="http://www.house.gov/commerce/o&i.htm">House Commerce subcommittee</a> begins to expand its probe of O'Leary's activities as Secretary.<p>
	I hope to give you a quick run-down on some of the allegations against Madame Secretary, but it is by no means a complete list, as Representative Joe Barton (R-TX)  has said, "the more information we obtain, the more potential problems we appear to be uncovering." <p>
	<b>The so-called Mission of The Department of Energy</b> (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1061.html">Backgrounder 1061</a>, "How to Close Down the Department of Energy")<p>
<ul>
<li> Since the Department was created in 1977, it has struggled to find its proper role or mission after the initial energy crisis of the '70's.<p>
<li>Representative Joe Barton does not &quot;really see a mission for the DOE&quot;<p>
</ul>
                                <b>Travel: Around the World in 130 Days</b><p>
<ul>
<li> O'Leary has spent over <b>130 days abroad</b> on 16 trips.
<p>
<li> On two of those trips, she was accompanied by over 50 aides, on another by 48 aides -- well over the number taken by previous Secretaries of Energy or even Secretaries of State!<p>
<li> Her four main missions have cost the taxpayers $2.6 million<p>
<li> She has upgraded from business to first class on 9 flights, and also made use of Madonna's favorite charter plane, the MGM Grand, on three occasions - when cheaper airfare was available.<p>
<li> O'Leary caused dismay last year when she arrived at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency with 38 aides -- not exactly &quot;fiscal austerity.&quot; -- previous Secretaries have taken 2 or 3 aides to similar meetings.<p>
<li> O'Leary claims that these trips brought in $27.7 billion dollars in new business, yet  Rep. Barton has said &quot;we cannot document a single case where the trip itself resulted in a contract that would not have been signed otherwise.&quot;
</ul>	
                                           <p>
<b> O'Leary's Media Consultant</b><p>
<ul>
<li>The DOE spent some $46,000 on a of media coverage study by Carmen International.  The result was a ranking of journalists and coverage of the DOE -- it was accused of being an &quot;enemies list&quot;.<p>
</ul>
<b>	The Department of Energy's New Logo</b><p>
<ul>
<li> O'Leary spent over $10,000 in a search for a trendier design for the DOE logo according to <i>Time</i> magazine.  She decided however not to make the move after she found out the cost would be over $1.7 million for the switch -- Hazel O'Leary, the poster child of financial restraint.<p>
</ul>
<p>	
            <b>  O'Leary Takes on the Military</b><p><ul>
<li>Going against a Cold War tradition, O'Leary released the location of over 111.4 metric tons of plutonium that was until now considered to be of extreme national security importance<p></ul>
<p><b>	Friends in Low Places</b><p>
<ul>
<li>O'Leary has also gotten in trouble according to the National Journal for overpaying a department ombudsman who happened to be a personal friend
</ul>
There have been Secretaries in every Cabinet embroiled in some sort of scandal, but the Clinton cabinet claimed to be different. Yet Agriculture's Secretary Espy and Treasury's Deputy Secretary Roger Altman are already gone and O'Leary and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown are under heavy fire.  O'Leary said it best herself &quot;sometimes we have to ... come to work as if you did not need a job.&quot;  Well for your sake, I hope you don't.<p>

<H2>Gingrich, Armey Lead Poll of Respected Conservatives
</H2>
<H3>Leadership Institute donors respect the Speaker and House Majority Leader for Strong Leadership in Congress</H3>
<P></center>
<BR>
<BR>
	<DD>Rejecting media attacks on the current Congress, Leadership Institute donors selected Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and House Majority Leader Dick Armey as the conservatives leaders they respect most.<P>
<I>	Speaker Gingrich received nearly 40% of   the vote.  U.S. Rep. Armey got nearly 30%</I>.<P>
 <DD>	The mail-in survey was conducted in June.  It suggested no names.  In all, 722 of those who sent in the survey volunteered which leader or leaders they respect.
<DD>	According to Morton Blackwell, president of the Leadership Institute, the <a href="respect.html"> Results</a> indicate the conservative grassroots favor leaders who take bold and principled stands for concerns  of both economic and social conservatives.
<DD>	"The natural governing majority in America is a coalition of economic and social conservatives," Morton said.  "The survey results reflect that."  
<BR><DD>	U.S. Rep. John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, won 79 votes, tying for fifth place with radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh.
<BR>	<DD>In third, with 89 votes each, were conservative thinkers Jack Kemp and William Bennett.
<BR>	<DD>GOP presidential candidates rounded out the top 10.  Bob Dole received 72 votes-22.6 percent of the total vote for Republican presidential candidates.  Pat Buchanan received 63 votes and U.S. Senator Phil Gramm got 55.
<BR> <DD>	None of the respondents selected President Bill Clinton as the most-respected conservative leader.

<center><h3>FLAT out throw them out: Part II</h3></center>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>It's time for sound policy, not sound bytes!</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	First, Steve Forbes and Dick Armey did not invent 
the flat tax this past year.  The flat tax has been around since 1981 when it was introduced 
by Dr. Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabuska.  Early supporters surprisingly included current 
<b>White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta</b>.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Enough on the history lesson, <i>Washington 
Post</i> columnist Jim Glassman said that the press is to blame for much of the poor 
treatment of the flat tax.   So it is our responsibility on a personal level to educate our 
neighbors and associates about the flat tax since the media can't or won't.  Because with 
or without its current messenger Forbes, the flat tax will survive and dominate the future 
of tax reform discussions.  So it is important to get out the message on what the flat tax 
actually is and what its likely effects will be.
<p>
<b>Why everyone should love the flat tax -- the universal appeal...</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; It's <b>fair, simple, singular and pure</b>.
<P><ul>
<li>	<b>Equality</b> The government will no longer be able to pick winners and 
losers with the tax code because everyone will fill out the same postcard and play by the 
same rules.  Everyone will pay the same rate; if your neighbor makes 10 times as much as 
you do, he will pay 10 times as much.
<p>
<li>	<b>Simplicity</b> Go ahead and toss out all of those 600-odd IRS forms with 
the fine print in favor of a simple postcard that takes minutes, not days to fill out.  
<p>
<li>	<b>Singularity</b> No longer will your money be taxed three or four times.  
Under the current system,  each dollar you earn can be taxed up to four times including 
capital gains taxes, interest taxes, company taxes, and inheritance taxes.  
<p>
	The goal of the flat tax is to tax all income once.  It is possible that after all 
current taxes are paid on your original dollar, you may only have 20 cents left, according 
to Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Dan Mitchell.</a> 
<P>
	 A result of the current loophole-filled tax code, only 11 percent of all income is 
taxed, according to the <a href="http://www.shoponline.com/ncpa/">National Center for 
Policy Analysis</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Purity</b> We cannot let any deduction beyond the personal allowance to be 
included in the proposal because once one deduction is allowed - interest groups will 
demand inclusion of their tax break.  This purity is necessary to keep the code fair and 
simple, as Heritage's Dan Mitchell wrote in <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi85.html">Why Liberals Should Support 
The Flat Tax</a>.
</ul><p>
<b>I keep hearing about the crisis surrounding the elimination of home mortgage 
interest.  What will happen to the housing market if we adopt a flat tax 
proposal?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Housing is a superior good; meaning that as the 
economy grows the housing market will grow accordingly.  Many of the numbers that 
have been raised in opposition to the flat tax were derived from a <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi87.html">study</a> done by 
DRI\McGraw-Hill, for the <b>National Association of Realtors</b>, that many experts 
say contains serious flaws. (See <a 
href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi87.html">Worst Case Scenario: Flat Tax 
Would Boost Home Values by 7 Percent or More</a> by William Beach and Dan 
Mitchell.)
<p> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In the first place, only 22 percent of all homeowners 
use the deduction and a majority of them are wealthy.  When realtors were asked by 
Citizens for a Sound Economy what the most important factor is when buying a home, 
the top two answers were interest rates and down payment.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Great! The flat tax will drop interest rates and put 
more money into the taxpayers' pockets.  Also throw into consideration that without the 
capital gains tax, selling your house would give you more cash.  
<p>
<b>How are you so sure interest rates will fall?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The best example of what would happen is seen if 
you compare municipal bonds and taxable securities.  On average, the interest rate on 
municipal bonds is 1.3 % less than taxable securities, so by implementing a flat tax 
system that does not tax interest, interest rates should fall at least one percent.
<P>
<b>But no one will give to charity anymore without the deductions.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	That same argument was made in 1986 after the tax 
cuts, but 1988 was a record year for charity giving.  Only half of donations to charity are 
even deducted, and for the most part this country is a generous one.  The better off we as 
a country are, the more money will be given to charity.  
<p>
<b>All the flat tax will do is add to the deficit because the Treasury will experience 
a reduction in revenues.</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The three biggest annual gains in revenue to the 
treasury were experienced in the 1920's, 1960's, and 1980's, which were three eras of tax 
cuts.  Why?  First, the wealthiest individuals will be less inclined to use tax shelters or 
overseas investments to avoid high tax rates.  Revenues grew 4.8 percent under 
Kennedy's cuts, and 2.2 percent under Reagan's cuts, according to Dan Mitchell. 
 <p>
 
<b>But how much money does this mean will come into the economy?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If the economy only grows one-half of one percent 
faster in ten years that will result in a difference of $5,000 dollars to each family.  The 
National Center for Policy Analysis reports that just raising the annual growth rate from 
2.5 to 3.3 percent will add $2.3 <b>trillion</b> dollars to the economy in 6 years.
<p>
<b>How come the rich do not have to pay money on dividends, when I work all 
week trying to get by and get taxed?</b>
 <p>
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dividends currently are taxed twice -- once on the 
corporate level, and then again on the individual level.  The flat tax eliminates only the 
second tax, dividend checks are merely after-tax payments.  As it is now, those who 
receive those checks are taxed unfairly.
 <P>
<b>Has the flat tax worked anywhere, or is this just academic conjecture?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Hong Kong, one of the fastest growing economies 
in the world,  has a flat tax and a budget surplus.  Closer to home, the Joint Economic 
Committee found that in terms of real personal income growth from 1962 to 1994, states 
with flat tax systems on average grew 223%, while progressive tax systems grew only 
175%.  "Even when the initial move is revenue neutral, in the long run, government 
revenues are higher with the flat rate."
<p>
<b>What about the national sales tax?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The sales tax backed by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tx.) 
and Sen. Richard Luger (R-Ind.) has many of the same benefits of the flat tax, but has one 
main drawback.  The transition from income to sales tax would be costly and difficult, 
and there also is the scary possibility of ending up with both systems.
<p>
<b>How can a flat rate help control government spending and balance the 
budget?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	According to the Tax Foundation, the Forbes plan 
would bring in around $300 billion dollars less in revenues for the first couple of years.  
Not so bad if you ask me, go ahead and cut spending to go along with the tax cut.  Or as 
Grover Nordquist said, "starve the beast."  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Another idea that I like is possibly linking a yearly 
balanced budget with an annual flat tax rate.  Such a system proposed by Glassman 
makes sense.  If Congress wants to spend more in any given year then they will have to 
raise everyone's flat tax rate.  This would put pressure on Congress to cut spending more 
and more every year to lower tax rates.
<p>
<b>Someone told me this was a <i>progressive</i> flat tax...</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under most of the current proposal there will be a personal 
allowance on approximately the first $30,000 made by a family of four.  After that 
deduction, each person pays the flat rate on any additional money.  The rich will pay 
more because the personal allowance is a smaller part of their total income.  So the rich 
will pay a higher rate than the middle class using a flat tax proposal, so some call it a 
<i>progressive</i> flat tax.
<p>

It only takes minutes.  See how you do, and I think you will like what you see.  To get a

<title>Why Liberals Should Support the Flat Tax -- Heritage</title>

<h3>WHY LIBERALS SHOULD SUPPORT THE FLAT TAX</h3><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel J. Mitchell</a><br>
McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 85<br>
February 7, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The flat tax continues to gain support across the country as more and more Americans realize that the existing tax code cannot be fixed and should be replaced by a fair and simple tax code. Polls show that workers, investors, savers, entrepreneurs, farmers, small business owners, and the elderly are among the groups of Americans drawn to the proposal because they feel they will pay less in taxes, benefit from a faster growing economy, or simply avoid the hassle of today's mind-numbing tax code.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is one group, however, which should support the flat tax but has yet to do so: liberals. Consider the following eight features and consequences of a flat tax which one would expect to appeal specifically to this group:
<p><ul>
<li> The key philosophical principle of the flat tax is equality. All taxpayers play by the same rules, no matter how wealthy they are.
<p>
<li> Lower rates result in the rich shouldering more of the tax burden. This happened in the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s.
<p>
<li> Deductions disproportionately benefit the wealthy and others able to exploit loopholes. Eliminating them with a flat tax allows for a lower rate for those with lower incomes.
<p>
<li> Radically simplifying the code with a flat tax will help end the corrupting effect of tax lobbyists and prevent politicians from exploiting the tax system to generate campaign contributions.
<p>
<li> Because of a generous family-based allowance, the poor are shielded from the income tax burden. A family of four pays no income tax on their first $33,000.
<p>
<li> The flat tax will boost wages and income for lower-income and middle-income workers by eliminating the double, triple, and sometimes quadruple taxation of capital.
<p>
<li> A pro-growth tax system will reduce the budget deficit by increasing the tax base and reducing demands for government spending.
<p>
<li> Lower-income and middle-income taxpayers will enjoy a more financially secure retirement if they are not forced to pay a double tax on their savings.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History illustrates that a flat tax will generate immense benefits for Americans of all backgrounds and incomes.<sup>1</sup>  Honest liberals -- those who are genuinely concerned about helping the less fortunate and who favor eliminating special advantages for the rich and powerful -- should be among the strongest supporters of sweeping tax reform. There are some on the left, however, who oppose the flat tax in the belief that some short-term political advantage can be gained from fomenting class warfare -- even if the ultimate victims are those who have the most to gain from a more rapidly growing economy.

<p>
<b>EIGHT REASONS FOR LIBERALS TO SUPPORT A FLAT TAX</b>
<P>
<b>1. A flat tax promotes equality.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals often say they are fighting for equality. No other word better describes the flat tax, whose key principle is that the law should apply equally to all taxpayers and all income. More specifically, supporters of the flat tax believe all taxpayers should play by the same rules and that government should not grant special preferences or impose special penalties based on how income is earned or spent. Equality under the law means a tax system with just one rate for all levels of income. Anything else explicitly allows the government to discriminate among taxpayers and ultimately is self-defeating.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi85c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows how the principle of equality applies to taxpayers with different taxable incomes. Under a system that treats citizens equally, a taxpayer with twice as much taxable income as his neighbor pays twice as much in taxes.
<p>
<b>2. The rich pay more.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals often equate a fair tax system with one that results in the rich paying more. If so, the flat tax is the answer to their prayers. Why?  While the flat tax is designed to treat all taxpayers equally, history strongly suggests that one effect of moving to a flat tax is that the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich actually will increase. America has had three major episodes of tax rate reduction -- in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. In each case, lower tax rates removed incentives to hide income, shelter income, reduce earnings, and transfer money overseas. The result: Upper-income taxpayers were willing to earn and report more taxable income, and the amount of tax they paid increased. The evidence speaks for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1920s, tax rates were reduced from a high of 73 percent to 25 percent between 1921 and 1926. Did the rich get a free ride?  Hardly: The share of the tax burden paid by those making more than $50,000 -- a great deal of money back then -- rose dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1960s, the Kennedy tax cuts lowered the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. The result: Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>3</sup>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan reduced the top rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988 (see <a href="fyi85c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).<sup>4</sup>
<p><b>3. Deductions help the rich.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals presumably do not favor laws that confer special advantages on those with more income. Thus, the elimination of all loopholes, preferences, credits, exclusions, subsidies, and deductions under the flat tax should be particularly attractive to them. As <a href="fyi85c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, the three best-known deductions offer almost no benefit to the poor and middle class. Upper-income and wealthy taxpayers, by contrast, benefit immensely.

<p>
<b>4. A flat tax ends special-interest tax lobbying.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are 12,609 special interests officially registered to lobby in Washington, and the tax code is one of their chief targets.<sup>5</sup>  Former Members of Congress, former legislative staff members, consulting firm employees, and law firm partners are among those who can earn up to $500 an hour wielding influence in the tax-writing committees of Congress. It is precisely this process that has caused America's tax system, which began in 1913 with one simple form, to turn into a monstrosity encompassing more than 600 forms in which even the simplest -- the 1040EZ -- is accompanied by 33 pages of fine-print instructions.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While lobbyists are very well compensated for their efforts (and not all of them are looking for special loopholes; some are fighting to keep their tax bills from increasing), the biggest winners from the convoluted tax code are the politicians. <a href="fyi85c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows the average contribution levels for members of the House tax-writing committee compared with the average for other House members. This is one reason why the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees are considered the plum assignments for new Members of Congress.
<p>
<b>5. The poor pay no tax.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The only loophole in the flat tax is the one that protects the poor. Under the Armey-Shelby proposal (H.R. 2060, S. 1050), a family of four does not pay the 17 percent rate until its annual income reaches $33,300. This personal allowance, which is indexed to inflation to prevent bracket creep, is considerably above the poverty level and will ensure that even the low rate of a flat tax is not an impediment to those trying to climb the economic ladder.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As <a href="fyi85c5.gif">Chart 5</a> illustrates, the personal allowance also has the effect of making the tax system progressive. The tax rate on a family of four with $30,000 of income would be zero compared to an effective rate of 2.8 percent for a family with $40,000 of income and 5.7 percent for a family with earnings of $50,000. The effective rate continues to rise with income, reaching 9.5 percent on $75,000 of income, 11.3 percent on $100,000 of income, and 14.2 percent for a family with income of $200,000. For the well-to-do, the effective rate approaches 17 percent, as families with $500,000 of income pay 15.9 percent and a millionaire's household would pay 16.4 percent.
<p>
<b>6. A flat tax promotes higher wages.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Considerable discussion has been devoted to the plight of the middle class. While some assertions are false (for example, middle-class incomes have not fallen over the last 20 years), there is no question that earnings could and should be rising at a faster rate. Fortunately, there is widespread agreement among all economists that the way to increase incomes is to make workers more productive by giving them more and better tools with which to produce. As liberal economist Paul Samuelson has written:
<p><blockquote>

	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates.<sup>6</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Or consider the views of the White House. In the 1994 Economic Report of the President, the Administration noted that:<P><blockquote>	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reasons for wanting to raise the investment share of the GDP [gross domestic product] are straightforward: Workers are more productive when they are equipped with more and better capital, more productive workers earn higher real wages, and higher real wages are the mainspring of higher living standards. Few economic propositions are better supported than these -- or more important.
</blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History shows a very close relationship between worker income and productivity, indicating the importance of capital formation. Since the flat tax eliminates the multiple taxation of capital income, levels of savings and investment will climb, worker productivity will increase, and wages will rise.<sup>7</sup><P><b>7. Budget deficits are reduced.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another desirable feature of the flat tax, at least for liberals, is that government <a href="fyi85c6.gif">revenues will rise</a>. As discussed earlier, the United States has had three major periods of tax rate reduction -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. In addition to the fact that the rich paid a greater share of the tax burden and the economy boomed, these reductions resulted in dramatic increases in tax revenues.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1920s, the top tax rate was slashed from 73 percent in 1921 to 25 percent by 1926. Because of improved incentives to work, save, and invest, income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to nearly $1.2 billion in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent during a period of virtually no inflation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The White House today would do well to heed the words of then Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, who wrote that "The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions that resulted in legislation which reduced the maximum rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965. Just as happened in the 1920s, tax revenues again grew significantly, rising by more than 16 percent between 1963 and 1966.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As President Kennedy remarked in 1962, "an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.... In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988. As supporters predicted, the tax cuts triggered the longest peacetime expansion of the economy in the nation's history. Critics charge, however, that Reagan's program caused big deficits.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These accusations may resonate politically in some quarters, but they are false. Reagan's critics conveniently forget that the first tax rate reductions, in 1981 and 1982, were offset by bracket creep and previously legislated payroll tax increases. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut, beginning in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent (28 percent after adjusting for inflation) by 1989.<sup>11</sup><p><b>8. Americans will have a more secure retirement.</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's Social Security system is in deep trouble. The bipartisan entitlement commission estimates the system's unfunded liability (the differences between how much is promised and how much will be available) at a staggering $7.3 trillion. With the baby boom generation approaching retirement, the Social Security Administration projects that the system will begin to run a deficit in less than 15 years. While there are ways to avert this upcoming catastrophe (the best option would be to follow the Chilean example of privatization),<sup>12</sup> it is widely expected that lawmakers will be reluctant to address such a politically charged issue.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This approach, unfortunately, means that the so-called baby boomers will face significant benefit reductions compared with what they are being promised and will be forced to augment their retirement income with private savings. The current tax system, however, punishes those who attempt to save and invest by imposing double, triple, and even quadruple taxation of savings and investment income. Even if income is "only" double-taxed, the effect on savings is dramatic. Chart 7 shows the difference in the nest eggs of someone who saves $1,000 a year under the current system and someone who saves the same amount in a flat tax world in which income is taxed just once. As shown, the double tax on interest income imposed by today's code dramatically redu
ces the amount which can be saved for retirement. By taxing income only once, the flat tax would allow interest earnings to compound, resulting in a nest egg almost 92 percent larger than the same amount of savings would generate under current law. See <a href="fyi85c7.gif">Chart 7</a> for the comparison between private savings with and without a flat tax.  
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. tax system ostensibly is designed to make the rich pay more and improve living standards for those with lower incomes. Even a cursory examination of the facts, however, underscores that the biggest victims of a progressive income tax which punishes success are precisely those who are on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. By achieving the effects outlined above, a flat tax therefore should attract the support of well-meaning people of all ideological persuasions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is a particularly important test for liberals. They must decide which is more important: maintaining lobbying power in Washington and keeping a tax system that may satisfy an ideological impulse to punish success, or adopting a system that ends special-interest corruption and helps boost the living standards of the less fortunate.

	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Last year, the National Association of Realtors 
hired Data Resources Inc./McGraw-Hill, a leading econometric firm, to analyze the economic 
effects of a flat tax. The resulting study concluded that the enactment of this tax, which would 
treat all taxpayers and all income equally, would result in a 15 percent drop in housing 
values,<sup>1 </sup>due largely to the elimination of the home mortgage interest deduction. This 
study is now being used by opponents of the flat tax. Yet numerous experts have pointed out that 
the DRI/McGraw-Hill study has serious methodological flaws that make its conclusions highly 
suspect.<sup> 2</sup> A more reasonable method of analysis -- one that looks at the historical 
relationship between personal income growth and the value of owner-occupied housing, 
combined with the range of estimates showing faster economic growth under a flat tax -- shows 
that home values actually would rise by as much as 7 to 14 percent by the fifth year after 
enactment of a flat tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These results should come as no surprise.  As <a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, home values consistently have mirrored changes in personal income. When the 
economy is strong and incomes rise, consumers spend more on almost all goods and services. As 
a major component of family budgets, housing has followed this pattern. Although projecting the 
value of housing into the future involves a level of uncertainty, a wide range of studies indicate 
that adoption of a flat tax would boost the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) 
by at least 1 percentage point for a period of five or more years.<sup>3 </sup> Because personal 
income would rise with increases in GDP, it is possible to use the strong historical relationship 
between income and house values to generate estimates of how home values will change under 
the flat tax.<sup>4 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Critics of the flat tax argue that it is improper to use 
historical data to predict the future value of homes under a flat tax because, they say, the 
relationship between home values and personal income exists only in a world where mortgage 
interest is deductible. Yet if the deduction were indeed the critical variable, there should be a 
strong relationship between housing values in the past and the tax value of the deduction. In 
1980, before the Reagan marginal tax rate cuts, for instance, a dollar of home mortgage interest 
cost an upper-income taxpayer only 30 cents. In 1988, that same taxpayer paid 72 cents out of 
pocket for every dollar in interest payments. As <a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a> indicates, however, the tax value of the 
deduction had no discernible impact on the value of housing over the period.
<p>


<b>Why the Realtors' Study Is Flawed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If the historical evidence and economic projections 
suggest that a flat tax will increase home values, why did the realtors' study predict a sharp 
decline? The reason is that it used several very questionable assumptions. For example:
<p>
<b>1. DRI/McGraw-Hill analyzed a flat tax with an initial rate of 25 percent, gradually 
phasing down to 21 percent.</b> The DRI/McGraw-Hill study used a much higher tax rate 
than is used in existing flat tax plans. Crucially, the lower the rate, the larger the economic gains 
under a flat tax, and the higher the positive impact on home values. Even the Clinton 
Administration's Treasury Department, no friend of the flat tax, refused to use a rate higher than 
21 percent when estimating the effects of a flat tax on the economy.
<p>
<b>2. DRI/McGraw-Hill did not properly estimate the drop in interest rates under a flat 
tax.</b> According to the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, interest rates would drop by 25 
percent to 35 percent under a flat tax.<sup>5 </sup> Other experts have similar estimates.<sup>6 </sup> DRI/McGraw-Hill stands alone in basing its estimate of likely interest rate declines -- and 
thus the positive effect on home values -- on the comparison between municipal bond rates and 
10-year federal bonds, rather than interest-bearing assets of equal risk such as high-grade 
corporate bonds.
<p>
<b>3. DRI/McGraw-Hill overestimated by 30 percent the average marginal tax rate which 
applies to homeowners.</b> Doing so significantly overstates the tax benefits of the deduction 
and exaggerates the change in a taxpayer's cost of mortgage interest under a flat tax.
<p>
<b>4. The study assumed that financial assets would lose value under a flat tax.</b> This 
assumption is at odds with academic analyses of the flat tax and defies common sense. Lower 
taxes on savings and investment actually would boost the value of financial assets by increasing 
the after-tax stream of income they produce.
<p>
<b>5. DRI/McGraw-Hill failed to include the impact of higher disposable incomes on home 
values.</b> The study does conclude that the flat tax would increase economic growth but fails 
to factor back in the effects on house prices. This is inexplicable.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The flat tax represents a direct threat to 
powerful vested interests that feel they benefit from today's deductions. Unfortunately, many of 
these special interests are willing to disseminate erroneous information to Americans in an effort 
to preserve the tax breaks they now enjoy. The DRI/McGraw-Hill study is based on an unsound 
methodology which leaves it alone in its dire predictions that housing values will fall. Historical 
evidence on the relationship between performance of the economy and house prices, however, 
clearly shows us that a flat tax would be a bonanza for homeowners.

<title>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</h2><center>

The October 2 Newsweek hailed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as a boon to 
the working poor and called Congressional efforts to cut the program "the war 
on work." But Newsweek didn't tell readers about evidence that the EITC 
actually discourages work by creating a huge marginal tax rate on the poor.
<p>
According to Newsweek's Marc Levinson, the program, which provides a tax credit 
to low-income workers and cash to those who don't pay taxes, "hits the 
bulls-eye, aiding families who earn too much for welfare but too little to have 
a tax-favored mortgage." Levinson quoted EITC beneficiary Janene Moore as 
saying: "My kids are not welfare statistics....They can say that their momma 
gets a check all right, but it's from her job, seven hours a day, 35 hours a 
week." Levinson also argued that the EITC "does nothing to discourage marriage" 
and cited fraud as the only argument against cutting the credit.
<p>
But what if the EITC actually discourages work? According to the September 20 
Investor's Business Daily (IBD), "Most economists agree that today it's doing 
more harm than good." According to IBD: "Once the family reaches that limit 
[$11,600], the credit is phased out. For each dollar over $11,600, the family 
loses 21 cents of its EITC until its income hits $28,000. Economists say this 
acts like a marginal tax rate of 21 percent," which "provides a strong 
disincentive to work."
<p>
IBD also cited American Enterprise Institute economist Marvin Kosters who 
points out that even having an EITC may discourage work. "After all, 
[recipients] get a 40 percent raise without working any harder." Kosters also 
claims that the EITC does indeed exact a marriage penalty, in some cases as 
much as $5,000 per couple. According to Kosters, That "would be about 25 
percent of the combined income of the married couple."
<p>
It's not enough for reporters to cite fraud as an argument against the EITC. 
Economists have serious concerns about the program's disincentives to work, 
concerns which must be addressed in a balanced story.

turned to Justice  Powell's plurality opinion in <U>Bakke</U> for support:  &quot;Political
judgments regarding the necessity  for the particular [racial] classification...
are the product of rough compromise struck by  contending groups within the
democratic process. When they touch upon an individual's race  or ethnic
background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is 
asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored  to serve a compelling
governmental interest. The Constitution guarantees that right to  every person
regardless of his background.&quot;

observed: &quot;I believe there is a moral and  constitutional equivalence
between laws designed to  subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits 
on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality.
Government  cannot make us equal; it can only recognize,  respect, and protect
us as equal before the law.&quot;   See also the discussion of affirmative

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<A NAME="119"><B>119</B></A>					One such
questionable program is the  Bureau of Indian Affairs' Higher Education Grant
Program, which received an appropriation  of $29.8 million in FY 1995. This
program provides up to $7,450 per year to college  students who belong to Indian
tribes &quot;to supplement  the total financial aid package prepared [for the
student] by the college financial aid officer.&quot;   Thus, two students from
identical socioeconomic backgrounds would receive  dramatically different levels
of federal assistance to  attend college, with the only difference between the
two being that one is &quot;at least  onefourth degree Indian blood descendent&quot;
and owns  a &quot;certificate of Indian blood.&quot;  See 
<U>1994 Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</U>,  Program ID15.114. There is
some evidence to  suggest that many Americans with trace levels of  Indian
ancestry have taken advantage of these preferences. Demographic trends, for 
example, cannot explain the threefold increase in  the number of Americans
identifying themselves as American Indians since the 1960 census.  Ac
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  cording to <U>The New York Times</U>
for March 5, 1991, &quot;the growing realization that an  Indian heritage can
mean special benefits has motivated many Indians, and presumably some 
impostors, to openly assert an Indian background.&quot;   One California
contractor won a $19 million contract on the Los Angeles rapid transit  system
because he was onesixtyfourth American Indian. See Roberts and Stratton, 
<U>The New Color Line</U>, p. 158.

<center><h2>Kudos: Sesno Challenges Rivlin, Daschle</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many in the media have accepted, and passed on as fact, the Democrats' party line that Republicans were out to cut and even destroy Medicare. CNN's Frank Sesno, on the December 17 Late Edition, set the record straight.
<p>
He first interviewed President Clinton's budget director, Alice Rivlin. Sesno confronted Rivlin with the facts: "Take Medicare, for example. You said, the President, rather, yesterday said, `They would let Medicare wither on the vine into a second class citizen.' Now, you don't really believe that the Republicans are going to let Medicare wither on the vine? They're not talking about that. And as you well know, and as they say as many times as they are able, even with their cuts in the rate of growth of the program, it still grows into an ever larger piece of the pie."
<p>
When Rivlin balked at such an analysis, Sesno remained adamant. "In the interest of truth in advertising here, do you really believe that the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate want to destroy Medicare?" he asked. "Isn't this part of the Mediscare debate that your critics accuse you of engaging in?"
<p>
After Rivlin, Sesno interviewed Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (along with GOP Senator Trent Lott). He pointed out to Daschle that "in the health care reform debate, of not very long ago, of which you were a part, there was a great deal of talk that expenses had to be controlled. You had something called global budgeting. I mean you were going to hold everybody down. So why is it unfair to do that in the case of Medicare?"
<p>
Later, when Senator Daschle called the Republican plan to slow Medicare's growth "the biggest cuts in the history of Medicare. Biggest by far. Three times more than has ever been proposed." Sesno corrected him: "Biggest cuts in the rate of growth of Medicare, not absolute cuts."
<p>
Kudos to Sesno for giving Democratic rhetoric the same scrutiny reporters usually reserve for Republicans.

<Title>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</h2>
<p>
<h3>Donations Rise as Funding Threatened</h3>
</center>
<p>
At this time last year, leaders of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), Public Television (PTV), and National Public Radio (NPR) were calling their viewers and listeners stingy. Not in so many words, of course, but that was in effect their argument when they warned that they would not be able to make up any cut in or elimination of public broadcasting's federal subsidy.
Conservatives, looking at history, argued that when taxes were cut (as Republicans planned), people gave more to organizations they support, including public broadcasting, and that if people truly liked public broadcasting, they would not let it die.
<p>
<b>Who was right?</b><br>
Looking at the results of last year's public broadcasting pledge drives, as reported in the Public Broadcasting Report, it looks like conservatives were correct. Even without a tax cut, merely the threat of cutting public broadcasting's subsidy spurred massive increases in private donations early in the year. Later, when it was clear that the federal subsidy would be kept, donations began to level off.
<p>
Conservatives, in making their arguments, were standing on strong historical ground. During the 1980s, when tax rates were cut, individual donations to public television, for example, increased every year. In fiscal year 1980 there were 2.6 million members of PTV who gave an average contribution of $29.96 for a total of almost $78 million. By fiscal year 1989 the number of members had doubled (to 5.2 million) and the average contribution had increased steadily (to $50.38), giving public television a total of $262 million from individual members. In fiscal year 1991, after the Bush tax increase, the number of individual public television members dropped to 5.07 million.
<p>
Last year, when Republicans in Congress threatened to eliminate or substantially cut public broadcasting's federal subsidy, donations skyrocketed. The first bit of good news came in February. KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, California announced that it had set a record for on-air fundraising by a public radio station in its February 6-14 winter subscription drive. According to the Public Broadcasting Report (PBR), the station "raised $1.09 million from 14,314 new and renewing subscribers," a 26 percent increase over the previous year. General manager Ruth Seymour told PBR that the debate over federal funding spurred the massive increase: "I think our audience understands that we are committed to the effort to keep public radio noncommercial."
<p>
Then public television stations began to note a striking increase in donations. PBR told its readers on March 24 that "PTV stations across the country reported very successful spring pledge drives." The Arkansas Educational Television Network, for example surpassed its $350,000 goal despite reducing the time spent in pledge breaks by ten percent. KRMA-TV in Denver and WETA-TV in Washington, D.C. had record-breaking drives, with KRMA reporting a 13 percent increase over 1994 totals and WETA garnering almost $1 million from 12,600 pledges, 62 percent of which were from new members. KCET in Los Angeles finished its spring pledge drive with $1.68 million, exceeding its March, 1994 drive, which lasted three days longer, by $205,127.
<p>
Nationwide, PBR reported, the number of pledges for March were "12.9 percent above March 1994 returns" and the total dollars pledged were up 15.3 percent. Public radio had similar success. According to PBR, "on average, stations did 15-40 percent better during this drive than they did during last year's campaign." The public radio stations that did "only" 15-20 percent better than the previous year were "those who stopped once they reached their goals."
<p>
The momentum was sustained through the summer. PBR reported on August 25 that "indications are that the August PTV pledge drive will be another hit in a year of overwhelmingly successful campaigns that many have attributed to publicity involving projected federal budget cuts." The number of pledges had increased a dramatic 18 percent over the previous August and pledge dollars were up 16 percent.
<p>
By December, though, when it had become clear that Republicans were not going to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting, or even cut it substantially, pledge growth slowed. The December pledge drive, according to PBR, collected seven percent more than the December 1994 pledge drive, a healthy increase, but not at the level of the astronomical increases of March and August.
<p>
The moral of the story: Viewers value public broadcasting enough to increase their donations when federal funding is threatened. But when it's clear the government will pay for it, they don't feel the need to pay as much.
<p>
This should reassure public broadcasting executives. During last year's debate, they didn't express much confidence in their supporters. CPB Chairman Henry Cauthen predicted that if federal funding were foregone, 87 public television stations would have to be closed down. (He didn't point out, of course that this would still give PBS more television stations than ABC, CBS, or NBC.)
Public Broadcasting Service president Ervin S. Duggan told TV Guide: "I don't think public TV could survive and maintain its mandate without federal funding. Survival would come at a cost of becoming commercial. We'd be driven by ratings, not quality."
<p>
As the debate continued Duggan became so convinced that individuals wouldn't ante up support for a privatized PBS that he began to speak in harsh tones about the future of the network, comparing privatized television to prostitution. He worried that "commercialized public television is likely to resemble, for all the world, Thomas Hardy's ruined maid: `no longer pure and simple, brazenly working the streets in her new commercial finery, doing whatever necessary to survive.'"
<p>
The evidence suggests Cauthen and Duggan were wrong. When federal funding decreases, private funding increases. If members of Congress really want to strengthen public broadcasting, then they should wean it from the federal government and cut taxes.

<p>
<h3>Lamenting Layoffs, Ignoring Job Rise</h3>
</center>
<p>
The current wave of layoffs at several large companies seems to confirm in many reporters' minds their view of how the business world works: Corporate America racks up record profits for wealthy shareholders while laying off millions of workers.
<p>
That's how the networks have reported the layoffs. But with a little digging these reporters could have found that corporate profits are not unusually high, that shareholders are not just rich people, and that more jobs are being created than destroyed.
<p>
Anchor John Roberts set the tone of the layoff coverage on the December 26 CBS Evening News: "The market has been hitting one record high after another. But as Economics Correspondent Ray Brady reports, many workers have paid a heavy price." Brady then interviewed "ex-Wall Streeter" Michael Thomas, who told viewers what he seemed to think was shocking: "Executives are running companies exclusively for their stockholders."
<p>
This focus on the interests of stockholders, Brady explained, has meant layoffs at such established companies as 3M and AT&T, which caused their stock prices to jump. "Who pays the price for this stock market prosperity?" Brady asked. "Come to any job center, where laid off middle managers scramble desperately for work. Corporate America announced more than 41,000 layoffs last month alone, up 45 percent over the same month a year ago."
<p>
Martha Teichner, Brady's colleague at CBS, joined the chorus on the January 7 Sunday Morning. "For all of 1995, the figure was nearly 450,000, but, hey, that's the good news. In 1993 it was 615,000," Teichner reported. "Here's a statistic for our leaner and meaner times. Since 1980, Fortune 500 companies, America's biggest and most profitable corporations, announced layoffs of more than eight million people. That's like laying off the entire population of New York City."
<p>
Over at NBC, on the January 4 Nightly News, Mike Jensen agreed. After saying that some companies had to downsize in order to survive, he said, "Some companies simply decided to make more money by firing people. Corporate profits totalled about $400 billion last year, up 25 percent. What all those companies did was obliterate one of the keystones of the American Dream, the security of a job for life. They created anxiety for everyone, even those who didn't get fired."
<p>
But just how high are corporate profits? According to the January 4 Investor's Business Daily, which quoted a study by the Employment Policy Foundation, corporate "profits have dropped from an average of 12 percent of national output in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s to about 9 percent currently -- a decline of about 25 percent in profits' share of total output."
<p>
About those supposedly greedy stockholders, the newspaper pointed out that they may not be who viewers were led to believe they were: "With more than half of all Americans now owning stocks through retirement, mutual, and individual shareholder accounts, it is the average American who benefits most from corporate profits -- not some fat cat on Wall Street."
<p>
And here's a statistic for Teichner: "Little noticed among the repeated headlines of Fortune 500 firms cutting jobs are the literally thousands of small and medium-sized firms that are adding new workers at a frenetic pace. Since the start of 1994, more than five million new jobs have been created in the U.S. economy -- more than enough to sop up all the new entrants in the work force."
<p>
Reporters seem to think the entire business world begins and ends with the Fortune 500. Until they start looking at the entire economy, they won't be able to tell the entire story.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>A Flat Tax Fact Sheet</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Virtually every Republican presidential candidate has endorsed some version of 
the flat tax, as has the Kemp Tax Reform Commission. This support is mirrored 
by public opinion, with polls showing anywhere between one-half and two-thirds 
of taxpayers prefer the flat tax over the current system. Needless to say, with 
all this attention, it comes as no surprise that many in the media have begun 
writing about and describing this revolutionary proposal. Unfortunately, this 
new-found publicity has been accompanied by frequent errors. In order to 
maintain accuracy, reporters should avoid these two most common mistakes:
<P>
Mistake #1: Many reporters write that the flat tax contains a huge loophole for 
the rich because they have trouble understanding how income is taxed under a 
flat tax. This error shows up in several ways. Some report that dividend and 
interest income is tax free. Others write that only labor income is taxed.
<P>
Reality: The source of these common mistakes is that the most well-known 
versions of the flat tax collect taxes on capital income at the source. Under 
the Armey- Shelby flat tax, for instance, a corporation must pay tax on behalf 
of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends. This 
approach, which reduces administrative costs and ensures greater compliance, 
makes a dividend check similar to a worker's paycheck in that both are 
after-tax payments. The same is true for interest income. Under the flat tax, 
businesses and financial institutions pay tax on interest payments they make, 
so there is no need to collect the tax a second time at the individual level. 
Once again, the motive for taking this approach is simplicity and compliance.
<P>
Message: Reporters can argue that the tax should be collected at the individual 
level. They can even argue that the income should be subjected to two or more 
layers of tax. Honesty demands, however, that they acknowledge that all income 
is taxed with a flat tax, but only taxed once, and that tax is collected in the 
least costly fashion possible.
<P>
Mistake #2: The flat tax will increase the deficit and/or boost taxes on the 
middle class. Many news reports assume that a flat tax will require a tax rate 
of 21 percent or more to offset reductions in excessive tax rates on the rich. 
Even with the generous personal allowance, this tax rate would adversely affect 
the middle class. Failure to levy a rate that high, on the other hand, would 
cause larger deficits.
<P>
Reality: With a 17 percent rate, the Armey-Shelby flat tax explicitly is 
designed to reduce the amount of money the government collects. As a result, 
even without making any assumptions about faster economic growth expanding the 
tax base (the supply-side effect), it is possible for all income classes to 
enjoy a lower tax burden. With regards to the deficit, the plan imposes strict 
new limits on government spending. Enforced by automatic spending control 
mechanisms, this ensures that the deficit will not climb. The key principle is 
that the flat tax is accompanied by spending savings to keep the overall 
package deficit-neutral.
<P>
Message: Conclusions that the middle class is harmed are based on analysis of a 
revenue-neutral tax proposal which does not exist. Reporters can condemn the 
proposal for reducing the amount of money the government collects, and they can 
write that the growth of government would have to be significantly slowed to 
keep the plan deficit neutral as sponsors propose, but it is inaccurate to 
assert that the middle class will pay more or that the deficit will increase.
<P>
With help from biased sources such as the Clinton Treasury Department and the 
union-funded Citizens for Tax Justice, many reporters have unwittingly (we 
hope) made one of these mistakes. Some, like Al Hunt of  The Wall Street 
Journal and Ann Reilly Dowd of Money, have made both mistakes in the same 
article. Fair and accurate reporting depends on the public receiving 
information in a straight- forward fashion. Avoiding these two mistakes will 
help ensure the upcoming tax debate is marked by legitimate policy issues 
rather than distorted media messages.

<h3>Reporters Crash, Viewers Burned</h3>
</center>
<p>
Just when you think reporters couldn't get any more hostile to industry, they do. Consider two mid-January television reports on ABC's Good Morning America and NBC Nightly News. Both stories contain mistakes which often plague reports about automobile safety, and both ignored the trade-offs safety regulations inevitably require. 
<p>
At issue were federal standards for rear guards on tractor trailers. These "U"-shaped metal rods are specifically intended to keep cars that hit the rear of a truck from riding under it. The regulatory standard for the guards has been set at 30 inches from the ground for the past fifty years, although the voluntary industry standard has been 22 inches for several years. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) merely codified this standard with the cooperation of the trucking industry.
<p>
That's the news part. But reporters portrayed this issue as a grand conflict, with industry as a hostile force and supposedly-impartial "consumer advocates" as society's protectors. The question for reporters was how to criticize industry without panning the government in a situation where both agreed. Here's how they answered it:
<p>
Neither report mentioned that industry was already producing 22-inch guards. ABC's Lisa Stark, on the January 19 Good Morning America, reported that "under the new standard, rear guards...must be lowered to 22 inches above the ground. They're now at 30 inches." Tom Brokaw stated in his introduction to the January 17 NBC Nightly News segment, "The government is about to take an action that should save lives." Robert Hager was more explicit in the NBC segment, saying that the government will require new tractor trailers "to be made with big rods on the back, bigger than any currently in use."
Neither report pointed out that most tractor trailers already have the 22-inch guards -- voluntarily.
<p>
Hager employed questionable data. "Nearly 700 [people] a year die in [ride-under] accidents," he declared. But both NHTSA and the trucking industry put the number of deaths at 60 each year. (ABC's Lisa Stark used the NHTSA figure.)
<p>
Both reports projected skepticism of the new standard -- but not of the government -- as insufficiently stringent without offering evidence. In Stark's report, Gerald Donaldson of Citizens for Reliable & Safe Highways (CRASH) stated that the new rule "was not selected on the basis of what would really be a big contribution to improving public safety... [but] on the basis of what the trucking industry would buy into."
<p>
The ubiquitous Joan Claybrook, representing CRASH in Hager's report, said, "We don't think this rule makes significant enough changes....Very few people are going to be protected under this standard." Hager didn't ask Claybrook why, if she was so concerned, she never acted on the rear guard issue when she was head of NHTSA from 1977-1981.
<p>
Neither report was skeptical of these supposedly objective "consumer advocates." The media look at funding only when it comes to industry associations or conservative advocates. That's why we hear about "tobacco-funded groups," but not "trial-lawyer-funded groups." The fact that a group is funded by parties who have a stake in certain outcomes does not necessarily mean that what they say is incorrect. Still, it would have been interesting if the reporters had asked who funds CRASH; they would have discovered that CRASH is substantially funded by the railroad industry.
<p>
Regulations intended to increase safety by decreasing one risk often backfire by creating new risks. For example, the risk of keeping the rear guard at 22 inches means that some small cars could still slip under the truck. But making the rear guard lower means that trucks could get caught on railroad grade crossings or have difficulty maneuvering around rail yards and ports, causing different kinds of accidents. ABC touched on this issue dismissively; NBC only mentioned the dollar cost of the changes.
<p>
When it comes to government regulation of safety, even the most skeptical reporters become true believers. Too eager to criticize industry, and too receptive to "consumer groups" which invariably advocate more government regulation, reporters often believe that we can have more safety at no cost. But overlooking the trade-offs involved in government regulation does not help anyone, and could, in fact, be deadly. Who pays this price? The very people reporters are trying to inform: consumers.

<Title>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</h2>
<p>
<h3>ABC's Missing Campaign Reform Idea</h3>
</center>
<p>
Is there too much money in politics? That question is a rhetorical one for much of the media. They simply assume that there is. So far this campaign season, network newscasts have reported numerous times about the costs of running a presidential campaign and the alleged problems this raises for candidates. Because reporters assume private money hurts politics, they report on every reform option except the one conservatives champion -- raising (or eliminating) the limits on individual donations to candidates.
<p>
Case in point: ABC News. On January 17 and 18 ABC's World News Tonight devoted a total of five stories to the role of money in the presidential campaign, under the title "The Greenback Primary." These stories followed a January 15 Nightline broadcast about campaign-finance reform. The assumption in all of these stories was that money has -- as Peter Jennings put it -- a "corrosive effect" on the political process.
<p>
Various correspondents contributed to the World News Tonight series. Jim Wooten pointed out that front-loaded primaries meant candidates have to raise a lot of money early. "None of the Republicans except Senator Dole has actually reached his fundraising goal," Wooten reported. "He's ahead. There could be a connection." John Donvan illustrated the elaborate means candidates must employ to raise enough money to compete. Bill Blakemore noted the rise of "soft money," such as contributions to political parties and independ-ent expenditures. According to Blakemore: "It's how corporations and unions can snub the law that forbids them to give to presidential campaigns."
<p>
While many of these stories were informative, none questioned the common wisdom that too much money is the problem with the current campaign finance system. None cited the mainstream conservative argument, made by law professor Bradley Smith in a Cato Institute study, that more money would improve politics. Smith wrote: "Considering the importance of elections to any democratic society, it is hard to believe that the expenditure of less than $10 per voter for all local, state, and national campaigns constitutes a crisis requiring government regulation and limitations on spending."
<p>
Ignoring this argument led to biased coverage of possible reforms. On the January 15 Nightline, Jeff Greenfield reported, "We'll be hearing a torrent of words about campaign-finance reform this year, but every proposal for change raises some big questions. Complete public financing? Well, skeptical voters might see that as just another taxpayer rip-off. Force television stations to provide free air time? Who would qualify and who wouldn't? Say to multi-millionaires they can't spend as much as they want on their own campaigns? No, the Supreme Court says that would be unconstitutional."
<p>
While Greenfield skillfully raised objections to all the reform ideas he cited, he didn't mention "every proposal for change." David Frum, in the January 15 Weekly Standard, suggested one proposal conservatives have long advocated -- "a sharp increase in the maximum permissible personal donation." Frum argued that "if [candidates] could raise their money in bigger chunks, they could spend much less time at the task" and that "once large donations could be made directly to the candidate -- which every candidate prefers -- the evil of unaccountable and undisclosed soft money would tend to wither away."
<p>
Reporters are correct to sense that something is wrong with the campaign-finance system. And the liberal view that private money always corrupts political campaigns should be reported fairly. But journalists shouldn't assume liberals are right and report liberal reform plans as if they were the only ones being proposed.

<title>Reporters Don't Challenge Politicians on Anti-Green Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on Government Pollution</h2>
</center>
<p>
When the media report on the environment, which will no doubt be a big issue in the upcoming presidential campaign, they almost always employ the same formula. Private industry is portrayed as the cause of all environmental problems; government is portrayed as the protector of the public. This formula ignores one big cause of environ- mental problems -- federal agriculture subsidies, which not only hurt taxpayers and consumers, but also finance environmental destruction.
<p>
Example: recent coverage of the Clinton Administration's proposal to try to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. Most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton plan, which would increase the tax on sugar by a penny per pound to pay for a $1.5 billion program that includes the federal government buying and restoring land in the Everglades.
<p>
According to CBS This Morning's Jane Robelot, on February 20, "The Clinton Administration has announced ambitious plans to save the Everglades from further ecological destruction by raising the tax on sugar." Correspondent Art Rascon continued: "It's the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever."
<p>
Newsweek's Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 issue, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senator Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar  money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times wrote on February 20 that "the administration's seven-year plan to save one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States is as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years, environmentalists say."
<p>
And according to ABC's Barry Serafin, on the February 19 World News Tonight, "Administration officials say the [sugar] industry, which enjoys generous price supports must pay its fair share, a view shared by many in South Florida, who are determined to bring back the state's fabled river of grass."
<p>
Although none of these reporters were wrong, and a few even pointed out the huge federal subsidy sugar gets from high tariffs, none asked why the government shouldn't simply stop subsidizing sugar. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Jonathan Tolman told MediaNomics that if the government simply "brought down the tariff wall on sugar, it would discourage overfarming of sugar near the Everglades and make land there less expensive, which would make Gore's program to buy the land less expensive." In addition, no reporter brought up another point Tolman makes: "The Clinton tax increase on sugar will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices."
<p>
Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times, in a February 29 article about price supports, made the connection between the government subsidies and environmental damage. Schmitt pointed out that "under the sugar program...the government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year. Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
But Schmitt was the exception among national reporters. Most reporters chose to challenge neither Clinton nor Republicans on why they maintain a subsidy that hurts consumers, taxpayers, and the environment.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Report Only One Side of Employment Picture</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Media Lay Off New Jobs Story</h2>
</center>
<p>
Most economists argue that layoffs and a certain amount of job insecurity are part of a healthy, competitive economy. Joseph Schumpeter labeled the process of new technologies replacing workers and new companies displacing established companies "creative destruction." While such a competitive economy isn't always pleasant for those who are temporarily out of work, most economists say it undeniably creates a more prosperous economy for all.
<p>
But most economists are never interviewed by network news reporters. The result is that, for the most part, viewers are told only about the destructiveness of a competitive economy and not job creation. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story about employment on network evening news shows (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, and NBC Nightly News) during January and February. Of the 21 stories, 19 focused on corporate layoffs and downsizing. Only two highlighted parts of the economy where jobs are plentiful. And while there were eleven soundbites from politicians, there was only one soundbite from an economist.
<p>
Tom Brokaw, on the January 29 Nightly News, expressed the typical tone. Introducing a story about "today's frightening job market," he said, "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety. A recent poll in New York state shows a third of the workers fearful they or someone in their household will lose their job, and soon. And with good reason. Last year there were more than 400,000 announced layoffs across the country, bringing the three-year total to 1.5 million."
<p>
Dan Rather, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, gave a similar diagnosis: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages." According to Rather, "Republican Pat Buchanan has hit a nerve with his rhetoric about this. He is connecting with real anger and fear in the workplace."
<p>
CBS's Wyatt Andrews, on that same broadcast, described "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 4 Nightly News, declared that "as for the future, American companies are locked on a new course. Layoffs and firings are no longer something they do only in a recession. Instead, they're business as usual."
<p>
AT&T's announcement that it would lay off 40,000 workers prompted many of the gloomy jobs stories. According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, on the January 3 World News, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired. AT&T announced that it was cutting 40,000 jobs." On January 2 Brokaw announced that "if what happened today to 40,000 workers at AT&T is any kind of barometer of what's ahead, it will be another long, anxious year for the American middle class."
<p>
But neither followed up on the AT&T workers. Like almost all of the other reports about the country's job picture, they ignored the parts of the economy which are generating jobs. T.J. Rogers of Cypress Semiconductor, in the March 12 Wall Street Journal, argued that "for the past decade or more, jobs have been migrating to smaller, more nimble, entrepreneurial companies from the Fortune 500 as those companies streamline and lose employment. This trend strengthens our economy, but it has created a short-term fear for their jobs among Americans."
<p>
According to Rogers: "What is not publicized is that my company has already hired some of those [laid-off] AT&T people. And our rival, Cirrus Logic, beat us to the punch in starting up a design center in South Carolina to take advantage of hiring those ex-AT&T engineers. The bad news from big companies gets front-page coverage, but the near-immediate absorption of their skilled workers is rarely discussed."
<p>
Similarly, economics columnist Robert Samuelson noted in the March 13 Washington Post that most laid-off workers find valuable employment elsewhere. "Among rehired workers," Samuelson wrote, "the Labor Department reports as follows: 27 percent got wages at least 20 percent higher than at their previous jobs; 26 percent got wages up to 20 percent higher; 16 percent suffered a pay loss no greater than 20 percent; and 31 percent suffered pay losses of more than 20 percent.
<p>
And American Enterprise Institute economist Herbert Stein pointed out in the March 14 Wall Street Journal that "in 1995, on average, 5.6 percent of the civilian labor force was unemployed. In the previous 20 years the rate had been lower than that in only three years." According to Stein, "The highly publicized layoffs by large corporations were a tiny fraction of the labor force and a small fraction of the number of people who enter or leave employment each year."
<p>
Stein also wrote that "concern with insecurity ought to be evident in real behavior." He noted that people didn't change their smoking or drinking behavior until they became seriously concerned with health or their social behavior until they became seriously concerned about crime. "If people were seriously concerned about their economic condition one might expect them to save more, but they don't." He noted that people are not retiring later, a trend that would be expected if workers felt financially insecure.
<p>
But good business news is rarely news. Only two network news reports focused on the country's enormous job growth. One was by Wyatt Andrews for the February 6 CBS Evening News. Andrews reported that some companies which laid off workers over the past few years have started rehiring. "The era of layoffs in America is not over," Andrews told viewers, "but there is a countertrend going on. In the latest polls, most American managers now admit they fired too many people...and that growth, including the hiring of new workers, is the only way to survive."
<p>
The other was by NBC's Linda Vester on the January 26 Nightly News. "From small machine shops to giant auto plants," Vester reported, "the manufacturing industry is in dire need of the best and the brightest." She said that many manufacturers cannot find enough skilled workers and are even employing headhunters to recruit them. Vester told viewers that "according to one study more than half of America's manufacturers say they're having trouble finding qualified people." She pointed out that people seeking to meet the demand are enrolling at vocational schools. Vester was the only reporter to interview an economist about the country's job picture.
<p>
But Vester was an exception. For most of her colleagues, two things still stand in the way of presenting their viewers with an accurate picture of the economy: The overwhelming preference they have for interviewing politicians instead of economists and their obsession with bad -- and only bad -- business news.

<center><h2>Kudos: Tim Russert</h2>
</center>
<p>
It's not very often that a network journalist talks about the positive effects of business competition and stock market growth for workers and for Main Street America. Usually, only the victims of business competition are presented to viewers and those who gain from the stock market are portrayed as greedy. The unorthodox presidential candidacy of  Republican Pat Buchanan has caused some reporters to challenge such conventional wisdom.
<p>
Case-in-point: NBC's Tim Russert on the March 3 Meet the Press. Russert challenged Buchanan's protectionist trade views by asking the candidate: "Hasn't the [foreign] competition, in fact been good for GM and Ford? Taurus is now the number one car. American cars are better because the American people opted to buy Japanese cars because the quality was better and forced American automobile manufacturers to make their cars better."
<p>
Then Russert pointed out how important the stock market is to workers. "I've talked to a lot of people in large corporations and on Wall Street over the last week," he said, "and they tell me that if your trade policies were put in place and your economic program was put in place, it would be a shock to the stock market, that the market would collapse perhaps as much as 20 percent. And they reminded me of something I'm not even sure you're aware of. Do you know what percent of the stock market is pension money? It's a third. Fifty four million people have fully-funded pensions in this country... And Mr. Buchanan, if that market was rattled by your economic policies, pensioners could lose a half billion dollars and their security is threatened."
<p>
When most reporters challenge candidates' economic policies, they do so from the left. Kudos to Russert for challenging Buchanan from the right.

<title>Guest Editorial, by Bruce Bartlett</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Flat-Tax Flip-Floppers</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the most remarkable things about the recent rise in popularity of the flat tax is the way leading newspapers and magazines that previously supported the idea have suddenly turned against it. In particular, the New York Times and Washington Post had previously editorialized in favor of the flat tax, but now both oppose the idea.
<p>
For example, in an April 15, 1982 editorial, the Post said, "The ideal income tax would be a flat percentage of all income above an arbitrary threshold of, say, $10,000 per year." It concluded that the flat tax "is the obvious remedy" to the problems of the tax system.
<p>
On June 3, 1982 the Post reiterated its support. "Replacing the [tax] system with a low-rate tax on income -- with few, if any, exclusions allowed -- is an idea that, by promising efficiency, equity and simplicity, appeals to all parts of the political spectrum," it said.
<p>
Fourteen years later, however, the Post is now opposed to what it had earlier supported. On January 19, the Post called the flat tax "a flawed idea, less a serious tax proposal than a slogan in the name of which the advocates claim to be able to accomplish several things at once." It concluded that the flat tax "wouldn't be an improvement." 
<p>
Back in 1982 the New York Times supported the flat tax. In a June 6, 1982 editorial, the Times favored "a flat-rate tax levied on a greatly broadened income base." It even praised Senator Jesse Helms's proposed 12 percent flat-rate tax.
<p>
As recently as 1992 the Times reiterated its support for the flat tax. In a March 27, 1992 editorial the Times explicitly endorsed the Hall-Rabushka plan upon which the Armey and Forbes plans are based. It called the flat tax "a superb idea."
<p>
But like the Post, the Times now opposes a flat tax. In a January 18, 1996 editorial the Times found "a glaring fault" in the flat tax. Like Claude Rains in Casablanca, the Times is now shocked, shocked to discover that the flat tax will benefit the wealthy! It concluded by denouncing the Forbes plan.
<p>
<%-2>Individual reporters have also flip-flopped on the flat tax. For example, <BI>Business Week<D>'s <B>Chris Farrell<D> thought the flat tax was great in a January 9, 1995 column. "If Washington legislators truly want to make a difference, they should...embrace a flat tax," he wrote. The Armey plan "makes sense  -- far more than any other reform being considered. Limiting exemptions and deductions would lower the tax rate by broadening the tax base. And the change would encourage a more efficient allocation of resources."<BI%0>
<p>
But like the Post and the Times, Farrell has suddenly decided that the flat tax is too risky. In a February 19, 1996 column, Farrell said flat-tax advocates are wrong. "Their florid rhetoric vastly overstates the economic gains and deeply understates the risks," he wrote. "The gains could be easily dwarfed by wrenching business and household upheavals as America shifts to a new tax code. Indeed, the transition to a flat tax is fraught with danger -- so much so that the long- term payoff may never come." According to Farrell, the stock market, home prices, and consumer spending all would collapse under a flat tax.
<p>
Such predictions can only be described as total nonsense. As Professor Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University points out, the magnitude of tax changes under a flat tax would be no greater than what we experienced in 1981 and 1986. And the impact on financial markets would be no greater than those experienced many times in the postwar era, when interest rates either rose or fell sharply. Moreover, there is no question that a flat tax will cause the stock market to rise, not fall.
<p>
Unfortunately, the ranks of those who have switched gears on the flat tax include conservatives. As a columnist, Pat Buchanan strongly supported Armey's flat-tax proposal. However, as a presidential candidate, Buchanan opposes it. In a January 27, 1996 article in the New York Times, Buchanan called the flat tax "simplistic" and attacked it for cutting the taxes of the rich. No wonder the Times published it.
<p>
<%-2>Of course, everyone has the right -- indeed, the obligation -- to reconsider their positions when con- fronted with new information. But when major newspapers and prominent writers switch their positions 180 degrees on a major issue, especially within a short period of time, readers are entitled to an explanation. Otherwise, they can only assume that prevailing fashion dictates editorial views, rather than facts and analysis, and that such views aren't worthy of serious consideration.<%0>

<TITLE>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</TITLE>

<h2><center>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</h2>
<p>
<h3>Fox's Profit Motive</h3></center>
<p>
Profit, a new prime time show on Fox, starts from a unique premise. Far from being the sympathetic hero, Jim Profit, the main character whose voice narrates the show, is a villain. Viewers naturally root against, rather than for, the show's namesake. This is new, different, and daring, and it makes for entertaining television. But in another way, Profit is anything but new. As is so often the case on TV, the villain is a corporate executive. 
Jim Profit, in fact, is a supervillain gone berserk. In the show's premiere  episode, which aired April 8, Profit is shown to be a relentless climber at Gracen & Gracen (G&G), the company where he is a vice president. He uses confidential information to blackmail a decent secretary into sabotaging her equally decent boss, whose job Profit covets. When the secretary later comes to work for Profit, he says: "It's good to see Gail understands the basic nature of business. We adapt or pay the price."
<p>
He uses other ruthless means to weed out those in his way. He frames a female vice president for the blackmail of the secretary, getting her fired. He seduces the wife of another vice president, and then masterminds a plan to make it look like she's sleeping with G&G's CEO. When her husband beats up the CEO (who, by the way, does pick a new mistress every year), he gets fired. And viewers find out that Profit became a vice president in the first place by inducing a heart attack in the vice president above him.
How did profit become so evil? Late in the premiere, viewers learn that as a child Profit was forced by his father to live in a cardboard box and spent all his time watching television through a hole cut out of the box. Profit tracks down his father, kills him, and threatens to frame his stepmother if she turns him in or tries to thwart his business plans.
<p>
The appearance of the show has rekindled a long-running debate about Hollywood's portrayal of business. The experts' conventional wisdom: the greedy scoundrels are getting what they deserve. Graef Crystal, a psychologist and compensation expert, told USA Today that employees "can't take out [their] rage on the CEO -- that person is too powerful. You probably can't even talk to the press for fear of losing your job. But a show that makes you say 'yes, that's exactly what it's like' will hold your attention." 
<p>
Alan Merten, dean of Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, also pinned the blame on the business world. He told USA Today that corporate executives "should look at this trend and realize that whatever their financial motives, their actions aren't playing well in Peoria. The timing of some large layoffs and big [executive] bonus packages has been terrible."
<p>
Perhaps. But Hollywood's business bashing isn't, as Merten suggests, a new trend; it's an institution. The show Dallas was popular long before the current wave of layoffs and in a 1992 Media Research Center study of entertainment programming, businessmen were 43 percent of the criminals, far more than lawyers, politicians, or any other profession. Even, in the past, when there have been positive business characters, such as the business owners on Designing Women, they haven't been positive because of their business. By contrast, there were evil lawyers on L.A. Law, but also lawyers who benefited society because of the work they did.
<p>
A more likely explanation for Hollywood's continued business bashing is that entertainment television writers still hold to an ideology which cannot conceive of business as an honorable calling that serves society by producing goods, services, wealth, and jobs. Profit, to them, seems to be a four-letter word.

<h3>Privatized Paupers? No</h3>
</center>
<p>
On March 11 and 12, the CBS Evening News broadcast a two-part "Eye on America" segment by Ray Brady focusing on Social Security privatization. What started out as a compelling case for reform of the soon-to-be bankrupt pension program ended up as a broadside attack against the most promising reform -- privatization.
<p>
First, the background. Social Security now has an unfunded long-term liability of more than $5 trillion -- which exceeds the entire national debt. In 35 years, the system will be financially insolvent. Kaput. As CBS rightly pointed out, in 1950 there were 17 workers for every retired person. Today there are three; by 2030 there will be just two. To keep the system solvent at current benefit levels would require the tax rate to rise from 15 percent to as much as 30 percent. If there were ever a program that needed major reform, it is this one.
<p>
CBS discussed one potential way out of the box: to privatize the system and allow individual workers to place their payroll tax dollars into a personalized account, like an expanded IRA. Under rules established by the government, workers could invest this money in mutual funds and other investments. Brady interviewed Jose Pinera, the former economic minister of Chile, where privatization was adopted some 15 years ago. The results there have been remarkably successful. Chilean workers are now receiving a 13 percent annual rate of return on their Social Security investments.
<p>
Brady then cited a Cato Institute study documenting that in the United States, if a low-income worker were permitted to place his payroll taxes into an IRA, and that worker earned just the average rate of return on stocks and bonds since 1946, that worker would receive a benefit of $1,650 more per month from the IRA than under Social Security. As one of the editors of that study, I can attest that the results were reviewed by well-respected actuaries who found no fault with the methodology.
<p>
Brady, however, launched an attack against privatization by arguing that the Cato study made "dangerously optimistic assumptions." The "dangerously optimistic assumption" was that over the next 50 years investors will yield roughly the same average real rate of return in stocks and bonds as was recorded by financial markets over the past 50 years. No one knows for sure whether the markets will perform better or worse. Still, it is worth noting that over the past several years the stock market has substantially outperformed the average rate of return since 1945.
<p>
Then CBS rolled out objections to the plan, such as claims that the plan only works if "workers work their whole lifetime in a boom stock market." This is patently false. If we had a boom market for the next 50 years, and we privatized Social Security, most American workers would be millionaire pensioners when they retired. But even if workers placed all of their payroll tax into low-risk, low-return bonds, privatization is still a very good deal for workers of all incomes, vis-a-vis a non-privatized system.
<p>
The CBS report saved its heavy artillery for last. Brady said that instead of "making educated guesses about the future, like the proponents of privatization, we took a look at how a Social Security stock plan would have performed using real data from the past." (Note the false inference here, that the Cato Institute study did not "use real data from the past.") "Using an independent firm," CBS reported that a wealthy worker would get $30,000 more under privatization, but a low-income worker would get $13,000 less. Conclusion: privatization is unfair.
<p>
Just how were those numbers derived? Alas, we will never know. After repeated requests for the methodology, CBS has refused to reveal what firm produced them, what actuarial assumptions were used, and any other information about the results. While CBS was quick to attack privatization advocates for using "dangerous assumptions," that charge can't be made against CBS; the company won't tell us what their assumptions were. For all we know, the numbers were simply made up out of thin air.
<p>
Finally, CBS concluded that most Americans oppose Social Security privatization. How should the system be fixed, then? "Cut benefits and raise Social Security taxes." Two problems here. First, virtually every poll over the past ten years shows that raising the payroll tax is by far the least popular "fix" to the Social Security system. Second, raising the tax level and reducing the promised benefit make Social Security an even worse deal than it already is for young workers. Now they would have to pay more in for a lower benefit. What a deal! If we "reformed" Social Security in the way CBS suggests, privatization would be manifoldly more attractive to workers. Was this taken into account when CBS said low-income workers would be worse off under privatization?
<p>
Social Security reform is perhaps the single most important issue to young workers in America. What is needed is a careful, balanced, and reasoned presentation of the options. Too bad Ray Brady and CBS failed to provide it.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</h2>
<p>
<h3>Network Reporting a Slave to Wages</h3>
</center>
<p>
Last month, MediaNomics reported that there were 19 stories about layoffs during the first two months of 1996, but only two stories about job growth. We noted how such a focus on the negative offered a distorted picture of the true nature of a competitive economy, which does destroy some jobs, but always creates more jobs.
<p>
The sister issue to job creation is living standards. A competitive economy would be of little benefit to workers if it caused their standard of living to decrease. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story that focused on wages and incomes on network morning and evening shows during the first three months of 1996. Ten of the 11 stories stressed the alleged wage stagnation of average workers over the last few decades. Only one story pointed out that opportunities have been increasing. No story pointed out that when benefits and payroll taxes are included, workers' total compensation has been steadily increasing.
<p>
A lack of diversity in guest selection kept the morning shows from giving viewers a balanced story. For instance, on the March 12 Today, Bryant Gumbel interviewed only Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Introducing the segment, Gumbel pointed out that the U.S. economy has created eight million new jobs over the last three years, adding that "the quantity of jobs is not being questioned, but the quality is."
<p>
Bernstein then said that "wages and compensation have been falling in our labor market since 1979 for most workers. yet in the current economy, profit rates, or corporate profits, are at a 30-year high." Bernstein also claimed that "this is a long-term trend and workers are experiencing falling wages and compensation and even increased turnover. That is, we have less stable employment and the typical American family is really running faster just to stay in place."
<p>
Gumbel's reaction: "OK, so let us accept all of that as fact. Could it be otherwise?" Since Gumbel didn't provide an alternative opinion, viewers had no choice but to accept Bernstein's assertions as fact.
<p>
Other reporters also seemed to assume that accounts of workers' falling wages was a fact. On the February 26 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather concluded that "the fear and anger of some American workers over layoffs and barely rising wages have emerged as a campaign issue." Earlier, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, Rather said: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages."
<p>
On that same broadcast, correspondent Wyatt Andrews portrayed "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." According to NBC's Mike Jensen, on the March 4 Nightly News, "William Young of California is typical -- 50, a victim of downsizing, laid off by Northrup after 29 years in the aerospace industry."
<p>
On the February 25 World News Sunday, ABC's Jeff Greenfield, normally one of the most balanced reporters at the networks, also bought the party line. He reported "something very disturbing behind the record Wall Street numbers and corporate profits." He interviewed a Wall Street economist who said, "This surge in financial markets was really based on an untenable situation of workers taking a real squeeze in living standards to improve corporate profit margins and competitive prowess." Greenfield called this the "dark side of productivity."
<p>
But just how dark is the American wage and income picture? According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists W. Michael Cox and Beverly J. Fox, writing in a January National Center for Policy Analysis Policy Backgrounder, it's not as bad as many have been led to believe. The problem with most analyses of stagnating wages is they don't look at benefits. Cox and Fox pointed out that "employee benefits have grown from 20 percent of payroll in 1953 to more than 41 percent today." Since benefits aren't taxed, they argue, employees have sought benefit increases. Increasing payroll taxes have also taken a bite out of wages.
<p>
Cox and Fox also maintain that looking at stagnating household income, as Bernstein apparently was, is misleading. "Today's households are nearly 15 percent smaller than they were in the 1970s -- so household income is spread over fewer people," they report. "The median family income statistics for yesterday's Brady Bunch cannot be accurately compared with those of today's Murphy Brown." Overall, Cox and Fox demonstrate that "per capita real personal income increased an average of 1.4 percent a year" from 1974 through 1993. Unfortunately neither they nor like-minded economists were interviewed by network reporters.
<p>
Only NBC's Jim Avila, on the March 4 Nightly News, gave any hint that the job and wage picture for American workers was not completely bleak. Though he didn't point out that total compensation has been increasing for American workers over the last few decades, he did look at small businesses creating jobs and noted that "many of the new jobs being created provide good salaries, full benefits, and something some of the old jobs did not provide -- a piece of the action. Often small companies offer new employees stock options and other incentives." According to Avila, "The workplace has changed, perhaps forever. The job security of the past replaced by uncertainty and, more often than you might think, also replaced by new opportunity." But, of course, Avila was the exception.

<center><h2>Guest Editorial, by Lawrence Hunter</h2></center>
<center><h3>Easy Money for Trial Lawyers</h3></center>

Time Warner's Money magazine claims to be a publication for serious investors. 
But lately Money seems to be fronting for an unholy alliance of anti-business 
activist Ralph Nader and a small group of the nation's most predatory trial 
lawyers. While dozens of liberal Democrats joined Republicans last December in 
passing securities litigation reform legislation in the only override of a 
Clinton veto, Money aligned itself with Nader's camp against the popular reform 
bill.
<p>
For years, "strike suit" securities lawyers have reaped lavish incomes 
targeting advanced technology and other growth companies. When stock prices 
drop suddenly, the lawyers typically swoop down and extract multimillion-dollar 
settlements. The system has made it so costly for companies to defend 
themselves against baseless charges that many are forced to settle out of 
court.
<p>
Over the past four years, settlements in such suits have cost investors more 
than $2.5 billion, one third of which -- $825 million -- went straight into the 
pockets of the "strike suit" lawyers.
<p>
The securities bar helped finance Ralph Nader's high-profile campaign against 
the federal legislation to curb abusive securities suits. Then President 
Clinton -- whose career has been largely financed by trial lawyers' largesse -- 
vetoed the legislation.
<p>
Scores of liberal Democrats, including Sen. Edward Kennedy, Democratic National 
Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd, and California Rep. Vic Fazio, joined 
Republicans to override the veto. They found support in much of the media, 
including a Washington Post editorial charging Clinton had "caved to the trial 
lawyers' lobby."
<p>
But Nader, President Clinton, and the trial lawyers had a reliable ally in 
Money magazine. Money's coverage was brazenly one-sided. In four of the five 
monthly editions preceding passage of the bill, managing editor Frank Lalli 
used his column to inveigh against the legislation. Money's fixation is all the 
more notable because Lalli's column is the only opinion piece each month. The 
magazine even ginned up a letter-writing campaign in support of a veto.
During the year of congressional debate on the bill, Money published no 
information about the benefits of the legislation, just Lalli's opinions.
<p>
Month after month, Money's opinion campaign broke the rules of honest advocacy. 
Persistently, the magazine published false or misleading characterizations of 
the reform bill. For instance:
Money falsely charged that the bill would "allow executives to deliberately 
lie." In fact, the bill specifically outlaws executives from making knowingly 
fraudulent statements. The bill does create a limited "safe harbor" for 
good-faith disclosure of forward-looking financial information. A Washington 
Post editorial praised the "safe harbor" for shielding companies "from a style 
of legal assault that is not far from extortion."
<p>
Money wrongly complained that "investors who sue and lose could be forced to 
pay the winner's court costs." The bill does not impose a "loser pays" or "fee 
shifting" provision. Instead it takes a modest step to toughen existing federal 
rules against frivolous claims, whether they are made by the plaintiff or 
defendant.
<p>
Money put things completely backwards in saying "accountants who okay 
fraudulent books will get protection." In fact, the bill gives the Securities 
and Exchange Commission new power to act against accountants, lawyers, and 
others who assist securities fraud.
<p>
The magazine refused to publish letters to the editor in support of the reform 
bill. It is unclear why a publication that professes to be a serious investors' 
magazine allowed only one side's arguments to be heard on an important issue 
for investors. Whatever the motive may be, surely it is not a serious search 
for the truth.
<p>
Securities litigation reform remains a hot political item. Securities lawyers 
are spending millions of dollars on a California ballot initiative that would 
effectively negate the new federal reform law's effect in that state and across 
the nation. Ralph Nader is campaigning ardently for the trial lawyers' 
initiative.
<p>
Those who keep Money magazine in business should take serious stock of its 
editorial policies and practices. Time Warner shareholders and executives -- 
and Money's readers and advertisers -- are in the best position to decide what 
editorial opinions on public policies best reflect their values. But clearly 
everyone is done a disservice when a publication attempts to justify its 
editorial opinion through falsehood and distortion.

<h2><center>Editor's Note, by Timothy Lamer</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Press: Fiscal Conservatives?</center></h3>
<p>
"There is a liberal bias [in the media]; it's demonstrable." 
"The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
Are these quotes from Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey? Or maybe Rush Limbaugh and William Bennett? No, the above quotes are from two members of the "media elite" -- Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas and CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg.
<p>
In the face of overwhelming evidence, some journalists are beginning to admit there's a liberal bias in the national media. But many of them ludicrously maintain that the bias only extends to social and cultural issues, not to economic issues, and that most reporters are in fact economic conservatives.
James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly makes this claim in his recent book Breaking the News. He argues that "the supposed liberalism of the elite press is more limited than many people believe. On economic issues -- taxes, welfare, deficit control, trade policy, attitudes toward labor unions -- elite reporters' views have become far more conservative over the last generation, as their incomes have gone up."
<p>
The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne agrees. During a May 29 Brookings Institution panel discussion, he said that "the press mostly has the biases of the educated, some would say over-educated, upper middle class." This, Dionne argued, means there is a  liberal bias in coverage of social issues, but "the issues we're most conservative on are in fact economic issues, just like much of the upper middle class that looks at its tax bill."
<p>
Fallows and Dionne are highly- regarded beltway journalists, and properly so. But on this issue they are terribly mistaken. Their argument lacks one element: proof. Numerous studies conducted by the Media Research Center demonstrate that most economic reporting in the non-business media is solidly liberal. For example:
<p>
Tax cuts. Reporters used to be less biased in tax coverage than they have been recently. It was the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 that ended any semblence of balance on tax issues. When tax cuts were being discussed in December of 1994, all 12 economists interviewed by the networks were against cutting taxes. The message: no matter what politicians say, tax cuts are bad economics. Then this year, when Steve Forbes' flat tax became a hot issue, reporters were more than twice as likely to mention arguments against it than for it. Fifty-one arguments against the flat tax were presented during January on the networks and in national news magazines. Only 24 arguments in favor were presented. Fallows and Dionne must know that "Reaganomics" has become a cuss word among reporters.
<p>
Federal regulations and mandates. Like most liberals, reporters seem to think businesses have money trees in their stockrooms. It rarely occurs to them that companies may have to increase prices, lay off workers, or reduce salaries and benefits in order to comply with regulations and mandates. A recent example is the debate over increasing the minimum wage. During the first four months of 1996, there were 60 sources interviewed for soundbites by the networks. Almost twice as many supported the increase (39) than opposed it (21).
<p>
Some reporters simply accepted the Democrats' logic at face value. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, the increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers" who earn near the minimum wage. CNN's Kathleen Kennedy worried that if the two parties couldn't agree, "people earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon."
<p>
Federal spending and the budget. Reporters seem to favor budget discipline when the issue is cutting taxes. But when spending programs are threatened, anecdotes abound outlining who will allegedly be harmed by fiscal restraint. During the first hundred days of this Congress, 34 network stories asserted that a balanced budget achieved by spending restraint would harm the poor. Only four stories focused on the benefits of a more limited government. And during the two government shutdowns last year, reporters repeatedly intoned about the "critical cuts" (Dan Rather) and "major cutbacks" (Tom Brokaw) in the GOP budget, without mentioning that Republicans planned to spend $267 billion more in 2002 than in 1996. According to CBS's Bob Mc-Namara, the shutdowns were "a hard lesson on what happens when big government goes away."
<p>
Part of the Fallows-Dionne misunderstanding may be in defining economic conservatism. For some reporters the definition is broad enough to include the architect of the Clinton health plan. CNN's Jeff Levine, on the August 30, 1993 Inside Politics, described (I'm not making this up) "the Ira Magaziner people" as "free marketeers."
<p>
If someone who proposed the biggest increase in government power since the New Deal is a "free marketeer," then who isn't? But if the definition includes, at the very least, some skepticism about government's ability to solve society's problems, few in the "media elite" qualify.

<title>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Poll: Workers: Happy. Media: Yawn.</center></h3>
<p>
Few mantras have been repeated more often in the media this year than the one about anxious American workers. It's accepted as fact among reporters that American workers are alarmed about their prospects in the new, global economy.
Just ask Dan Rather. As MediaNomics reported earlier this year, he spotted "fear and anger" in the workforce over "layoffs and barely rising wages." According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired." 
<p>
Tom Brokaw, introducing a January 29 Nightly News story about "today's frightening job market," announced: "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety." 
<p>
The print media have been similarlyfocused on gloom. The January 22 U.S. News & World Report cover asked: "Is the American Worker Getting Shafted?" (The magazine's answer: yes.) Newsweek's February 26 cover labeled four executives who had laid off employees as "Corporate Killers," and declared that the "public is scared as hell."
<p>
The New York Times saw fit to print a seven-part series depicting American workplaces as "battlefields" with "millions of casualties." According to the Times, the story of a man who lost a high-paying bank job, was forced to take a job at one-fourth the pay, and then had his family leave him "is no longer extraordinary."
<p><b>
Really?</b><br>
To find out, Inc. magazine tried something different. Rather than repeating emotional anecdotes about companies laying off loyal workers, Inc. commissioned the Gallup Organization to conduct a nationwide poll of workers.
<p>
"Across the board the 34 questions [to the worker survey] prompted upbeat -- sometimes even glowing -- responses," the magazine found. For example: 90 percent of the respondents were not worried about losing their jobs and 75 percent had not had three or more days in the past month when stress caused them to behave badly with their families. (For more survey results, see box.)
<p>
Interestingly, Inc. found that on many questions, workers at smaller companies are happier than those at large firms. The national media may be missing the story of worker happiness because they relentlessly focus on big business. Last summer, Media- Nomics found that in the first six months of 1995, there were 119 network evening news stories on the health of large companies, while only 13 stories focused on the health of those companies not in the Fortune 500.
This is truly a whopper of an omission, since smaller, fast-growing companies ("gazelles") created five million jobs between 1990 and 1994, while other companies lost 800,000.
<p>
The non-business media have not reported Inc.'s findings and have yet to tell the whole story about the true nature of the American workplace. It is a picture of the entire economy -- they aren't telling the whole story.

<title>Reporters Still Ignoring the Real Tax Record of the 1980s</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Tax and Pretend about Budget Deficit</h2>
</center>
<p>
Here we go again. With Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole pondering a large tax cut proposal, many in the media are telling their viewers and readers that cutting taxes is inimical to balancing the budget.
<p>
"When you talk about a balanced budget and then you talk about big tax cuts, that's smoke and mirrors," argued NBC's Tim Russert, questioning House Speaker Newt Gingrich on the June 2 Meet the Press. "Bob Dole has been searching for a campaign issue that will mark clear-cut differences between himself and Mr. Clinton," stated ABC's Peter Jennings on the June 3 World News Tonight. But with taxes, "has Mr. Dole painted himself into a corner?" A week later, on the June 10 show, Jennings asked Dole in an interview: "Cutting taxes or the budget deficit, how can you do both?"
<p>
That doing both is impossible has been an article of faith for reporters for years. 
<p>
Since the 1980s, especially the late 1980s, reporters have repeatedly blamed budget deficits on tax cuts. In 1989 and 1990 they scolded George Bush for promising not to raise taxes and urged him to change his mind. On July 18, 1989, CBS Evening News reporter Mark Phillips, for instance, referred to "the stubborn budget deficit that most economists say will never be seriously reduced without the new taxes to which the President [Bush] remains opposed." 
<p>
"We cannot simply sidestep what is happening by resorting to old ideologies and new slogans," stated Mortimer Zuckerman in the February 6, 1989 U.S. News & World Report. Asked Zuckerman: "Who wants to read Bush's lips when to do so in the face of gigantic budget deficits means the slow decline of the America we know and believe in?" And correspondent Richard Threlkeld, on the October 16, 1990 CBS Evening News, opined: "So if and when they do sort out that deficit mess it's likely the rich are going to get soaked, at least a little, to make up for the soaking they avoided in the `80s."
<p>
But are tax cuts really such bad policy? Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, points out in the May 27 Washington Times that when tax cut detractors are "asked for evidence that the American people suffered from [President] Reagan's tax cut, they have none to offer except the budget deficit."
<p>
This is a spurious argument, Bartlett maintains. "In fact, the tax cut had nothing whatsoever to do with the increase in federal budget deficits in the 1980s. On average, federal receipts as a share of GDP were higher in the 1980s than in the 1970s -- 19.0 percent of GDP versus 18.5 percent." According to Bart-lett, the deficit increase was caused by massive spending increases, with outlays increasing from 20.6 percent of GDP in the 1970s to 23.1 percent in the 1980s.
<p>
Bartlett demonstrates that real economic growth averaged 3.9 percent per year between 1982 and 1989, more than double the average for the 1990s. He also points out that "real median family income increased by $4,564 between 1982 and 1989, an increase of 12.6 percent, while it has fallen by $2,108, a decline of 5.2 percent in the low deficit 1990s."
<p>
If, as is most likely to be the case, tax cuts become part of the debate in this year's campaign, reporters should at least be skeptical of those who claim that they inevitably lead to higher deficits and other dreary economic outcomes.

<title>Issue Analysis: Are Some Risky Products More Newsworthy Than Others?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories</h2>
</center>
<p>
The following is adapted from a Media Research Center special report, to be released later this summer, about news media coverage of risky products and the companies which make and sell them:
<p>
It is estimated that about 400,000 Americans die each year from smoking-related illnesses.
<p>
It is also estimated that about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related illnesses. And studies show that fully one-third of Americans (75 million) are overweight.
<p>
Given these statistics, it's reasonable to assume that there are three news stories about dietary fat and the industries that sell products with dietary fat for every four news stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, right?
<p>
Wrong. Media Research Center analysts counted every evening news story during the first six months of 1996 that had to do with tobacco and every evening news story during the same period that had to do with obesity and dietary fat. (Shows analyzed were ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's The World Today, and NBC Nightly News.) There were 138 stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, all of which portrayed tobacco as a risky product. There were only 38 stories about dietary fat and obesity which portrayed fat as risky to consumers, a difference of almost four to one.
<p>
It's hard to escape the conclusion that tobacco has been singled out. Unlike fat, no angle of tobacco or of the tobacco industry went uncovered during the study period. There were reports, for example, about increases in teen smoking. NBC's Brian Williams, introducing a January 25 Nightly News story, told of  "a disturbing report out today on teenage smoking from the Centers for Disease Control. Despite all the pressures to stop, all the attempts to restrict cigarette sales, kids in much of this country are picking up the habit faster than ever." According to NBC's Bob Kur, in the same story, "Teenagers are part of 47 million smokers nationwide whose habit costs the country $50 billion in medical care." Bill Clinton's anti-tobacco photo-ops were also popular news stories. ABC's Peter Jennings, on the May 7 World News Tonight, reported that "President Clinton was in a New Jersey classroom warning that 3,000 teenagers start to smoke every day."
<p>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. This was especially the case when Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole claimed that, for some people, smoking isn't addictive. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<p>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27 CBS Evening News told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On that same night, NBC's Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." 
<p>
There were also a great many stories about former tobacco industry executives and scientists admitting that they had known all along that nicotine is addictive, and numerous lawsuits against the tobacco industry were deemed of enough national importance to make the evening news.
<p>
In contrast, there were far fewer stories about fat and obesity and the industries which help produce them. Should tobacco really warrant so many more stories than fat? How dangerous is obesity? According to reporters themselves, it is quite dangerous. NBC's Tom Brokaw said, on the April 29 Nightly News, that "obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country. It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS's Jacqueline Adams, on the April 9 CBS Evening News, reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<p>
Even one high-fat meal can be dangerous, according to ABC's John McKenzie. On the May 9 World News Tonight, McKenzie told viewers about a study conducted at the University of Maryland in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<p>
So why so much more attention to the tobacco industry than to industries that produce fat? There were never any heated stories on the evening news about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. There were no reporters monitoring the political donations of fast-food restaurant chains and their trade associations. There were no stories in which reporters asked food-industry executives if they believed their products to be harmful. And there were no stories pointing out the medical-care costs of obesity.
<p>
Either the network evening news shows spend too much time covering tobacco or not enough covering the dangers of obesity and dietary fat. Either way, one politically incorrect product and industry is being singled out for intensive news coverage while other risky products and the industries which produce them are not.

<title>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</h2>
</center>
<p>
All this year MediaNomics has reported on how the TV networks have overhyped the economic insecurity of American workers. A March study, for instance, showed that there had been 19 stories in the first two months of the year about layoffs, but only two about job growth. The June issue reported on how the media were ignoring an Inc. magazine\Gallup poll showing that most workers are quite secure and happy.
<p>
Finally, some reporters are starting to question the layoff legend. "The fears," said Forest Sawyer, in his introduction to a July 3 World News Tonight story, "are not always supported by the facts." 
<p>
Robert Krulwich, an economics correspondent for ABC News, continued: "Because we read every day about corporate layoffs and corporate downsizing and job anxiety, most of us now believe the world has changed...[but] what we all think is happening is not." According to Krulwich, "We Americans stay at our jobs about as long as we did 20 years ago. If you go back to 1973 to see how many folks had been at the same company for 10 years or more, for the younger group it was 28.8 percent and for the older group it was 45.1 percent. Now let's go forward to 1993, and look at this, the percentages are up, but very slightly. No big change at all."
<p>
He quoted Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University: "And so what this is telling me is that there is basically just about as much job stability now as there was 20 years ago."
<p>
But then Krulwich tried to explain why people seem to feel more insecure now than they did in past decades. "Here's one possible explanation," Krulwich ventured. "Yeah, lots of people left jobs in 1973; lots of people left jobs in 1993. The numbers look the same...[but] there is some evidence that back in the 1970s more people happily quit their jobs for better pay, whereas today more people get fired." According to Krulwich, "Today people may stay at their jobs because they are afraid of losing their health insurance or their benefits, so they are stuck. Back then people maybe stayed on their jobs because they liked them."
<p>
This explanation conflicts, however, with the Inc. poll, which showed that 70 percent think management makes their workplaces great places to work, that 84 percent had opportunities to grow and learn at work, and that almost 70 percent thought they were paid fairly. This is not the picture of an unhappy work force.
<p>
While his diagnosis of worker attitudes may have been suspect, kudos to Krulwich for reporting the facts about job tenure.

<title>Just Whom Does Big Business Support?</title>

<center><h2>Just Whom Does Big Business Support?</h2></center>
<p>
Reporters ignore actual donations, label conservatives as industry-backed
A burden of being a free market think tank or activist group in Washington must be knowing that TV network news typically ignores your work. What may be almost as bad is when network reporters cite the work of your free market group, but then sully its credibility by labeling the group "industry-supported."
<p>
It doesn't seem to matter to TV reporters that groups supporting expanded government policies actually receive more funding from corporations than do many of the free market think tanks. Nor does it seem to occur to reporters that some corporations may like, and profit from, big government policies more than from a free market.
<p>
Take CBS' Eric Engberg. On the June 21 CBS Evening News, Engberg reported on the efforts of conservatives in Congress to "defund the left," or stop the federal government from subsidizing the lobbying efforts of liberal advocacy groups. According to Engberg: "Right-leaning advocacy groups would be largely untouched by the legislation because they receive little federal aid and often have deep-pocketed backers in the business world."
<p>
Engberg failed to point out that many of the liberal groups which receive government money in fact have business backers with deeper pockets than those of most conservative groups. According to Stuart Nolan of the Capital Research Center, "Popular opinion incorrectly ties conservatives to big business, while liberals claim the moral high ground by championing 'the little guy.' In truth, however, big business tends to support conservative nonprofits only on legal issues and, to a lesser degree, on regulatory ones. Corporate America tends to fund liberals who specialize in women's, family, minority, and environmental issues."
<p>
According to Nolan's research, Corporate America donates over three times more to left-of-center groups than to right-of-center groups. Examples: AT&T financially supports such liberal groups as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the National Organization for Women (NOW).
<p>
And Times Mirror supports the Children's Defense Fund, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Urban League, and Planned Parenthood. Yet none of these industry supported groups are labeled as such by reporters. 
Conservative groups aren't so lucky. The latest example is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a free market environmental group. While CEI does receive some of its funding from corporations, so do liberal environmental organizations, such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Audubon Society. That didn't stop two CBS reporters from placing only CEI in the same boat as "industry."
<p>
On the May 30 CBS Evening News, reporter Rita Braver (and Bill Plante on the May 31 This Morning), after reviewing President Clinton's objections to revisions of the Clean Water Act, referred to "industry groups and their supporters" before running a soundbite from CEI's Fred Smith. While Braver and Plante should be commended for interviewing Smith, liberal environmentalists who get more money from industry than CEI have escaped such labeling.
<p>
Industry is not a monolith. Some businesses support and prosper from free markets. Others do not and give money to groups which favor government activity in the marketplace. By missing this point, reporters unfairly tilt credibility against the think tanks and advocacy groups which support free markets in favor of those which do not.

<title>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</h2></center>
<p>
NBC correspondent uncovers angles other Washington reporters miss
For some time now, NBC's Lisa Myers has been one of the most perceptive network news reporters based in Washington. Her beat is politics, but she brings to that calling an economics perspective which even some of the most seasoned business reporters lack.
<p>
Since the beginning of the year, Myers has spent most of her time covering the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill. She has been no knee-jerk partisan of the GOP. Often she challenges Hill leaders for practicing the same kind of old-fashioned politics they had claimed to repudiate in the November elections.
On the March 14 Nightly News, for instance, Myers took House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston to task for directing pork spending into his and other committee members' districts. "Bob Livingston preaches budget cutting with the fervor of a televangelist," Myers reported. "When critics charged that cuts victimized the poor, Livingston argued that the real victims today are taxpayers." 
<p>
But, she said, "he and his committee seem less concerned about reaching into taxpayers' pockets when it comes to their own pork barrel projects." After pointing out the nearly $3 billion Appropriations Committee members had steered to their own districts, Myers said the policy, though started by Democrats, "runs contrary to promises that this Republican Congress would be different."
On the May 23 Nightly News her target was Senatorial junkets. She described one junket in which five senators flew to Bali to visit a bamboo training center. She criticized both Republicans and Democrats, namely Senators Bennett Johnston, Alan Simpson, and self-proclaimed fiscal conservative Arlen Specter. She also detailed the extensive travels of one Congressman, supposedly to learn more about foreign policy issues, even though he sits on the Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
<p>
In contrast to many other political reporters in Washington, Myers also turns a skeptical eye toward many popular government programs. President Bill Clinton's pet program, Americorps, has received extremely favorable coverage from other networks. But Myers, on the February 16 Nightly News, looked at the facts. "Everyone agrees that what these young people are doing is worthwhile," Myers said. "The issue is whether it's a smart use of taxpayers' money. Critics insist it's not, that it's the last gasp of big government liberalism."
<p>
She pointed out that "an environmental project in Alaska costs taxpayers $42,000 per volunteer per year" and also that a grant of "$140,000 [went] to Northeastern University, [but] not a penny went for volunteers." She challenged a bureaucrat who helps run the program, finding that "even a top supervisor described Americorps as a jobs program," which "is not the way the Clinton Administration sold it to Congress."
<p>
On the May 25 Nightly News, Myers examined the federal government's program to subsidize America's sugar growers. According to her, "The sugar secret is hidden in many of your favorite foods: candy, cereal, even canned hams. The sugar growers like it that way. They get billions of dollars; you pay inflated prices and don't even know it, which is one reason the sugar program is one of the sweetest deals around."
<p>
Myers explained that "government price supports and import restrictions combine to drive up the cost of sugar in this country. This year the world price of sugar is 14 cents a pound. But U.S. growers get 22 cents a pound." She pointed out that the total cost to consumers is $1.4 billion a year and that most of the benefits go to large corporate sugar farmers rather than small family farmers.
<p>
On the June 13 Nighty News, Myers proved unafraid to investigate one of the most powerful lobbying forces for big government in America -- the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). "If you think the AARP is some frail group of old people," she reported, "think again. In reality the AARP is one of the most influential voices in [Washington], trusted by 33 million members who are powerful because they vote as a bloc." She pointed out that most AARP money comes not from dues but from selling and endorsing products.
<p>
"However, an NBC News analysis found that while these products and endorsements are good business for the AARP," Myers said, "they are not always good deals for its members." She interviewed experts in such fields as investment banking and health insurance who told viewers that the AARP-sponsored products are usually not the best on the market and are overpriced because of the fee the AARP receives for products sold.
<p>
But it's Myers health care reporting which especially distinguishes her from many of her colleagues. While her beat is politics, and she therefore focuses on political angles, Myers nevertheless consistently brings up important economic facts which other reporters -- even economics reporters -- miss. In the previous Congressional term, for instance, when the Clinton Administration was proposing a sweeping health care program and assuring Americans that it knew how much the program would grow over the years, Myers looked at history and was skeptical.
<p>
On the September 29, 1993 Nightly News, Myers said: "When LBJ proposed [Medicare] he claimed it would cost $8 billion in 1990. The actual cost was $98 billion. Many health experts and economists are already challenging key assumptions of the Clinton plan."
<p>
The only other network reporter to point out the poor track record of government health care estimates, and how the government always underestimates rather than overestimates costs, was CBS's Ray Brady.
<p>
When, last year, the Democrats' favorite health care soundbite was that each American should get the same extravagant medical coverage as members of Congress, Myers kept her eye on the ball. On the June 21, 1994 Nightly News, she asked about such rhetoric: "And who will pay? One way or another, you will." 
<p>
And on this year's hottest health care issue, Medicare reform, Myers has again provided unique insights. The root problem of Medicare, according to Myers, is that "elderly Americans are getting far more in benefits than they ever paid in taxes. Fact: The average man retiring today will have paid about $24,000 in Medicare taxes and will get $85,000 in benefits. For women, who live longer, the difference is even greater: $25,000 in taxes compared with $104,000 in benefits." She is, so far, the only network reporter to point out the large disparities.
<p>
Myers, however, is no ideologue. In 1992 she gave less than charitable coverage to both Republican Presidential candidates, George Bush ("Even judged by the words of his own inaugural address, he comes up short.") and Pat Buchanan ("Pat Buchanan leads with anger."). She also has been critical of Republican plans to cut taxes and reform welfare. 
<p>
She is, above all, fair. She regularly does what good Washington reporters should, but don't usually, do: take skeptical looks at not just "waste," but at the programs government claims to run well, and remember that there are usually economic facts underneath every political story.

<Title>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</h2>
</center>
<p>
Ray Brady, CBS's economics correspondent, would be a great economics analyst -- if this were the 19th century. For Brady the only good job is manufacturing job. His rhetoric would have you think that service jobs are something akin to slavery, with most of the jobs created since the 1980s being for hamburger flippers. This vastly underestimates the power of the late- 20th century American economy to create good service jobs.
<p>
On the July 7 CBS Evening News, Brady reported on a drop in the unemployment rate that "on the surface, it looks like good news, but if you dig into the numbers, they're really not that great." Why? Because "we're losing manufacturing jobs, which are high paying, and we're adding amusement park kinds of jobs, which don't pay much."
<p>
This is nothing new for Brady, who has been bashing service jobs for years. On March 10, 1989, he reported that "in today's figures, the big job increase is in low-paying service industry jobs" while a graphic of a teen flipping burgers was on the screen. Good employment news on September 4, 1992 was tempered by losses in "manufacturing, the industry that's the heartbeat of the economy."
<p>
On March 5, 1993, Brady reported that "there was hardly any growth in high paying manufacturing jobs," only in service jobs, which "don't pay what the old jobs did." And on March 4, 1994, Brady reported that despite a drop in unemployment, "still, the biggest winners came in low-paying service jobs."
<p>
But just how bad are service jobs. According to National Review's Ed Rubenstein, service jobs include "positions in law, advertising, computers, and medicine." During the 1980s, he reported, "only 12 percent of the increase in employment occurred in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations such as retailing and fast-food restaurants." And what about the 1990s? According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the January 30 Nightly News, "The Census Bureau today said that [computer] software is by far the fastest growing part of the service economy."
<p>
So Brady and other reporters should take a good look at the wide range of service jobs before stereotyping them as "amusement park kinds of jobs." Most of the new service workers do just fine.

<center><h2>Kudos: Post Looks at Regulations from Business Perspective</h2>
</center>
<p>
The concerns of small business owners rarely make it into the stories of the Washington media (See page 2). A notable exception: the July 17 Washington Post. Staff writer Jay Matthews, in a front page story, describes how the federal regulatory maze causes one small business, the Drypers Corporation, to "fear" and "shudder" at the cost of compliance. According to Matthews, that fear can now be remedied by "a Republican led Congress [that] tries to rewrite and scale back what businesses consider irrational intrusions." Matthews gives readers a "close look at Drypers' multi-layered relationship with Washington [which] helps explain the resentment that drives this [deregulatory] campaign."
<p>
The story quotes Walter Klemp, chairman of the Texas-based diaper company, as fearing almost any new government action. Referring to the last time Congress changed tax laws, he asks: "How many volumes and rooms of tax code did they add to the whole thing the last time?" Matthews notes that "Drypers must calculate its income in one way for the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and its shareholders and in quite another way for the [Internal Revenue Service]." Other "conflicting rules" which "almost no one reads" include "a federal law that requires a plan to reduce its employees' commuting time while a state law says the company does not have to put the plan into effect." Such conflicting rules require Drypers' management to neglect their "families for weeks to produce stacks of reports," causing Klemp to declare that "government has tried too much to work social issues through business."
<p>
While Matthews didn't point out the cost of excessive regulations for consumers and society (See Editor's Note, page 8), kudos to him and the Post for reporting on how overregulation does hurt small, struggling business owners.
<p>
 MediaNomics noted recently that NBC's Lisa Myers has been emerging as one of the most original network reporters. During July, the trend continued. Last month Myers reported again on sugar subsidies for Dateline. She pointed out that the program costs consumers while a limited number of sugar growers get billions in subsidies.
<p>
Then, in a Nightly News story, she returned to the Medicare debate. Myers reported again that most recipients receive much more in benefits than they paid into the program and that Medicare's explosive growth wasn't predicted by its founders.
<p>
Myers' fact-based reporting continues to clear up the often foggy entitlements debate.

<title>Reporters Ignore Those Who Support Tax Cuts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Economists Unanimous on Taxes? </h2>
</center>
<p>
Reporters seem to think they have found something others have been trying to find for years -- a consensus among economists.  Journalists in both the print and broadcast media are reporting that "most economists" are against Dole's tax cuts. But a recent study that actually surveyed economists finds much less agreement than the media are conveying.
<p>
"Bob Dole says his new economic plan will carry America `to the threshold of a breathtaking future.' But to many economists, it looks like `Back to the Future,'" wrote the Boston Globe's Peter G. Gosselin on August 6. "For all Dole's claims about the innovativeness of his proposal analysts said that it relies on two tried-and-troubled ideas -- spending cuts like those balked at by the public last year, and an economic payoff largely missing from the nation's last experiment with substantial tax cuts under Ronald Reagan."
<p>
Clay Chandler, in the August 6 Washington Post, agreed: "Economists, investors and budget experts yesterday questioned the validity of those assumptions and the budget numbers underlying Dole's ambitious claims." He quoted Norwest Corp.'s chief economist, Song Won Sohn, as saying, "If we were to put in a package like this, I'm concerned that income growth effects would be negative, not positive."
<p>
Broadcast reporters were equally adamant. NBC's David Bloom, on August 5, said: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan." 
<p>
It turns out not to be so clear, though. Professor William C. Adams of George Washington University conducted a nationwide survey of 700 members of the American Economics Association. According to Adams, the survey found "an unexpected degree of sympathy for tax cuts" as well as "an enormous diversity of opinion and no profession-wide consensus on these key issues." (See box.)
<p>
About the same percentage of economists, for instance, think federal spending caused the increased deficits of the 1980s (52) as think Reagan's tax cuts were the culprit (48). More than eight out of ten, though, agree that Reagan's tax cuts increased economic growth. A sizable minority of economists (41 percent) think Dole's plan to recapture 30 percent of the revenue lost from his tax cut through faster economic growth -- the classic supply-side argument -- is plausible. 
<p>
According to the survey, the closest thing to a consensus among economists concerns reining in spending. When asked their preferred priorities for the next Congress, a plurality (42 percent) picked cutting taxes and restraining spending. Thirty four percent chose restraining spending. In other words, a full 76 percent favor restraining spending, a story still waiting to be told in the news.

<title>Issue Review: Coverage of Business Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Schizophrenic on Corporate Welfare</h2>
</center>
<p>
When General Colin Powell, in his speech at the Republican National Convention, challenged his party to rein in corporate welfare and not just other parts of government, reporters responded approvingly. But a look at their own past record in coverage (or lack of coverage) of subsidies to business and industry reveals that reporters themselves need to start challenging both parties on the issue.
<p>
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin Powell's speech," commented MSNBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, "is that he did talk about the hard choices and he said, `Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have to give up corporate welfare as well.'" PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to the Family Research Council's Gary Bauer: "You heard the reaction in the room at the conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you think this crowd is really receiving this message?"
<p>
As important is how the media have received this message. For while they are interested in corporate welfare now, the real deafening silence has been in the media's coverage of business subsidies. As reported by MediaNomics in past issues, reporters over the last several months have often either ignored corporate welfare when it was a major part of a prominent issue, or they have actually promoted business subsidies.
<p>
Example: Last summer when some budget cutters in Congress were trying to cut business pork, reporters came to the rescue. CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4, 1995 World News, reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described the USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block."
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, undersecretary of commerce, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." Is the USTTA corporate welfare? Bierbauer didn't ask. Bierbauer's conclusion: "Tourists may continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
John Roberts, on the June 25, 1995 CBS Evening News, warned that budget cuts may hurt summer jobs programs. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low-income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment." Roberts quoted Labor Secretary Robert Reich as pointing out that "one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs." So does taxpayer funding of businesses training costs constitute corporate welfare? Roberts didn't ask Reich.
<p>
A July 2, 1995 Washington Post story assumed the Commerce Department was necessary and didn't bother interviewing critics who were calling it the embodiment of corporate welfare. The entire story was from the point of view of then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. According to the Post, Brown, "a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence `cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress."
<p>
The Post said the secretary had been "leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets" and quoted Brown as saying that "it's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the cabinet table." The Post didn't give any space to non-administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum told the House Commerce Committee. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair."
<p>
Sometimes journalists simply ignored corporate welfare altogether, even when it was part of an issue they were covering. This past spring, for example, most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton Adminstration's expensive plan to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. The fact that federal subsidies, supported by both the Clinton Administration and Republicans in Congress, were propping up the same sugar industry which threatened the Everglades rarely merited a mention.
<p>
The Clinton plan is "the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever," cheered CBS News correspondent Art Rascon on the February 20 This Morning. Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 Newsweek, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." On February 20 reporter Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times called Clinton's plan "as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years."
<p>
But none of these reporters made the connection between the subsides provided to industry by the sugar tariff and damage to the Everglades. None asked why the government, before spending a lot of money, shouldn't just bring down the tariff. Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times criticized the subsidies. "The government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year," Schmitt pointed out. "Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
Such subsidies to business constitute some of the least defensible of federal spending programs. Although neither Republican nor Democratic politicians want to talk about corporate welfare, it has critics outside of Congress and the Clinton Administration on both the right and the left. Reporters generally cheered Colin Powell for bringing up corporate welfare in his convention speech. But when it comes to specific programs, they have usually been slow to mention corporate welfare's critics and quick to assume that business subsidies are justified.

<center><h2>Kudos: NBC's Lisa Myers and Andrea Mitchell</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the encouraging recent trends on the evening newscasts is the development of regular segments in which reporters explore how the government often misspends taxpayers' money. As recent coverage has demonstrated, NBC Nightly News' version, "The Fleecing of America," has proven to be one of the best.
<p>
The July 10 "Fleecing of America" segment told viewers how the Social Security Administration spends tax money for union representatives who, as Tom Brokaw said, "do no work on Social Security matters." According to correspondent Lisa Myers: "Taxpayers are paying the salaries of 146 full-time employees who do not work on Social Security matters and instead spend all of their time on union activities," as well as another 1,800 who spend part of their work time engaged in union tasks. Myers reported that "under President Clinton, the cost of these union activities has doubled to almost $13 million a year."
<p>
She interviewed former SSA employees who told of the union workers' using their jobs, and therefore tax money, to promote the Democratic Party, and confronted an SSA official about such partisan ties. "This is not happening just at the Social Security Administration," she concluded, "but in virtually every other federal agency."
<p>
Correspondent Andrea Mitchell, for the August 7 segment, told viewers about an "expensive new Medicare handbook, courtesy of the U.S. Government." According to Mitchell: "The handbook is supposed to describe Medicare benefits and where to get help, basic information. It cost $2.1 million to distribute last year. But this year, an election year, it cost nine times as much -- $18 million."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "critics wonder, was the chief reason for this year's big cost increase politics." One of those critics, Rep. Bill Thomas, (R-Calif.) said, "The primary goal was to create a positive, warm feeling in an election year with taxpayers' dollars."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "a separate copy went to every American over 65. That's 37 million copies," which went even to married seniors whose spouses received a copy. She pointed out that, despite the high cost, the handbook didn't even mention one of the new programs Medicare recipients are eligible for and concluded that to many, "it reads like another chapter in the fleecing of America."
<p>
Kudos to Myers, Mitchell, and NBC for holding government to the same standards reporters have long held the private sector.

<title>Guest Review, by Linda E. Platts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Where Science Meets Politics</h2>
</center>
<p>
Science and technology are now major players in the public policy arena. While much of the media ignore the science behind many political issues, at least one show takes it on squarely. TechnoPolitics, a half-hour public television show, is helping its viewers make sense out of technical information and also see how the policies that evolve will affect their lives.
<p>
Hosted by James K. Glassman, a Washington Post columnist who also hosts CNN's Capital Gang Sunday, TechnoPolitics is designed to "distinguish the science from the politics in policy debates," according to the producers. Thus, it deals with issues such as electronic communications, air defense, fat substitutes, medical research, and global warming.
<p>
The show delves into one topic at length and then follows with a briefer look at two other subjects. Film clips provide background information usually followed by a debate by experts representing both sides of the issue.
<p>
What distinguishes TechnoPolitics from other shows dealing with topical issues is its willingness to air views that get short shrift elsewhere. In a recent show, the World Bank came under close scrutiny. It is supported by the American taxpayers to the tune of $789 million a year and relies on the American government to guarantee its loans. Glassman dug in with queries on the bank's hefty salaries, its new $314 million headquarters, and its often risky loans, which no private bank would consider.
<p>
For another show, TechnoPolitics tackled pornography on the Internet. One side weighed in with the view that children must be protected at all costs and government control is essential. The opposing side suggested parents should do their jobs, rather than allow the government to gain a foothold on the free flow of information over the Internet. Another emotionally charged issue tackled recently by TechnoPolitics was medical research using animals. News footage with an animal rights activist and a patient battling AIDS introduced the segment, then in the studio two scientists presented contradictory "scientific" evidence. There were no clear winners or losers in this debate, but it highlighted the complexity of making public policy about animal testing.
<p>
Whether the subject is a replacement for the F-16 or saving human lives, TechnoPolitics doesn't shy away from the hard issues. The joint strike fighter, for instance, is intended to meet the needs of all the military services, but the development time, as Glassman noted, stretched well into the next century. Even more attention to the costs behind the science would be a welcome addition.
<p>
The last segment of each show does not examine an issue so much as raise an interesting subject. A New York Times reporter told how alternative medicines can deter patients from seeking effective treatment from conventional sources. A writer from Scientific American explained that all great scientific discoveries have already been made and from now on we will just be refining the details. Interesting, yes, but there is no debate and viewers are left in limbo waiting for the point that is never made. TechnoPolitics might be better leaving these stories to another program and sticking with the clear, rapid exchange of views that distinguishes the earlier portions of the program.
<p>
TechnoPolitics is produced by the Blackwell Corporation in association with South Carolina Educational Television and it is distributed by the Public Broadcasting System. It is broadcast on 180 stations and reaches 40 of the top 50 markets. It airs on Sunday mornings in most markets.

<Title>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Don't</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit Chicken Hawks</h2>
</center>
<p>
Bob Dole pledged to cut income taxes by 15 percent, balance the
budget, and leave Social Security and Medicare untouched. Toughminded
reporters believed none of it and shared their skepticism with
a national television audience,&quot; writes the Weekly Standard's
David Frum in the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<P>
But then, according to Frum, &quot;Two weeks later, the Democrats met in
convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth about
their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al Gore's
words, of wanting to `give health insurance ripoff artists a license
to change Medicare, to let this program for our seniors wither
on the vine. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But
we won't let them.' Those remarks are blatantly untrue, both about
the Republican plans and about Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing.&quot;
<P>
Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax rhetoric
than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media Research Center
analysts reviewed all of the stories about either tax cuts or
Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's World Today during the month of August. The MRC's
findings: While network journalists were ardent deficit hawks
when reporting on tax cuts, they lost their deficitcutting zeal
when Democrats denounced Republican Medicare plans.There were
a total of 24 stories during the month that questioned whether
Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the budget. Only two
stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could erase the deficit
while not advancing Medicare reforms in his second term.The reaction
to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same across the networks.
&quot;Since Dole would leave Social Security, Medicare, and defense
untouched,&quot; reported CBS News correspondent Phil Jones, &quot;it's
still unclear what would be cut in order to pay for his tax cut.&quot;
According to CNN's Gene Randall, &quot;Bob Dole has produced an
economic plan that is getting mixed reviews even from Republicans.
The bipartisan Concord Coalition on Sunday warned against electionyear
taxcut Santas.&quot;
<P>
NBC's Mike Jensen offered that &quot;most
analysts say it's not good economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth
of the tax cuts would be paid for by an expanding economy, but
the rest would have to come from spending cuts, and those haven't
been spelled out yet.&quot; Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran
claimed that &quot;if critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to
budget deficits of the size of those dating back to the Reagan
era, then his campaign simply isn't going to worry about it for
now.&quot;
<P>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics
columnist Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post,
pointed out that in the upcoming years &quot;the only way to avoid
(or minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced benefits
and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On Medicare, the
Republicans proposed precisely such a shift...Clinton's demolition
of this effort confounds the CBO's sensible advice.&quot;
<P>
Only
two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare alone
could be compatible with balanced budgets. &quot;A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade,&quot; ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. &quot;So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit reductions
will be impossible to sustain.&quot; ABC's Jeff Greenfield reported
that &quot;with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in about
15 years, those entitlement programs could take every single dollar
of the budget.&quot;
<P>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters
concerned about how to &quot;pay for&quot; automatic Medicare
spending increases. If Bill Clinton won't reform Medicare in his
next term, why aren't reporters asking him which taxes he will
raise?

<Title>Issue Analysis: The Media Versus Tobacco</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories, Part II</h2>
</center>
<p>
 Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be lifethreatening,
or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For
America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former.
Over a recent twelvemonth period, television news has devoted
significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting
on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
This is one finding
of a special yearlong Media Research Center study of news coverage
of risky products and the industries which make and sell them.
Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage
by far than any other risky legal product, such as dietary fat
and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol
and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry.
Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media
obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well,
even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign. 
<P>
Media Research
Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky
products on network morning and evening news shows between August
1, 1995 and August 1, 1996. There were 413 stories during that
twelvemonth period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about
illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite welldocumented
rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few
years, notably among teenagers.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity
has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American
newspapers finds that the terms &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot;
were employed 26,546 times between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996. Over the same time period, the terms &quot;cocaine or
heroin or LSD or illegal drugs&quot; were used only 8,501 times.
In other words, there were more than three times as many stories
focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal
drugs.
<P>
President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the
map. Eightyfive of the television news tobacco stories were about
the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry.
Almost all of the stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts
to regulate tobacco, portraying him as courageously taking on
a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced
on the August 11, 1995 Today that &quot;in a historic move the
Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and
has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers.&quot;
According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning,
&quot;President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness
smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures
today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco
lobby.&quot;
<P>
But when the issue was the increases in illegal drug
use, Clinton was mentioned only in 45 stories, and most of those
mentions were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The
same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that
government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the
young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal
drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media
that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how
much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the
print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals
that there were 4,057 stories between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996 that had &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot; in
the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the
story. Stories with the terms &quot;cocaine or heroin or LSD or
illegal drugs&quot; in the headline and a reference to Clinton
in the body of the story numbered 381.
<P>
This singling out of tobacco
had effects on 1996 campaign coverage. Normally, when a politician
radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance,
there were several evening news stories during the 1996 Republican
National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on
illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the
Republican vicepresidential candidate. &quot;
<P>
The quarterback became
the acrobat today,&quot; reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August
14, 1996 World News Tonight. &quot;Kemp was flipflopping on long
held positions.&quot; She noted that these changes &quot;left
at least one delegate here feeling abandoned&quot; and that &quot;Kemp's
change in position on these core issues fights the very image
that he's built for himself as an independent thinker.&quot; According
to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, &quot;Bob
Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts.
Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration.&quot;
Rather wondered: &quot;Isn't that, or is it, going to make it
more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?&quot;
<P>
But
these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice
President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In
his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that
his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his antitobacco
crusade. None of the network evening newscasts pointed out that
in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that &quot;throughout most
of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my
own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred
it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped
it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped
it and sold it.&quot; Apparently, politicians changing their positions
cannot go unpunished by the media unless they result in the politician
becoming an antitobacco zealot.
<P>
The disparity between tobacco and
other legal products was even greater. On television  during the
same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco
 there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; there were
94 stories about auto safety; there were only 58 stories related
to alcohol and health.As MediaNomics reported two months ago,
the disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary
fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates
who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the
U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000
deaths in the U.S. per year. Reporters acknowledged this risk.
&quot;Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country,&quot;
Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. &quot;It
is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from
heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like.&quot;
Other reporters pointed out that obesity during pregnancy can
cause birth defects and other serious problems in babies. One
reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one highfat
meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. But
there were still only onefourth the number of stories on obesity
and dietary fat as there were stories about tobacco. 
<P>
There was
also a different standard of judgment for the industries that
make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected
to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured.
There were no stories, for example, about fastfood advertising
enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day
kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical
costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the
campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol.
But all the networks were critical of tobacco advertising and
campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society
of smokingrelated illnesses.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some
perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more
stories on tobacco than on other legal, risky products, but they
have allowed Clinton to use smoking to deflect attention from
rising illegal drug use. Reporters should not ignore tobacco,
but they should not apply to it a harsher standard than they apply
to even illegal drugs.Editor's note: This issue analysis is adapted
from a longer Media Research Center special report about media
coverage of both legal and illegal risky products and the industries
which produce them.

<center><h2>PBS: Already Commercial</h2>
</center>
<p>
In all of the heated debate about privatizing
public broadcasting, one observation has struck me most forcefully
about PBS: It is a fact seldom commented upon that many PBS shows
have had their roots firmly fixed in commercial soil from their
inception. Many of public television's bestknown offerings are
either transfers from the networks, adaptations from them (often
using the same personnel), or purchases (on a commercial basis)
from British television companies (including such forprofit competitors
of the BBC as Thames Television).
<P>
The <I>MacNeil-Lehrer Report</I>, for
instance, was produced by a team from NBC News and resembled the
<I>Huntley-Brinkley</I> Report. Bill Moyers shuttled between PBS and <I>CBS
News</I>. William F. Buckley's <I>Firing Line</I> had run on RKO General
stations before moving to PBS. <I>Frontline's</I> first anchorwoman was
NBC News' Jessica Savitch. The American Experience was headed
by veteran Moyers' producers from CBS News. National Geographic
specials were simply moved from CBS. Ken Burns' The Civil War
was sponsored by General Motors.
<P>
Sesame Street was produced by the makers of CBS's Captain Kangaroo. British comedies like Monty
Python's Flying Circus were sold profitably to individual stations,
as were howto programs such as This Old House and The French Chef.
Masterpiece Theatre and Mystery! were brought to PBS by the Mobil
Corporation. The story of Milton Friedman's Free to Choose is
a case study of how private sponsorship made possible a major
PBS miniseries. 
<P>
One could choose a different selection of programs
to analyze, but it would be difficult to find truly excellent
PBS fare which did not have some commercial connection. It is
precisely these market forces which serve to improve the range,
quality, and choice of programs on public broadcasting.
<P>
The extent
to which public broadcasting had developed into a large, powerful,
and wealthy establishment over the past three decades remained
largely obscured from public view prior to 1992, when political
deliberation over continued funding for the system began in earnest.
As a result of the subsequent years of debate and disclosure there
is now a bipartisan consensus in Washington that public broadcasting
can be selfsupporting. In 1996 Congressman Jack Fields, chairman
of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, introduced what
he called the &quot;Public Broadcasting SelfSufficiency Act.&quot;
Although I have opposed such a billiondollar final payment to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (as a &quot;trust fund&quot;),
no one has come forward to publicly argue against the principle
of selfreliance.
<P>
Indeed, a January 1996 public opinion survey commissioned
by CPB found broad support among the American public for PBS sales
of videotapes and merchandise, commercials, retail stores, online
computer services, and mailorder catalogs. Fiftyseven percent
of those asked said, &quot;The more sales the better.&quot; Eightysix
percent agreed that &quot;sponsorship announcements are okay because
public broadcasting has to do something to raise money in the
face of the decreased support from the federal government.&quot;
That is, the public now accepts that educational and cultural
programming on PBS can be successfully supported by private revenue
streams.
<P>
A system which began with a $5 million appropriation for
CPB in 1967 has grown over thirty years into a multibillion dollar
worldwide multimedia empire. With over a thousand public radio
and television stations, public broadcasting is now the largest
network in the United States. When judged by the number of stations,
National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, Pacifica,
and Public Radio International are bigger than Fox, CBS, NBC,
or ABC.
<P>
In addition to their on-air activities, public broadcasters
publish magazines and newsletters; provide computer programs,
online services, sites on the World Wide Web, study guides and
textbooks; host conferences; license toys, games, and clothing;
produce stage shows; sell products through mail order catalogs
and retail stores; and distribute videocassettes and compact disks.
From these activities a large industry has grown to parallel commercial
broadcasting. And, just like other telecommunications giants,
public broadcasting spends millions on public relations firms
and lawyers to lobby Congress.
<P>
The political issue of &quot;zeroing
out&quot; federal subsidies is no longer a matter of &quot;if&quot;
but merely a matter of &quot;when.&quot; For the evidence is clear
and convincing: public broadcasting does not need tax dollars
in order to do its job.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>Train Wreck or Fender Bender?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Washington is abuzz with talk of an impending budgetary "train wreck." To most 
Americans this conjures up the image of gruesome wreckage and bloody 
casualties. But the truth is that the budget train wreck should have little if 
any impact on the lives of ordinary Americans even if it forces a temporary 
shutdown of the federal government. The only forces that will collide in 
October will be the two competing philosophies of governance of a Democrat 
President and a Republican Congress. Reporters should, therefore, be careful 
about calling the impasse a crisis.
<P>
To be precise, there are actually two potential budget train wrecks ahead. The 
first would occur if President Clinton vetoes any or all of the 13 
congressional appropriations bills. If spending programs have not received an 
appropriation before the start of the fiscal year on  October 1, then no money 
can be spent on the programs. Only "essential" functions, such as defense, law 
enforcement, and air traffic control, would continue to operate.
The second train wreck would occur if President Clinton vetoed the debt 
extension bill. The current debt ceiling of $5 trillion is expected to be 
reached by late October. Mr. Clinton might veto an extension because 
Republicans plan to attach welfare reform, Medicare savings, and tax cuts to 
the debt ceiling. If the ceiling is not raised on time, then the federal 
government is legally prohibited from continuing to borrow. It can continue to 
spend the money that is collected in taxes, but it cannot borrow to send out 
Social Security checks, veterans benefits, payments to defense contractors, and 
so forth.
<P>
How should the press cover this melodrama? Some tips:
<P>
First, a budget train wreck would be neither disastrous nor unprecedented. 
Ronald Reagan closed down the government for a day on several occasions as a 
result of policy disputes with Congress. Then, the circumstances were reversed: 
Reagan vetoed congressional appropriations bills because they spent too much, 
not too little. Moreover, even if the impasse between Congress and the White 
House lasted for several or even many more days, since essential government 
services would continue, only nonurgent federal spending would be halted. 
Surely few would be hurt if Head Start funding or NEA grants were discontinued 
for a few days.
<P>
Second, White House claims that the GOP budget includes deep, mean-spirited 
cuts should be greeted with skepticism. The GOP budget would allow federal 
spending to climb by $350 billion over the next seven years. The President 
wants to spend an extra $600 billion over this same period. Like the dispute 
over school lunch programs earlier this year, the debate is really about how 
much more should be spent on social programs.
<P>
Third, the charge that the GOP plan includes substantial tax cuts for the rich 
lacks factual support. Of the $250 billion tax cut package that will soon be 
agreed to by the House and Senate, the vast majority of the benefits accrue to 
working class Americans with children. The middle-class child tax credit is 
about four times as expensive as the capital gains tax cut. And this child 
credit is very similar to the middle-class tax cut Bill Clinton promised in 
1992. The official Joint Tax Committee finds that the House GOP tax package 
provides the largest percentage reduction in taxes to Americans with incomes 
between $30,000 and $75,000.
<P>
Fourth, the President may not be altogether hostile to the idea of a short-term 
shutdown of the government. During some past shutdowns of the federal 
government, few Americans even noticed. A several-day closure of non-essential 
federal activities may not be the doomsday scenario outside of Washington that 
it is perceived to be inside the beltway. This train wreck may have no 
casualties.
<P>
Fifth, the underlying policy disagreement between the President and Congress is 
whether there should be a balanced budget by 2002. The core dispute between the 
Congress and the President is not over tax cuts, Medicare savings, or welfare 
reform. The fundamental disagreement is whether the nation should be set on a 
course toward a balanced budget.
<P>
The budgetary showdown will, of course, be big news. But reporters should 
refrain from calling a temporary shutdown of the government a crisis when most 
Americans' lives will be changed very little. If reporters cry wolf too often, 
people may stop listening.

<center><h2>Reporters Say American Dream
Stolen</h2>
</center>
<p>
&quot;America: Who Stole the Dream?&quot; was the provocative
title of a recent tenpart Philadelphia Inquirer series, published
nationally in KnightRidder newspapers, by PulitzerPrize winning
journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele. Their answer
to the series' title question: freemarket proponents and foreigners.
But in their lengthy series they didn't mention some important
facts that critics have since pointed out.
<P>
Free trade was one of
Barlett and Steele's main villains. Instead of creating jobs in
export industries, low American tariffs have &quot;wiped out jobs
and driven down wages.&quot; Barlett and Steele lamented that
in 1996, &quot;the United States will record its 21st consecutive
merchandise trade deficit  a record unmatched by any other developed
country.&quot; America's other big economic problem, according
to Barlett and Steele, is immigration to the U.S. &quot;No other
industrial country has allowed in so many workers in so short
a time, depressing wages and living standards.&quot;
<P>
While these
policies are good for big business in the short term, the two
reporters suggest that American workers may be on the verge of
starting a revolution. They quoted a Kansas factory worker as
saying: &quot;Are we just going to keep lowering our standard
of living? When that happens, nobody is going to have money to
put food on the table. Then you are going to see a revolution,
because people are not going to be able to feed their families.&quot;
A Pennsylvania factory worker told the duo that &quot;there's
going to be bloodshed before we get out of this.&quot; These workers,
Barlett and Steele informed readers, &quot;reflect a largely silent
but growing sentiment&quot; in the U.S. Profiles of people with
such sentiments dominated the series. The two reporters proposed
restricting immigration and hiking tariffs.
<P>
The reaction to the
series was quick and severe. Economics columnist Robert Samuelson
called it &quot;junk journalism&quot; in a September 18 Washington
Post column. &quot;What [the series] doesn't say is that the trade
balance and employment are hardly connected,&quot; he wrote. Samuelson
pointed out that the trade surpluses of Germany, the Netherlands,
and Sweden  which Barlett and Steele envy  haven't kept those
countries from having far higher unemployment rates than the United
States. According to Samuelson, Barlett and Steele reported such
matters &quot;so select ively...that ordinary readers are misled.&quot;
<P>
The reporters' selective use of anecdotes and statistics bothered
George Washington University's Steve Suranovic. In a September
25 letter to the Inquirer, Suranovic wrote that it is easy for
reporters &quot;to choose individuals whose stories confirm their
conclusions.&quot; He argued that Barlett and Steele could have
&quot;found workers with new jobs in export industries earning
higherthanaverage wages&quot; and &quot;profiled  a couple of
millionaires with middleclass backgrounds who created export industries
employing thousands of workers. Bill Gates springs to mind.&quot;
<P>
The Cato Institute's Stuart Anderson argued that Barlett and Steele
misled readers about the economic effects of immigration. In an
October 14 Investor's Business Daily editorial, Anderson pointed
out that having more people in the U.S. does not lead to more
unemployment. The reason: &quot;While immigrants do increase the
supply of labor, they also increase the demand for labor.&quot;
His proof: As immigration and trade deficits have increased over
the past 20 years, and total employment has increased 59 percent,
&quot;the unemployment rate has dropped from 7.7 percent to 5.2
percent.&quot; According to Anderson, &quot;Even the total number
of unemployed people in the country has dropped.&quot;
<P>
The views
of Samuelson, Suranovic, and Anderson are held by enough economists
that they should be discussed in any major, tenpart economic series
that purports to be serious journalism.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Global Economy As a News Story,
1991-1992 vs. 1995-1996</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit in Trade Reporting</h2>
</center>
<p>
International trade has almost ceased to be an issue to report on for the network
news media. This is in stark contrast to 1991 and 1992, when the
media reported heavily on trade as an electionyear issue. As a
result, the trade deficit  though large  is not nearly the negative
story (except in KnightRidder papers, see page one) for President
Clinton that it was for President Bush. Media Research Center (MRC)
analysts reviewed all of the stories about foreign trade on ABC's
World News Tonight, CBS <I>Evening News</I> and NBC <I>Nightly News</I> between
July 1, 1991 and June 30, 1992. There were 134 trade stories during
this period. MRC analysts also reviewed all of the stories about
foreign trade on the same shows between July 1, 1995 and June
30, 1996. There were only 39 trade stories during this period.
<P>
There was also a large difference in the tone of the stories. During
the 1991-1992 study period, many stories focused on how trade,
especially with Japan, was harming America. Trade was like war.
According to NBC's Garrick Utley, on the January 12, 1992 Nightly
News, there is a &quot;new superpower rivalry. We, of course,
won the old one with the Soviet Union. The outcome of the new
one with Japan is much less certain.&quot; Stories focused on
union demands for tariffs and the views of protectionist economists.
<P>
Reporters adopted a different attitude during the 1995-1996 study period.
Spurred by Pat Buchanan's criticism of free trade, the networks
began pointing out the benefits of a global economy. Before the
South Carolina primary, NBC's Mike Boettcher contrasted the &quot;new
South, flush with foreign investment and hightech jobs&quot; with
&quot;the old South, shuttered textile mills, unemployment, and
pleas for protection from foreign competitors.&quot; ABC's Aaron
Brown reported that &quot;while Buchanan says you can protect
industries with high tariffs without driving out foreign companies
here, economists say that is nonsense.&quot;
<P>
There was also a dramatic change in the amount of coverage given to the trade deficit. In
a 1988 study for the Media Institute, Virginia Commonwealth University's
Ted J. Smith III found that as the American economy improved during
the 1980s, reporting on the economy decreased in volume and became
more negative in tone. In particular, he found that the media
became more interested in one statistic  the trade deficit  when
it widened and less interested in other indicators as they improved.
<P>
The trend in trade reporting that Professor Smith found during the
1980s was present during the 1991-1992 study period, when the U.S.
economy was coming out of recession. There were 21 reports about
the trade deficit, about the same number he found when the economy
was coming out of recession from 1982-1983. But during the 1995-1996
study period, when the economy was fully out of recession and
the trade deficit was expanding, there were only eight such reports.
During the Reagan era, when the economy was fully out of recession,
trade deficit reporting increased dramatically.
<P>
During 1991-1992, even decreases in the trade deficit were treated skeptically.
&quot;Some mixed signs on the U.S. economy today,&quot; reported
ABC's Forest Sawyer, on the March 19, 1992 World News Tonight.
&quot;The U.S. trade deficit grew smaller in January, down $5.8
billion. Still, many economists say they are concerned that American
exports were also down.&quot; 
<P>
Trade deficits, though, have not been big news more recently. In two instances, only CBS mentioned reports of widening trade gaps. On July 18, 1995, Dan Rather announced:
&quot;The United States has taken another beating in world trade,
posting a recordhigh deficit in May.&quot; Nearly two months later,
on September 12, 1995, Rather used almost identical language:
&quot;The U.S. took a beating in the world markets for the second
quarter of the year, posting the biggest quarterly trade deficit
ever.&quot; ABC and NBC ignored the news.
<P>
Trade deficits may not be such bad news. Many economists point out that prosperous countries often run trade deficits because they have a lot of money to spend,
and that imports constitute a great benefit to an economy. So
perhaps ABC and NBC were correct to play down the trade numbers.
Still, this was a new standard not applied to GOP presidents.
<P>
And trade in general could be a bigger news issue in this election
year than it has been. Will Bill Clinton, if reelected, again
defy union backers and work to expand the North American Free
Trade Agreement? Reporters, who seem to have lost interest in
trade, aren't asking.

<Title> Review: Lifetime'sTraders</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>New Business Show Better Than Most</h2>
</center>
<p>
This is the battleground of the modern world, where war is waged daily. Fortunes are made
or lost in seconds. These are the men and women of Gardner/Ross.
They're brilliant, ruthless, only as good as their next deal...They
work hard and play harder and agree on just one thing  winning
is everything.&quot;
<p>
From this promo for Traders, a Canadian program
now being shown on cable's Lifetime network, one would think that
it would be another typical TV caricature of business: A world
dominated by rogue greedheads who have no redeeming qualities
and whose work does nothing beneficial for society.
<p>
While this
tendency is present in the show, it doesn't always dominate. Traders
instead treats investment banking the way television usually treats
some other vocations, which is a step above the way business is
normally portrayed. Traders focuses on the Torontobased investment
firm Gardner/Ross. The plots center on the firm's senior executives:
<p>
<blockquote>
Sally Ross -- An idealistic economics professor, Ross steps into her father's
role as senior partner when he is arrested for illegally skimming
$5 million off of a $47 million deal. She is immediately at odds
with the firm's other senior executives, who want to make money
at all costs. She wants to make money, but also wants to preserve
her family firm's good name. When she doesn't allow the firm's
head trader to trade on inside information, he yells: &quot;You
know, you've got a really unhealthy sense of morality.&quot;
<p>
Adam Cunningham -- Ross's alter ego, Cunningham is willing to blackmail
government officials to land a deal. He has no conscience, but
a great knack for cliches: Investment banking is a &quot;zerosum
game. Nobody wins unless somebody loses&quot; and &quot;We all
know the game. You buy on rumor, you sell on fact. Look, if enough
people believe that fertilizer is worth more than gold, the next
thing you know crap is selling at $600 an ounce.&quot; When the
Russian mob threatens the family of the editor of the firm's newsletter,
Cunningham worries that the editor will care more about her family
than the firm.
<p>
Jack Larkin -- A very hungry young trader, he makes
his way to Gardner/Ross by landing a seatofthepants mining deal.
He's willing to risk everything for a big deal, but he's no Cunningham.
He cares deeply about mending his poor relationship with his father,
and his father's illness occupies as much of his time as does
the firm's business. It also gives him some perspective. When
a young trader almost ruins her career by not placing an order
out of concern for a client who is a compulsive gambler, Larkin
tells her: &quot;I'll deny I ever said this, but it's just a job;
it's just money.&quot; By steering the firm into investing in
an emerging medical drug, Larkin shows viewers that investment
banking can help society.
<p>
Marty Stephens -- The firm's head trader,
Stephens is a younger Cunningham. When the firm's building catches
fire, he threatens to fire any trader who leaves the floor. Is
extensive flooding in South Africa bad news? Not for Stephens,
because the firm will make money from the flood's effect on the
markets. His family life is a mess: He doesn't know the name of
his son's girlfriend, even though she eats dinner with the family
every week. When Stephens is suspended for 30 days because of
unethical trades, his life seems to change. He finds a support
group and learns that he is obsessed with money to compensate
for his own insecurities. He resolves to change his ways, but
once he's back on the floor the old Marty returns.
<p>
Suzanna Marks -- Marks runs the firm's investment newsletter. She becomes the
target of the Russian mob, which wants her to recommend a stock
she doesn't want to recommend. She stands on principle, refusing
to compromise her integrity. The Russians then threaten her family,
including her young daughter. Though terribly tempted, she still
doesn't cave. The situation is resolved when Larkin, whom viewers
learn has some mysterious tie to the Russian mob, finds out about
the threats and intervenes. The stress, though, ruins her family
life. Her husband, believing she places too great a priority on
work, files for divorce and custody of their daughter. 
<p>
Traders has often been compared to ER, but it is more like L.A. Law. On
ER, there is no question that the doctors are engaged in noble
work. On L.A. Law, sometimes the lawyers helped people and society;
sometimes they harmed people and society. Some of L.A. Law's lawyers
were extremely unethical, some morally upright. Traders' traders
are a similar mix. For business, as portrayed on television, this
is a step up in the world.

Many journalists swarmed like hornets after the
first presidential debate, their stingers aimed at a Bob Dole
soundbite statistic. Maybe the numbers seemed implausible to them.
Maybe they deemed Dole's private source for the statistic less
reliable than comparable government sources. Or, just maybe, they
were simply expressing their kneejerk bias against conservative
economic principles.
<p>
Whatever the reason, the day after the first
debate, several media outlets challenged Dole's Tax Foundation inspired
statement  that the average American household today pays more
in taxes than it does for food, clothing, and housing combined.
<p>
In a frontpage story, for example, the Los Angeles Times hinted at
a Dole blunder. The article related that while Dole relied on
a conservative think tank for his data, &quot;the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' consumer expenditure survey found that the average
household spent more than twice as much on food, clothing and
shelter as on taxes in 1994.&quot; Eric Engberg of CBS News was
more forthright in his analysis. Asserting that &quot;some [of
Dole's] facts got mangled,&quot; Engberg stated the GOP nominee's
claim was an &quot;exaggeration&quot; that could be disproved
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) study.
<p>
Ironically, while these and other news organizations used the opportunity to show
how Dole, in the words of the Times, was &quot;tweaking&quot;
the truth to his advantage, it appears the media were doing the
same thing. By accepting the BLS data as unimpeachable, the reporters
made an error of such magnitude that, if committed by either of
the presidential candidates, it would have made frontpage news
nationwide.
<p>
The problem is the BLS survey greatly understates taxes
paid. While the national survey is considered an accurate portrayal
of consumer expenditures, in the tax category the report only
covers individual income taxes (federal, state, and local), real
and personal property taxes, and an amorphous category called
&quot;other taxes.&quot;
<p>
Among the most recognizable omissions
from the survey: Social Security taxes paid. While the BLS survey
doesn't have a category for such payments, the Tax Foundation
estimates that the average household will pay about $1,100 for
the employee's share of payroll taxes alone this year. Similarly,
the BLS survey doesn't specifically report sales and excise taxes
paid. In the only entry in the survey in which these taxes might
fit (&quot;other taxes&quot;), households earning between $50,000
and $69,000 are said to pay $77 annually. By comparison, based
on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data, the Tax Foundation
estimates that households in that income group average over $2,000
in federal, state, and local sales and excise taxes paid.
<p>
Also,
the BLS survey results altogether ignore the effect of indirect
levies, such as business taxes, on American society. Unlike the
survey, the Tax Foundation incorporates all taxes at all levels
of government in its annual analysis, including those levies hidden
from taxpayers. For example, business taxes (including corporate
income taxes) must be borne by the general population somehow,
whether through lower wages for workers, lower shareholder dividends
(which harms anyone with a pension fund), or higher consumer prices.
So, while the typical American won't ever see a tax bill for these
taxes, they're certainly paid by everyone.
<p>
In total, the BLS survey
 relied on by so many reporters to knock Bob Dole's argument for
lower taxes  understates total taxes paid by more than four times,
according to the Tax Foundation's analysis based on BEA data.
<p>
The
flaw here isn't the BLS survey. It lies in the way the survey's
results were used by reporters. The search for truth by the media
is undeniably critical, especially during an election year. Unfortunately,
the public is hurt when reporters, to prove a point, choose to
accept certain economic premises without verifying their legitimacy.

<title>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</h2></center>

Network news coverage of Japan has changed recently. When Japan seemed 
invincible, network journalists would often report on Japanese industrial 
policy with the underlying premise that it made Japanese capitalism superior to 
American capitalism. Now, with Japan's economy in a prolonged tailspin, the 
networks have dropped the subject, no longer showing any interest in the 
economic effects of Japanese industrial policy.
<p>
Ned Potter's December 15, 1992 ode to Japan's government planners for ABC's 
World News Tonight was typical of a pre-1995 network story on Japan. Potter 
told viewers that environmental protection would be the biggest new industry of 
the future. He said that while the U.S. was leading the world in environmental 
cleanup technology, "Japan is mounting a major offensive to be the new leaders 
in what they call the eco-industrial revolution."
<p>
Potter glowingly described "Genesis," the Japanese plan to direct companies to 
work on such projects as technology for clean coal and oil plants. The moral of 
Potter's story: Genesis "shows how far ahead the Japanese are looking. And 
that's the challenge for America. With the new Administration seeking an 
economic revival, how can it best help U.S. industry compete with Japan for the 
environmental marketplace?"
<p>
That was 1992. Reporters, understandably, no longer use Japan as a model of 
government economic planning. But they also aren't talking about Japanese 
industrial policy at all anymore, even though in Japan, the role of government 
is the subject of fierce debate. U.S. News & World Report's Stephen Butler 
relates that "a fast-selling, controversial new book that has unleashed a 
torrent of debate in Tokyo suggests Japan must do more than throw money at its 
problems."
<p>
According to Butler, Japanese author Yukio Noguchi argues that Japan's economic 
woes "are a painful legacy of World War II, when the government intervened 
heavily in the private economy and suppressed market forces to boost industrial 
output." But despite this "torrent of debate" about Noguchi's book, no network 
report from Japan has mentioned Noguchi or his free market arguments.
Network reporters should be more curious about the roots of Japan's four-year 
economic stagnation. If they are, they will find and report on a robust debate 
in Japan about the role of government in a free economy.

<h2><i>Feminism at its Finest....</I></h2>
by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>June, 1996</center><P>
	On Tuesday <b>Betty Friedan</b> participated in an interesting panel discussion entitled "The Collapse of Marriage" at ... believe it or not ... the Heritage Foundation! Friedan, the co-founder of the National Organization of Women, the National Women's Political Caucus, and NARAL, gained national prominence after the 1963 publication of her book <I>The Feminine Mystique</I>.  She is currently a Guest Scholar at the Wilson International Center, and her remarks here at Heritage left us with some notable quotables that show that conservatives were right about marriage and family after all.
<p>	
She said....
<p><ul>
<li>"We made a mistake with no fault divorce."  There are unexpected economic consequences and decreases in living standards for women and children.<p>

<li>We have conducted "enough studies that show that divorce is not good for kids."<p>
<li>In a seminar she currently is teaching she claims, "You are not a real man if you have kids and don't take care of them."
<p></ul>
	According to Friedan, she now concentrates on reframing family values in light of economic realities.  Isn't it nice to see another advocate jumping on Dan Quayle's family values' bandwagon?  She thinks we should look at the economic consequences of government policy for women and children -- a step in the "right" direction.  Did you ever think one of the founders of the modern feminist movement would make such an about face?  And at Heritage?

<TITLE>Welfare: It Keeps Growing and Growing... -- Heritage </TITLE>

<CENTER>
<h3>WELFARE: IT KEEPS GROWING AND GROWING AND ...</h3>
<P>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>
</CENTER>
<P>
 As Congress and the White House get down to the serious business
of reforming America's welfare system, it might be useful to figure
out how we got in the mess we're in. After all, when President
Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty back in 1965, he didn't
envision an open-ended expansion of the welfare state.  
<P>
 Johnson's vision of  a &quot;temporary&quot;  investment to help
the poor become self-sufficient and climb into the economic mainstream
has turned into a bureaucratic and fiscal nightmare whose  total
cost has been calculated at $5.4 trillion.
<P>
 Just how did this burgeoning welfare state develop?  
<P>
 America's descent into the welfare abyss is a relatively recent
development. For the first 150 years of its existence, the U.S.
government played a very minor role in welfare. &quot;Charity&quot;
was conducted mainly by private religious organizations. In 1929,
for example, total federal, state and local welfare costs were
just $90 million, or about $800 million in today's dollars.  
<P>
 Welfare work relief programs -- the Civilian Conservation Corps,
the Public Works Administration and others -- created to deal
with the harsh effects of the Great Depression, fueled an increase
in welfare spending to $46.6 billion in 1939. However, by the
start of World War II, most of the these Great Depression anti-poverty
programs had been terminated and welfare spending remained low
during the post-war years.
<P>
 During the 1950s and early 1960s, welfare spending grew slowly.
But starting in 1965 -- a year after President Johnson declared
War on Poverty -- new programs began an unprecedented proliferation
based on the concept of &quot;entitlement&quot;; older ones expanded
eligibility requirements. In just three years -- from 1965 to
1968 -- yearly welfare spending more than doubled, from $38.3
billion to $80.5 billion in today's dollars. 
<P>
 Between 1965 and 1975, yearly spending on cash aid welfare programs
nearly tripled; social-service spending did triple; medical aid
almost quintupled; food aid did quintuple; housing programs increased
sevenfold; and job-training funds increased fifteenfold! By 1975,
total yearly welfare spending had reached $119.4 billion, nearly
five times as much as a decade earlier. (All these figures are
adjusted for inflation.) By 1993, combined federal and state welfare
spending on poor and low-income persons had risen to $324 billion
per year.
<P>
 One way to get a grip on how quickly welfare has expanded is
to compare welfare spending with spending on other programs and
functions of government:
<UL>
<LI>In 1965, the United States spent just 17 cents on welfare
for each dollar spent on national defense. By 1993,  spending
on welfare had surpassed defense, rising to $1.11 for each defense
dollar. By the year 2000, America will be spending twice as much
on welfare as defense.  
<LI>In 1965, we spent 29 cents on welfare for every dollar spent
by all levels of government on primary, secondary and post-secondary
education. By 1993, welfare  costs were 91 cents per education
dollar.
<LI>In 1965 the United States spent 51 cents on welfare for each
dollar spent on Social Security and Medicare. By 1993, the figure
was 77 cents in welfare costs for each Social Security and Medicare
dollar. 
<UL>
<LI>At the beginning of the War on Poverty, welfare spending absorbed
about 1 percent  of the gross domestic product (GDP). By 1993,
welfare spending was taking up  more than 5 percent of GDP.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
  And if current projections are to be believed, the situation
is only going to get worse. According to Congressional Budget
Office projections:
<UL>
<LI>Annual federal welfare spending will rise from $272.1 billion
in 1995 to $387.3 billion in the year 2000.
<LI>Combined federal and state welfare spending will rise from
$378.7 billion in 1995 to $551.7 billion in the year 2000. 
<LI>Between 1996 and 2000, the federal government will spend $1.6
trillion on welfare.
<LI>Add the cost of welfare to the states and that number increases
to $2.38 trillion. 
</UL>

<P>
 This kind of growth simply can't be sustained. That realization
-- on Capitol Hill and in the White House -- is one of the reasons
serious reform finally is being discussed.  What remains to be
seen is whether lawmakers are ready to take the political heat
for the total overhaul needed to bring welfare spending under
control.

PRIVATIZING THE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
<P>
By Ronald D. Utt
<P>
 Politicians have been &quot;reforming&quot; Washington's General
Services Administration (GSA) for more than 15 years, yet waste
and inefficiency still plague the government's central housekeeping
agency. It's time to try something radically new like privatization.
<P>
 Breaking GSA up into its major functional parts, then selling
them to private companies working with groups of  the agency's
former employees would clean up the current mess. How big a mess
it is can be seen in the fact GSA charges government agencies
$2.21 for the same dozen BIC pens a private-sector firm sells
for 89 cents!
<P>
 The need to fix GSA -- often the focus since 1978 of wide-ranging
probes by government investigators and media exposes of fraud
and abuse -- is so obvious that even the National Performance
Review led by Vice President Gore said big changes are needed
in the agency.
<P>
 Doing something about GSA is important because its 18,500 employees
manage more than 268 million square feet of space in 8,000 federally-owned
or leased office buildings and warehouses.
<P>
 GSA's basic problem since it was created in 1949 has been its
legalized monopoly on providing support services to government
offices and office workers. This monopoly is why GSA's annual
$200 million annual operating budget is deceptive. Acting as a
middleman for other federal agencies, GSA actually controls about
$50 billion worth of  building leases and purchases, building
services, office supplies, telecommunications, and computer equipment.
<P>
 Gore's performance review said ending GSA's monopoly would make
the agency more efficient because it would then have to compete
for business from federal agencies just like a private-sector
company. If GSA became 25 percent more efficient than it is now,
the annual budget savings would be about $12.5 billion.
<P>
 But why stop there when GSA's own experience proves how much
more could be saved by privatization? According to the General
Accounting Office, between 1982 and 1992, GSA reviewed 731 commercial
activities carried out by its Public Building Service for contracting
out to the private sector.
<P>
 Ultimately, 73 percent of the activities reviewed were privatized.
On average, the low contractor bids received by GSA were 39 percent
lower than the government's own cost for doing the same activities.
For custodial services, the low contractor's bid was 50 percent
less than the government's cost estimate.
<P>
 Similarly significant savings will result from privatizing other
parts of GSA. Last year, several private firms reviewed the potential
savings from renegotiating federal building leases. They concluded
that government could spend as much as 25 percent less on rent
each year through such competition.
<P>
 So great and so certain are these potential savings that private-sector
firms have proposed taking over GSA's property-management functions
at no direct cost to the government, paying themselves only from
the savings they achieve for taxpayers.
<P>
 It is important that GSA's employees share in the fruits of privatization
as the various parts of the agency are taken over by private-sector
companies. The Federal Employee Direct Corporate Ownership  Opportunity
Plan (FED CO-OP), developed by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
during the Reagan administration, provides a model.
<P>
 FED CO-OP sets up an &quot;Employee Stock Ownership Plan&quot;
jointly-owned by a contractor with employees working on a particular
activity being contracted out to the private sector. Employees
would thus be able to participate in the profits of the firms
that win contracts to take over GSA's commercial activities. The
program also provides guaranteed employment for a limited time
and high-quality out-placement services for employees who leave
the new firm within the first year after privatization.
<P>
 Fortunately, GSA should be the easiest federal agency to privatize
because its many services are available from the private sector,
whose many successful firms provide a blueprint for how a privatized
GSA could not merely survive, but thrive in a competitive environment.

<h3><i>Who's Vision of Governance Is America's Best Bet:  Federal Administrators 
v. Local Innovators? </i></h3>
<p>
<center>by <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a><br>
February, 1996<p>
 </center>Ever since the infamous Congressional elections of 1994, 
skeptics of the Republican Contract With America have claimed that lower taxes, less 
spending, fewer regulations, and genuine welfare reform sound like good ideas in theory, 
but they cannot be implemented in reality because they are too "tough" on the little guy -- 
the poor, the middle class, the "average" American.   At least, that's what they argue...and 
we all like to hear good arguments, don't we?   It's just that some of us, myself included, 
want them to back up their rhetoric with some really good examples of how their policies 
would be better at solving our nation's ills.  I, personally, take with a grain of salt, the 
economic advice of Harvard University-trained economists and well-meaning politicians.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; So, the question we must ask ourselves is:  DO THESE 
IDEAS REALLY WORK?  IF SO, WHEN HAVE THEY BEEN TRIED?    
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We need only to look so far as the states to realize what 
governors -- particularly Republican governors -- are doing on all these fronts.  
Republican governors now occupy 31 state houses across the country, and in these states 
we are seeing some new ways to address the same old problems.  
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In honor of the <b>upcoming Republican Governor's 
Association Annual Dinner being held in Washington on February 5</b>, I have 
listed some accomplishments of their administrations, showing that local innovations are 
better than overbearing federal usurpations.
<p>
<b>TAX CUTS</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Republicans have always preached that lower tax rates 
yield an improved economy with more jobs.  Governors from New Jersey, Michigan, and 
New York have successfully put this philosophy into place.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman</b> of New Jersey has created 110,000 new jobs 
with her  30% income tax cut enacted in 1994.
<p>
<li><b>Gov. John Engler</b> of Michigan has turned a $1.8 billion debt into a $1 billion 
surplus with much of the credit going to the 18 tax cuts he has implemented since he took 
office in 1990.
<P>
<li><b>Gov. George Pataki</b> of New York has reversed the high taxes of the Cuomo 
era in favor of a 25% income tax cut in 1995.  That move has many companies 
announcing that they will remain or even expand in the Empire State.
</ul><p>
<b>WELFARE REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  As legislators quibble over what the future of welfare will 
be on a national level in Washington, two rising Governors in Wisconsin and Michigan 
are already administrating revolutionary new approaches to welfare.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Tommy Thompson</b> of Wisconsin, through his "Wisconsin Works" 
program, hopes to completely replace Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) 
with a work-based system providing training and child care.  The <i>Los Angeles 
Times</i> called the plan "the biggest break from the traditional welfare system 
proposed anywhere."
<p>
<li><b>Gov. John Engler</b> of Michigan has also pushed through  a new welfare 
program that emphasizes self-sufficiency.  The <i>New York Times</i> simply noted 
that "the new program would be at once tougher on people who refuse to work and 
gentler on those who make an effort."
</ul><p>
<b>EDUCATION REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  The thrust of Republican reforms in education is to allow 
all parents, rich or poor, to be able to decide where their children attend school.  The hope 
is that the increased competition will improve the quality of education in both private and 
public schools.  Governors in Minnesota and Massachusetts have pushed for such reforms 
in their home states.
<P><ul>
<li><b>Gov. Arne Carlson</b> of Minnesota has given low-income parents of 
Minnesota a $3,000 education voucher to all families with an income below 130% of the 
poverty line.
<p>
<li><b>Gov. Bill Weld</b> of Massachusetts has begun the process of establishing 
charter schools that are designed to focus on one specific subject area.  Thus far 25 such 
schools have opened their doors to Massachusetts families.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; These are just a few examples of the revolutionary 
changes that are occurring in state houses across the nation.  Washington does not, and 
should not, have a monopoly on what's best for all citizens.  Programs that touch our 
daily lives are best administered at the local and state levels.  The REAL solutions to 
America's problems lie in the hands of the governors who are willing to take on and meet 
the difficult challenges without asking the federal nanny-state to step in and mind the 
store.

 </P>Hundreds of conservative activists.  Whole roast pigs.  Family activities. Ideal location</P>               

</P>That’s the 25th Annual Fourth of July Soiree.</P>								</P>And I invite you to attend.</P>			
</P>Can you think of a better way to celebrate the Fourth of July?  I’d be honored if you and your family would
come and join me at the Fourth of July Soiree.  It’s an ideal opportunity for you, your family, friends and colleagues to celebrate the values and principles upon which this country was founded.  Let’s keep this fine conservative tradition going by celebrating together the birth of our nation.</P>
					</P>The shelter at Fort Hunt Park has already been reserved for this year’s Soiree.  Fort Hunt is located on the George Washington Parkway near Mt.Vernon.  It’s a convenient location for everyone.</P>
						</P>Read a list of <A HREF="sponsors.htm"> recent patrons and sponsors</A>.  There’s also a convenient<A HREF="direct.htm"> directions</A> for finding the park.  Feel free to tell your conservative friends about the Soiree and to visit our internet site at <A HREF="http://lead-inst.org">http://www.lead-inst.org</A></P>
								</P>The Soiree is  a uniquley patriotic occassion you and your entire family will remember for years.  For those who want to spread out and enjoy  the company of other conservatives, there is lots of space available at the park.  There are also two volleyball courts and a softball field.</P>

</P>This year we’ll hold a conservative olympics for teams of five to participate in.  So assemble your team today.
There will be a number of activities for the kids again this year.  Ross the Clown was a big hit last year, 
and we’ll try to have him back again.</P>

</P>The very popular Roast Pig, or rather a close descendent, will again be on the menu this year. Last year’s crowd of 
five hundred people dispatched three large hogs.  The Soiree is a cooperative gathering of conservatives.</P>

</P>The heart of the program will feature an old-fashioned political stump speech.  Speeches are seldom considered entetainment in this town, but the Soiree is known for its verbal fireworks.  It’s free, fun, patriotic.  And only once a year.</P>

</P>Please join me in celebrating the Fourth of July at the 25th Annual Conservative Soiree.</P>

</P>Cordially,</P>

<P>

Facts are stubborn things.  I have always liked interesting facts or statistics that aren't readily 
available in the day-to-day news media.  Here's a good sample of what the <i>American Enterprise</i> 
magazine called the 1995 indicators.  It includes statistics that can "change the way you understand 
the world" -- how we vote, how we live, how we do business.
<p><p><ul>
<li><b>How Does Talk Radio Fare?</b>  The most popular radio format in the United States 
today is not the Talk Radio of Rush Limbaugh or the rock of Pearl Jam.  It is <b>country</b> with 
some 2,642 stations nationwide.
<li><b>Is Congress still a Country Club?</b> 27 Black Americans ran for Congress on the 
GOP ticket in 1994.
<li><b>Electoral Politics:</b>  According to the Republican polling firm The Wirthlin Group, a 
September 1995 survey showed that one third of American voters could <b>not recall</b> when 
the next presidential election would occur.
<li><b>Were the '80's the Decade of Greed or Prosperity?</b>  According to our U.S. 
Treasury Department, 86% of those who reported incomes in the bottom fifth in 1980 had moved 
<b>upwards</b> by 1988.  In fact, 16% of them made the jump all the way from the bottom to the 
<b>top income bracket</b>.
<li><b>Hillary and Health Care Costs:</b>  After a year of Hillary-style health care meetings, 
official documents show that the Clinton Health Care Task Force cost slightly more than the 
projected $100,000 dollars -- the tab was actually <b>$14 million.</b>
<li><b>The Republican Party Comes of Age:</b> Almost 65% of registered Republicans are 
<b>under the age of 45</b> according to a 1995 Gallup poll.
<li><b>NAFTA Results:</b>  As of November 1995, 70% of US corporations report that their 
businesses have <b>not been affected</b> by the implementation of NAFTA or GATT.
<li><b>Political Contributors:</b> Only 19% of individuals have ever contributed to a 
<b>political candidate</b> according to a 1995 Gallup poll.
<li><b>What's a political party, dad?</b> According to an August 1995 Gallup poll, in the last 
fifty-five years, nearly 1 of 5 Americans has deserted the traditional party structure -- Democrat 
or Republican -- to become: independent voters.
<li><b>Budget:</b> In the next seven years under the latest GOP plan, the government will spend 
<b>$12 trillion dollars</b> -- only 7% less than when the Democrats ran Congress under the 
direction of then-Speaker Tom Foley and then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell.
<li><b>Competition Is a Good Thing:</b>  According to a government study, the emergence of 
14 new discount airlines has saved consumers an average of <b>$100 dollars</b> per round trip 
airfare.
<li><b>TV Viewing:</b>  Nielson research data reports that the average American woman 
watches almost 4.5 hours of <b>t.v. per day</b>, while men average just short of 4 hours per day.
<li><b>The Cost of Bureaucracy:</b> 75% of the World Health Organization's $1 billion annual 
budget goes to salaries, and much of the remainder goes to conferences.
</ul>
