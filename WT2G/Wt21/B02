               PLANS TO CUTBACK-- BUT 
               NOT SHUTDOWN THE LOCAL 
               PLANT.
                    OFFICIALS SAY 
               PRODUCTION OF WEAPONS AT 
               THE PLANT SHOULD BE 
               REDUCED AS A RESULT OF 
               AN END TO THE COLD WAR.
                    THAT MEANS A 
               POSSIBLE LOSS OF MORE 
               THAN A THOUSAND JOBS BY 
               THE TURN OF THE CENTURY.
                    ALLIED SIGNAL'S 
               DOWNSIZING PLAN IS 
               EXPECTED TO SAVE 
               MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER 
               THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

holyfield      RETIRED FROM BOXING TWO 
               YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF 
               HEART PROBLEMS..
               
SUPE/LAS VEGAS BUT OBVIOUSLY NOTHING 
               WAS WRONG WITH HIS HEART 
               LAST NIGHT..WHEN HE 
               LOCKED UP WITH IRON 
               MIKE.
               TYSON WAS A HEAVY 
               FAVORITE BUT HOLY-FIELD 
               NEARLY WON THE FIGHT IN

               BELL SAVED TYSON..
               
               AND THEN IN THE 11TH, 
               HOLY-FIELD LANDED 9 
               PUNCHES TO THE HEAD AND 
               THE FIGHT WAS STOPPED 
               AFTER 37 SECONDS.

REPORTING             Those convicted

               BUT INSTEAD HE'S OUT FOR 
               THE SEASON.
                 THE SURGERY WAS MORE 
               COMPLICATED THAN 
               EXPECTED--BECAUSE THE

               ANYTHING SO REVERED AS 
               THE AMERICAN POLITICAL 
               PROCESS.
                   IT WAS ABOUT 
               PROFESSIONAL 
               HATE-MONGERS ... AND THE

                        BUT THESE 
               LITTLE VAMPIRES ARE BATS 
               COME LATELY TO THE TALES 
               THAT HAVE INSPIRED 
               MOVIES LIKE DRACULA.
SOT TIMM       "VAMPIRES AS A BAT WERE 
               NOT PART OF THE OLD 
               WORLD LEGENDS.  THERE 
               WERE VAMPIRES BUT THE 
               NOTION OF BLOOD SUCKING 
               DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL 
               SPANIARDS CAME TO THE 
               NEW WORLD AND WERE BIT 
               BY THEM."
DAWSON/TIMM    "ASIDE FROM THE VAMPIRE 
               BATS WILL A BAT BITE ME 
               ON PURPOSE? NO THEY WILL 
               ONLY BITE OUT OF FEAR."
DAWSON/TIMM    "SO SHOULD I BE AFRAID 
               OF A BAT FLYING INTO MY 
               HAIR OR BEARD? NO BATS 
               WON'T GET IN YOUR HAIR 
               OR BEARD."
                      ANOTHER MYTH BATS 
               ARE BLIND.
SOT TIMM       "BATS HAVE EXCELLENT EYE 
               SIGHT THEY USE IT WHILE 
               THEY ARE FLYING AND 
               FORAGING FOR INSECTS."
                        AND THEY ARE SO 
               EFFICIENT YOU MIGHT SAY 
               BATS ARE NOT OUR BUT A

               ..UNTIL ELWAY GOT THE

               THE CHIEFS COULD NOT 
               FIGURE OUT..DENVER'S 
               5-RECEIVER SET..
               
               CHIEFS HAD SOMETHING 
               GOING IN THE SECOND

               BONO TO DANAN

               AND PICKED OFF BY TYRONE 
               BRAXTON.
               BONO NOT A GOOD 
               DAY..PICKED OFF TWICE IN 
               THE END ZONE..

               SECOND QUARTER HE 
               SCRAMBLED OUT OF 
               TROUBLE.
               ELWAY RAN THE BALL  
               TIMES FOR   YARDS 
               TODAY..HIS MOST EVER...
               
               AND THEN HE WAS ALL SET 
               TO BURN THE CHIEFS 
               AGAIN.

               LINUS VAN PELT HAS 
               GOTTEN A LITTLE CARRIED 
CBS 9AM        AWAY PREPARING FOR 
9:41           HALLOWEEN.
                    LINUS ENDS UP IN A 
               PUMPKIN PATCH AWAITING 
               THE ARRIVAL OF "THE

               ACCORDING TO THE LITTLE

               TO ALL CHILDREN.
                    PEANUTS CREATOR 
               CHARLES SCHULTZ FIRST

               LINUS WRITING A LTTER TO 
               THE GREAT PUMPKIN 
               DETAILING A WISH LIST 
               FOR HALLOWEEN.
                    The story appeared 
               annually in the Peanuts 
               strip..and was brought 
               to C-B-S in animated

                    BUT, HERE ARE SOME 
               TIPS TO PROTECT 
               YOURSELF:
                    - BE LEERY OF 
               ANYONE WHO JUST SHOWS UP 
               AT YOUR DOOR...SAYING 
               THEY WERE IN THE 
               NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE WILL 
               BE A LOT OF LEGITIMATE
               CONTRACTORS OUT IN THE 
               NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT BE 
               CAREFUL ABOUT HIRING 
               ANYONE YOU DIDN'T CALL.
                    - IF YOU HIRE 
               SOMEONE WHO DROPS BY, BE 
               SURE TO GET A LICENSE 
               PLATE NUMBER, A PHONE 
               NUMBER AND A BUSINESS 
               ADDRESS. 
                    - DON'T LET ANYONE 
               PRESSURE YOU INTO HIRING 
               THEM RIGHT ON THE SPOT.  
               UNLESS THE TREE IS A 
               THREAT, YOU CAN WAIT.
                    - CHECK YOUR CITY 
               HALL TO SEE IF THE 
               CONTRACTOR IS LICENSED 
               AND BONDED. MANY CITIES 
               REQUIRE THAT.
                    - BE SURE TO GET A 
               WRITTEN CONTRACT AND 
               THAT IT CLEARLY SPELLS 
               OUT THE WORK TO BE DONE, 
               INCLUDING WHICH LIMBS TO 
               BE CUT, THE COST AND IF 
               IT INCLUDES DEBRIS

               REMOVAL.
                    - BE LEERY OF 
               ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'LL 
               TAKE YOU TO THE BANK TO 
               GET MONEY FOR THE 
               REPAIRS. THAT'S A RED 
               FLAG THAT THEY COULD 
               TAKE YOUR MONEY AND RUN.
                    - AND FINALLY, 
               NEVER PAY IN ADVANCE. IF 
               THE CONTRACTOR SAYS HE 
               NEEDS MONEY FOR 
               MATERIALS TO FIX YOUR 
               HOURSE, BUY THEM

WENDALL ONCAM       WE LEAVE YOU 
               TONIGHT WITH A FINAL 
               THOUGHT REGARDING OUR  
               SURPRISE SNOWSTORM.


  renaud                Thu Oct 24 10:06  page  19

                   IT CAME LIKE A BAT 
               OUT OF HELL ... IT 
               TRASHED OUR 
               NEIGHBORHOODS ... LEFT 
               US WITHOUT HEAT AND 
               LIGHTS.
                   BUT YOU KNOW, IT 
               COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.
                   IT MUST BE A BIT OF 
               A MIRACLE THAT ALL THE 
               CHAOS THAT TOOK CONTROL 
               OF OUT LIVES, YESTERDAY 
               --  ALL THE CRACKING 
               LIMBS AND CRASHING CARS 
               -- DIDN'T SERIOUSLY HURT 
               ANYONE.
                   WHAT'S MORE, IT 
               SHOWED US WHAT WE CAN 
               LIVE WITHOUT ... THAT A 
               LIGHT BULB CAN BE 
               REPLACED BY A CANDLE OR 
               A FLASHLIGHT ... A 
               FURNACE BY A DOWN 
               COMFORTER AND WOOL 
               SOCKS. 
                   THAT IN MANY CASES,  
               TRAFFIC LIGHTS CAN BE 
               REPLACED QUITE NICELY 
               ... BY A LITTLE DRIVING 
               COURTESY.
                  THAT WE CAN STAND 
               PATIENTLY IN LINE FOR 45 
               MINUTES ... EVEN WHEN 
               WE'RE WAITING FOR FAST 
               FOOD.
                  THAT OUR LAWNS CAN BE 
               PUT BACK IN ORDER WITH A 
               LITTLE HELP FROM A 
               NEIGHBOR OR A FRIEND.
                   THAT WE ARE NOT AS 
               HELPLESS AS WE MIGHT 
               HAVE THOUGHT ... AND NOT 
               AS QUITE AS INDEPENDENT 
               EITHER.

               AT IT, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T

               SAID ALI MCGRAW -- "IS 
               NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOUR 
               SORRY."

                    LAST WEEK, HILTON

               COFFERS OF THE COMPANY 
               THEY CROSSED IT FOR.
CAM ...            THAT HILTON -- IN 
               THE END -- WILL REAP THE 
               PROFITS FROM THE VERY

                   YOU SEE, IT'S TRUE.
               SO OFTEN, WHERE BIG 
               MONEY IS CONCERNED:"YOU 
               CAN DO WHAT YOU WHATEVER 
               WANT ... IF YOU JUST SAY 
               YOUR SORRY AFTERWARDS."

               CRASH NEAR NEW YORK.
                     Today's 
CNN 130 FEED   "Washington Post" says 
13:35:52       damage patterns in the 
               central fuel tank ...
               suggest a less energetic 
               explosion than a bomb or 
               missile would cause.
                    AND DETECTIVES SAY 
               THEY'VE FOUND NO HARD 
               EVIDENCE THAT POINTS TO 
               FOUL PLAY.
                    BUT, THE 
               INVESTIGATION IS STILL 
               FAR FROM OVER.

REPORTING      few students, others

               expensive to renovate.
                      So the district 
               wants to close seven 
               schools and 
               re-distribute the 
               students so that 
               educational programs 
               would be evenly 
               distributed.
                     And they'd save a 
               lot of money, at a time 
               when student population 
               and school funding are

15:32:34       a battleground in the 
               last three weeks of the 
               election, that is 
               something that I would 
               welcome because I 
               believe the people there 
               are fundamentally fair- 
               minded and 
               forward-looking. And 
               when I became president, 
               California had the 
               weakest economy in the 
               country.  Since I've 
               been president, they've 
               had to endure 
               earthquakes and fires 
               and floods. And in spite 
               of all that, they have 
               shown a remarkable 
               turnaround in so many 
               areas. And I'm very 
               proud of the partnership 
               we have had.  No 
               administration in 
               history has worked as 
               hard on so many fronts

               DOCTOR ALEX VACCARO IS 
               AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON.
                    HE SAYS MANY OF THE 
               BAD BACKS HE SEES COME 
               FROM BAD BEDS.
                    SOME ARE TOO SOFT, 
               SOME TOO HARD. SO HOW DO 
               YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT 
               MATTRESS?
                    WELL, FIRST REALIZE 
               THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL 
               PROBLEM... BEDS ARE 
               FLAT.  YET, AS YOU CAN 
               SEE HERE ON THE LEFT, 
               OUR SPINES ARE CURVED.
SUPER:         "you need to have 
DR. ALEXANDER  appropriate support to 
VACCARO/       maintain your normal 
ORTHOPEDIC     alignment."
SURGEON        APPROPRIATE SUPPORT 
               MEANS THE MATTRESS HAS 
               TO HAVE ENOUGH SPRING TO 
               ALLOW YOUR SPINE TO 
               MAINTAIN IT'S NORMAL

               FIRM, IT WILL FLATTEN 
               OUT YOUR SPINE, CAUSING 
               MUSCLE ACHES.
                    UNFORTUNATELY, THE 
               LABELS ON MATTRESSES... 
               SOFT, FIRM, 
               ORTHOPEDIC... DON'T MEAN 
               MUCH BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 
               STANDARDIZED.
                    EXPERTS SAY FINDING 
               THE BEST MATTRESS MEANS 
               TESTING IT FOR TEN 
               MINUTES AND SEEING IF 
               YOUR BACK HURTS.

               BECAUSE THEY DON'T GIVE 
               ENOUGH SUPPORT.
                         THEY ALSO 
               RECOMMEND FLIPPING YOUR

               PROSPORT BOOKED AN

                    BUT, WE'VE LEARNED 
               PROSPROT DID PAY WESTERN 
               PACIFIC AIRLINE TO FLY 
               A GROUP TO THE GAME IN 
               DENVER. 
                    BUT, THAT AIRLINE 
               SAYS PROSPORT DIDN'T 
               PROVIDE A PASSENGER 
               LIST, SO THE AIRLINE 
               DOESN'T KNOW WHO'S 
               BOOKED ON THE FLIGHT.
                    WE ALSO LEARNED 
               PROSPORT OWES MONEY TO 
               HOTELS IN DENVER AND 
               MINNEAPOLIS...SO FANS 
               COULD LOSE THEIR ROOMS.
                    GREEN SAYS HE'S HAD 
               ENOUGH AND PLANS TO 
               QUIT...LEAVING NO ONE TO 
               RUN THE COMPANY.

                    SO, IF YOU BOOKED A 
               TRIP THROUGH PROSPORT, 
               OUR ADVICE IS TO:
                    - CONTACT YOUR

                    - CONTACT THE 
               HOTELS AND SEE IF THEY 
               HAVE YOUR RESERVATIONS.  
                    - CONTACT THE

               THEN SHARES A BAG OF

                    THAT FRIEND NOW HAS 
               HEPATITIS.

LIGHTER SIDE        ONE MAN HAS FOUND 
               WHAT THE GERMANS AND THE

                    HE TURNED UP HIDDEN
               TREASURE NEAR THE CITY 
               OF DRESDEN THAT HAD BEEN

*VTR VO             ONE OF GERMANY'S 
SUPER:         WEALTHIEST FAMILIES

               TO STEAL THE TREASURE 
               BUT FOUND ONLY A SMALL 
               PART OF IT.
                    THEN AFTER THE WAR, 
               THE OWNERS TRIED TO FIND 
               THE REST BUT LOST TRACK 
               OF THE LOCATION.
                    FINALLY THIS WEEK, 
               A CURIOUS MAN WITH A

               MORE THAN 6-THOUSAND 
               STUDENTS..PRIMARILY 
               BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE 
               MOVING AWAY..
               AND SINCE THE DISTRICT 
               RECEIVES 36-HUNDRED 
               DOLLARS PER STUDENT IN 
               STATE AID, THE 
               DISTRICT'S LOST AN 
               ESTIMATED 21-MILLION 
               DOLLARS.
                         AND WHILE THE 
               SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS SAY 
               THEY HAVE WORKED LONG 
               HOURS TO COME UP WITH A 
               SOLUTION.. PARENTS SAY 
               THE CUTS CAN COME FROM

                 THE IDEA IS TO CLOSE

               REQUIRE A LOT OF

COCA COLA           A HIGH DOLLAR 
               BEVERAGE BATTLE IS 
               HEATING UP.
                    THE GREAT GRANDSON 
               OF ONE OF COCA-COLA'S 
               FOUNDERS SAYS HE WANTS 
               TO SELL WHAT HE CLAIMS 
               TO BE THE ORIGINAL 
               FORMULA.
                   FRANK ROBINSON SAYS 
               HE'LL SELL IT BECAUSE HE 
               NEEDS THE MONEY.
                     BUT HIS ESTRANGED 
               WIFE ALSO WANTS IN ON 
               THE DEAL.
                     SHE CLAIMS TO ALSO 
               HAVE THE RECIPE .. AND 
               WILL GIVE IT UP FOR A 
               PRICE.
                    THE COCA COLA 
               COMPANY ITSELF SAYS THE  
               BATTLE IS ALL FOR 
               NOTHING BECAUSE THE 
               ROBINSON RECIPE IS A 
               FAKE.

LIGHTER SIDE        THE PAINTING THAT'S

               OF PRINCESS DIANA.

Tracy:  MEANWHILE, WENDALL IS STILL POURING OVER THE RESULTS OF LAST WEEK'S REPUBLICAN CONVENTION IN SAN DIEGO. THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF HIS COMMENTARY.<P>
<P>
<P>
WENDALL:  TRACY, WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHAT KIND OF "BOUNCE" <P>
BOB DOLE TOOK IN THE POLLS.  IT SHOULDN'T BE HARD, OF COURSE ... BECAUSE -- AS ANY POLSTER WILL TELL YOU -- THEIR ABILITY TO MEASURE BOUNCE, THESE DAYS, IS ALMOST UNCANNY.  TAKE A-B-C'S POLL, FOR EXAMPLE. IT SAYS BOB DOLE NARROWED THE GAP TO JUST FOUR POINTS OF CATCHING BILL CLINTON.<P>
<P>
AND THEY'RE SO GOOD AT MEASURING BOUNCES ... THAT THEY KNOW THEY'VE NAILED THE MARGIN TO WITHIN THREE-AND-A-HALF POINTS, PLUS OR MINUS .. OF HOW WE ALL WOULD VOTE.  AND IF YOU THINK THEY'RE GOOD, WHAT ABOUT THE IMPOSING TROIKA OF <P>
CNN/USA TODAY/GALLOP.  THEY FIND A MARGIN OF SEVEN POINTS BETWEEN THE TWO TOP CONTENDERS ... AND GUESS WHAT. THEIR MARGIN OF ERROR IS ONLY THREE POINTS <P>
PLUS-OR-MINUS.  AND THAT SAME DEGREE OF ACCURACY IS TOUTED BY THE DYNAMIC DUO OF C-B-S AND THE NEW YORK TIMES ... WHO FIND THE CANDIDATES 12 POINTS APART.<P>
<P>
BUT YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PART I CAN'T FIGURE OUT.  ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THOSE THREE POLLS TOGETHER ... TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S MORE THAN THREE-AND-A-HALF POINTS OFF.  SO IF ALL THOSE EXPERTS ARE SO ACCURATE IN TELLING US HOW WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ... WHY DID THEY ALL COME UP WITH DIFFERENT ANSWERS.

TRACY:      ALL OF SUDDEN, WE ALL GOT EXCITED ABOUT SPACE AGAIN ... AND ALL<P>
BECAUSE OF A ROCK ... THAT CONVINCED NASA SCIENTISTS THAT THERE HAD ONCE BEEN <P>
LIFE ON MARS.  OF COURSE, THE EVIDENCE WASN'T CONCLUSIVE ... BUT THIS WEEK'S COMMENTARY, WENDALL REMEMBERS A TIME WHEN YOU COULDN'T EVEN SUGGEST IT.<P>
<P>
<P>
WENDALL:  TRACY, WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN THE '40'S... THE POSSIBILTY OF<P>
LIFE ON MARS WAS THE MOST COMPELLING MYSTERY OF THE DAY.<P>
<P>
BUT AMONG US KIDS YOU SEE, WE KNEW ALOT MORE ABOUT MARS THAN ADULTS ...  BECAUSE WE STUDIED ABOUT IT ...IN COMIC BOOKS. OF COURSE, WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO READ COMIC BOOKS ... BECAUSE GROWNUPS REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THEM.<P>
<P>
AND MY SIXTH-GRADE TEACHER -- MISS GROVE -- UTTERLY DESPISED THEM.  TO HER COMICS WERE ACADEMICALLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND SO WAS ANY SUGGESTION OF SPACE <P>
TRAVEL OR LIFE ON MARS.  <P>
<P>
SCIENTISTS HAD NO TIME TO CONSIDER TRASH LIKE THAT, SHE SAID. BESIDES, IT WAS <P>
IMPOSSIBLE.  AND WITH THAT, SHE BANDED ALL SUCH TALK FROM THE CLASSROOM.<P>
<P>
[ON TAPE] ("THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR A MAN. ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.")<P>
<P>
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHERE MISS GROVE WAS THE DAY WE LANDED ON THE MOON. BUT I SURE WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE.  BECAUSE THAT WAS THE DAY I STOPPED BELIEVING THAT GROWNUPS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT AND KIDS ARE ALWAYS WRONG.<P>
<P>
IT WAS ALSO THE DAY I REALIZED THAT TO CLOSE YOUR MIND TO ANYTHING ... IS TO SHUT OUT A WHOLE UNIVERSE.  NOT TO SAY MISS GROVE WASN'T A GOOD TEACHER.  SHE WAS A GOOD TEACHER.  AND MY SIXTH-GRADE SCIENCE BOOK WAS ONE OF THE BEST <P>
THINGS I EVER READ. <P>
<P>
WHY IT WAS RIGHT UP THERE WITH BUCK ROGERS.

WHETHER THEY MEANT TO OR NOT ... THE SENIORS TOURNEY AND THE P-G-A HAVE ABANDONED SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY NEEDED THEM. <P>
<P>
REMEMBER 1994?   THAT'S THE YEAR WE LEARNED THAT KANSAS CITY WAS LOSING ITS SENIORS TOURNEY ... BECAUSE SOUTHWESTERN BELL WAS DROPPING ITS SPONSORSHIP <P>
AND NO OTHER SENIORS CORPORATION IN TOWN WANTED TO PICK IT UP.<P>
<P>
BUT WE DIDN'T LOSE THE SENIORS.  BECAUSE AT LAST MINUTE, A MOST UNLIKELY HERO STEPPED FORWARD.  NOT A PHONE COMPANY OR A GOLF-BALL MANUFACTURER ... BUT THE <P>
V-F-W. A NOT-FOR-PROFIT VETERANS ORGANIZATION ... WHICH WAS SIMPLY LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR. THE EX-GI'S ONLY ASKED THAT THE P-G-A NOT <P>
SCHEDULE THE TOURNEY ON ITS SACRED DATES ... MEMORIAL DAY ... AND THE <P>
FOURTH OF JULY ... AND THE DATE OF ITS NATIONAL VFW CONVENTION.<P>
<P>
BUT OF ALL THE 44 WEEKENDS AVAILABLE, FOR NEXT YEAR ... THE P-G-A SUGGESTED AUGUST 18TH ... THE CONVENTION DATE.<P>
<P>
AND EVEN THOUGH TOURNEY ORGANIZER JIM KLINE HAD FIVE WEEKS TO CONSIDER THE DATE ... HE ADMITS HE DIDN'T MENTION IT TO THE V-F-W UNTIL IT WAS SET IN STONE.<P>
<P>
HE JUST FOULED-UP, HE SAYS. IT'S ALL HIS FAULT, BUT THE DAMAGE IS AS IT TURNS OUT, KLINE WORKS FOR THE NEW SPONSOR: ST. LUKE'S/SHAWNEE-MISSION HEALTH SYSTEM.<P>
<P>
AND AS POPULAR AS THE SENIORS IS NOW ... WHO KNOWS HOW MANY OTHERS ARE WAITING IN LINE. <P>
<P>
BUT NO MATTER WHO SPONSORS THE TOURNEY THE REAL HONOR WILL ALWAYS GO TO THE V-F-W.  THEY DIDN'T JUST SPONSOR IT THEY BROUGHT IT BACK FROM THE DEAD.<P>

<P>
DATE June 7th, 1996<P>
<P>
TRACY:   THERE WAS ONLY ONE STORY IN KANSAS CITY THIS WEEK: THE <P>
UNCEREMONIOUS FIRING OF WALT BODINE BY PUBLIC RADIO STATION K-C-U-R.<P>
<P>
TWO SHOT TRACY:    EVERYONE HAS HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT <P>
IT ... AND IN TONIGHT'S COMMENTARY, WENDALL OFFERS HIS TWO BITS.<P>
<P>
WENDALL:     TRACY, I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S LEFT TO SAY AFTER EVERYTHING EVERYONE ELSE HAS SAID, THISWEEK. K-C-U-R MANAGEMENT CERTAINLY GOT AN EARFUL. NO ONE HAS SUFFERED THAT MUCH VERBAL ABUSE ... SINCE LINN ELLIOT MISSED ALL THOSE FIELD GOALS.<P>
 <P>
I AM LEFT WITH NOTHING TO SAY ... BECAUSE THIS COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY SAID IT.<P>
ALL THOSE PHONE CALLS TO K-C-U-R SAID IT, AND THOSE PICKETS OUTSIDE SAID IT:<P>
[ON TAPE] ('HE'S AN INSTITUTION, YOU KNOW.")<P>
<P>
ALL THOSE LETTERS TO EDITOR SAID IT, "HAPPY MEMORIES TO WALT BODINE. YOU HAVE <P>
GIVEN MUCH TO KANSAS EVEN THE FIERCELY COMPETITIVE MEDIA SAID IT, "HE MANAGED TO PENETRATE POMPOSITY ... KNIFE UNDER LAYERS OF PRETENSION ... AND REVEAL LAYERS OF TRUTH. [ON TAPE] ("I GUESS THE BIGGEST SHOCK TO ME WAS THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT.")<P>
<P>
AND IF YOU'VE GOTTA PACK IT UP... IN THE END IT DOESN'T MAKE A RIP WHAT MANAGEMENT THINKS.  ALL THAT REALLY COUNTS IS WHAT YOUR LISTENERS THINK. THEIR DEVOTION IS SHAPED -- NOT BY RATINGS OR RESEARCH -- BUT BY WHAT THEY HEAR ON THE RADIO. WORDS THAT TURN INTO THOUGHTS THAT LEAD TO KNOWLEDGE AND <P>
APPRECIATION AND UNDERSTANDING ... AND MAKE WALT BODINE'S CONTRIBUTION TO HIS <P>
COMMUNITY ... NOT JUST TALK RADIO ... BUT A BODY OF WORK.<P>
<P>
SO WALT, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?<P>

<P>
<P>
DATE 960607 <P>
<P>
OBVIOUSLY, THE EASTSIDE HAS PROBLEMS. BUT IN TONIGHT'S COMMENTARY ... WENDALL SAYS THE KIND OF OUTBURST WE SAW LAST SATURDAY ... ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE.<P>
<P>
Wendall:<P>
THOSE ROCK-AND-BOTTLE THROWERS WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK THEY WERE TAKING A STAND AGAINST THE HEAVY-HANDEDNESS OF A PREDOMINATELY WHITE POLICE FORCE.<P>
BUT THERE WAS NO NOBILITY IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING BECAUSE THOSE WHO THREW THE ROCKS, LAST WEEKEND ... ARE A DISCREDIT TO ANY RACE.<P>
 <P>
THE MAYOR IS RIGHT, OF COURSE. WHAT WE SAW IN ACTION SATURDAY NIGHT WASN'T A RACE-RIOT. IT WAS A MINDLESS EXERCISE IN DEFIANCE BY THE "LOW-LIFE" FRINGE.<P>
<P>
NO ONE ELSE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY WANTED ANY PART OF IT. AND IF ANYTHING GOOD CAME FROM THAT PATHETIC EXHIBITION OF FALSE BRAVADO, I THINK IT'S <P>
THIS:  IT ISOLATED FOR ALL TO SEE ... THAT POCKET OF TOUBLEMAKERS THAT HOUNDS THE GOOD PEOPLE OF KANSAS CITY'S YOUTH.   LOOK AT THEIR FACES AND ASK YOURSELF ...<P>
 <P>
DO YOU THINK ANY OF THESE YOUNGSTERS WAS AMONG THE LEGIONS OF EASTSIDERS WHO HAVE SPENT THEIR WEEKENDS CLEANING UP TRASH-STREWN STREETS. <P>
<P>
DO YOU THINK THEY WERE EVER AMONG THOSE BRAVE EASTSIDERS WHO MARCHED -- UNARMED -- AGAINST THE DRUG HOUSES?  WOULD YOU GUESS THAT EVEN ONE OF THESE <P>
YOUNGSTERS EVER LIFTED A HAND -- LIKE THESE YOUNSTERS ARE DOING  --TO PUT THINGS BACK?    HOW MANY DO YOU THINK GO TO SCHOOL ... OR HAVE A JOB ... OR  <P>
EVER PLAN TO GET ONE?<P>
<P>
AND ONE MORE QUESTION. WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE ... WHEN THEIR NEIGHBORS CAME DOWN TO 27TH AND BENTON, THIS WEEK ... AND CLEANED-UP <P>
AFTER THEM?<P>

<!-- WARNING! CGI Coding - DO NOT DAMAGE! -->
<P>
DATE May 5th, 1996 <P>
<P>
TRACY:     DEVELOPERS WANTED ANOTHER NEW STORE IN A POPULAR JOHNSON COUNTY <P>
SHOPPING DISTRICT .. BUT THIS WEEK NEIGHBORS CONVINCED THE CITY TO SAY "NO".<P>
IT'S THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS SHOT DOWN IN THAT AREA.<P>
SOME THOUGHTS ON THE TREND TONIGHT ... IN WENDALL'S COMMENTARY.<P>
<P>
<P>
WENDALL:     TRACY, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH SUCCESS. BUT YOU CAN HAVE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT BOTH RESIDENTS AND THE OVERLAND PARK CITY COUNCIL WERE TELLING DEVELOPERS AT MONDAY NIGHT'S MARATHON COUNCIL MEETING.<P>
<P>
IN A PHRASE: ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. ROSANNA SQUARE TRAFFIC WAS BAD AROUND 119TH AND METCALF WHEN ROSANNA SQUARE OPENED ... BUT THE INDIVIDUAL NUMBER OF STORES JUST GREW ... AND GREW ... AND GREW. UNTIL TODAY, IT IS NON-STOP RUSH HOUR.<P>
<P>
AND 119TH IN FRONT OF A NEARBY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS A FREEWAY. THE CITY HAD <P>
PROVIDED PLENTY OF ROOM FOR COMMERICAL DEVELOPMENT ... MAYBE TOO MUCH. JUST LOOK AT ALL THAT RED ON THE ZONING MAP.  BUT DEVELOPERS WANTED MORE.  SO THEY <P>
ASKED FOR A CHUNK OF THE ADJACENT OFFICE-ZONING TO BUILD A SUPER-TARGET <P>
STORE. <P>
<P>
NOW I ASK YOU ...  IS THERE ANY PLACE IN THE WORLD THAT NEEDS ANOTHER GIANT STORE IT ALREADY HAS A GIANT SPORTS STORE ... AND A GIANT COMPUTER STORE ... AND A GIANT ELECTRONICS STORE ... AND A GIANT BOOKSTORE ... AND A GIANT BATHROOM STORE ... AND GIANT DEPARTMENT STORE .. AND A GIANT GENERAL STORE <P>
... AND TWO GIANT MOVIE HOUSES. SO IF IT'S QUALITY OF LIFE YOU WANT ... <P>
INSTEAD OF MAKING A BUCK ... WHO NEEDS MORE. <P>
<P>
<P>
I THINK THAT'S WHY WHEN RESIDENTS OF OVERLAND PARK AND THEIR COUNCIL SAID "NO" THIS WEEK -- THEIR REAL MESSAGE TO DEVELOPERS WAS "ENOUGH."                       <P>
<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFE8">M</FONT>One of the worst things we parents can imagine is losing a child. <BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFE8">M</FONT>When any child is abducted or runs away from home, it's a nightmare for all parents. Stories of abducted children are regularly told on the evening news and in magazines and newspapers. Shadowy news videos show runaways, huddled in city bus stations or grungy alleyways, wreathed in smog and cigarette smoke, threatened by leering passersby in flashy cars. <BR>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFE8">M</FONT>One of the telephone companies has been advertising a toll-free hotline for runaways. "Mom, I want to come home," says the young teenager in a shaky voice into the pay phone receiver. The warm-voiced narrator reassures us that now everything will be fine. The phone company will help.<I> <A HREF="missingkids.html">Continued</I></a><P></blockquote>

WebPointers Online is the World Wide Web home page for the WebPointers columns carried in your local newspaper.<p>

Here you will find the WebPointers columns being published this week and an archive of previous columns that have been published. The great advantage of WebPointers Online is that the web sites mentioned in our columns are presented here with "active hyperlinks": text that is underlined and usually presented in a bright blue color. <P>

You may click on any hyperlink and your web browser should take you directly to that web site. You can examine the site to check details we have described and go on to further explorations. It is this ability to hyperlink to other sites, and gain serendipitous exposure to new information that makes this revolutionary new technology so powerful and appealing. Whenever you find a web site that you would like to return to, you may "Bookmark" it, add it to your "Hotlist," or otherwise save the location depending on your browser's terminology. This is a very handy feature that eliminates the need for you to remember all the "http:gobbledygook" that is the present means of identifying web sites.<P>


We have designed our pages to be best viewed with the Netscape Navigator browser and have provided a hyperlink to their site where you can download the current version for free personal use. We encourage you to do so. If you are accessing the Internet with one of the popular online services that does not yet support Netscape you may want to consider subscribing to an independent Internet Service Provider (ISP) in addition to your online service. You may search <a href="http://www.thelist.com">here</a> for known ISPs by country, state, area code and local exchange. If you are already using an ISP you may want to compare prices with others who have may recently entered the market.<P>

You can see from our Index that WebPointers Online has gathered a wealth of other resources for you to explore. If you know of other sites that you think we should add, please let us know. If you have suggestions for our columns or thoughts about WebPointers generally we'd be glad to hear from you. You may always send us feedback by <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">email</a>.<P>


You may always go back to the previous page by clicking on the "Back" button on the screen menu of your browser. You may also click on the "Back" hand below to return to WebPointers front page, or the "Next" hand" to proceed to the next. <P>

(If you return to our front page, now would be a good time to experiment with bookmarks. Move your cursor up to "Bookmark" on the menu bar and click on "Add Bookmark." The next time you want to visit WebPointers you can click on your Bookmarks, pull down the menu bar and click on "WebPointers." You browser will bring up our front page. Remember this simple technique for other web sites you want to return to on a regular basis.)<P><P>

Welcome! You're on the verge of a great adventure. You're going to have a wonderful and rewarding time. You may think of yourself as a complete novice but you're already in the vanguard of the information age.<p><p>Your successful navigation to this page means you are already skilled in the basic functions of computer use: <p><LI>you know how to turn on the power switch<LI>you know how to connect to the internet with your modem<LI>you know how to type<LI>you know how to move and click a mouse<LI>you know there is a wealth of information on the World Wide Web and you're willing to exert the effort to learn how to get it<p><p>Bravo! You've joined the top 1/2 % of the humans on the planet (at the beginning of 1996) who are beginning to take advantage of this revolutionary technology. (And you thought you were a beginner. ;-)<p><p>
Please keep in mind four simple but important concepts:<P><LI>all those who consider themselves "experts", "techno-wizards", "net-heads", "internauts" (or whatever the current jargon may be) ... all of them started exactly where you did; they are only a little ahead of you on the learning curve.<LI>they all learned how to get around on this amazing web of information just like you're doing: one step at a time;<LI>the information available is changing daily and the technology for accessing it, or retrieving it, is changing just as fast; all of us have to learn new things every day.<LI>the more you use the Web, the more you will learn about it and the easier it will become to get value from the time you invest in the effort; consider it an adventure and enjoy yourself.<p><p>The most important concept to master on the World Wide Web is "hyperlinking." When you see a word or words that are underlined and in a different color than the rest of the text, you have the opportunity to link to another document or source of information that is connected to that underlined text. Move your mouse so that the cursor on your screen is positioned above that text. The cursor changes from an arrow to an icon of a hand with a pointing finger (just like WebPointers' hand.) When you click on the linked text under the pointing hand icon, your computer's web browser will load the new file and it will appear on your screen. If there are a lot of graphics in the new file, or if you have a slow modem connection, it may take a period of many seconds or minutes to load the new file.<p><p>Occasionally the link may not work and you will see some sort of ominous error message on your screen. Don't be alarmed. Some links will be discontinued. Some will have changed location. Some may have been programmed improperly. It happens. It's part of the adventure. Go on to the next link and continue your explorations.<p><p>WebPointers is dedicated to exploring the Web and explaining what is out there to the general public. We are not writing for the experts. If we get too far over your head  please send us an <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">email</a> and bring us back to earth. <p><p>

There. Did you notice that hyperlink on the word "email"? If you clicked on that, your web browser should have brought up a pre-addressed letter form to send us an email. Your cursor has now changed to the familiar bar that indicates you can type in your message. If you want to practice right now, how about telling us the name of your local newspaper where you read  the <b>WebPointers</b> column or tell us how you heard about us. Go ahead and type it in. Then move your cursor up to the empty bar that says "Subject" and type in a word that indicates what your message is about. Next, move your cursor up to the top where a little icon says "Send." In a few moments the letter form will disappear and your message has been sent. That's all there is to it. <p><p>You've sent an email. Congratulations! You're not really a "Beginner" anymore, are you?<p><p>

<font size=5><center><b>Pointing the Way on The Web<P></b></center><Font size=4>
The use of the Internet and the number of sites on the World Wide Web is growing exponentially. As more people become aware of the Web, and begin to access the Internet, the need for understanding and information about it increases dramatically.<p>
We believe the best way to provide that information is through our regular columns in general circulation newspapers coupled to our site on the World Wide Web which serves as a general resource for our readers. As one of our early advisors said <i>"Everyone knows how to go to a movie. I want to know which one to go to."</i><P>
We developed <b>WebPointers</B> as the first syndicated newspaper column for the general reader which is devoted exclusively to the World Wide Web. <b>WebPointers</b> columns are gentle excursions into the  exciting and rapidly-evolving world of electronic information. In this regular series of short adventures we introduce you to specific areas of the World Wide Web, increasing your knowledge and ability to explore on your own.
Think of us as your guides, pointing the way. Follow us or go off your own. <p>
Come back and join us for each new excursion. <p>
WebPointers columns are <a href="archives.html">archived</a> each week after they have appeared in print. Don't worry if you miss a column in your local newspaper. You can find it here on our Web page.<P>
Return to us week to week and pick up the trail. Please feel free to pass on our address to your friends and colleagues. If you enjoy yourself and would like to follow us on a more timely basis please recommend <B>WebPointers</B> to your local <a href="papers.html">newspaper</a> where these columns are available on a more timely  basis. <p>
These pages will be updated weekly as we add new material to our archives. They will also evolve over time as we make improvements and take advantage of new developments in technology. <P>The appearance of our <img src="WebPointer.gif"> logo  and the blinking keywords <B><blink>NEWS FLASH! </B></blink> will indicate something new that's worth noting.<P>
In addition to the column archives we will maintain Pointers to many other sources of information which you may find valuable. <P>Look in our Index for topics of interest.


WebPointers appreciates its readers' opinions and will respond from time to time with columns devoted to your helpful suggestions. You can send your questions, comments, criticisms or pointers to our editors by <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">email</a>.

<center><font size=6><B> * T H E * F A Q S *</B></font size><BR>
<HR>
<I>Frequently Asked Questions</I><BR>
<HR></center>

<font size =2> (WebPointers receives questions from readers all across the country and posts those that have a general application to this page. If you have a question, please feel free to <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">email</a> it to us. Don't worry about appearing dumb in print (we'll leave that to the politicians.) WebPointers doesn't use names on the FAQ sheet. Please consider the advice we used to give Journalism students "There's no such thing as an indiscreet question, only an indiscreet answer."<P><center>
<img src=line.gif></center><BR>
<font size=4><B>How do you learn all this techno-babble that "internauts" use?</b><BR>
<font size =3>WebPointers tries to avoid the use of all technical jargon in its columns.  However, if you really want to know the difference between http and html, moo, mpeg and sgml we recommend you look at the <a href="http://www.matisse.net/files/glossary.html">glossary</a> maintained by Internet Literacy Consultants. Once you've memorized all these terms and added them to your everday vocabulary, don't be surprised if your friends' eyes glaze over when you trot out your newfound knowledge.<P>

<font size=4><B>Who invented the World Wide Web?</b><BR>
<font size =3>Credit for the invention of the World Wide Web goes to a brilliant young Englishman, Timothy Berners-Lee, a graduate of Queens College, Cambridge who is now with the Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href="http://web.mit.edu">(MIT)</a> in Boston where he directs the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3</a> Consortium.

According to popular lore, Tim read a book called "Enquire Within: A Compendium of All Known Knowledge" and conjured up the idea of using newly-invented computer hypertext language to create his own program for storing and retrieving information using random associations. It's just the sort of thing you'd expect a physics graduate to do isn't it? Ten years later, working at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, he proposed his system to the scientific community as a  means of efficiently exchanging scientific information. He started his work in October, 1990 and by the end of December it was up and running on the Internet. The rest, as they say, is history.<BR>
Oh yes, that book he read? It was first published in 1858. WebPointers doesn't know which is more remarkable: that it took so long for the first idea to germinate or that English physics graduates are reading text books that 120 years old.<P>

<B>Why do you recommend the Netscape Navigator? Do they pay you, or do you own stock in the company?</b><BR>

<font size =3>WebPointers owns no stock in <a href="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> and is not paid for recommending that you use it. We recommend it because it works, works well, and keeps getting better. Best of all, it is free for personal non-commercial use. You can download it from the World Wide Web by clicking on the button we provide on our front page; once you've installed it on your computer you can access its handbook whenever you're connected online or print it out on your home printer for easier reference. You can also buy the software with complete manuals at most computer software stores.<BR>
One note: Netscape has become a very big program: now about 2.6 MB. If you have a 28.8  modem it will take at least 15 minutes to download. At 14.4 it will take almost twice as long. At 9600 ... well, you get the idea. Don't try it unless you've got something else to do while you're computer is tied up.<P>

<font size=4><B>What is a web site?</b><BR>

<font size=3>A web site is any specific location on the World Wide Web that provides information. You are presently reading this on the web site maintained by WebPointers. If you have clicked on one of the many links on our pages you have gone to another web site. There are literally millions of web sites now and their number is growing every day.<P>

<font size=4><B>What's a home page? And how do I make one?</b><BR>

<font size=3>A Home Page is the first page (generally) that appears on a web site. Other pages are related to the home page in a parent-child hierarchy. Many individuals (particularly students who are learning about computer programming and the World Wide Web) create home pages as experiments. Some are quite good, and then again ... some are rather like those experiments you made when you first started in the kitchen.<BR>
If you would like to make a <a href="http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/HomePages.html">home page</a> we recommend you talk to some friendly teenagers. They probably already know how and they'll show you free. You can also take courses at your local community college, jump into online discussion groups, get help from an online serivce technician or actually pay one of the many, many new companies that are marketing their services. No, sorry, WebPointers does not help people make home pages.<P>

<font size=4><B>If I'm online, am I a host?</b><BR>
<font size=3>If you're online you are not a host but a user. The techies would say that your computer is a client and the host computer that you're using to access the Internet is the server and the computer that is sending the information to your server is the host. (WebPointers thinks that's how it works.)<P>

<font size=4><B>How do I access all the juicy information about me?</b><BR>
<font size=3>It depends on how "juicy" your information is. If your name happens to be <a href="http://blake.oit.unc.edu/~steph/reagan/">Ronald Reagan</a> you only have to enter your name in most search engines and they will return a huge amount of information; (most of it will likely be about that other Ronald Reagan, though.) If you're looking for something specific in the way of your tax returns or social security contributions you're going to have to go through multiple layers of Privacy Act restrictions so it may not be available. Just because the information is on a computer somewhere doesn't mean you can get it.<P><P>

<HR=2>
<font size=4>
<img src="wonk.gif" width=261 height=415 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

OOOps.<P>

Sooo sorreee.<P>

Did we tell you about the physical exam? Yes. It's time to have a little look-see. Now don't be embarassed. There's nothing we haven't seen before.<P>

But you thought this was the WebPointers Weekly Web Wonk Contest Page? <I>(Try to say that quickly three times without sputtering.)</I><P>

It is. You see, right now, our contest involves a little examination on your part and a little examination on our part. This is how it works: if you read this week's columns carefully you'll find the answers to all this week's questions.  A new Weekly Web Wonk Contest goes up every Monday afternoon. <P>


Congratulations Webbie! Weekly Web Wonk Extraordinaire!<P>

That's right, she did it again. And she did it by reading diligently all three columns and following the links.<P>

The Webmaster wants to emphasize that the answers to all the questions are in the columns... not just out in the ether. (Yes, tdmagli, that means you:  and no, Pinocchio did not lead by a nose in the race to romance.)<P>

On to to this week's quiz:<P>

THE QUESTIONS:  <blockquote>

(1) A green teddy-bear hugging a globe is the logo for what?<P>

(2) The saleswoman "who would phone my mother" worked where?<P>

(3) Where do you find an "absurdity check"?<P>


</blockquote>

Yep. That's it. End of Quiz.
<P>

Cheers and The Blessing!<P>

Send us an <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">email</a> with the words "Weekly Web Wonk" in the subject line and your answers in the message. Please include your full name, snail-mail address and the name of your hometown newspaper. <I>(No. It doesn't have to be a newspaper that carries WebPointers columns.)</I><P>

<img src="tj.gif" align=left> We will award a very special prize to the winner and provide fame and glory in this space next week. Fame and glory? Well, all right then: how about fame and glory and a small portrait of our third president (that great writer and educator who was born nearby in the James River Valley)? <P><I>(Did you know that Thos. Jefferson was actually wearing his fox-hunting 'pink' coat when his photo was taken?)</I><P>

In the case of multiple correct entries, the winner will be determined by earliest email transmission. So get out your glasses and start looking.  <P>

A wealth of media resources is available on the World Wide Web. A few of those which might be of special interest to journalists include:<P><P><HR>
WIRE SERVICES<P>

<a href="http://www.trib.com/NEWS/"> The Associated Press.</a> This is the major wire service which provides news to newspapers, television and radio stations across the country. Go here to catch the latest breaking news stories.<P><P>

<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/">Reuters.</a> This is the world's biggest wire service and supplies news feeds to media around the globe. Check their coverage against the stories moving on the AP wire.<P><P>
<HR>
<img src="cnd.gif"><a href="http://nytsyn.com/cgi-bin/times/lead/go"> Computer News Daily</a> is where we go when we want to keep up with newspaper columns about computers, hardware, software, vaporware ... A division of the New York Times, this provides a good snapshot of what's being covered around the country at individual newspapers.<BR=clear><P>

<img src="webed.gif"><a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/"> Editor & Publisher </a> is the industry source for news about the newspaper business. As the industry begins to change it seems only proper that the venerable old E&P should introduce a "cyber lite" version for the new generation. More importantly, this is the source of Steve Outings's extraordinarily valuable daily column "Stop The Presses."<P><P>

<img src="elctline.gif"><a href="http://www.electionline.com/"> Election Line</a> is promising to be an indispensable tool for the next presidential election. This is not just the polls and the opinions of pundits. This may become the treasure trove of every "truth squad" that ever tried to sway a campaign. If a candidate says something on an issue it will be archived here; and everything else he said will be here too; and all accessible. Go ahead, read my lips...<P><P>

<img src="elib.gif"><a href="http://www.elibrary.com/"> The Electric Library</a> is a new entrant into the search engine field but it offers a wonderful plain grammar enquiry mode and searches hundreds of daily newspapers and magazines. What was that quote you were looking for? <P><P>

<img src="fec1.jpg"><a href="http://www.fec.gov"> The Federal Election Commission</a> has now placed all that hard to find financial dope on the Web. You don't have to file a Freedom of Information Act request anymore to find out who funds your candidates and how much they've spent to get your votes. You want to know how much money the PACs gave the presidential bagmen? How much the candidates themselves invested? You want to know your own state's stats? It's all here; have a look. <P><P>

<img src="typwrtr.gif"><a href="http://www.dgsys.com/~editors/"> Internet Newsroom</a>  is the web site of the monthly newsletter of the same name published by Editor's Service. The site includes an archive of previous articles, a current sample, and a downloadable Adobe Acrobat.pdf format file of their printed newsletter. Valuable url references for editors and reporters.<P><P>

<img src="snpa.gif"><a href="http://www.snpa.org/resources/resources.html"> Internet Resources for Journalists</a> is a reference site sponsored by the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association. It may be a bit heavy for the casual reader but it should be helpful if you're a young journalist wanting to get up to speed.<P><P>

<img src="nicar.gif"><a href="http://nicar.org/"> The National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting</a> (NICAR) is a terrific boon for all newspapers. "Nicarians" as they call themselves are on the bleeding edge of making this New Media work for a living. This is where reporters can find out things they can't find out anywhere else, and how to make their computers do more than just type.<P><P>

<img src="presclub.gif"><a href="http://town.hall.org/places/npc/"> The National Press Club</a> in Washington has been made famous for its famous speakers lunches broadcast on National Public Radio. Its continues to be a convenient place for reporters and editors to get together near the White House and this website points the way to lots of useful resources including, of course, those transcripts and audio files of Press Club lunches.<P><P>

<img src="npr.gif"><a href="http://www.realaudio.com/contentp/npr.html"> National Public Radio.</a> This is the web site for NPR's popular radio programs. You can download the free software RealAudio and listen to current broadcasts or check the archives for previous broadcasts you may have missed or want to hear again. Includes all the most popular programs.<P><P>

<img src="wsj.gif"><a href="http://www.wsj.com"> The Wall Street Journal</a> now has a web presence you can access for free. You like the Journal but don't want the whole thing? They'll let you create your own Personal Journal, select just what you want, and send you the software to manage it. It's subscription based but you can get a two-week free trial and judge for yourself whether it's worth it.<P><P>

<img src="wrn.gif"><a href="http://www.wrn.org/welcome.html"> World Radio Network.</a> This will give you a chance to check the radio news (and listen to it too) with the freeware program RealAudio.<P><P>

<center>HEARD ON THE WEB</center><P><P>
<HR>

<font size=3>
From time to time WebPointers comes across exchanges on the Internet that seem too valuable to let slip off into cyberspace. The following message was posted by <a href="mailto:lqk7928@IS2.NYU.EDU">Linda Korrow</a>, an Information Systems Specialist in Telecommunications who is also a student at NYU School of Continuing Education.<P>
Linda was responding to a general question from <a href="mailto:JRenaud@unlino.unl.edu">Jerry Renaud</a> at the University of Nebraska, asking how much technology should be taught in journalism school. Her answer:<P>

Jerry, I am a student, but feel compelled to respond to you anyway.  I
don't think you can teach enough about technology.  Your school and your
students can be on the leading edge or behind the times.  You're either
there or you're not there, *especially* J-schools.  The Prez says
every school in the country will be online by 2000.  Do you want to
wait that long?  Don't put your students at a disadvantage, go for it
in a big way.<P>

There are many dimensions to the technology.  The Internet alone, which is
only at the edge of it's potential.  It's invaluable.  There's so many
aspects to it and it's expanding every day in depth and breadth of
content and functionality.  For example:<P>
<UL>
        <LI>1.  networking -- sources, professional affiliations, friends
        <LI>2.  online research - tons of info and sources, do a survey
        <LI>3.  communications (email, voice, video)
        <LI>4.  story submissions - increasingly the  preferred vehicle
        <LI>5.  advertising - personal web pages, signatures, participation
        <LI>6.  job search - positions and freelance work
        <LI>7.  online publications - growing like crazy, info sources, jobs, etc.
        <LI>8.  portfolios - NPPA folks are doing CDROM portfolios & web pages
        <LI>9.  classes - via email, interactive sites, etc.
        <LI>10. collaborative efforts - worldwide teams
<P></UL>
Probably tons more.  I've watched people put together world-wide photo
teams, offer email-based classes, do online surveys on all sorts of
topics, find people, offer jobs, share information, get instant info
on news from people in that country, etc.  There is a lot of power here.
IMHO, the sooner your students are online, the better!<P>

Cheers,<P>
Linda Korrow<P>

WebPointers? Well, yes, [blush] we are becoming famous... and famouser.<P>

The latest review comes from <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ghatten/webpointers.html">Irwin Greenwald</a> in California, a subscriber to our WebPartner, the Los Angeles Daily News and a cyber-student member of the InfoSources Group. Don't take our word for it. Read his December 11th <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ghatten/webpointers.html">review.</a> <P>

Are we impressed by student reviews? If the student has the education, background and experience of Irwin Greenwald you can bet your cybersocks we're impressed. And proud too. Thanks Irwin! <P>

      


In case you missed it, click over to Steve Outing's August 2 <B>"<a href="http://www.mediainfo.com/ephome/news/newshtm/stop/stop802.htm">Stop The Presses</a>"</B> column at Editor & Publisher Interactive. We've always said he writes an awfully good column and now, gosh, he's written about us.<P>

The ink was hardly dry on Steve's column when there was <b>that</b> <a href="http://www.pluggers.com">Plugger</a> cartoon crediting WebPointers' Managing Director Robin Lind with being a "<B>Plugger</B>". Yup, that's him. Robin swears he's never met him but Jeff MacNelly even got the glasses right. <P>

For those of you who enquired about the truck: sorry, Robin sold his '46 Chevy some years ago. <P>
Robin and Kitty's son Frankie, a freshman at Cornell, is the one who currently drives the '41 Pontiac Silver Streak Torpedo Deluxe with 88,002 miles on the odometer. <P>

Robin drives the '66 Buick SportWagon with 6,534 miles on it.<P> 

And Kitty drives the '87 Ford Escort with 8,965 miles on its clock.<P>

(Guess which car has the most mileage. ;-)<P>

A lot of our early WebPointer Advisors would ask "Who is catbird and why is he emailing me?"<P>
(A few asked <I>"why is she emailing me?")</I><P>

A knowledgeable birder pointed out that the Catbird is not as accomplished as the Mockingird and nowhere near as musical as the Brown Thrasher. The Catbird, of course, has few original songs of its own. It is only a skillful mimic -- musically pointing to others. So skillful, in fact, that it imitates not only other birds, but also frogs, hens, pigs, cats and -- some believe -- in urban environments it has taken to imitating foreign cars. It ranges over almost the entire United States up into Canada and as far south as Central America. You can find the Catbird in dense thickets, well-tended gardens, residential areas and some urban plantations. <P>

Naturally, you can also find the Catbird at WebPointers: Kitty and Robin ...<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Businesses Aren't Just Playing<BR>Around 
With Games</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Word association time. <P>

I say "computer." What do you say?<P>

Did I hear you say "games"? <P>

Someone out there must have, anyway. I know, I know. Some of you said software, some said work, some said calculations or binary or C++ or something technical, but lots of people think of games when they think of computers.<P>

Perhaps it's because of that association that even the most serious online businesses often have a game or two to attract visitors. <P>

<a href="http://www.finalbell.com">Final Bell</a> is an example. The site, one of many good financial sites on the Web, has a bunch of games. Register by giving certain information about yourself, and you are issued 100,000 "sand dollars" to use in the various investment-related games. Whoever has the highest ending balance on March 17 wins real money.<P>

<img src="e.schwab.gif" width=125 height=116 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Final Bell is one of several online games run by <a href="http://www.sandbox.net">Sandbox</a> Entertainment Network. Others include Cyberhunt for Vincent, and The Court of Last Resort. When these games have run their courses, I expect new ones will take their places.<P>

Somehow or other, while you're having fun answering trivia questions or managing your make-believe portfolio, you probably will learn enough about the mysteries of the market that you'll want to invest real money. That's where site sponsor, e.Schwab Online, stands ready and willing to help.  <P>

(e.Schwab Online is the Internet manifestation of the discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co.)<P>

Most of the market information and background on companies at Final Bell comes from Schwab. <P>

The main game at the site, Play the Market, is really a showcase for Schwab's research and brokerage services. It looks like a great game, though, and I wouldn't be put off by its commercial side. As an added benefit, you may learn something you didn't already know. <P>

Play The Market allows you to select and buy stocks on the American, New York or NASDAQ exchanges with your play money and manage your portfolio. Your success in the game is based on the real world performance of your stocks. You use features from e.Schwab Online Investing and Web Trading on the <a href="http://www.schwab.com">Schwab NOW</a> Website to help decide when to sell, buy or hold.<P>

The other games include Run with the Bulls and Sharks, both market prediction games. In each, you are given a set of stocks and asked to predict their behavior over a certain time period. Next to the symbol for each stock is a button you can click to access NetWorth's stock predictor and research. Depending on the game, you double or quintuple your play money investment or lose it all.<P>

PennyWise is a 401(k) simulation game in which you can decide what portion of a weekly maximum of $2500 in play money you want to invest in 10 pre-selected mutual funds. Like some real employers, Final Bell matches your investment (with play money, though). Whatever you make is added to your grand total, whatever you lose is subtracted.<P>

The Forum is a message board where you can ask questions, complain or rave about the way the site is managed, and crow about your successes.  For a reality check -- or do I mean an absurdity check? -- you can review the Final Bell Monkey's portfolio and compare his success rate to your own. <P>

"...[H]is picks are totally random and there isn't an ounce of strategy in his choices," we are told.  <P>

Hmm. Sounds like a monkey after my own heart.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Reminder Sites Keep Track<BR>
So You Don't Have To</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


I'm always trying to remember what I ought to be doing, and then trying to do it. <P>

Like the lady who sits down to write a little note to her friend, I can spend hours not getting something done. You remember the story: first, she looks for her writing paper, then her pen is out of ink, then she can't find her stamps, and before she knows it, the morning is gone, and the note is unwritten.<P>

I feel so guilty, even when I don't actually get in trouble for missing a deadline or forgetting a promise.<P>

Perhaps you know someone like that?<P>

Although those of us who are chronically unproductive have, ultimately, to find our own solutions, the Internet offers help with some little things. <P>

Take birthday presents, for example. I can remember dates. A couple of weeks ahead of time, I think, "Aah, my little nephew's birthday will be here soon." The problem arises when my brain processes that thought by putting a check mark in the "done" column of my to-do list. Over the crucial days or weeks between the thought and the event, I bask in a false sense of accomplishment.<P>

<img src="Giftone.gif" width=217 height=52 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

By the time the birthday or other special event is upon me, it's too late to buy a present or a card, and all I can do is telephone. Bummer. If the birthday child is still celebrating in single digits, good intentions from an aunt or godmother are worth nothing. <P>

There are many automatic reminder sites on the Web, but I just found <a href="http://www.giftone.com">GiftONE</a>, which could offer a solution to my particular problem. <P>

You enter the names of people you might want to give presents to, the significant dates, and a price range for each. Two weeks before the event, GiftONE sends you an email with gift suggestions and merchants from whom you can order online. Sounds like a great idea. I can't wait to see if it works. <P>

Another reminder site I like is <a href="http://calendar.stwing.upenn.edu">Remind U-Mail</a>. When you sign up, you are given a user name and password to access your calendar. You click on a date to add birthdays, appointments and other events on your horizon. Click a little button to indicate whether the event will happen only once or annually. Type in the subject and text of the email reminder which will be automatically sent to you on the days you select.<P>

This is a wonderful service for people who check their email every day, though it's not much use to those who are sporadic.<P>

Various other sites, like <a href="http://www.tripod.com">Tripod</a>, also provide a regular email reminder service, so the technology must be available to Website developers who think it will add value to their sites.<P>

 Back to GiftONE. If it's as good as it sounds, it could save the procrastinators among us.  I hope they have a good choice of merchants and wares, though. You see, even when I remember a birthday at the appropriate time and manage to get my car keys and my checkbook and my spare time all nicely lined up to go out and buy something, I can waste an afternoon if nothing I see appeals to me. <P>

When I was a girl, I remember a saleswoman in ladies' dress shop who would phone my mother when she had something she thought my mother would like. Perhaps my memories are little rosy and indistinct, but it seems to me she was often right. <P>

I want an online shopping service just like that saleslady. One that would email me when it had found just the thing. Then I'd fork over my credit card number, type up a nice little note (no need for stamp, writing paper or ink), and have whatever it is it sent to my beloved relative or friend. <P>

I guess it does sound a little like science fiction, doesn't it? But my expectations are often as rosy -- and hazy--as my memories.<P>

For Missing Children</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


One of the worst things we parents can imagine is losing a child. <P>

When any child is abducted or runs away from home, it's a nightmare for all parents. Stories of abducted children are regularly told on the evening news and in magazines and newspapers. Shadowy news videos show runaways, huddled in city bus stations or grungy alleyways, wreathed in smog and cigarette smoke, threatened by leering passersby in flashy cars. <P>

One of the telephone companies has been advertising a toll-free hotline for runaways. "Mom, I want to come home," says the young teenager in a shaky voice into the pay phone receiver. The warm-voiced narrator reassures us that now everything will be fine. The phone company will help.<P>

Whether the child is found dead or reunited with his or her parents, the story plays on our deepest fears.<P>

According to an article in the February 3 issue of The New Yorker magazine, the number of children who are missing or abducted every day may be exaggerated in the media. The author, Kurt Andersen, reports that the father of Adam Walsh, the child who was abducted and murdered in 1981, estimated that 50,000 children a year were being abducted. The figure was taken as fact and widely reported, though Andersen's own investigation (he was then a reporter for Time magazine) suggested the actual number of children abducted might be far smaller. <P>

Whether the number is hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands, the problem is real. If a child you know or a child you love has been affected, it doesn't matter whether the number is huge or merely large.<P>

There are several World Wide Web Sites devoted to finding missing children.<P>

The <a href="http://www.missingkids.org/">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a> has put information and photographs on the Internet to help find missing children. The site is illustrated with pretty childish drawings of rainbows and flowers and animated figures searching for the lost or jumping with joy over the found. Every page has the national hotline telephone number, 1-800-THE-LOST, for anyone who has or wants information about a missing child.<P>

In spite of the prettiness, it's hard to explore the site without getting emotional. The faces of children, usually dressed up for family photographs, contrast sharply with the facts of their abductions or disappearances. Some ran away years ago, some were abducted by "non-custodial parents," others by strangers, and some simply vanished. Some are now adults, but their parents are still hoping to find them.<P>

The <a href="http://www.missingkids.org/criteria.html">database</a> is searchable by name, height, weight, age, race, hair coloring, and place last seen. <P>

Other than the database, most of the NCMEC site is static, with pages of text taken directly from brochures. Nonetheless, it's valuable.<P>

The <a href="http://www.alliance9000.com/E/MCNC/11a.html">Missing Children's Network Canada</a> isn't so "pretty", but solid attention is given to content. The logo, a green teddy bear hugging a globe ringed with children, is used as an icon to click for further information in various categories, such as "what to do if your child goes missing." The database is not large, but at the bottom of every page of photographs is a link to an email form you can use to report sightings.<P>

 Another site to visit is <a href="http://www.childquest.org/child_quest/cqmissingchildren.html">ChildQuest International</a>, with searchable databases and contact information like the first two. The site looks very slick and professional, but in fact it's a little hard to navigate. Browsing all open files, for example, involves an alphabet bar on which you can click a letter and presumably get information about children whose last names begin with that letter. It doesn't work very well, though. Oh, well. Details, details.<P>

An Altavista search on the words "missing children" turned up more than 4000 sites. Some of them are better than others. It's good idea to be skeptical about sites that lack key information, like names, addresses, telephone numbers. They may be fine, but they may not. As the New Yorker writer, Andersen, warns: "Thanks to the Web, amateurism and spuriousness no longer need look amateurish or spurious." <P>

Keep that in mind. <P>

Written for the general reader, <b>WebPointers</b> columns are designed to be gentle excursions into the exciting and rapidly-evolving world of electronic information. In our regular series of short adventures we introduce you to specific areas of the World Wide Web, increasing your knowledge and ability to explore on your own.
Think of us as your guides, pointing the way. Follow us or go off your own. <p>

<blockquote>

<font size=5> TIP!</font> If you're looking for a specific topic or story and can't remember exactly when it ran, try using your browser's "Find" tool. On Netscape, it is the binoculars icon in the top menu bar. Click on the binoculars, then type in the word you're looking for; hit the return key and you will go to the first use of the word. This can also be a handy tool to use within the columns themselves. <P>

</blockquote>

Come back and join us for each new excursion. Look into our <a href="#archives">archives</a>  for past adventures. Return to us week to week and pick up the trail. Please feel free to pass on our address to your friends and colleagues. If you enjoy yourself and would like to follow us on a more timely basis please recommend us to your local <a href="papers.html">newspaper </a> where these columns can be printed on a regular basis. <p>


WebPointers appreciates its readers' opinions and will respond from time to time with columns devoted to your helpful suggestions. You can send your questions, comments, criticisms or pointers to our editors at <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">catbird@webpointers.com</a>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFE8">M</FONT>When any child is abducted or runs away from home, it's a nightmare for all parents.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFE8">M</FONT>One of the telephone companies has been advertising a toll-free hotline for runaways. "Mom, I want to come home," says the young teenager in a shaky voice into the pay phone receiver. The warm-voiced narrator reassures us that now everything will be fine. The phone company will help.<I> <A HREF="missingkids.html">Continued</I></a><P></blockquote>

He served on the Goochland County School Board from 1984-87 and in 1989 he was named his county's Citizen of the Year.<P>

A native of Singapore, Robin was schooled at Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, educated at Tonbridge School in England, and graduated from the University of Virginia. He is married to WebPointers's Editorial Director, Kitty Williams. They live with their two children at Hope Springs in central Virginia's James River Valley.<P>

When not glued to the computer monitor, Robin resists the urge to collect antique typewriters and serves as an Emergency Medical Technician and Ambulance Driver for his local Volunteer Rescue Squad.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Job Searching Online Guarantees<BR>Practice If Not Employment</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Graduation isn't far off for college and high school seniors. Whether you are looking for a summer job, an internship, or your first "real" job after graduation, you've got to start getting your ducks in a row soon.<P>

There are odd job resources on the Internet, compiled by college placement offices, government and private placement agencies, and even the folks who make the soft drink, 7-Up! Though many of them offer help to the recent graduate, searching for an entry-level position in his or her chosen field, internship and summer job sites are scarcer than (insert your favorite cliche here).<P>

At least there are some opportunities to practice job-seeking skills. <P>

Whatever type of job you want, you won't get it without enduring a job interview. (Unless, of course, your Mom or Dad or Aunt Ethel is the big boss!)<P>

Kaplan Interactive offers <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/career/hotseat/">Hotseat</a>, an online game to help you practice for a job interview. It features an interviewer asking a series of questions. If you answer one well, you go on to the next; if you blow it, you are shown the door. <P>

There are some trick questions, so pay attention if you want to end up with a great job. Unlike a real job interview, you repeat it as often as you like until you get it right.<P>

When you're ready to stop playing and track down your ideal job, stay on the Internet for clues. <P>

AOL (if you can get online) has a section dedicated to jobs and careers with links to many of the good Internet job sites. In fact, AOL has its own jobs link with 157 jobs listed the day I checked in. Most of them are technical jobs, though others range from attorney to personal assistant.<P>

<a href="http://www.jobweb.org/catapult/catapult.htm">The Catapult</a> is a career planning site that's part of Job Web. It was originally developed by Leo Charette, now Director of Career Services at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. In addition to offering links to college and universities, online employment resources including job listings, employment centers, internships and so on, it has links to resources for career practitioners, help guides and career library resources and professional development opportunities. It is updated regularly.<P>

College students will like Catapult's  Showcase of <a href="http://www.jobweb.org/catapult/homepage.htm">Career Offices</a> with links to college and university career office home pages in Canada, Australia, Great Britain and the United States. (If  your college or university is not listed, go to its home page and look around for a link to career services. It's probably there, but access may be restricted to members of your college community.)<P>

One Catapult link leads to <a href="http://www.jobweb.org">Job Web's</a> searchable career and job opportunities. You can limit your search to <a href="http://www.jobweb.org/catapult/jintern.htm">internship</a> and co-op opportunities, but the time I tried it, there were only four internships available nationwide, all with the Federal Government. Three were for International Relations Specialists, and I realized the search engine returned them only because the word "intern" is in "international. That means there was really only one. Perhaps there will be more as summer approaches. <P>

The Internet's <a href="http://www.occ.com/">Online Career Center</a> doesn't return anything useful in response to a search for internships or summer jobs, either, but it does have a number of useful links to career services and a resume input form you can use to make your resume available.<P>

Would-be summer interns might have better luck at <a href="http://www.7up.com/UPstanding/JobPool/frcall.html">Upstanding</a>, the 7-Up Job Pool site. Right now they only offer links to a variety of Internet jobs sites and a couple of unpaid internships in the entertainment industry, but they imply that more is to come.<P>

If all this research makes you want to go back to playing games try the <a href="http://www.collegegrad.com/">College Grad Job Hunter</a>. It's not a game at all--actually it's dead serious--but it provides the sort of information and insider tips a job hunter desperately needs in an entertaining, one step at a time format, from preparation through resumes and interviews to the desired New Job!<P>

Happy Hunting.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Birders Can Spot<BR>Peterson's Guides Online</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


It's a shame you can't throw your computer with Internet connection into your vest pocket, sling a pair of binoculars around your neck, and take off for a day of bird watching. You see, Roger Tory Peterson's Field Guides to the Birds has an outpost <a href="http://www.petersononline.com">online</a>.<P>

Launched shortly after Peterson's death last year by Houghton Mifflin Interactive, the site pays tribute to one of the greatest birders of all time. Of course, it also tries to sell some of his books.  Peterson's Guides are worth having, and this site does what only the best  Internet Websites do. It enriches and expands on the wonderful material already available without attempting to discount the value of  the book itself. It's liberally sprinkled with Peterson's own illustrations.<P>

Click on Peterson's <a href="http://www.petersononline.com/birds/index.html">Birds</a> for resources from an ID challenge to reports of sightings to an interactive game. <P>

In the ID challenge, you try to identify an unnamed bird. When you think you've guessed, you can click on the answer for the correct name and complete information. The identifying marks and characteristics are carefully explained, so you'll be more sure the next time.<P>

Online tutorials under Peterson's Perspective help you learn how to identify birds by visual characteristics, field marks, size and shape, range, behavior, and flight, among other things. A section titled Regular or Rare shows which birds are regular in one part of the world while rare in another, and gives reasons they might turn up in an unusual place.<P>

A section on Feeding contains a possible menu for the Bird Cafe, and describes the variety of ways birds eat. Did you know that "Loggerhead Shrikes impale their prey on sharp branches. ... Snowy Egrets shuffle about in pools to stir up fish, frogs, and other food." You may be surprised by the ways Ruddy Turnstones and Wilson's Phalaropes and others rustle up their favorite grub.<P>

Excerpts from the current issue of Bird Watchers Digest are available online, as is subscription information. If you think birds are pretty but boring, read the bone-chilling description of brood parasitism, <a href="http://www.petersononline.com/birds/bwd/backyard/0197-watching.html">"Watching Bird Behavior: Cowbirds,"</a> by Dr. David M. Bird. You'll feel differently the next time you see a baby bird that's fallen from its nest. It may not have been an accident.<P>

Fervent birders can read reports from National Birding Hotline Cooperative -- for example, a Razorbill was seen February 1 from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, in Virginia, and a first winter Ivory Gull was sighted in Portland, Maine on January 25. These reports include contact information.<P>

If a Website doesn't seem complete without a game, click on the Skill Builders link. There you can play Silhouette Spotter online if you have Shockwave, or download a version to play offline. They say they plan to add other identification games later.<P>

If this site piques your interest, and you want more Internet information, click on Birding Links and Resources for a well organized set of links, both online and offline (you know--telephone numbers and addresses).<P>

<a href="http://www.petersononline.com/kids/index.html">Peterson Online: Kids</a> has a coloring book, skill builder, kids' gallery and a link to the First Guides Section of the online store.<P>

Visit the online store if you don't have several Peterson Guides in your bookshelf already. I am not associated with the publisher, and unfortunately they are not paying me a cent for this plug, but I really think people, especially families with children, should have a few. <P>

The series has more than 50 guides, including animal tracks, the atmosphere, butterflies, corals, reptiles, trees, and rocks and minerals. Only a handful are available for sale online, but you'll find a rack full of them at any good bookstore. <P>

The point is, you can take them with you when you go outdoors. If you can't drag yourself away from the monitor, the next best thing is probably the Peterson <a href="http://www.hminet.com/home/products/peterson/index.html">Multimedia Guide</a> to North American Birds. You can find out all about it at the site.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Web to the Rescue<BR>For Valentines Day Greetings</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


	
Listen up, guys and gals: Valentine's Day is almost here, and if you think it's okay to ignore it, you've got another think coming.<P>

You figure your significant other knows you love him or her, so why bother mentioning it. Sooo monotonous.<P>

Well, smarten up. You aren't going to get off that easily. Fortunately the Internet is there to pull your bacon out of the fire. Again. <P>

<img src="cyrano.gif" width=224 height=236 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

How about a love letter smelling faintly of roses, reeking of sentiment and longing? You wouldn't know what to say? No problem. That big-nosed, big-hearted writer, Cyrano, lives online at Nando.Net. <P>

At <a href="http://www.nando.net/toys/cyrano.html">the Cyrano Server</a>, you supply names, adverbs, adjectives, favorite foods, and so on. Cyrano uses your material to produce a letter in the style you've selected: steamy, poetic, indecisive, surreal, intellectual, desperate or regretful. You can copy the letter onto your own flowery writing paper in your own fair hand, or you can fancy it up with computer graphics, supplied at the site, and send it to your love through the ether.<P>

You may prefer Frank Sinatra's style to Cyrano's. Again, no problem. Click on over to <a href="http://pscentral.com/frank/">Frank-E-Mail</a>. At that site, you can write a note and have it "translated" into words Old Blue Eyes might use. A disclaimer at the site warns that the results might not be politically correct. Send yourself an email first to make sure it's exactly what you want to say.<P>

Billets doux (that's French for love letters) are all well and good, but sometimes your relationship with a certain someone requires more. You need to get that someone a present, and the fancier the better. Flowers, perfume, a pet, perhaps, or a Porsche. <P>

No money? Well, they say it's the thought that counts. How about sending a <a href="http://www.virtualpresents.com/">A Virtual Present</a>? From the Virtual Presents site, you can choose from clothing, tools, furniture, vacations, cars and planes (the Porsche), jewelry, food, flowers or pets. Select from the appropriate category, write a note to go with it, and click it on its electronic way to your love. <P>

If you receive a virtual present of, say, a pet frog (that's one of the options), you could respond with a virtual kiss. I don't guarantee the result will be a prince or a princess, but ...<P>

TheKiss.com lets you design a virtual kiss or pick among the "pre-puckered" ones, and send it to your chosen frog (or person). While you're at <a href="http://www.thekiss.com/">TheKiss.com</a>, have a look at the Kissing Machine, a battery operated gizmo consisting of two "love handles" connected to a control box. Kissers using the machine are rewarded with a slight electric shock when they touch lips.<P>

When you need a kissing machine to liven up your kissing experience, you could have more of a problem than you think. If sparks don't fly naturally when you and your beloved are together, you may not be meant for one another. Find out using the <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~kink/love/">Love Calculator</a>. Enter your own name and the name of the other person, click the button labeled "calculate" and it comes back with a number indicating your compatibility.<P>

Is that a little unscientific for you? You might prefer the <a href="http://www.kfu.com/~nsayer/compat.html">Biorythmic Compatablity Calculator</a>, which requires you to enter birthdates for "Person 1" and Person 2" and click a button to find out your physical, emotional, mental and overall compatibility. That page proudly carries the statement that is has been designated "Useless."<P>

These suggestions are just the beginning. There are some inspiring (and not) links at the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Holidays/Valentine_s_Day/">Yahoo! Valentine's Day</a> subdirectory. One of them, <a href="http://mustang.wyoming.eaglequest.net/~mjluce/romance.html">Love in Language: Poetry and Quotes</a>, might be just the place you need to go to get into the Valentine's Day spirit. There you'll find Shakespeare and Elizabeth Barrett Browning on love, as well as 10,000 Maniacs, INXS, The Beatles, Madonna and Sting and many others.<P>

"How do I love thee ? Let me count the ways." Sigh.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Franchises Offer Opportunities<BR>For Entrepreneurs</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


For some people, the urge to be out on their own is overwhelming. They don't like being a cog in someone else's machinery. They want a little bit more control over what they do and why they do it. They want to be the boss!<P>

Sometimes the engineer of a particular company, call him or her CEO, CFO or Director of Human Resources, decides the company's machine would run better without quite so many moving parts. A handful of once willing cogs gets tossed onto the spare parts pile. You know -- layoffs, downsizing, right-sizing, whichever euphemism you like best.<P>

<img src="bizsquare.gif" width=287 height=93 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

What to do next? One option is to explore entrepreneurial opportunities. Either look around for something that needs doing and set up a new business to do it, or buy an existing business and run with it.<P>

Franchises are an obvious choice for people who want to be on their own without giving up corporate support and structure altogether.  If you are one of them (if you don't  want to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel) there is plenty of information about franchises on the Internet. <P>

Perhaps running a McDonald's fast food joint has always been your dream. By all means read the <a href="http://www.entrepreneurmag.com/page.hts?N=744&Ad=S">Entrepreneur Magazine Online article</a> about the franchise that tops their 18th annual Franchise 500 list.<P>

If you have another company in mind, or you want to see what's available, you can search the <a href="http://www.entrepreneurmag.com/resource/franchise.hts">Franchise 500 database</a> by product or service, name or ranking. Choose search by ranking for a pulldown menu. When you select a particular franchise and click the button mysteriously labeled "show by ranking" you get contact information, start up costs, fees, and other financial information, number of franchises for the past several years, and other basic information.<P>

Except in a very few cases (possibly only those who pay a sponsorship fee), no Website addresses are listed.<P>

Don't give up if you want to find more information online. Before trying a search engine, see if you can use the following URL, substituting a company name for the three asterisks: http://www.***.com.<P>

It worked for the three top companies on the list and may well for many others. The top franchise company on Entrepreneur's list is found at <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com">http://www.mcdonalds.com</a>; the second at <a href="http://www.subway.com">http://www.subway.com</a>; and the third at <a href="http://www.yogenfruz.com">http://www.yogenfruz.com</a>.<P>

The trick didn't work for the fourth listed franchise, <a href="http://www.franchise-update.com/7-11.htm">7-Eleven Convenience Stores</a>, so I did an Altavista search on the whole name in quotation marks, and found information on the company at <a href="http://www.franchise-update.com/index.htm">Franchise Update Online</a>.<P>

Franchise Update Online is another useful site for those exploring franchise opportunities.  Its Executives' Guide to Franchise Opportunities Online has detailed company profiles on franchise systems in the United States, listed alphabetically and by category. It doesn't have as many listings as the Entrepreneur site, but it is worth a visit for more extensive information on the companies that are there.<P>

Both Franchise Update and Entrepreneur have articles for the first time franchise buyer. Franchise Update Online also has a paid directory of franchise attorneys, a National Franchise Resale Network, a library of articles about franchising, and the opportunity to order print publications. <P>

If these two sites don't answer your questions, or if they whet your appetite for more, try a search on the word Franchise, using Altavista. I got more that 40,000 hits, including <a href="http://www.frannet.com/">FranInfo</a> with a couple of thought provoking self tests to help you determine if you're suited to franchising, and if so what type.  They also have forms you can fill in to get more information. Hmm.<P>

<a href="http://www.monster.com/btb/">Be The Boss</a>: The Ultimate Franchising Website had an ad on the page with the Altavista Search results, so I clicked the button, and found another interesting-looking Website, with searches, profiles, directories and links to resources for the would-be franchise owners and operators.<P>

So, get started if this sort of thing excites you. You need to do a lot of research before your take your first actual step.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Around the World<BR>In 80 Clicks</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Jules Verne's classic tale, <a href="http://www.bibliomania.com/Fiction/verne/world/">Around the World in 80 Days</a>, was fantasy, science fiction even. 

<P>Today, travelers can go around the world in a few weeks, a few days, or even a few hours, depending on their mode of transportation. Of course, if you circumnavigate the world in a space shuttle or a satellite, you can't really stop to see the sights.

<img src="UK.gif" width=203 height=270 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>


<P>On the Internet, though it may seem a lot like science fiction, you can travel around the world, stopping to see the sights that interest you, without leaving your chair.

<P>The World Wide Web is so named because there are Websites everywhere in the whole wide world.

<P>Several enterprising persons have collected links that allow the surfer to travel wherever he or she wants, and visit Websites or places that suit particular interests.

<P>Before visiting such a site, and getting into the specific areas that interest you, start with an astronaut's eye view.

<P><a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/cities.html">Earth Viewer: Cities around the World</a> has links to satellite photographs of dozens of cities. As satellite pictures, you'll find that they don't include a very high degree of detail -- in fact the photograph of New York City included most of the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Chesapeake Bay. You could just make out Long Island somewhere in the middle of the frame. (A neat feature lets you choose between night and day.)

<P>The <a href="http://www.vtourist.com/vt/">Virtual Tourist II World Map</a> is a good next step. The clickable map has links to City.Net, with a vast database of local and regional information. Click Asia, for example, and you get a map with the countries marked. Click a country and you go to a page with specific information about travel, sights, entertainment, history, people finder, and U.S. State Department travel advisories.

<P>First I clicked <a href="http://www.rockbridge.net/personal/bichel/kyrgyz.htp">Kyrgyzstan</a>, formerly part of the Soviet Union, sandwiched between China and Kazakhstan. There were links to the 1995 CIA Factbook, a report on the languages of Kyrgyzstan from the Ethnologue Database. The Link to the Interactive Central Asia Resource Project on Kyrgyzstan had changed, but left a forwarding address. To my amazement, it is a huge page with dozens of links to information including contacts, visa requirements, information for those who want to do business there, and more. Those interested in Kyrgystan ought to make this their first stop. 

<P>Anyone who is planning to travel anywhere should leap over to the Virtual Tourist for a surprisingly well-connected site. You never know what you'll find here, but it pays to keep digging deeper and deeper through the layers of hyperlinks.

<P>For a different experience of world travel, pick a theme and jump to <a href="http://www.icom.org/vlmp/world.html">WWW Virtual Library: Museums around the World</a>. You want history? Art? Science? Current events? Weirdness? You got it.

<P>From Argentina to Australia, Vatican City to Venezuela, you can find links to museums that cover the spectrum of human knowledge, experience and creativity. 

<P>A small sample: In Argentina you can visit a museum of scientific instruments; in Australia the National Botanic Gardens, in Austria, 1002 Situations: an interactive "people's museum" on the Internet; and in Belgium, the Mechelen Museum of Deportation and Resistance, honoring those who suffered and died there during the Holocaust. 

<P>Chile has a pre-Columbian museum, the Czech Republic has a pharmaceutical museum, Denmark has a Karen Blixen Museum, Estonia has an open air museum, Finland has cultural history, France has a museum of electrical energy. 

<P>As you can guess from the list above, I've left out ten or more links for every one I mention, and I'm only in the Fs. It's a wonderful site to visit and revisit endlessly for both familiar and unexpected  experiences, depending on your mood of the moment. 

<P>Enjoy.

<center><b><font size =6>Bemoan Poetry's Ebb...<BR>
But Not Upon  the Web</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>

<I>When nations grow old, the arts grow cold and commerce settles on every tree.</I><BR> -William Blake<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


I found that quote in my email this morning, at the end of "<a href="http://www.wordsmith.org/awad/">A Word A Day</a>," a free daily message, sent out regularly to subscribers. The word of the day was "apocalypse." <P>

Coincidence or not, the quote and the juxtaposition got me thinking. Are the arts growing cold in this aging nation? It certainly seems so. Music and arts education are the first to go when school budgets get tight and educators focus on "outcome based education."<P>

Philharmonic orchestras are on strike for living wages.<P>

Poets bemoan the shortage of poetry in our daily lives.<P>

Painters starve unless they can hook up with trendy interior decorators. Actors forbid their own children to watch television with the admonition to "never watch anything stupider than you are."<P>

<img src="gmh1.gif" width=205 height=250 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

But, wait. Last night I was at a Borders bookstore where a group of poets were taking advantage of the weekly Tuesday open mike poetry session. I stopped to listen for a while and was transported to another place and another time. No cigarette smoke filled the air, no black berets or turtlenecks could be seen, no brandy or absinthe stoked the creativity of the poets. They made do with decaf skinny latte or perhaps, living dangerously, a caffeinated double espresso. <P>

They were real poets, baring their hearts and their art in the hothouse of an openly commercial establishment. Not cold. Rather: cool, man. <P>

But the Internet is the place where poetry is really alive. Though the cyber-averse scorn it as a culture-free source of trash, as a virtual printing press the Internet allows art (and near-art) to flourish.<P>

That means that though you can find shameless junk on the Internet, you can also find hearty helpings of the good stuff. Poetry, that most subtle, non-commercial art, is thriving. <P>

While poets' works and the efforts of  their biographers and critics rate only a couple of dozen feet of shelf space in even a large chain bookstore like Borders, the Internet has multitudes of Websites devoted to poetry, from the works of well-known and obscure dead poets to the works of living poets, both commercially successful and self-published.<P>

Poets can also meet each other and discuss life, the universe and everything on dozens of Internet news groups.<P>

If you want your low view of cyberculture confirmed, you can start with Roger Chappell's remarkably, um, arrogant <a href="http://vms.www.uwplatt.edu/~chappell/index.html">The Page to End Bad Internet Poetry</a>.  This page offers links to pages of bad poetry, and the suggestion that visitors email the poets to let them know how bad their poetry is. <P>

Nice, really nice. Not!<P>

<img src="dante.gif" width=84 height=100 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

Good poets, particularly those whose work is no longer under copyright restrictions, abound on the Internet. There's <a href="http://www.crs4.it/~riccardo/DivinaCommedia/DivinaCommedia.html">Dante's Divine Comedy in Italian</a>, for example, or the 1918 edition of <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/hopkins/">Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins</a> edited by Robert Bridges with hyperlinked footnotes. You can find the <a href="http://www.next.com/~bong/eliot/index.html">complete works of T.S. Eliot</a> in many places. If you prefer Japanese Haiku poetry, there are dozens of sites, including the <a href="http://www.lsi.usp.br/usp/rod/poet/haiku.html">The Art of Haiku Poetry</a> and <a href="http://www.lsi.usp.br/usp/rod/poet/renga.html">Interactive Renga Poetry Writing Online</a>. Renga poetry involves several poets collaborating on a single poem according to a strict form related to haiku.<P>

You can find out about the present U.S. Poet Laureate, <a href="http://www.diacenter.org/prg/poetry/95_96/intrhass.html">Robert Haas</a> and his predecessors, <a href="http://www.engl.virginia.edu/faculty/dove.html">Rita Dove</a> and the late <a href="http://www.sharat.co.il/nosik/brodsky/">Joseph Brodsky</a>. You can read the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/inaugural97/poem.html">Inaugural Poem</a>, written for the 1997 Presidential Inauguration by Miller Williams. You can find your own favorite poets online through <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/Literature/Genres/Poetry/Poets/">Yahoo</a>, the <a href="http://www.artswire.org/poets/poets.html">The Atlantic Monthly Poetry Pages</a>, or the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/atlantic/atlweb/poetry/poetpage.htm">The Academy of American Poets</a>. <P>

And lest you think poetry is the sole territory of academics plying quill pens in ivory towers, check out the <a href="http://www.im.nbs.gov/naamp3/naamp3poetry.html">Frog Poetry</a> page of The North American Amphibian Monitoring Program (NAAMP), or the delightful <a href="http://www.cs.amherst.edu/~ccm/prufrock.html">hyperlinked version of the Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</a>, which will guide you on a unique tour of the Internet, (even though some of its links are out of date).<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Map Your Financial Future<BR>On the Web</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


You are a high school or college student, or the parent of one. Thoughts about the future are eating up your waking hours. <P>

College, graduate school, career -- what are your options? What should you do now to ensure that you are where you want to be a year, four years or ten years from now?<P>

You know that college graduates earn substantially more than their less-educated peers but can you fund your childs tuition without bankrupting yourself?<P>

You can gaze into a crystal ball, consult the stars or just set off blithely, trusting that everything will turn out. Or you can do a little research, and develop a plan and some strategies to help you accomplish it.<P>

<a href="http://mapping-your-future.org/">Mapping Your Future</a>, a Website sponsored by Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) agencies, offers lots of help if you choose the latter route.<P>

"On this site, you will find information to help you plan your career, select a school, and pay for your education," explains the introduction.  With tuition costs continuing their upward spiral, as college education become increasingly vital for success in life, financial aid is the meat of this site, but it is not the only thing here.<P>

If you are a bit confused about what to do, and when; if you are feeling pressure not to miss important deadlines, the <a href="http://mapping-your-future.org/myf/calendar.htm">Financial Aid and College Admissions calendar</a> is useful guide. With hyperlinks to clear, concise information about the various components of the college application process, it can help a high school senior and his or her parents decide what to do when, and why.<P>

In August, they suggest, the rising senior should request applications. The word "applications" is hyperlinked to a page of explanation and tips on how and when to apply.<P>

If you have any questions about the alphabet soup of <a href="http://mapping-your-future.org/myf/standard.htm">standardized tests</a> such as the SAT, ACT, GRE, LSAT, GMAT, click on SAT, ACT in the September entry for a brief explanation of each, telephone numbers and links to online information if available. If you want, you can jump to The <a href="http://www.collegeboard.org/">College Board Online</a> site, check the test dates, and (with a credit card) <a href="http://www.collegeboard.org/sat/html/satform.html">register online</a> for your SATs.<P>

	In October's entry, the words "<a href="http://mapping-your-future.org/myf/finaid2.htm">financial aid</a>" are linked to a page with information about the various types of Federal financial aid available and how to get a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Most of the site sponsors are institutions and companies offering student assistance. Hyperlinks to their Websites are at the bottom of the MYF main page.<P>

Applications, standardized tests, and financial aid may be all some students need to concern themselves with. <P>

For others, however, the perennial question "What are you going to do when you grow up?" takes on a new importance.<P>

	In fact, the career planning section of the site is valuable to everyone contemplating the job market, whether choosing a course of study leading to a career, looking for work after graduation, or just plain looking for work, period. <P>

On the main page, click on "Planning a Career" for a list of Ten Steps including: develop a plan, assess your skills, research occupations, select a school, prepare your resume, practice job interviewing techniques, and check out other Internet resources. Each of the steps has hyperlinks to further information to help with the specific tasks, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ocohome.htm">1996-97 Occupational Outlook Handbook</a>.<P>

Specially valuable are the job and career links found under "Other Internet Resources."<P>

They include America's Job Bank, Career Resource Library - New York State Department of Labor, The Catapult, College Grad Job Hunter--WWW Home Page, Hiatt Career Development Center, University of Virginia OCPP Documents and Handouts, Getting Past Go--A Survival Guide for College Graduates, Career Mosaic, State Occupational Information Coordinating Committee.<P>

All of these sites are rich with resources, and well worth a visit. You'll see what I mean if you check out <a href="http://www.jobweb.org/catapult/catapult.htm">The Catapult</a>. I'll go into them more fully in a future story.<P>

<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Although it is tempting to say that most musical Websites are concerned with selling CDs and catering to popular taste in music, it would be a mistake to give in to that temptation. <P>

Sure, you can find Websites for almost every band and musician, whether popular or obscure, performing rock, punk, alternative, ska, heavy metal, New age, or you name it. Just as you expected. <P>

<img src="mozart.gif" width=144 height=168 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

But then there's this musical Mozart dice game, made up by the composer himself.<P>

<a href="http://204.96.11.210/jchuang/Music/Mozart/mozart.cgi">Mozart's Musikalisches Wurfelspiel</a>: A Musical Dice Game for Composing a Minuet is fun even for those who claim to HATE Mozart. According to <a href="http://204.96.11.210/jchuang/Music/Mozart/mozart.cgi#about">notes at the site</a>, Mozart made up the musical composition dice game in February 1787.  In the original version, players threw dice, looked up the  results on a table of rules, then cut and pasted pre-written measures of music together to create a Minuet and Trio.<P>

(You always wondered what people did for entertainment before the invention of television and computers, didnt you.)<P>

The Web site goes one up on Mozart's version. Mozart would have loved it, I am sure. <P>

Click on the button labeled "Make Music" and the computer throws the dice for you, that is, it generates the random numbers and then looks up the corresponding measures. A page comes up with a list of the measures in your Trio and Minuet. If your computer has a sound card and can play MIDI files (most do), you can then click a button to play "your" collaboration with the late great composer. You are also supposed to be able to generate a score for your piece and print it out, but that wasn't working when I tried it. <P>

After generating a few of your own Mozart collaborations, you will probably want to listen to some of the real stuff, just to clear your brain. An extensive collection of Mozart's work in MIDI format is available at the <a href="http://www.prs.net/mozart.html">Classical MIDI Files</a> site.<P>

The Mozart dice game is the work of <a href="http://204.96.11.210/jchuang/">John Chuang</a>, who is also in the process of creating a <a href="http://204.96.11.210/~jchuang/Ear/">MIDI-based ear training site</a>. Before you get too excited, this doesn't mean you can train your ears to do tricks, though that's an intriguing thought -- I've always wanted to learn to point mine in different directions, like a horse. Instead, this site randomly generates MIDI files containing two notes (an interval), a chord or a scale. You listen to the MIDI file and guess what it is. <P>

The game format is a good way to get a young or beginning music student to pay attention to these crucial foundations to music appreciation.<P>

With MIDI you don't get the sound of an ancient Stradivarius or a Steinway concert grand piano. You also aren't going to get the voices of Pavarotti or Kiri Te Kanawa. You won't get any voices at all. The sound is more like a electronic keyboard, a player piano or a music box. At its worst, it reminds me of those tiny computer chips in birthday cards that play a little tune when you open up the card. Still, if you moderate your expectations, it's fun.<P>

Having your computer throw pretend dice to randomly create a piece of music, based on a game created more than 200 years ago by a famous composer might make you curious to find out more about the man, himself. Two thousand Website addresses were suggested by the search engine Altavista in response to a search on Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Some lead to <a href="http://www.classicalmus.com/bmgclassics/biography/mozart.html">biographical sketches</a> from music stores' catalogs, such as the BMG Classics listing, which also includes a list of recommended recordings, but no obvious way to buy them online. Obvious is not always the answer, and if you click on the word Composers at the bottom of the page, then click on the letter M, then click on the word Mozart, you come to an extensive list of recordings, all for sale online.<P>

Many of the other sites found through Altavista also have recordings for sale.<P>

Another site the Mozart fan might visit is <a href="http://www.efes.com/lecagot/mozart.html">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at OEM Design</a>, where you can find a biography, list of compositions, recommended recordings, and downloadable musical samples in Real Audio format. With voices.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Charity Begins ...<BR>(Online) At Home</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

It may have been a newspaper article about victims of a flood, a fire, an earthquake or a winter storm that got you thinking. It could have been the homeless person you passed on the street (who could have been you, if things had turned out differently) that made you want to do something to help.<P>

You may have experienced extra good luck and want to share some of it.<P>

Perhaps you missed the United Way campaign at the office.<P>

For one reason or another you want to donate money or services to the less fortunate. With so many deserving causes how will you establish priorities?<P>

Well, you can research charities, volunteer, and even make a donation electronically.<P>

<img src="goline.gif" width=83 height=37 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

<a href="http://giveonline.org/go/go.htm">Give Online</a> is an elegant, simple site for secure online donations to the charity or service organization of your choice.  With a minimum of graphics, and hyperlinks leading to as much or as little information you want, the site allows you to get on and get off in no time, or spend hours reading up on different programs, following links to other sites, and generally exploring the charitable aspects of the online experience. Your choice.<P>




At the <a href="http://giveonline.org/go/donate.htm">Give Online Donation Form</a>, you can choose among more than 130 receiving organizations listed at the site, or add a new one if the charity of your choice isn't listed. The list includes an amazing range, from the Red Cross Disaster Relief fund, the American Cancer Society, the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts, to the Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund and The Ayn Rand Institute, to Greenpeace, the ACLU, March of Dimes, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Planned Parenthood and so on. <P>

If you want to know more about an organization before forking over your cash, you can click on the button labeled Information on Charities, a list of <a href="http://giveonline.org/go/os.htm">links to sites</a> with further information. <P>

<a href="http://www.charitiesusa.com/">Charities USA</a> has information on 400 independent charities, with an index of types of charities. Click the words "Let's do something" for a link to a contributor's assistance hotline and an email form you can fill in if you or your company wants to sponsor a fund drive or special event to help victims of the winter weather.<P>

CharitiesUSA, like Give Online, also offers secure online giving capabilities.<P>

The Better Business Bureaus  Business and Charity Reports are available online from the BBB site. Maintained by the Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB, the <a href="http://www.bbb.org/reports/charity.html">extensive reports</a> include background, history, programs, fund-raising practices, tax-exempt status, finances, and whether the organization complies with voluntary CBBB Standards for Charitable Solicitations. Your really ought to read these reports before donating to a charity or non-profit you don't know much about, no matter how appealing their mission or their literature.<P>

The <a href="http://www.nonprofits.org/">Internet NonProfit Center</a> claims to have "Information on more nonprofits than any other site in the world!" Do you want to count up the number on the other sites and check that fact? Suit yourself. The site is divided into several sections, Library, Gallery of Non-Profit organizations, Parlor and Heliport, which is links to other online non-profit resources.<P>

The Library contains lists of Best Buys for Big Hearts, the <a href="http://www.nonprofits.org/library/top40.html">Top 40 Charities</a> (a hyperlinked list), a donor defense kit, tips on how to evaluate non-profits, and other articles "generally by sources other than nonprofits themselves." <P>

The Parlor has bulletin boards, live chat and the like. Unfortunately, the Nonprofit Center site isn't updated very often. Although the old information may still be valid, there's a stale quality to a Website that is still promoting events that took place months ago. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Putting The Zip<BR> Back in Zip Code</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



The other day the instructor began class by handing out a list of students with addresses and telephone numbers. I was mildly distressed to see that my address was the only one without a four-digit extension to the ZIP code. <P>

Mildly distressed, I repeat, since the friendly mail carriers at our small rural post office have both the time and inclination to figure out inaccurate and incomplete addresses. Just before Christmas, for example, we received a letter from an old friend in England addressed to "Hope Springs, VA 23103."  See what I mean? (Hope Springs is the name of our place in the country, not the name of a village.)<P>

<img src="uspslogo.gif" width=243 height=48 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

Still, I do know how get my full ZIP code. A few weeks earlier, I had visited the <a href="http://www.usps.gov/">United States Postal Service Website</a> getting the zip code for a letter I wanted to mail and I was delighted by the experience.<P>

Before the USPS got on the Internet, you could call or stop by a <a href="http://www.usps.gov/postofc/">post office branch</a> and ask --if it was open, if the phone wasn't busy, and if everyone wasn't too busy ... Or you could buy one of those fat paperback ZIP code directories, and look it up. <P>

You can still do all of those but <a href="http://www.usps.gov/ncsc">ZIP code lookup</a> and address information on the Internet is a major improvement. Type the street address and state in the electronic form and you get back the code. It puts the zip back in zip-code.<P>

Though you can't buy stamps on line yet, stamp collectors can look at the new issues and archives of images. You can <a href="http://postcalc.usps.gov/itds/owa/calculator.home">calculate postage</a> for letters and packages sent within the United States, or check on <a href="http://www.usps.gov/consumer/95intlr.htm">international rates and fees</a>. There's a link to <a href="http://www.usps.gov/moversnet/">MoversNet</a> where you can fill out an online change of address order, locate your new post office, and read all the stuff that's in the hard copy Mover's Guide prepared for the USPS by Targeted Marketing Solutions, Inc. (TMSI).<P>

If your business depends on shipping, you can find how-tos and rates for Express and Priority Mail options, as well as Express Mail Tracking. Enter a package tracking number in the form and see whether it's arrived yet.<P>

Neither last nor least, but certainly of interest, there is a link to the US Department of State Passport Services Website with forms and information you need to get a passport.<P>

The venerable old post office isn't the only shipper to benefit from this new technology. Indeed, few other industries have yet enjoyed such positive impact on service and cost-cutting as shippers.<P>

<img src="fedex.gif" width=284 height=152 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

<a href="http://www.fedex.com/">FedEx</a>'s site is terrific, with lots of online services, including downloadable software and package tracking. There's even secure <a href="https://www.fedex.com/acct_num.html">online account registration</a> for US accounts. For businesses, there are inventory management and "just-in-time delivery" learning labs with case studies, glossaries, expert forums, "white papers" and the like. There's a drop-off locator where you can find staffed and self-serve locations by city and state or by ZIP code. You can also explore delivery options with an interactive form, and learn all you need to know about International shipping.<P>

<img src="upslogo.gif" width=78 height=83 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

The <a href="http://www.ups.com">UPS Home Page</a> doesn't look quite as snazzy as the FedEx page although it's quite respectable. In fact, its simplicity may work in its favor, since they haven't tried to pack EVERYTHING in. You'll find most of the same sorts of links found on the competition's site: drop-off locator, package tracking, and downloadable software. Prominently featured is a <a href="http://www.ups.com/using/services/rave/rate.html">quick cost calculator</a> for U.S. and international locations - very handy and easy to use. In addition to returning the cost of the type of delivery you specify, it returns alternatives.  <P>

Click "Request Pickup" to summon a driver to get your packages.<P>

I'd suggest you bookmark all three home pages and return whenever you need information or service, on a personal or business level. It sure beats waiting on hold, punching through the interminable "options" of voice mail, or standing in the "cattle chute" lobby waiting for 
the next available customer representative.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Web100 Offers <BR>Favorites Insights</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Where is everyone going online? What are the "Hot Sites"? How do colleagues always seem to be on the cutting edge of the Web when you know they don't have any more time than you do?<P>

You can find extraordinary sites by luck, or you can use a search engine to find pages with information you need. You can follow links from a page you like, and arrive at some unsuspected treasure or dead-end at broken link after broken link. <P>

If you are a focused and disciplined forager for information on the Web, you will develop streamlined selections of web sites to visit daily or as needed. You can pay for Internet information services, and guarantee that almost every minute you spend on the Web is productive and valuable.<P>

You can, but where's the fun in that? The interconnectedness of information on the Internet allows a choice between main streets and scenic byways. <P>

When the scenic byways beckon, some starting points are better than others.<P>

Consider the <a href="http://www.web100.com">Web 100</a> site. It's a stripped down list of best Web sites, as rated by visitors to Web 100. Creators Allan Hoffman and Scott Blanksteen, explain their purpose quite simply: "Rather than overwhelming you with listings of hundreds of thousands of Web pages, the Web 100 provides an easily accessible selection of 100 sites in areas such as entertainment, business, education, news, and sports."<P>

Each hour the ratings change, based on responses by visitors to the site. I couldn't find a counter, so there is no way of knowing whether the ratings were determined by a few or by many. A "Website of the hour" which is getting lots of votes is also featured. <P>

Web100 suffers from an over-reliance on technology and a lack of human supervision, however. At least one highly-rated site, URoulette at number 32, appears to be down and to have been down for some time, according to reader reviews at the site. Another, the <a href="http://ubl.com">Ultimate Band List</a> at number three, had an old URL. I found the correct address by deleting all but the primary site address, and pressing "enter."  On the <a href="http://american.recordings.com/">American Recordings</a> Home Page, I found a link to UBL and the correct address.<P>

Caveats aside, Web 100 is as good a place as any, better than most, to embark on a Web surfing adventure. The sites are mostly well-established, valuable sites in their various categories. If the links are broken, first try my trick with the URL. If that doesn't work, you should be able to find the page, if it still exists, with any good search engine.<P>

On my first visit, the site of the hour was the <a href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a> site. I'm sure the United Nations is not, and probably never will be, the most popular site among the legions of average Web surfers. There is no sex here, and the kind of violence the U.N. deals with every day -- war, inhumanity, famine, and the neglect and maltreatment of children -- is not the kind of violence that sells books and movies. <P>

Instead, this U.N. site uses Internet technology to explain in detail the workings, the history and the mission of the United Nations, and offers illustrated tours of the U.N. Headquarters in Manhattan and the Palais des Nations in Geneva. <P>

You can visit online databases of International treaties, Statistics and Indicators, Land Mines, films of Security Council and General Assembly Meetings, REFWORLD (refugees) and ReliefWeb. The U.N. site is interesting and valuable, and would be helpful to anyone interested in the facts behind the headlines.<P>

Another time I visited the Web 100, the site of the hour was <a href="http://www.politicsnow.com/">Politics Now</a>, a site produced jointly by ABC News, The National Journal, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and Newsweek with front page coverage of Paula Jones lawsuit against President Clinton. <P>

When you visit, you will almost certainly find something that makes your trip worthwhile. But remember, sheep walk in paths. The fact that a web site is getting a high number of visitors doesn't prove it's superior. There's many a jewel yet to be discovered.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Make Money Maybe<BR> ...With Web Advice</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



You want to make your money work for you in 1997. It's both your plan and your resolution. So you look around, read the paper, grab a few money mags off the news stand, and ponder.<P>

<img src="sandp.gif" width=230 height=87 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

A couple of years ago, you recall, everyone was talking about mutual funds as the hot new way to make money off investments. Is that a good idea? I looked around on the Internet to find some answers. <P>

To sum up what I found: Maybe, maybe not. (Don't you love specific financial advice?)<P>

With mutual funds, you pool your money with a group (often there is a fairly high minimum stake) and a hotshot fund manager invests in a nicely diversified group of high yield stocks.<P>

When they first became trendy, mutual funds were handsomely out-performing the well-known market indices. Small and individual investors flocked to funds such as the Vanguard S&P 500. With the growth of individual retirement accounts and 401(k) accounts, a sizable amount of retirement money is still pouring into mutual funds. <P>

<img src="foolface.gif" width=81 height=81 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

According to a  September 7, 1996 online article in the Motley Fool's Rogue, there are more mutual funds than there are stocks listed on  the New York Stock Exchange, and monthly purchases of mutual funds average $30 billion. (For similar articles, use the <a href="http://www.fool.com/sea_all.htm">Motley Fool search engine</a> and enter the words "mutual funds." You'll find some opinionated and informative stuff there.)<P>

Today many people question the wisdom of that trend. As one said to me last week, "the bloom is off the rose." The Rogue notes that more than 70% of mutual funds fail to beat the market.<P>

With the help of the Web, you can do your own research and discover why mutual funds are still attracting investors, whether you should be among them, and what the alternatives are.<P>

<img src="networth.gif" width=116 height=74 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

 Start out from the <a href="http://networth.galt.com">NETworth</a> site. There you can get objective analysis of funds that interest you from Morningstar, a respected source of information on more than 7500 mutual funds. You can search by fund name or ticker symbol. <P>

If you aren't looking for a specific fund, you can click on Top Performers. Following that link, you come to a page which lists 44 categories of funds, and a choice of return periods from year-to-date, 3-month to 10 years. Select a category, say Mid-Cap Blend, and a time period for a list of the top 25 performers. <P>

For more information on a specific fund, you can click on the <a href="http://networth.galt.com/www/home/mutual/mstar.html">Morningstar hyperlink</a> next to it. You get information on the funds family name, assets, and category, the 3-month, year-to-date, one year, three-, five-, and 10-year average returns, Morningstar risk and returns ratings, an investment profile, fees and expenses, operations data including the name and tenure of the <a href="http://networth.galt.com/www/home/mutual/">fund manager</a>, and portfolio information on price/earning ratio, price book ratio, composition and sector weightings.<P>

This information is free, but you must register to access it.<P>

If you are interested in more information about an individual fund, there are links to many well-known mutual fund groups along the left margin of each NETworth page. Listed as "Premier Partners" are American Century, Dreyfus, INVESCO Funds, The Kaufmann Fund, Scudder Funds, T. Rowe Price, and The Vanguard Group. "Select Partners" include Gabelli Funds, Guinness Flight Mutual Funds, IAI Mutual Funds, Janus, Kemper Money Funds, The Montgomery Funds, Nations Funds, Neuberger & Berman, PBHG Funds, SAFECO Mutual Funds, Stein Roe and Wright Investors' Service. ( I couldn't tell the difference between Premier and Select partners, but suspect it has something to do with how much they paid to be listed.)<P>

If you click on any link, you can find more information about individual funds within each group and a link to each partner's home page.<P>

As an example of the sort of information you can find, <a href="http://www.vanguard.com">The Vanguard home page</a> contains news and announcements, planning tools, articles about international investing, year end distributions, and gifts to children. It also has educational articles, up to date information about Vanguard mutual funds by category, risk level, asset type, fund minimums and daily fund reports.<P>

After you've done all your homework, you tell me: is "Maybe, maybe not" a fair assessment?<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Read Your Future in The Stars</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Current academic wisdom holds that "We three Kings of Orient," the wise men or Magi who were led by a star to the manger where the Baby Jesus lay, were actually court astrologers.<P>

You read that correctly. Astrologers. New Agers. Folks who calculate the positions of the stars and planets to find out what's going to happen, when it is auspicious to undertake projects and all that stuff.<P>

Two thousand years ago, according to the Bible, astrologers determined that the birth of a child to a poor carpenter and his wife was significant. Each January 6, millions of Christians around the world celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany, when the astrologers paid their respects. Today, however, though wildly popular, astrology is also looked on with suspicion. <P>

A few prominent people like former President Reagan's wife Nancy consult astrologers, but most Westerners, at least, see it as a harmless entertainment. In newspapers, horoscopes are generally found near the comics and the crossword puzzle.<P>

I don't know whether astrology is harmless entertainment or something more. I do know that there's an incredible variety of astrologers who have taken up residence on the Internet in hope that you'll pay them a visit (and pay them cash for in-depth, customized readings.)<P>

As the new year begins, many people feel the urge to peer into the future and predict what the next 12 months will bring. My favorite Internet astrologer, <a href="http://marilyn.metawire.com/stars/97p1.htm">Jonathan Cainer</a>, doesn't disappoint. The coming Comet Hale-Bopp figures prominently in his year ahead predictions for each sign of the Zodiac.<P>

Jochen "Joe" Savelberg, a Belgian college student and Internet whiz, has compiled <a href="http://stars.euregio.net/joe/zodiac/">Easy Scopes</a>, a Website for anyone even mildly interested in horoscopes. <P>

Several weeks ago, when he emailed me to let me know about his site, he wrote: "When I started reading horoscopes on the Internet, I learnt the URL for my sign (Leo) off by heart so that I could always go directly to the information that I wanted. Then I realized that more people might be doing the same. That is why I created 'EasyScopes - fast and easy horoscopes index.' This index lists a lot of horoscopes and astrology sites and all links are sorted by zodiac sign. So you can get to your <a href="http://www.euregio.net/joe/home.html">information</a> without going through the frontdoor."<P>

A few weeks later, I heard from him again: "I expect to have more than 10,000 visitors a day during the first two weeks of January. Already at the begin of December I had more than 60,000 visitors a week." Wow. Obviously he is onto something. <P>

This 21-year-old student at the College of St. Laurent at Liege, Belgium is a go-getter -- check his <a href="http://www.euregio.net/joe/cv.html">resume</a> for everything from kindergarten through driver's license (1994) to fluency in four languages, to membership in the HTML Writers Guild, to Website systems administrator. Watch out , Bill Gates!<P>

He's currently putting together a new list of astrology links which will be available soon. "The design of the page will be completely renewed to reflect a music-industry style of chart. I think that page will be much more fun to visit in future," he explained.<P>

Among all the horoscopes available at Joe's EasyScopes, one stands out: a site sponsor, <a href="http://www.astroadvice.com">AstroAdvice</a>. <P>

The interactive horoscopes and astrology guide is ambitious, complicated, and should be a major hit with astrology buffs. Although it is free, you have to register and give your birthdate, time and place. Then the site generates custom skycharts, extensive horoscopes, astro biodex charts (remember biorhythms?), natal analysis and lots of background information about astrology in general. <P>

By February they plan to offer interactive pages to help you discover whether you are "truly compatible with your loved ones," and that sort of thing. <P>

Early response when the site officially opened in early January was overwhelming, and the servers went down temporarily. The glitch was soon fixed and the site was operating smoothly soon afterwards.<P>

So, now, what's stopping you? Trace the footsteps of those Oriental court astrologers--you may follow a star to a wonderful place. Or else, this all may be dangerous hogwash. Who knows?<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Something's Rotten<BR>On The Internet</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


I got a compost bin for Christmas--I'm so excited!<P>

Actually, what I really got was a book, "Let it Rot" and a promise that the compost bin on page 84 would be built wherever I wanted it.<P>

Now, either you know exactly how I feel or you are completely befuddled. If you don't like dirty fingernails, or if you think autumn leaves are a nuisance to be disposed of as rapidly as possible, this column may seem strange to you.<P>

To me and to many others, compost can be thrilling. Trust me. <P>

My few acres of earth are soggy when wet, and hard as cement when dry. For the past decade and a half, I have been struggling with one area or another, trying to improve the soil so my plants will flourish and my garden will prosper. <P>

I'm getting there. Last year I had a great crop of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. A visiting child turned over some mulch in the corner of the garden, and found a lovely wiggle of earthworms to admire -- they're another sign my efforts are working. <P>

Compost is the reason, though mine doesn't always behave the way it should. (Partly because I don't. I've already confessed to adding meat scraps, which can cause a stink. I also throw in whole grapefruit rinds.)<P>

Unlike me, my father-in-law, a serious, careful gardener in Canada, has a proper attitude to compost. He doesn't permit improper additions, and all the fruit and vegetable scraps are carefully cut into small pieces before going into the bin. His garden flourishes in appreciation.<P>

I'm far too lazy and impatient to follow his example. I dump the garbage--what ever is in the sink strainer-- into the bucket under the sink, and when the bucket is full, dump that onto the compost pile. I sometimes find plastic wrap, those bright blue rings from gallon milk jugs, wine corks and other miscellaneous non-biodegradables in my finished compost. <P>

Still compost is wonderful and I can't wait until my Christmas present is ready.	<P>

In the meantime these cold days keep me indoors, planning and dreaming. Not to my surprise, the Internet is a rich source of serious information on composting, both on a small residential level and on a municipal level. There are even sources of educational information for school science classes.<P>

In fact, a good place for eveyone to start is <a href="http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/compost/why.html">Why Compost?</a>? The well illustrated, copiously hyperlinked page is part of the <a href="http://www.cals.cornell.edu/dept/compost/">Cornell Composting</a> site which also has information on <a href="http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/compost/schools.html">Composting in Schools</a>,  Science and Engineering aspects of composting, and a list of additional <a href="http://www.cals.cornell.edu/dept/compost/Compost_Resources.html">resources</a> for composters. <P>

Composting in Schools, produced by Cornell University's Program in Environmental Sciences for Educators and Youth, is a fascinating resource with a teachers' page, detailed instructions for projects such as building a soda bottle bioreactor, a composting quiz and lots more.<P>

Cornell's <a href="http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/compost/science.html">Science and Engineering of Composting</a> site, on the other hand, is much more sophisticated. It even includes downloadable Excel spreadsheets for calculating your compost mix! To quote from the site's Note to Casual Composters "Some of the topics in the Science and Engineering section may be far too technical to be relevant to casual composters. On the other hand, some may be intriguing.... explore these pages to whatever level your curiosity takes you... "<P>

Hint: All these pages might be a great source of inspiration for senior high school science projects.<P>

Although you might find enough at the Cornell site to answer all your questions, there are other Internet web sites you might want to visit. <P>

There are articles such as <a href="http://tfrec.ncw.net/Orchard/compost.html">Fun with Compost</a>, <a href="http://www.acnatsci.org/erd/ea/compost2.html">The Compost Pile Meets the 1990s</a>, and <a href="http://fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de/~fritsch/Papers/env/compost/startadd.html">Starting and Adding to a Composter</a>. Then, of course, there's the aptly named <a href="http://net.indra.com/~topsoil/Compost_Menu.html">Rot Web</a>. <P>

If you still want more, try a search on compost with one of the big search engines like AltaVista  ...and let 'er rot! <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Web Surfing Substitutes<BR>Make Foraging Easier</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



If you believe most business people, they get to work at 6 a.m. (after a brisk game of squash or half an hour on the treadmill at the health club), eat a cup of yogurt at their desk for lunch, and get home well after the once-common knock-off-time of 5 pm.<P>

An acquaintance who is a successful executive, once told me her husband was going through a slow time at the office. "Of course, he isn't working 8 hours a day or anything like that," she added quickly. <P>

It took me a few seconds to realize she meant he was still putting in 10 hours or more every day, just as she did.<P>

No wonder many business people say they don't have time for the Internet. Even on a good day of 'Netsurfing, you'll waste precious time that could be used writing memos or selling widgets or crunching numbers for your marketing plan. <P>

If you really don't have time, don't despair. You're part of the new wave of Internet Users referred to as "Foragers" -- people whose time is valuable; people who know what they want, want to get on, get it and get off.<P>

Useful information and tools are available out on the World Wide Web, and business people who are poised to take advantage of them will prosper. The secret is learning how to use the Web productively.<P>

What's to be done? You can't ask your secretary to Websurf for you (after all, it can be too much like fun.) Besides, secretaries are supposed to be busy and productive all the time. Successful 'Netsurfing usually requires a steady investment of unproductive time.<P>

Enter <a href="http://home.navisoft.com/vip/norman.htm">Norman~The Ulimate Business Surfer</a>.<P>

Norman produces one of several email newsletters that arrive periodically in your mailbox, with hot sites for business people. Others that have business news and/or links include Netsurfer Digest, OMRI Daily Digest and Seidman's Online Insider. <P>

Norman, whose real name is Ken Leebow, is a self-dubbed "Net-Aholic in good standing." He expects to begin 1997 with 100,000 subscribers to his free weekly, Norman's Friday Hot Tips and Sites to Visit Newsletter. You can subscribe by clicking an icon at his home page.<P>

Each week, the newsletter brings 10 sites for business people to visit, as well as news about developments in the Internet and related technology.<P>

Some very useful web addresses for business people are gathered on <a href="http://home.navisoft.com/vip/article.htm">Norman's list of superior sites on the Internet</a>. They are organized in 29 categories including search engines, "inspirational stuff," business assistance, stock market and investments, package tracking, productivity tools, and so on.<P>

Norman's home page also has links to business periodicals on the 'Net and offers help to people who want to set up a home page, publicize one that already exists or develop an email newsletter of their own.<P>

<a href="http://www.netguidemag.com">Seidman's Online Insider</a> is aimed at those in the online business or those who are following the rising and falling fortunes the online service industry and related software and hardware developers. <P>

<a href="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/index.html">Netsurfer Digest</a> isn't actually a business newsletter at all, but it's worth subscribing to anyway. This weekly newsletter contains an eclectic selection of intriguing Internet addresses, some goofy, some fascinating, some useful, and some combining one or more of those attributes. Anyone who wants to get a taste of the Web's variety should visit the NSD home page and read over the current issue. A recent edition contained links to English Renaissance Literature, Hubble Spacecraft images, the Drug Free America site and the <a href=" http://www.npd.com:80/pcmeter.htm">PC-Meter</a> Web Measurement Services site with survey information about who is using the Web to shop online, for what.<P>

After all, if you are going to use the Internet as a business tool, you ought to be able find the sites that relate specifically to your own business, whether it's selling books or educating children or designing nuts and bolts for space craft.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Mad Scientists and Others:<BR>Romancing the Details</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


What comes to mind when you think about scientists and inventors?<P>

<img src="madscientists.gif" width=250 height=136 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

There's the mad inventor, Dr. Emmett Brown (with his wild Einstein-like hair) working alone into the night on his souped-up DeLorean, to perfect time travel. There's Einstein himself, of course, with his mismatched socks (when he remembered to wear socks).<P>


There are medical researchers like <a href="http://Time.com">Time Magazine</a>'s 1996 <a href="http://pathfinder.com/@@iWZQwwcAuGLhddv1/time/moy/index.html">Man of the Year</a>, Dr. David Ho who is working to conquer a terrifying disease. And don't forget Ian Fleming's 'Q' whose devious creations pulled James Bond's bacon out of the fire time and time again during his adventures fighting the Cold War. (Q's inventions may or may not have been strictly fictional. Decide for yourself when you visit the unofficial Central Intelligence Museum on the Web.)<P>

Though science is painstaking, tedious work, it captures the popular imagination, in fact and fiction. <P>

It doesn't matter that most of us tend to see our own eye reflected back at us when we try to look through a microscope, rather than the single-celled creatures or wiggly pond life we expect. We are still prepared to be wowed by science, make believe, real, or in transition between the two. Naturally, the World Wide Web -- offspring of Science and Computers, invented by an Englishman in Switzerland, using American software -- offers scads of sites for all tatses.<P>

Dr. Emmett Brown, the wild-eyed dreamer in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/cache/title-exact/11113">Back to the Future</a> may be many people's idea of a scientist and inventor.  He embodies elements of an H.G. Wells character, mixed up with Timothy Leary, Buckminster Fuller and Dr. Frankenstein. Even his "science" is reminiscent of Dr. Frankenstein's, when he uses lightning to bring his invention to life.<P>

 Stuck in the past without sufficient power for his time machine, he rigs wires up to the City Hall clock, and breezily explains to the hero of the movie: "As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely eighty-eight miles per hour the instant the lightning strikes the tower ... everything will be fine!" Don't confuse me with the facts! That was a funny movie.<P>

A real scientist, Dr. David Ho was named 1996 Time Man of the Year for his AIDS research, although most of what he does is a mystery to non-scientists. His "glamorous" <a href="http://www.healthcg.com/journal/july96/pathogen.htm">work</a> involves tedious, repetitive work, with no slapdash rigging of wires to clock towers in thunderstorms. But he's having increasing success fighting a disease that threatens the world. That makes him a hero the equal of <a href="http://www.mcs.net/~klast/www/novels.html">James Bond</a>.<P>

James Bond fought the Evil Empire (no matter that it's turned out to be neither as evil nor as powerful as we believed during the Cold War.) To enhance his remarkable physical and intellectual powers, not to mention his charm, he used clever, painstakingly designed weapons, provided by his scientific colleague, <a href="http://www.mcs.net/~klast/www/q.html">Q</a>.<P>

Q's inventions, concealed in the accouterments of a gentleman (walking stick, umbrella, cufflinks, cigarette case, Aston Martin) enabled the swashbuckling Bond to slip out of danger's grasp at the last split second.<P>

The <a href="http://www.inch.com/~dna/">Central Intelligence Museum</a> has exhibits of spy paraphernalia that might have been beneath James Bond's gentlemanly standards, but George Smiley and the other less flashy heroes of <a href="http://www.salon1999.com/weekly/interview961021.html">John leCarre</a>'s spy novels would have recognized them at once.<P>

The CIM is plastered with disclaimers and warnings not to mistake it for an official government site. We readers of spy novels aren't so sure.  Some of that stuff has to be real, don't you think? There's the disappearing ink, the exploding cigarette pack, the camera hidden in a smoke detector... <P>

Some of the images are animated, and show the outside appearance and the inner secret workings of these nifty little inventions. Others are still photographs. Whether they are real or not, anyone who's planning to write a spy novel should spend a little time here, researching the tools (?) of the trade. <P>

Whether scientist are spies, or spies are scientists; whether the enemy is as vast as a government or as tiny as a virus; and whether the glamour of scientific pursuit is real or imagined, there are ample resources on the Internet to support any opinions you might have.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Email Invitation Launches<BR>New Urban Legend</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


It's the stuff <a href="http://www.urbanlegends.com">urban legends</a> are made of: Why not use the Internet to promote a book publisher's benevolent image?<P>

Why not ask the online community to email their fondest holiday memories to a special address? For every 25 messages, the publisher would donate a copy of a Christmas children's book, to cheer up sick kids in hospitals across the country.<P>

Brilliant! Could lead to a public relations home-run!<P>

"Hi, Everyone! Maybe you've already got this message but this seems like a great way to spread some happiness.  Please take a minute out of your day and respond to the address listed below. ... When you have fulfilled your part, please send this message to as many other people as you can.  Thanks, everyone!<P>

"The Houghton-Mifflin publishing co. is giving books to children's hospitals; how many books they give depends on how many emails they receive from people around the world. For every 25 emails they receive, they give one book--it seems like a great way to help a good cause.<P>

"Hope you can spare the seconds to write and then let your friends know.  So far they only have 3,400 messages...last year they reached  23,000."<P>

Naturally, many Internet-savvy people were suspicious of the request. As one member of an Internet news group wrote: "I can't imagine why Houghton-Mifflin would want to be flooded with email. If they want to give free books, then they can just do it."<P>

There was even speculation that they were trying to surreptitiously gather email addresses for a future marketing blitz. Others thought that competitors might have launched the campaign deliberately to overwhelm HMCo's email service.<P>

<img src="polarexpress.gif" width=108 height=146 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

I was sure it was a scam. I visited the <a href="http://www.hmco.com/">HMCo</a> home page, expecting to find an urgent plea to cease and desist--but not at all. Instead, I found a link to the <a href="http://www.polarexpress.com/">Polar Express</a> Share the Spirit Campaign Website. The page proclaimed the campaign over, 50,000 emails received, and 2,000 books donated. Visitors were invited to browse excerpts from emails received. How touching, I thought.<P>

Then, the rest of the story began to materialize. <P>

First, there was this newsgroup posting: "The word that I have is that the program was real, but it has been maxxed out. H-M no longer wants E-mail. Indeed, they may have become the newest <a href="http://www.urbanlegends.com/classic/craig.shergold/">Craig Shergold</a>."<P>

(Craig Shergold was the English child diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1989 who wanted to be listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for receiving the most get well-cards. He got his wish in 1990 when Guinness listed him with more than 16 million cards; in 1991 he was successfully operated on at the University of Virginia hospital and is now a healthy 16-year-old whose cards keep coming. Guinness retired the category in 1992 when the total had reached 33 million; officials quit counting when they went over 60 million and estimate there are now over 100 million. And yes, they're still coming despite all pleas for a halt.)<P>

On December 12, 1996, a former HMCo employee wrote "Although the promotion is/was real, PLEASE DON'T SEND THEM ANY MORE EMAIL. The mail gateway is throttling with the incoming mail....They've  gotten a little over 100k messages in 1 week. The mail server is currently a SPARC 5 w/ 64MB RAM and a gigabyte of swap, and is so  hosed that they're switching in an Ultra2 tonight to try to handle the load.<P>

"The lesson here is: don't do a marketing ploy without first consulting  your Tech people. Apparently, the whole thing was cooked up by one of the departments, who neglected to tell MIS."<P>

Even though the techno-jargon is over my head, I think I get the picture. <P>

We forwarded the message to our son at college. His response, dated December 18, gives an indication of the growing headache HMCo is still facing:<P>

"Hey guys, I got that message about the reality of Houghton Mifflin's blunder.... I was just telling .... a Mac-techie from down the hall about it, and he was rather enlightened. In fact, he'd been told about it by another friend, and decided to do them a good turn. He sent those poor dopes _13500_ emails with a special mailbomber program he has (just for novelty purposes, of course), with the best intentions. Thinking of everyone else who probably did to, I guess they'll not make that offer again."<P>

A mailbomber program, indeed. Hmphf!<P>

That same day we received an official response from Yuka Sugiura at Houghton Mifflin Interactive. They achieved their goal of 50,000 messages on December 10 and shut down the email address. They are, said Sugiura, still interested in messages.<P>

"The campaign is not over as we are still accepting and posting messages sent via The Polar Express Share the Spirit web site (http://www.polarexpress.com). In addition, because we reached our goal so early, we'll be donating an extra 500 books to children's hospitals."<P>

I can only imagine what will happen to the Web site.<P>

<P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Classrooms are fast being wired into the Internet. Even the President and Vice-President have been photographed, sleeves rolled up, hammers and wire-cutters in hand, helping to bring schools online and into the 21st century.<P>

This is all so exciting. The Internet is vast, almost beyond our human ability to imagine. Every nook and cranny has treasure to be explored, and unimaginable resources for students, teachers, researchers.<P>

A lot of this kind of hype is actually more or less true. <P>

There are only a few small problems. Such as: how do you find the good stuff? How can you tell whether something you find on the Internet is actually true? How should students use the Internet for research? What teacher has time in his or her busy schedule to learn how to use the Internet? <P>

Just a few small details like that...<P>

You can always start with a search engine such as Yahoo! and search on the keyword <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Education">education</a>. You'll have a few thousand search results to explore. You can spend hours tracking down leads, and, in the end, you may have a dozen wonderful bookmarks for Web sites to explore at a later date. If you have the time, go for it. Most people don't, though.<P>

Another alternative is to find a message board or a real time discussion on educational topics. <P>
<img src="virtualauditorium.gif" width=267 height=346 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

The best hosted real-time discussions for students and educators that I've visited so far are at <a href="http://www.classroom.net/">Classroom Connect</a>'s Virtual Auditorium. A schedule for hosted events is available at the site, and the discussions I've been in have been interesting, polite, and, most of all, helpful. Educators with an interest in the Internet are likely to find good tips from fellow teachers on where to go and what to expect. (FYI: The auditorium seems to close down during school vacations.)<P>

Classroom Connect's Home Page has variety of solid, high-quality online resources for teachers, including articles and <a href="http://www.classroom.net/cgi/rofm/eduFind.html">links</a> to resources elsewhere on the 'Net. It looks like a very useful site for the teacher who doesn't have time and needs to get up to speed fast.<P>

Useful material at the site includes an article on the proper forms for <a href="http://www.classroom.net/classroom/CitingNetResources.html">citing online research</a>. As students increasingly turn to the Internet to do research for reports and term papers, teachers need a way to check sources. They also need commonly agreed-upon forms. Although other ways of citing online sources probably exist, and strongly held opinions will differ on the details as the Internet evolves, this is a very useful tool.<P>

CC also has a huge directory of school home pages, but many of them were not up when I visited. I was directed to two good school home pages, however, by the hostess of a Virtual Auditorium chat. One was for an elementary school, one for a high school <P>

New York City's <a href="http://www.gsn.org/web/models/rbs/rbshome.htm">Ralph Bunche School Home Page</a> is the effort of the mini "computer school" within RBS. It's a simple page, with links to articles, poems, and artwork by students, and it's a good example of what works. Don't miss the <a href="http://mac94.ralphbunche.rbs.edu/spanish.html">illustrated Spanish Alphabet</a>. RBS students are in third through sixth grades.<P>

The <a href="http://www.fred.net/nhhs/nhhs.html">North Hagerstown High School</a> home page is a far more complex, ambitious effort, and also well worth a visit. There is information about the school and the community. The News Discussion Site is an example. Discussions on topics of current interest have included Bosnia, the Budget Battle in Congress, O.J. Simpson, and so on. Links to news sources are provided so students can inform themselves of the facts before forming opinions. The webmaster "reserves the right to edit flames, venomous spew, and unintelligent dribble by zapping such offensiveness with the delete button." Way to go!<P>

Another must-visit site for educators using the Internet is <a href="http://www.gsn.org/">The Global SchoolNet Foundation</a> home page. With links to various projects supported by big names in the communications industry (ever heard of Microsoft, Canon, Cisco, MCI?), it is well worth an hour or more of your time. In addition to resources and links, it has a series of fascinating <a href="http://www.gsn.org/gsn/articles/index.html">articles</a> on integrating the Internet into the classroom.<P>

What are you planning to do this New Year's Eve?<P>

Same old, same old? Dress up in your most glamorous clothes, go to parties, stay up late, drink more than you're used to? Or keep the TV on until midnight and join the crowd in Times Square, counting down the last seconds until 1997. What fun! Yippee! <P>

Not.<P>

We all feel we ought to do something to mark the change of dates, but for some reason, some times, our celebrations can seem dull. Tiresome. And then there is the waking up on New Year's morning with headache and dragon-mouth. <P>

Although I'm not a nouveau Puritan -- I like my martinis dry (shaken or stirred), and dinner just doesn't taste right without a glass of wine or two -- New Year's Eve without booze seems like an intriguing novelty.<P>

In fact, it's more than a novelty. More than 160 cities across in North America mark First Night with spirited, but alcohol-free celebrations. From Boston, Massachusetts, to Eugene, Oregon; Charlottesville, Virginia, to New York City; Calgary, Alberta, to Martha's Vineyard, whole families of revelers take to the streets. Tickets are sold in the form of buttons that allow the wearer access to the events including music, dance, street performers and a wide variety of other entertainments, often capped off with fireworks at midnight. <P>

<img src="1stnight.gif" width=75 height=150 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

First Night originated in Boston twenty years ago, other cities have only just started. Most attract crowds with their alternate approach to celebrating the first night of the next year.<P>

There are Internet home pages for some of the celebrations, with schedules, maps, information on how to buy buttons, find food, get around, and all the other logistical stuff you need if you're planning to stay up all night and mingle with crowds in a big or medium-sized city. <P>

Boston, has a <a href="http://www.firstnight.org/">truly cool Website</a> to promote and inform. There's even an interactive events planner where you can check the types of entertainment you are interested in and get back a listing with times and places of appropriate events. The Boston site also has <a href="http://www.firstnight.org/otherfn.html">links</a> to First Night Web sites for other cities.<P>

<a href="http://www.FirstNightNYC.com/">New York City's First Night site</a> is another fine one, with extensive listings. Events that are suitable for children are so marked. Several scheduled event warn revelers that they may be very crowded. Looking over the offerings, I saw lots of things I would rather do than stand shoulder to shoulder in Times Square, watching the clock. Storytelling, ice-skating, dancing, Jazz, and more.<P>

Some sites weren't fully functioning when I visited them, but they probably will be after Christmas, when events planners can focus on the Next Big Thing. I hope so.<P>

<img src="1stnighterie.gif" width=249 height=242 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

<a href="http://www.1stnight.com/">First Night Coast-to-Coast</a> has a listing of all the <a href="http://www.1stnight.com/parties.htm">First Night parties</a>, with telephone numbers for more information, and a few home page addresses. This site was still under construction when I visited, but if they get it finished in time, it will be a fine place to enjoy a virtual New Year's Eve party online as well as work on your New Year's resolutions. (You know: lose weight, get rich, be nicer, read War and Peace. Same old, same old.)<P>

You could even pour yourself a glass of champagne before you log onto the computer, if you wish, set the alarm for the stroke of midnight and toast your fellow cybernauts across the 'Net. <P>

Happy New Year. May you be blessed with virtual bubbles throughout '97!<P>

<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Whether your children get a regular allowance or depend on odd jobs for income, you, as their parent, would like them to save some of  that money, perhaps even use it wisely.<P>

Children are notorious spendthrifts. There are so many calls on their money -- clothes, music, entertainment, candy -- that their money can seem to evaporate like water on a hot griddle.<P>

Some parents require their children to save money, and some children actually save on their own.  Many are simply overwhelmed by the consumer culture that tugs seductively on the purse strings of young and old alike. <P>

What bait will attract kids to save? Once they're interested in saving, what are their options?<P>

The piggybank approach is a start. Most piggybanks I see these days have a plug in the bottom so you can sneak a few coins or bills out without "breaking the bank." Too easy.  <P>

An Electric Library Question of the Day was: <a href="http://www.elibrary.com/intuit/10005/">How do I teach my Kids about Money?</a> Jump to the series of links to newspaper and magazine articles addressing the subject. At least you'll know you aren't alone with the question. Articles range from, "<a href="http://www.elibrary.com/intuit/10005/fetch/kidsm_01.htm">Teaching Kids Early about Money</a>," a September 1995 Tennessee Tribune article, to "<a href="http://www.elibrary.com/intuit/10005/fetch/kidsm_10.htm">Businesses your child can start and run</a>" from a December 1991 edition of Black Enterprise Magazine. The latter has a terrific list of books and newsletters for "Kidpreneurs" at the end. <P>

Many banks encourage children to open savings accounts and exempt them from regular bank fees. <P>

A bank that's making an Internet effort to engage kids early is the <a href="http://www.mercantilebank.com/lawrence/clubkids/clubinfo.html">Mercantile Bank</a> in Lawrence, Kansas.  A Club for Kids, for the under-seventeen set, offers prizes for those who meet their quarterly savings goals, and a free piggy bank to save money in between deposits. Online forms are available for download, as is <a href="http://www.mercantilebank.com/lawrence/personal/accounts/kidsclub.html">complete information for parents</a> on fees and responsibilities. <P>

Once your child has saved up at least a hundred dollars, he or she might want to put it to work. The <a href="http://www.younginvestor.com/">Young Investors Web Site</a> sponsored by the Stein Roe Young Investors Fund proposes to teach teenagers and younger children a little about investing. (Incidentally, they would also like to let folks glance over the prospectus of the Young Investors Fund, $100 minimum investment.)<P>

The site is promising, though a little sparse. There are a few articles, a few games, a few links....<P>

When you first sign onto the site, you are asked for your name, age and whether you're a boy or a girl. I lied  ;^)  and said I was a 16 year old girl. You get a choice of guides, each with his, her or its own personality: Planet Lisa loves to ski and prefers ecologically responsible investment, Webster is conservative, Blad is into high-tech stocks, etc.<P>

Apparently if you are under 13, the appearance of the site is simpler than the one for older teenagers, but the one I saw was pretty simple. There are a couple of games to download: <a href="http://www.younginvestor.com/moneytration.html">Money-Tration</a>, a version of Concentration and a Wall Street and investing trivia game. The site promises that the Young Investors online Stock Market Challenge is coming soon, so keep an eye out if you are interested.<P>

Make sure to click the <a href="http://www.younginvestor.com/parents.html">Stuff for Parents</a> button. Syndicated columnist Dr. Tightwad is there as is a college calculator and a link to the <a href="http://www.younginvestor.com/YI/youngp.html">Young Investors Fund</a> site where you can download a prospectus.<P>

If all of this works, and your child becomes an avid money manager and investor (miracles do happen) he or she should visit <a href="http://www.fool.com/">Motley Fool</a>: The Online Financial Forum For The Individual Investor. It's entertaining enough to hold the attention of the youthful investor, and serious enough to attract flocks of adult investors and affect the performance of certain stocks. The Fools have a new Internet site or you can use keyword Fool for the AOL version. <P>

Just remember, conventional stockbrokers don't know what to make of the Fools' investment strategy, and the Fools don't have a lot of respect for conventional stockbrokers.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>50 Fastest Web Sites<BR>Are Quick to Load</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


One day the World Wide Web will be perfect. In that ideal future, Web sites will download quickly, plug-ins and applets will work without crashing your computer.  Traffic on the Information Super Highway will run like clockwork.<P>

In your dreams.<P>

Take heart from the fact that you aren't the only one who longs for that ideal future. Besides, if there aren't improvements in speed and clarity, many users of the WWW may soon loose interest. That might improve performance for remainers.<P>

<img src="Fast50.gif" width=180 height=90 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

While debates rage about conserving bandwidth, at least one site has taken a different approach, showcasing Web pages that "will almost fly into you computer!"<P>

I'm sorry to say that even with my 33.6 kbs modem, the sites didn't exactly FLY into my computer, but at least I didn't have time for several hands of Hearts while I waited for them.<P>

<a href="http://www.zazz.com/fast50/index.shtml">Fast 50 Web Sites</a> is a different kind of hot list, with sites in categories including Business and Finance, Computers and the Internet, Literature, Miscellaneous, Children and Education, Reference, Sports, Food & Health, Travel, History & Biography.<P>

Sites were chosen not only because they download quickly, but also because their contents are interesting. Though some of them have fairly elegant layouts, they are all simply designed, with few if any graphics.<P>

Take for example the <a href="http://www.sec.gov">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> site. Its only graphic is the SEC logo with a quote from William O. Douglas, who was  SEC Chairman from 1937 to 1939. Otherwise the page consists of a few links to current news items, and buttons down the side linking to: About the SEC; Investor Assistance & Complaints; EDGAR Database; SEC Digests & Statements; Small Business Information; Current SEC Rulemaking; Enforcement Actions and Other Sites To Visit. If you're looking for information, it's the kind of site you hope to find.<P>

Not all the Fast-50 sites are dry stuff like the SEC.  There's a Children's Literature Newsletter,  Cool Places for Kids (Links), the invaluable AltaVista Search Engine, and my favorite source of  news of new Web sites: Netsurfer Digest.<P>

Mathematicians will enjoy <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistoryTopics.html">History Topics in Math</a>, a straight list of hyperlinks with fascinating titles such as Babylonian and Egyptian mathematics, Pi through the ages, The four colour theorem, Topology enters mathematics, and Longitude and the Acadmie Royale. It originates from the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.<P>

If your tastes tend more toward letters than numbers, <a href="http://www.mk.net/~dt/Bibliomania/fiction">BIBLIOMANIA Fiction Library</a> has links to the texts of  40 books that were probably on your summer reading list back in high school: works of the likes of Louisa May Alcott, H. Rider Haggard, Jules Verne, James Joyce, Charles Dickens, etc.  At the bottom of the page is a link to the <a href="http://www.mk.net/~dt/Bibliomania/index.html">Bibliomania</a> home page. The home page has a few dancing graphics so it doesn't load as fast, but it is worth a visit for links to the Reference, Non-Fiction and Poetry libraries.<P>

For those who look to the Web for entertainment, the Fast-50 list includes an <a href="http://csugrad.cs.vt.edu/~eburke/anagrams.html">Anagram Generator</a>. Watch out for this one, it can be addictive! <P>

For instance, an anagram for catbird is "cab dirt" -- ouch. But anagrams for Kitty & Robin are "knit by riot" and "I tort by ink." Here's one: WebPointers is "top web siren" Yeah! (There's a "guaranteed non-offensive version" available for those with good taste...)<P>

The Fast 50 site is conducting a poll. Visitors are invited to select up to three of their favorite among the 50 sites and submit their choices before December 31. The winners will be announced in January. Visitors can also submit their favorite fast-loading sites for consideration.<P>

Even though this site is only a small voice of sanity  in the wilderness of massive slow-loading Web pages, I hope that it will be heard. The Fast 50 list is proof that a Web page doesn't need to be glitzy and complicated to merit attention. If more site developers follow this example, the future of the Internet will surely be brighter. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Free Samples Are Worth<BR>What You Pay for Them</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Buying a book because you like the picture on the cover or buying a record after reading a review in the paper can sometimes lead to disappointment.<P>

After all, the aphorism "you can't judge a book by its cover," is frequently repeated because it is often true.<P>

I've found a partial solution to the dilemma on the Web. Two Internet sites (at least) have sprung up to offer "free samples" of books or music to potential customers.<P>

<img src="dialabook.gif" width=250 height=273 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

The first is a small, sleek site called Dial A Book <a href="http://www1.psi.net/chapterone/">Chapter One</a> which lets you read the first chapters of more than 360 books, online, and then order them online if you wish.<P>

The second is a massive site called Tunes.com which offers 30-second RealAudio samples of more than 200,000 pieces of music before ordering online.<P>

Chapter One has a rather eclectic selection, including first chapters of books recently reviewed by Atlantic Monthly, the C-SPAN Booknotes television program, Astronomy, and Foreign Affairs Magazine; books from leading public policy organizations and major university presses; American Library Association Newbery Award Children's books; Chess books selected by the U.S. Chess Federation; eleven Bible translations; and Ziff-Davis and Albion Books computer books.<P>

It isn't going to give the massive Amazon.com bookselling site a run for its money, but for a small site with a limited audience, it's not bad at all. At least you don't have to wait for it to appear on your screen.<P>

The book chapters are presented in straight text, without any illustrations or design touches. Some of us might agree with the young protagonist of <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/People/rgs/alice-table.html">Alice in Wonderland</a>: "'... what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'"<P>

For others, though, it's a great help to be permitted to read a few pages of a book without guilt or obligation.<P>

As I read through some of the online first chapters, I thought that though they may have been reviewed by prestigious periodicals, the reviews may not have been all positive. I wished the site linked to reviews if available online.<P>

At the other end of the scale is <a href="http://www.tunes.com">Tunes.com</a>. <P>

Talk about a slow site -- if it weren't for the fact that the selection is huge and there is a great deal of useful information about all sorts of musicians, I would never go near it. As it is, I spent an hour or more there, chewing my fingernails with frustration as I waited for the next list of tunes, artist's biography or 30-second music sample to download. <P>

In addition to the nearly quarter of a million songs you can preview, they offer untold numbers of albums for sale without samples. You can browse by genre, style, instrument or region, or you can search for a specific artist, composer, album or song title, or record company. The site also contains reviews, interviews and discographies. <P>

The site depends on the new beta release of <a href="http://www.prognet.com/products/">RealAudio</a> to deliver the sound samples. <P>

In this case, when they say beta, they really mean it. I'm sure that anyone with a super-fast, direct Internet connection with argue with me, but I found RA 3.0 unsatisfactory -- in fact almost intolerable. Yes, the sound quality is ever so much better than the earlier version, but the only sound clip I downloaded that played all the way through with only a little minor static from time to time was from RealAudio's own site.<P>

The clips from Tunes.com consisted of a few seconds at a time of excellent quality, interrupted by the kind of static that made me think walkie-talkie or World War II BBC broadcasts into enemy territory.<P>

Tunes.com's inventory and excellent organization, and their secure and simple online ordering process, will keep them in business, however I hope for their sake that the quality of the sound clips improves quickly! <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Web Pages Designed for Business</font></center></b>


<font size =3>






<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Recently we stayed in a bed and breakfast in New York State's Finger Lakes area. I found it through the Internet. <P>

The <a href="http://www.fingerlakes.net/redhouse/">Red House Country Inn</a> is a quaint 19th-century former farmhouse near Seneca Lake. It is decorated with crafts and collectibles which are also available for sale in a little shop. There are goats, cats, and champion Samoyed dogs. <P>

As far as I could tell, however, there wasn't a computer on the place. When we left, we were presented with a handwritten bill.<P>

<img src=redhouseinn.GIF width=213 height=159 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

I asked the innkeepers whether they thought it was worthwhile to have a home page on the Internet, and they did indeed. In fact, innkeeper Joan Martin told me that a large number of their guests tell them they found the Inn on the Internet. <P>

A small graphics design firm in nearby Trumansburg handled all the Web site design and maintenance, she told me, when I asked how they'd developed the site. <P>

On my return home, I visited the home page of the firm, <a href="http://www.spidergraphics.com/">Spider Graphics</a> in Trumansburg, and discovered that they create and maintain Web sites of all levels of complexity for all sizes of businesses. I emailed to ask for more information.<P>

A week or so later, on a Saturday afternoon, I had a call from Spider Graphics founding partner Don Ellis.  He told me a little bit about his company, its history and current status.<P>

I already had a hint that they must be doing well. Our conversation took place in November, but the firm's home page hadn't been updated since April! That could mean one of two things. Either they'd gone out of business and forgotten about it, or they had so much paying work no-one had time to update their site. The second turned out to be true.<P>

According to Ellis, the firm has 14 employees including writers, graphics designers, programmers, software developers, a linguist, an engineer, an architect and an oenologist (that's a wine expert to the rest of us.)  Most of the <a href="http://www.spidergraphics.com/spd/spdresumes.html#top">Spiders</a> have a combination of skills. At least half are women. One of them, a programmer, works entirely from home. <P>

More than 100 businesses have come online with help from the Spiders, some of them wildly successful, said Ellis. Among the most successful are businesses involved in books and wine, he said. The Spiders number <a href="http://www.spidergraphics.com/spd/sample/spdsmpl.html#top">among their clients</a> more than half of the Finger Lakes wineries.<P>

Spider Graphics was conceived of in November 1994 and opened on the first business day of 1995. To their surprise, clients have come to them mostly by word of mouth, said Ellis, "There is an endless local market." <P>

He rather wistfully admitted that he would have liked to do more work at a distance, but he isn't complaining.<P>

I asked him what Web site development costs. It's not an easy question to answer, because a company like Spider Graphics can do so many different things, from straight text and pictures to fancy multimedia sites.<P>

"The current thing for me to overcome is how to help clients understand that they are going to get excited about their Web pages," said Ellis. An initial $4000 budget can easily go to $8000 when they get excited about the possibilities. <P>

The Spiders run an almost completely paperless office, and ask their clients to provide information in digital form where possible. As most of their clients already had web pages when they hired Spider Graphics, that hasn't been as difficult as it may sound. If it weren't for the government, we wouldn't have paper at all," said Ellis.<P>

Recently a salesman came to sell them a copy machine, and couldn't understand why they didn't have one or need one. When he left, they still didn't have a copier... but they had sold him a Web page.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Skin Website Takes<BR>Best in Show</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



Do you remember the girl in high school who had perfect skin? Never a spot? And she said all she ever used on her face was soap and water?<P>

And the other one who was a martyr to virulent acne and had to take prescription medicine that didn't really help that much?<P>

The girl with the perfect skin was probably captain of the basketball team and class president. The girl with acne probably kept her shoulders slightly hunched and seemed awkward and shy around others.<P>

Your skin has a lot to do with how people perceive you. Nowhere is this exploited more than in the movies. Dermatologist Vail Reese's award winning Website, <a href="http://itsa.ucsf.edu/~vcr/Dermcin.html">Dermatology in the Cinema</a>, shines a spotlight on the ways in which skin conditions, from rosacea to sun damage to tattoos, are used in the cinema to symbolize a character's personality and morality. <P>

Winner of the Best Web Site award in the 1996 AMA Medical Film Competition, Dr. Reese's site isn't heavy-handed at all. He uses the simple facts -- photographs of actors showing their real or fictional skin conditions with a brief description of the character they portray -- to indicate how the cinema takes advantage of our tendency to judge one another on the basis of appearances.<P>

There are many lessons and resources at this site, but they are offered with a light, entertaining touch. <P>

Movie enthusiasts will enjoy background information about the actors and movies they love, websurfers will like the well designed Website, and those who struggle with skin conditions can find links to Dermatology patient support groups.<P>

There is more than one cautionary tale imbedded in this entertaining site. The category, <a href="http://itsa.ucsf.edu/~vcr/Evil.html">Representations of  Evil</a>, points out how often movies use skin conditions to signal that a character is evil. James Bond's wicked adversary Stavro Blofeld has a fencing scar from his hairline, through his eye, to his jaw. Freddy, star of the Nightmare on Elm Street, etc., has terrible burn scars covering his entire face. Parents whose children "forget" to use sunscreen will find the Dick Tracy villain, Pruneface, a useful visual aid when pointing out what sun damage can do to a person's good looks. <P>

Before and after photographs of Brigitte Bardot and Robert Redford, also victims of sun damage, are shown in the section on <a href="http://itsa.ucsf.edu/~vcr/Actors.html">Actors with Skin Findings</a>. Other skin conditions in this section include W.C. Field's rosacea which gave him his bulbous nose, actor Morgan Freeman's DPNs, the little dark bumps on his cheeks common among African-Americans, and traction alopecia or hair loss from too-tight corn-row braids worn by actors such as Whoopi Goldberg and Bo Derek.<P>

The site also has links to websites of organizations such as National Rosacea Society, NOAH (National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation), National Vitiligo Foundation, National Psoriasis Foundation, Action Programme for the Elimination of Leprosy, National Registry for Ichthyosis and Related Disorders, Klippel-Trenauney support group and United Scleroderma Foundation.<P>

Granted that this is a well-designed site with great graphics and useful information, but surely, you think, it can't have had much competition for the AMA's best medical Website award!<P>

Well, just a short browse with the help of your favorite search engine will show you that you may be wrong to assume that. Complicated medical websites are out there in abundance, all demanding attention. <P>

There's the University of Iowa's <a href="http://vh.radiology.uiowa.edu/">The Virtual Hospital</a>: The Apprentice's  Assistant, for example. Presented by the University Department of Radiology's Electric Differential Multimedia Laboratory, the site has multimedia information for both patients and healthcare providers, as well as links to other internet health-related sites. <P>

Then there's the AMA's own Official <a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/">Home Page</a> with links to AMA Health Insight, a guide to health resources on the Internet, and AMA Physician Select, with a database of 650,000 doctors licensed to practice in the United States where you can find a doctor by name, specialty or location anywhere in the country.<P>

If you want further proof of the number of medical sites on the Internet, glance at <a href="http://www-sci.lib.uci.edu/HSG/HSGuide.html">Martindales' Health Science Guide '96</a>. <P>

'Nuff said.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Learn to Cope <BR>With Learn2 dotcom</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Some people seem to know everything -- how to make a bed, change a diaper, understand a football game, iron a shirt, cope with a hangover. <P>

Most of us don't. If we ever learned, we've forgotten. And it distresses us. <P>

I mean, don't you feel inadequate when faced with a brown, hairy coconut? I do. How do you get into the thing without making a mess and breaking furniture?<P>

Not to worry. A site on the Internet has the answers to these and other domestic, sartorial, and social dilemmas.<P>

<img src=learn2mark.jpeg width=195 height=91 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

If you can't drag in an expert to demonstrate the proper technique, <a href="http://www.learn2.com">Learn2.com</a> is online to help. A cross between Emily Post, the guy at the hardware store, your mother, and your older, more experienced next-door neighbor, Learn2.com offers "2torials" on important life skills. It's the work of Panmedia, a Sausalito, California, company that "specializes in the design, production and implementation of new media." Learn2.com seems to exist strictly for the public good.<P>

Some 2torials, like the one on <a href="http://www.learn2.com/05/0573/0573.html">separating an egg</a>, have animated illustrations to help. Others, like the one on <a href="http://www.learn2.com/05/0544/0544.html">understanding football</a>, should only be undertaken if you really WANT to understand the game.<P>

On a recent visit to the site, I read directions for <a href="http://www.learn2.com/06/0602/0602.html">opening a coconut</a>. When I was a child living in Central America, I'd watch strong little men climb palm trees and return with the large green nuts, which they'd neatly open with precise blows from their machetes. They'd pour the milky-watery liquid into a cup, then neatly slice out the white meat, as if it were an easy task.<P>

 I don't trust myself with a machete, and I'm not one for shinnying up coconut trees, so I avoided coconuts until our son wheedled me into buying one for him. I beat at it with a hammer until it kind of broke open, and the liquid went all over the floor. My standing as an expert went down appreciably in my son's eyes. <P>

If I'd had Learn2.com, I would have known exactly how to get the milk out, and where to strike the shell with my knife handle to open the nut. <P>


Not everyone needs or wants to open a coconut. However, before deciding that you already know everything you need to know, browse the site.<P>

There's a section on <a href="http://www.learn2.com/06/0611/0611.html">gift wrapping</a>. Unless you can get your secretary or significant other to do it for you, or are willing to pay the store, you probably need this skill. In fact, it may be worth learning so you can charge others for the service. The other day I heard a <a href="http://www.usc.edu/marketplace/">Marketplace Radio</a> broadcast about a store in Manhattan that charges $100 and more, just for wrapping a present! Fifty-some dollars a yard for ribbon! <P>

If you're entertaining over the holiday season -- or anytime for that matter -- you'll want to review <a href="http://www.learn2.com/06/0608/0608.html">Learn2 Set a Table</a>, a 2torial that covers everything from which direction the knife blade faces in a simple place setting to how to arrange a full-fledged formal setting using all your grandmother's silverware. Well, they don't go into the details of shrimp forks, asparagus tongs, marrow spoons and all the specialized Victorian pieces, but that's just as well, don't you think?<P>

This site is wonderfully useful. If it doesn't have what you need, check <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~cooperag/quiz0003.htm">Anne's Quiz #3: Emily Post's Etiquette</a>, for additional help. There you'll find an illustration of a formal place setting, as well as the definition of "semiformal," the obligations of a godparent, and other important tips. <a href="http://www.pacificnet.net/~cooperag/">Anne Cooper</a> of Moorpark, California, an earthquake and etiquette expert, compiled the quiz based on the 1984 edition of Miss Post's book.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Games for Business Strategy</font></center></b>


<font size =3>






<center>by Robin Lind</center>


How do you unwind when you're at work and find yourself momentarily pushed beyond the limits of practical productivity? Bother someone else? Play computer solitaire? Net surfing? <P>

<img src=chess.gif width=200 height=200 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

They're questions that ought to be of interest to both office workers and their managers, especially those in a "Dilbert-like" setting where every minute may be monitored by your computer (and "Catbert" the Evil Human Resources Director.) Is the employee playing a game with his computer goofing off, recharging his batteries or honing the edge of essential skills?<P>

Following Thanksgiving's traditional overindulgence I found myself in the company of a Washington lawyer, a New York investment banker and a Cornell undergraduate, all looking to the Web for relief<P>

The banker pointed us to a free chess game site called <a href="http://chess.onenet.net/chess/">Fixation</a> which was written by Yale computer science student, <a href="http://powered.cs.yale.eud:8000/~miller/comp/mystuff.html">Adam Miller</a>. <P>

Fixation, a Macintosh client for Free Internet Chess Servers and Internet Chess Club, allows users to register with anonymous "handles" and then play others from around the world who are logged in at the same time. Each player earns a rating based on wins, losses and draws. Usually a half dozen or more are logged on at any one time.<P>

When you log in you can see who is connected and what their ratings are, issuing challenges to those whose ratings are close to your own. If another player accepts your challenge, a large chess board appears on a new screen and the game begins. (White moves first, of course.)<P>

Each player has a limited amount of time to move. If you run out of time you forfeit the game. The outcome determines future rankings. It's intellectually stimulating. It's relaxing. It's quick. Because it's connecting you to an actual person there is an element of quirky unpredictability that can't be had from playing against a computer. It's the sort of thing the Internet is good at. <P>

Obviously it is hard to gauge an opponent's strength when he is anonymous. Fixation, however, allows you to exchange "conversation" with your opponent between moves by typing messages on the parent screen.<P>

In challenging "Diomedes" our banking friend first sent the message "Happy thxgvg;" then moved pawn to Queen four. <P>

Diomedes moved his own pawn and responded "?"<P>

"I said happy thanksgiving, you curmudgeon!" the banker typed back, and he built a conversation from there, lines typed in and sent between moves, as the little onscreen clock ticked off the seconds remaining.<P>

"I will put you on my no-play list" responded Diomedes
"Awww, I was just sending a little holiday cheer."
"I'm not a native speaker in English" wrote Diomedes.
"What are ya, a Greek?"
"No,"  answered Diomedes, "I'm German... I chose a Greek name because I love the old mythology of Greece..."
"Women?"
"No, and you?"
"Konnen sie thanksgiving?"
"Yes, I just thought you were making fun of me... You know Germans aren't very funny usually."
"Move you Prussian snail..."<P>

Queen, bishops and knights gone, Diomedes resigned and offered to play again.<P>

"Let's do another one. By the way I'm Bavarian."
"Entschuldegung. Ich bin ein Prussian," typed the banker (who was in no way a Prussian by any stretch of the genetic imagination.)
"You are what, a Prussian?"
"Ja vol."
"It's Jawohl!!!"
"How do you know? You're Bavarian."
"I had to join our famous army for one year, yeah!"
"Do you know the name of that composer from Hamburg?
"A bit more specific perhaps..."
"I think his name was Eisenberg or something..."
"I don't know..."
"He wrote the bratwurst symphony..."<P>

Cornered, frustrated, distracted, his time used up, Diomedes then was forced to resign again.<P>

"You're making fun of me..."
"I'm just trying to waste your time."
"I think so. and I have to switch windows, so I'm not really playing chess at the moment you know."<P>

The deliberate cheekiness of the young banker in pursuing psychological warfare to give himself the upperhand in this game against an anonymous Bavarian impressed us all. <P>

It gave me a renewed cause for thanksgiving: thanks that I was not engaged in negotiations with him across the board room table. The Bratwurst symphony indeed!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Live Chat is Unpredictable</font></center></b>


<font size =3>






<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Live chat is a big attraction to many in the online community. <P>

I'm not one of them. <P>

I often feel left behind and confused when I try to join a chat. For one thing, I'm put off by the overwhelming amount of blather.<P>

For me, entering a chat is often like arriving at a cocktail party where everyone is talking at once--and hardly anyone is listening. <P>

At other times I have come upon Internet chat areas that appear entirely empty, even when an "event" is "scheduled." <P>

I'm sure I still have a lot to learn, but I feel a little like Andy Rooney: I just don't get it.<P>

The choice between  deserted chat rooms and pointless chatter is rather pitiful. I'm not going to give up yet, however.<P>

<img src=avatar.gif width=150 height=73 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

America Online is beta-testing (that means it isn't quite ready yet) a new software called Virtual Places which I find very promising (AOL Keyword "VP Beta"). In <a href="http://members.aol.com/pspservice/avatar.htm">Virtual Places</a>, you download and install software that allows you to chat in real time anywhere on the Internet. Your conversation is limited to others who also have the software, but if you like, you can get together a tour group and take them with you on a trip across the Web. This beats an AOL "private room" because as you converse you can show people sites you think they'd like.<P>

<img src=avatar1.gif width=48 height=64 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Virtual Places allows you to use an "avatar" or small image to represent you as you talk. I find the avatars distracting. The conversation takes place both as text on the bottom of the screen and balloons issuing forth from the avatars. If you prefer to see the Website unobscured by a sprinkling of avatars, click on view and select "browser only." Selecting "AOL classic" allows you to follow the conversation as text. <P>

<img src=avatar2.gif width=48 height=64 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

If you love the idea of avatars, there are several sites where you can download images to use. WBS has several libraries of animals, <a href="http://images.wbs.net/wbs/pics/vegetable/">vegetables</a> and minerals you can visit; a company called PSP Service has some you might like, and many of the denizens of Virtual Places are anxious to trade avatars. <P>

<img src=avatar3.gif width=48 height=64 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

As it stands right now, Virtual Places is fun if you can get a group of friends or acquaintances to all download the software. Then you can use it to get together at the Website of you choice and chat. VP uses the AOL browser rather than one of the more refined browsers such as Netscape or Internet Explorer, so fancy Websites won't look so hot. Among Websites that already take advantage of the software is Pastor Barb's <a href="http://members.aol.com/barbaraak/church.htm">Cyber Church Chat Room</a> which meets every Sunday at 3 p.m. EST.<P>

<img src=avatar4.gif width=48 height=64 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

If you are looking for people with common interests to meet and "talk" to, or if you want to discuss politics, business, romance or other topics of interest, <a href="http://home.netscape.com/assist/helper_apps/">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://www.mckinley.com/feature.cgi?events_bd">Magellan</a> both have lists of current live Internet events, available in different formats. For a longer list of chats and events, check <a href="http://www.solscape.com/chat/">Sol -- The Largest  Chatroom Index on the Internet</a>. <P>

<a href="http://www.hprf.odu.edu/chatterbox/">OmniChat Interactive Chat System</a> hosts chats on business, religion, romance, books, and sports, none very well attended when I visited. It also allows you to create your own chatroom.<P>

<a href="http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/chat/html/javachat.htm">World Village Chat</a> requires you to have a browser, such as <a href="http://home.netscape.com/assist/helper_apps/">Netscape</a>, that can handle JavaScript to participate in real time, family friendly chat without downloading additional software tools.<P>

WBS also has a variety of chats on specific subjects. When I went to investigate a scheduled <a href="http://wbs.net/webchat3.so?cmd=cmd_doorway:small_business_chat">Small Business chat</a>, I found two people there engaged in desultory conversation. Oh, well.<P>

After many, many hours trying to figure out live chats, I have concluded that you can waste a great deal of time on this particular quest. If you can contrive to get a group together to chat, it could beat a conference call though. <P>

The chief benefit is the unpredictable value in a chat peopled by strangers; it's also, (natch) the chief drawback. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Even The Web<BR>Has A Spot For Dogs</font></center></b><P>


<font size =3>








<img src=101.gif width=180 height=195 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Are you longing for a sweet little puppy? A Dalmatian, perhaps?<P>

Look before you leap.<P>

Newspapers are full of articles warning that Dalmatians aren't for everyone. The SPCA and various animal rights groups have gone into overdrive. With the release of Disney's new movie, 101 Dalmatians, starring dozens of real, adorable pups, the warnings should be heeded.<P>



You may think you want a Dalmatian, but you must not make the choice based strictly on "cute" say those in the know. <P>

These dogs have strong personalities and need regular, vigorous exercise. We are warned that they don't fit easily into every family situation. The breed has a tendency to deafness though it's not at all a certainty. (In fact, my husband says a childhood neighbor's Dalmatian got up and left the room when the first broadcast of Shakespeare's MacBeth was televised... Yes, the devoted family pet slunk out of the room when the television boomed the immortal line: "Out! Out! Damned Spot!")<P>

I can see why all these dog breeders and animal protection types are worried, though. I haven't seen the movie, but I have seen the <a href="http://www.disney.com/101/">Website</a>, and if you think Babe was adorable, wait until you see all those dear little doggies.<P>

Fortunately for all of us, you can adopt a virtual Dalmatian puppy at the site, and then, after reading about how to take care of your puppy, you can "play" with it in Macintosh, Windows or using the Shockwave plug-in!<P>

Awww.<P>

Another bit of interactivity, Pelt Cruella, is the prize if you complete the online puppy search. Download it, and you can drop eggs on her head, have the horse kick her or the ox butt her. The game ends when a pig drops out of the air and lands on her.  It gets old fast.<P>

There are lots of other amusements on the Website, too, including a sweepstakes and information on how the movie was made and the puppies were treated on the set. You can even buy advance tickets online in some cities (not ours, though.)<P>

If you are actually thinking of buying or adopting a real live puppy, there is another site you ought to visit.<P>

Although it doesn't have animations or interactivity, the <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/">Dog Owner's Guide</a> is a must read for prospective dog owners. It includes more than 170 articles on topics such as choosing the right dog, <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/chbreed.html">breed characteristics</a>, dog sports, manners and training, and kids and dogs. <P>

If you are strongly tempted to add a Dalmatian to your family circle, read the section on <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/dal.html">Dalmatian</a> breed characteristics. Here is an excerpt: <P>

"Exercise is of paramount importance. Dals that are not walked or worked daily may develop undesirable behavior patterns and become destructive. ... This is definitely not a breed for a sedate family, a family with very young children, or an elderly couple. A fenced yard is a must, for a Dalmatian that is allowed to run free will do just that, and may wander for many miles before his need for exercise is satisfied."<P>

Do not feel sad, though. You might have to give up your dream to own one of those darling spotted creatures, but this site contains plenty to help you choose precisely the right dog. Whether you need a pal to sit by your feet in front of the fire while you read, or run beside you while you train for the marathon, you'll come away from this site knowing enough to choose wisely.<P>

"Dog breeds are not interchangeable... Some are laid back and gentle, some are dominant; some are noisy; some dig holes, climb fences, and escape through doorways to satisfy their need to run. ... Some are good watchdogs and others are over-friendly."<P>

Use this site to determine what you really expect of a dog who may be part of your family for a decade or more. It can be heartbreaking -- and dangerous -- to take in a dog whose personality clashes with your own.<P>

<font size =3>

Well those drifter's days have passed me now. <BR>
I've got so much more to think about.<BR>
Deadlines and commitments.<BR>
What to leave in, What to leave out.<BR>
<I>--Bob Seger, Running against the Wind</I><P>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Does time sometimes seem to compress and wriggle away from you? Are you "busy, busy, busy" all day long, but then wonder what you actually did?<P>

For some of us, our only free time is when we're commuting. Others have relinquished even that free time, and do business on their cell phones while zooming down the freeways or crawling through rush hour traffic.<P>

It makes us long for the "good old days" when doing laundry or baking was a full day's hard work. Back then, you couldn't be expected to put in a full day at the office, do the shopping on your way home, throw the laundry into the machine, take the kids to ballet class, make dinner and then go to a public hearing on a proposed zoning ordinance after dinner.<P>

<img src=shiftcontrol.gif width=174 height=67 vspace=12 hspace=6 align=left><P>

A tongue-in-cheek article in the British e-zine, <a href="http://www.shiftcontrol.com">Shift Control</a> by Robin Hunt, head of the Guardian and Observer New Media Lab, complains about the European Community's new rule that no one can be forced to work more than 48 hours a week. He describes a work-DAY that would take 48 hours.<P>

An industry has sprung up to help people deal with this situation. Personal planners, calendars and schedule books are omnipresent. <P>

<a href="http://www.daytimer.com/">Day-Timers</a>, Franklin Day Planners, and Covey Seven Habits Organizer Systems, among others,  all offer to help us regain control of our lives. <P>

What's nice, though maybe a little idealistic, is that all of these systems encourage you to think about the big picture. The Covey blurb says "Unlike other systems that focus mainly on crisis-oriented schedules and prioritizing daily activities, the Seven Habits Organizer keeps you focused on relationships and results --the essence of true effectiveness..."<P>

Perhaps Covey's focus is unlike the one behind the little free calendars you get from your Realtor or the Week at a Glance pocket calendars or Day at a Glance desk calendars we all grew up with, but it is essentially the same as <a href="http://www.franklinquest.com/">Franklin Quest</a>'s. Day-Timers are a bit less spiritual, though they look more or less like the other two with an hourly schedule, to-do list, a place to record expenses, and a page for notes and commitments.<P>

All of these systems also have excellent Web sites you can visit for more information and, of course, to order the planners, tapes, videos, seminars and miscellaneous peripherals.<P>

At the Franklin Quest site, you can learn how the members of the "Jefferson Family," Mom, Dad, kids, dog, use their planners. <a href="http://www.franklinquest.com/picnic.html">Picnic, the dog</a>, actually doesn't have one, but once enjoyed a brief taste of the genuine leather cover on Mrs. J's when she left it within reach. He liked it a lot.<P>

 The Day Timer's site has Time Tips of the Day, an <a href="http://www.daytimer.com/cgi-bin/quiz.cgi?src=tmq">interactive test</a> to rate your time management skills, and an archive of articles and tips. <P>

<a href="http://www.covey.com">Covey</a> site opens with the statement: "Traditional time management suggests that by doing things more efficiently you will eventually gain control of your life and this increased control will bring the peace of mind and fulfillment you are looking for. We disagree." <P>

If you want to find what Covey could possibly mean by that, go to their site and see if their "<a href="http://www.covey.com/workshops/ftf/">First Things First</a> Approach" might work for you. <P>

On a personal note: I use one of these systems fairly regularly and I like it a lot. Unfortunately, it hasn't cured me of missing deadlines or failing to return phone calls. <P>

At least I can keep track of all the things I didn't do....

Search As You Will,<BR>Someone May Be Watching You</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Do you ever feel as if someone were looking over your shoulder while you surf the 'Net? If you've ever used the <a href="http://www.mckinley.com/">Magellan Search Engine</a>, you may well be right. That voyeur might even have been me.<P>

Magellan, which provides a very useful search engine also has an amusing side line: <a href="http://voyeur.mckinley.com">Magellan Voyeur</a>. Voyeur allows you to look in on real time searches, and if the search subject interests you, to proceed to the very search results being returned to the actual searcher. <P>

Now, before you get alarmed let me calm you by saying that as far as I can tell there is no way to identify the searcher or learn anything at all about him or her. <P>

What you see with Voyeur is a list of search topics. The list changes every 20 seconds if you have Netscape 2.0 or higher, and is a great screen saver or inspiration aid. Although sex and orgies and stuff like that reappear with depressing frequency, a recent list of search topics included Rockford Fosgate, Pacific Telesis, Bighorn River, Primordial Soup Kitchen, ergonomic keyboard, Everton Football Club, hydrology, vegetarianism health nutrition, endless tubing, Landstat Caribbean, Wisconsin weather, US banks, and makroeconomy.<P>

If you can react before the list changes and click on a topic that interests you, you can find out what the searcher found. I click on <a href="http://www.rockfordcorp.com/fosgate/index.html">Rockford Fosgate</a>, for example, and discovered that it's a car audio equipment company.<P>

Knowing me as you do, you won't be surprised to hear that I was intrigued by <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~griffeat/kitchen.html">Primordial Soup Kitchen</a>. Mostly, I wanted to know if there was such a thing or if the search engine came up empty-handed.<P>

There is such a thing, the work of "a math prof at the University of Wisconsin - Madison whose research these days focuses on self-organization of random cellular automata." Professor David Griffeath produces computer graphics and animations "that illustrate the ability of local parallel update rules to generate spatial structure from disordered initial states." Whatever. They're pretty, though, and you can view them, download them, or send them as virtual postcards from the site.<P>

I've found other interesting sites and topics while idly watching the constantly changing lists on Voyeur. <P>

The other day, I noticed someone had done a search on the jazz musician, <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/SRoyall/homepage.htm">Django Reinhardt</a>, and turned up lots of sites. I'm going back to look at those soon. <P>

Another time, I looked in on a search for addresses of Australian Embassies. Because Magellan searches for sites that have one or more of the words in the initial search, the results for this one included lots of sites about Australia and lots of embassy sites. <P>

What caught my eye first was <a href="http://israel.org/sites.html">Israeli Internet Sites</a>, the "Hot List" of the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Anyone who has an interest in the national and local government, history, culture, economics, and current events of Israel and the Jewish world should find this long list of links invaluable. It will be even more valuable to those who read Hebrew, as some of the links lead to sites in that language. If this find wasn't serendipity, I don't know what else you'd call it.<P>

Magellan's search engine isn't much use when the searcher misspells the topic. "Makroeconomy," for example, turned up nothing, but when I corrected the spelling myself, to macroeconomy, the search returned 35 hits. The more commonly used term, "macroeconomics," turned up 1,479 hits.  
I have to tell you that some people who use this search engine REALLY can't spell. <P>

While "makroeconomy" might be an innocent misspelling by someone whose native language is other than English, how do you explain some of the others I've seen, like "kaledascope" and "pitures?" People who can't spell must believe that search engines are "wuthless," since they never find what they're looking for.<P>

Online Shopping Extends<BR>Catlogue Reach</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


The catalogs have been arriving for some months now, and I expect all well-organized, efficient, forward-looking folks have already finished their holiday shopping. Good for them.<P>

Not me, though. The catalogs are piled on my bedside table and on my desk and in the bathroom, and I've marked certain pages with little colored flags. Gift information overload!<P>

If, as they say, "it's the thought that counts," all the people on my list should feel well taken care of, however. <P>

While the Internet contributes mightily to information overload, online shopping can also help alleviate some of the stress. Many mail order companies have Internet outposts.<P>


<img src=llbean.gif width=175 height=164 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

Venerable <a href="http://www.llbean.com/">L.L. Bean</a> of Maine, granddaddy of the catalogue industry,  has an intricate and interesting site. As I perused it the other day, I noticed a separate email address for questions about customer service. My husband's Bean boots are just about worn through and need new soles, so I wrote to inquire about costs and procedure. The following morning, a polite letter with all the information I needed was waiting for me in my email in-box. Bean's old-fashioned, gracious customer service has come with them onto the Web. I think Leon Leonwood himself would be pleased. <P>

(Now, how do you send boots as an email attachment. ...?)<P>

Bean's distinguished young cousin, <a href="http://www.landsend.com">Lands' End</a>, also has a Web site to complement their many catalogues. Among those currently decorating my desk is their "Last Chance Before Christmas 1996." In the address block on the back is the line "Requested in-home Nov. 13-15." <P>

Although I'm not a bit happy about my old friends in Dodgeville loading on the guilt and pressure like that, I do rather like their web site. It's cozy, comforting and easy to use. <P>

 The best part of the site is the Intelligent Order Blank. If you're like me you may have a stack of dog-eared catalogs from the various Lands' End enterprises, offering household linens, children's clothes, career woman office clothes, luggage, "et cetera, et cetera" (as the King of Siam used to say).<P>

With the Intelligent Order Blank, you can consolidate your order in a single Internet experience. Place your stack on the desk next to your PC, go through the catalogs one at a time, enter each item number into the IOB, get a confirmation that what you want is available, and, when you're all done, click your order on its electronic way. I like that.<P>

Another catalog on my desk is the <a href="http://www.mustardweb.com">Mount Horeb Mustard Museum</a>'s Museum of Mustard Art 1997 Exhibition Catalog. This Wisconsin company sells more varieties of mustard than any sane person could imagine existed. Their catalog is great fun, but their Web site is still under construction. That means that although you can admire some of their wares, you still have to call or write to order them. Online ordering is on its way, though.<P>

If you want to send something other than mustard--and who doesn't?--you can visit the pleasant Website of the <a href="http://www.monks.org/cheese.htm">Abbey of Gethesemani</a> in Kentucky to order cheese, fruitcake and bourbon fudge made by the monks. I guess the monks don't choose to hang around waiting for email orders, though. Once you've decided what you want you must print out the order form, fill it in by hand, and send it by fax or snailmail.<P>

The <a href="http://www.flyingnoodle.com">Flying Noodle</a> from Vermont, offers a wild variety of pastas, sauces and olive oils individually or in combinations. You can even sign up for the Flying Noodle's Pasta Club! Mangia, Mangia! Their secure online order forms are quick and easy to use. <P>

Or, you can find baked goods at <a href="http://www.auntidas.com/online.htm">Aunt Ida's Southern Kitchen</a> -- pies, cookies, tea cakes, cinnamon buns, ... yummm -- and order them on line.<P>

Perhaps these sites have too narrow a focus to satisfy all the foodies on your list. Perhaps the <a href="http://tpeaks.com/">Twin Peaks Gourmet Trading  Post</a> will fit the bill with everything from sauces to pies to live Maine Lobsters. Go look . <P>

This is only the tip of the iceberg.<P>

<font size =3>






<center>by Robin Lind</center>


Young, ambitious and computer-struck technophiles expect everything constantly to improve for the better. Occasionally old ways are best.<P>

<img src=yellowpages.gif width=89 height=111 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

A case in point is the 1997 edition of the <a href="http://www.mcp.com/newriders">World Wide Web Yellow Pages</a>, published by New Riders, a subsidiary of Simon & Schuster. It's big. It's impressive. It includes a CD-ROM that works on Windows, Mac and Unix.<P>

Weighing in at just over two pounds, this mammoth compilation of over a thousand pages has an 86-page table of contents, a 56-page introduction, over 700 pages of individual listings, a 35-page appendix of college web sites and a 120-page index.<P>

Approximately 10,000 web sites are categorized by topic in the familiar yellow pages model. Each site includes a 40-50 word summary explaining the site's content. <P>

At $34.99 it's hard to believe this is going to be a runaway best seller but it does offer value for people and businesses that are just beginning to dabble on the Internet. <P>

The introduction is well worth reading if you want to get a basic grounding in the way the Web works. If you're just introducing the Internet or Intranet to your business you'd do very well to have everyone study it.<P>

Unfortunately, the alphabetizing is a little eccentric. It is confusing, for instance, to see web sites within the Books & Authors category go from Cyber-Seuss to Roald Dahl, Le Marquis de Sade, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Dr. Seuss... I understand what they're doing and why they're doing it but it tells me only that this was compiled by propeller heads with scant experience of cataloguing and library science.<P>

As for the CD-ROM: forget it. True, this one includes all the information that's in the book with active hyperlinks to all those sites but you must access it from your Internet browser and the accessing is painfully slow. <P>

A WWW directory is not a static medium: it ought to be growing and changing all the time and ought best be archived on the Web where it can be updated every minute.<P>

And, what do you know, the yellow pages directory IS available on the Web!<P>

Not only is it available on the Web but you can enter your own company's listing at no charge. This will help increase the value of this directory immensely. By next year the directory may be too big to print but the online version should be really useful. <P>

If you want an "enhanced" listing you can pay extra to have logos, pictures or additional text. Even "better" (depending on your perspective) if you buy the enhanced listing your company is guaranteed to come up ahead of someone else's if a search is made in your category. <P>

This can be a two-edged sword. A search on the word "bicycling" brought up a host of sites, the first of which was for Spokes Bike Shop, an "enhanced" listing with artwork. But the second listing was for "Buttman Videos" which turned out to be a purveyor of adult videos. <P>

Say what? Either this is a sorry example of poor judgement or some hacker has already started mucking with the sorting codes.<P>

Finally, I must say that having the printed version in your hands is a major advance over having the CD-ROM.<P>

Why?<P>

Well, for the simple reason that we have all been trained to read. A book lies flat on your desk and you can scan two pages at a time. You can not only find information quickly but you can also benefit from the serendipity of seeing allied and related information you did not realize existed.<P>

You can turn the pages at your own speed, accelerating or slowing as you please, without worrying that the screen will seize up, the connection fail or the computer crash. <P>

The Yellow Pages Directory also passes WebPointers' popular "Four-Bs Test" -- the standard by which we compare all alleged advances in technology: Yes, you can carry it from Bedroom to Bathroom to Bus to Beach.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>
Teachers and Students Both<BR>Benefit from History Sites</font></center></b>


<font size =3>




<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

History comes alive for some of us if we can look at pictures and hear stories about real people. Larger social, anthropological and political issues seem more important when we can imagine what it was like to be alive in a different era.<P>

Several wonderful sites on the Internet fill that need for teachers and students of all periods of history.<P>

For brief, well-told stories that shed new light on familiar historical events you can visit <a href="http://www.amomentintime.com/">A Moment in Time</a>'s site. The Web page is a companion to the Public Radio program of the same name. A handful of illustrated <a href="http://www.amomentintime.com/list.html/">transcripts</a> and RealAudio files of recent broadcasts are available there. If you want more, you can peruse the list of the hundreds of "moments in time" written and produced by University of Richmond historian Dan Roberts and order transcripts that interest you. A link to "<a href="http://www.amomentintime.com/today.html">Today in History</a>" and other good historical sites on the 'Net make the site well worth while.<P>

If you'd rather take a virtual tour of an archaeological site, you can visit the <a href="http://www.dhm.de/museen/stein/stein_e.html">Roman Open Air Museum at Hechingen-Stein</a>. There you can read the history of the 1st-3rd century AD. Villa Rustica in south-west Germany. Eight hundred years after the villa was destroyed, the last German imperial family built their castle which still stands on the Hohenzollern, a nearby mountain overlooking the museum.<P>

The virtual tour of the Villa allows you to peer into the heating system, the baths and the living areas, visit the kitchen, <a href="http://www.dhm.de/museen/stein/tour/tour14e.html">gaze</a> at the nearby castle, and admire the reconstructed section. <P>

Also available in German, the page has links to other sites relating to German archaeology and ancient history. A huge page of <a href="http://www.dhm.de/links.html">links</a> to other museums in Germany as well as worldwide and virtual museums of all descriptions is mostly in German. There are enough similarities with English so you can guess what some words might mean, even if you don't speak the language. For example, what do you think the <a href="http://members.aol.com/minzmuseum/index.html">Pfefferminzmuseum Eichenau</a> might be? If you can't guess, text in English is available at that site.<P>

 If you do speak German and in addition teach ancient history, you might want to visit <a href="http://132.230.36.11/schule/Roemerzeitung/RZ0.HTM">The Roman Newspaper</a> on the World Wide Web. As far as this non-German speaking person can tell, it's an online newspaper produced by elementary school students about the life of ancient Romans. It sounds like a neat way to learn simultaneously about ancient and modern technologies.<P>

American history students with an interest in more modern times can take a virtual tour of  a typical <a href="http://tqd.advanced.org/3615/">Spanish Mission in California</a>, modeled on Mission San Juan Capistrano. As with the Villa Rustica, virtual tourists can visit the kitchen, living quarters and work areas to learn more about the people who once lived there. In addition to trying to convert Native Americans to Christianity, the Padres who ran a typical mission forced them to work building the missions as well as at metal craft, candlemaking and agriculture. <P>

A page at the site provides <a href="http://tqd.advanced.org/3615/teacher.shtml">information for teachers</a> who want to use it as a supplement to schoolwork. It includes technical information and tips for using the Web page to enrich classroom lessons. More and more classrooms are being  wired and more and more students and their parents expect schools to take advantage of the newest technologies. Teachers, afraid of becoming "roadkill on the Information Superhighway, will welcome this kind of help and support. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>
Web Reveals Barbie Art</font></center></b>


<font size =3>






<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


When I was about ten or so, I spent a good deal of my pocket money on Barbie clothes and paraphernalia. My mother was rather horrified, and tried her best to curb my passion. As soon as I showed signs of losing interest, my Barbies and their wardrobes were packed away. I have no idea what became of them.  I suspect they may have been civilian casualties in the Wars of the GI Joes that my youngest brother and his friends supervised in later years.<P>

<img src=tvreport.gif width=150 height=221 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

Although I liked my Barbie dolls, and spent my money on keeping them in style, I never wanted to be like Barbie. In addition to her inhuman figure, she has a really strange face. Though it has changed over the years, it has never looked quite right to me. She isn't cozy. In fact with those pointy little hooves she has for feet, she could put someone's eye out! Affection is not what I felt for her.<P>

No, it wasn't the face or the body that appealed to me. I just liked buying those clothes and "accessories," a word I thought of only in terms of Barbie. (Real grownups I knew had shoes and pocketbooks and gloves and hats and jewelry--not accessories.) <P>

Playing with Barbie was playing at conspicuous consumption, I guess.<P>

I find it hard to believe that Barbie should carry on her narrow plastic shoulders all the blame for the discomfort modern American women feel about their own looks. <P>

In the meantime, I've found the home page of a grown man -- a father, grandfather, and professional photographer -- who has tapped into some of the imaginative delight I remember feeling when I dressed Barbie up and did her hair and stuck those nasty little plastic earrings into the holes in the side of her head.<P>

<a href="http://www.erols.com/browndk/index.html">The Barbie Chronicles</a>, photographs by <a href="http://www.erols.com/browndk/dean.htm">Dean Brown</a> is hilarious. Although he warns that some images may not be suitable for children, there is a school of thought that holds that Barbie herself is not suitable for children. Proceed at your own risk: Naked Barbies ahead.
(Is it pornography? No. Is it a hoot? Yes!)<P>

According to his bio at the site, "Dean Brown has been making Barbie pictures since 1981 when a daughter gave him a Barbie for his birthday and suggested that the doll might make a good model."<P>

She was right. In the series titled the <a href="http://www.erols.com/browndk/perils.htm">Perils of Barbie</a>, you can consider images of Barbie as a witch, or about to be run over by a train or in a police lineup or lost in space or worse, much worse. There are other series, including Life with Barbie and the Homecoming Shoot. <P>

Best of all is <a href="http://www.erols.com/browndk/art.htm">Barbie's History of Art</a>. I couldn't stop laughing at picture after picture based on well-known works of art by Lucas Cranach, Peter Paul Rubens,  Carravagio, Gaugin, Degas, Lautrec, Fragonard and <a href="http://www.erols.com/browndk/nude.htm">Marcel Duchamp</a> all starring Barbies, Kens and the occasional G.I. Joe. So silly.<P>

But what about serious Barbie research? An Altavista search on Barbie doll turned up tens of thousands of sites, many selling special edition <a href="http://www.dgm-online.com/barbie/index.htm">dolls</a>, custom doll clothes, Barbies in high fashion outfits and all the things a Barbie fan might want. (I haven't tried to buy anything from any of these sites, and I have no idea whether it would be wise to do so.)<P>

On American Online, use the keyword Toys to go to a site with gossip about Barbie and chats for collectors, and downloadable images of the very first Barbie and several of her descendants. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Setting Up a Home Page?<BR>
Look to Web for Answers</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams and Robin Lind</center>

You've been 'Net surfing for some time, and you're more than half-tempted to set up a Homepage for your own business. You've seen some great small business Websites out there. Everywhere you hear about how important the Internet will be for business in the next century.<P>

If you decide to do business online, you must face the fact that you'll be a pioneer, even though there are millions of your co-pioneers out there. <P>

You have so many questions. After all, you're setting up a virtual storefront. You want people to be able to find you, and once they've found you, to want to return. Will your business actually benefit from an Internet presence? Will your customers be pleased to shop online? Or will they be annoyed by the frustrations of a slow day on the "World Wide Wait" (as the Web was called in a recent New York Times online article)? <P>

Then, the logistics. How much does a home page cost to make? How do you get it up onto the Web? Who maintains it? <P>

You won't be surprised to learn that there are no simple answers. But consider this range: you can rent three megabytes of space on one national Internet service for $5 a month; another in the same market charges $100; another wants $300.<P>

We know of one multi-national corporation that paid $60,000 to have a Website created last year. We know of another highly attractive and functional site that was done for well under $1,000.<P>

If you have to bring in a typewriter repairman to fix your "old reliable" you'll probably have to pay $75 an hour. Be prepared to spend at a similar rate for web page design although you can very likely find a cheaper rate in a college town with a good computer science program.<P>

As you surf the web, make note of the home pages you like. If you are inclined to buy something from an online merchant, figure out why. <P>

At the bottom of most home pages, you'll find a link inviting you to send feedback. On many pages, there is also a link to the page designer's home site. Go look at it. Email the designers and ask them about their services.<P>

If you are a do-it-yourself type, and you'd rather create your own Website, an Internet content provider such as <a href="http://www.AOL.com">AOL</a> might be the way to go.<P>

With membership in AOL, you are allowed a free two megabyte Homepage for personal or business use. Go to keyword "My Place" to find out more. <P>

You can design your AOL home page with Personal Publisher II (keyword "personalpublisher"). Start simply. As you learn more about Web authoring, you can develop a more sophisticated page. Help and advice on Web design, HTML authoring and publicizing your page on the Internet is all available from AOL as well, through the Web Toolkit, Web Diner, Desktop & Web Publishing Forum and the Pro's Corner.<P>

<img src=pagemaker.gif width=244 height=317 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

If you don't want to fool with AOL, and you already have some design skills you can use a graphic software package with web authoring tools, such as <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/pagemaker/main.html">Adobe PageMaker</a>. <P>

Fancy yourself as a closet propeller-head and want to try writing raw code? Try the <a href="http://the-inter.net/www/future21/html.html">Homepage Creation Center</a> where you can download free code editors and the latest versions of new browsers. Or you may want to visit the very core of the Web, maintained by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World Wide Web Consortium</a> at MIT, where the scientific community agrees on new standards and their implementations.<P>

Contact your Internet service provider to find out about getting your page online when you're done. <P>

Most of them will do it for a very reasonable price but a word of warning: don't be taken in by the latest creative use of fear tactics. Twice we've been told by prospective Web page hosts that their substantially higher rates are justified because they exclude pornography and we wouldn't have to worry about our Web site being on the Internet right next to something really gross.<P>

Hunnh? we may look dumb, ... but do we really look that dumb?<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Science Pages<BR>Push The Envelope<BR>
</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

You love science. Your daydreams are about fractals.  You wish you could find a significant other who shared your enthusiasm for prime numbers ...<P>

It may not be an adequate substitute but if fractals, black holes, mazes for the mind, and endless computer-generated caverns interest you at all, <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/home.htm">Clifford A. Pickover's Home Page</a> is a web site you have to visit.<P>

<img src=pickover.gif width=311 height=240 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

Pickover, a Yale Ph.D. and research staff member with IBM, has written more than a dozen books, with titles such as, "Black Holes -- A Traveler's Guide," "Computers, Pattern, Chaos and Beauty," and "Frontiers of Scientific Visualization." For more on his interests and achievements, you can read his online <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/biog.html">biography</a>. His Home Page offers a good deal more than books for sale though.<P>

Pickover's Wishing Project is a thought-provoking scheme. He's collecting wishes people would make if they knew they would come true. Click on the hyperlink next to the revolving 3-D smiley face to enter your own wish, read a sample of wishes others have made, and download a fractal image of a magic wishing pebble. <P>

If wishing isn't for you, scroll down the page to test your skill on puzzles like "Welcome to <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/discov.htm">Worm World</a>, or look at computer graphics like the <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/cave.htm">Virtual Caverns</a>, or a simulated fossil seashell. Incidentally, the seashell is interesting, but it doesn't look like any <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/nip.gif">fossil seashell</a> I've ever seen. In fact, it looks more like 1960s-revival Op-Art sculpture -- maybe a lamp? a paperweight? I'm sure I saw one somewhere in a college dorm in the dim past.<P>

Trigonometry fans will definitely want to consider the question: Are Infinite <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/carotid.htm">Carotid-Kundalini Functions</a> Fractal? "The humble sine waves that lie at the very foundation of trigonometry have a special beauty all their own. It takes just a little coddling to bring the beauty out. But who would guess, for example, that intricate fractal patterns lurk within the cosine operation applied to real numbers?" says Pickover. If that thrills you, you'll find more where it came from, including programs for your own PC.<P>

Don't think you're going to find out about the current offerings from Hollywood when you click on Pickover's Movie Server. Not at all. Instead you'll find animated lava lites, virtual caverns and such. Not exactly thrilling to the amateur, but if you know about these things, you may be impressed by his virtuosity.<P>

When you've finished exploring Pickover's Page, follow links under <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/picks.html">Pickover's Picks</a> to some fascinating destinations. IBM's <a href="http://www.ibm.com/eos/">The Electric Origami Shop</a> is  a good place to start. Click on "High Tech Art" and you'll discover such treasures as the <a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/gallery.html">STM Image Gallery</a>. Art in the gallery is created by <a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/atomo.html#stm10">moving individual atoms</a> with a scanning tunneling microscope. The most famous of these is first of the genre, titled "The Beginning," 35-atoms of xenon on a background of nickel that spell out the letters IBM. There are many others.<P>

If art is not your thing, you can go to the <a href="http://www3.hursley.ibm.com/moodn/mood.html">Mood Ringo</a> and discover the mood of the Internet or add your own mood to the list. Choices range from Euphoric to Incredibly Grumpy. Sports fans can look at the Kasparov vs. Big Blue <a href="http://www.chess.ibm.park.org/">Chess tournament</a> pages. <P>

Pickover's page and the sites he sends you to are wonderfully intense and frivolous at the same time. Creators of some of these pages are obviously brilliant, but I often was left scratching my head at the results of their work. <P>

More than once, I asked myself: "Why are they doing this?"<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Thanksgiving Recipes Abound<BR>On The Web</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

With weather that is usually cool and energizing and a feast that is (relatively) healthy and predictable, Thanksgiving is my favorite of all the holidays. It's a gathering time without the glitter and stress of Christmas or the chocolate overdoses of Easter. <P>

<img src=turkey.gif width=150 height=190 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

Many years ago, I invited my parents, siblings, and in-laws, to join us for Thanksgiving. Our house was almost finished -- we were still renting a house nearby -- and the power company worked overtime Wednesday evening to get us electricity. <P>

The carpenters had cleared out the living room: it was unpainted, unfinished and unfurnished but we managed to bring in a huge old family table and an eclectic collection of chairs that helped make it a memorable house-warming celebration. <P>

Everyone brought contributions to the meal, and I prepared the bird -- going to new lengths of culinary foolhardiness. <P>

I'd read a Julia Child recipe in Parade Magazine, and I tackled it enthusiastically. I boned the turkey, leaving in the leg and wing bones, working from the back so the skin stayed in one piece. Then I reassembled the bird, alternating stuffing and sliced breast meat (freeze for an hour or two so you can make neat slices), sewed up the skin in back, trussed it up so it looked like it still had its bones, and roasted. <P>

I hear the groans and moans of efficient cooks everywhere. Why go through all that pain, when you can roast a delicious bird with a tiny fraction of the energy? All you really need to do is turn on the oven, discard the little paper package of guts, throw a lemon and an onion into the cavity, grease, salt and pepper the outside, and cook until the little plastic thingy pops up. Directions are on the package.<P>

Still, that turkey was a memorable bird. The clincher came when we all sat down to the table, my father at the head, and realized we didn't have a carving knife. My father was distressed on my behalf, but bravely took a serving spoon to the bird at my direction. Needless to say, the reaction when the bird fell into neat slices was most satisfactory.<P>

I lost Julia Child's recipe immediately after that Thanksgiving, but that hasn't prevented me from trying to recreate it ever since. Sometimes I have more success than others.<P>

In preparation for this year's bird, I searched the Internet for recipes and found many. Julia's still eludes me, but one day I'll find it, I'm sure. In the meantime I found lots of sites with a surprising number of variations on the theme of Roast Turkey, few straying far from the traditional. <P>

The recipe for the <a href="http://www.cyber-kitchen.com/recipes/Roast_Turkey.htm">Ultimate Roast Turkey</a> from Mimi's Cyber Kitchen contains a clue: "...jazzy isn't what people are looking for in a turkey."<P>

As fancy as I get with the presentation, I stick with simple stuffings. Cornbread or whole wheat bread? chestnuts? oysters? sage? or green apples?  Celery and onions are taken for granted. One year I mixed in a thawed package of chopped spinach, and that was good.<P>

As always on the Web, I found new ideas. <a href="http://homearts.com/rb/food/11thanf1.htm">Redbook</a> magazine suggests stuffing the bird with fresh fruits and sticking <a href="http://homearts.com/helpers/cooking/11thanb1.htm">fresh sage leaves</a> under the skin. The newsgroup <a href="ftp://ftp.neosoft.com/pub/rec.food.recipes/poultry/roast-turkey06">rec.food.recipes</a> has a recipe for turkey with chestnut stuffing. <a href="http://homearts.com/helpers/cooking/11goltur.htm">Good Housekeeping</a> offers three stuffings: country sausage and cornbread, wild rice, and chestnut and apple. The <a href="http://www.butterball.com/butterball/recipe.html">Butterball home page</a> has <a href="http://www.butterball.com/butterball/old_favs.html">Southern peanut and oyster stuffing</a> and toasted <a href="http://www.butterball.com/butterball/cor-stuf.html">Pecan, Cider and Cornbread stuffing</a> for the traditionalists. For those who are looking for a change, Butterball also has couscous dressing with shrimp and spicy sausage.<P>

I don't know what I'm going to do yet. All of them sound intriguing. And then there are side dishes. Naturally we'll have <a href="http://www.broccoli.com">broccoli</a>, something with cranberries, and garlic mashed potatoes, but then what? Braised shallots with balsamic vinegar? Green beans Caesar? Sigh.  And what's for dessert? Pumpkin mousse? Perhaps not. I'll know it when I see it.<P>

I'm already anticipating the post-turkey walk through the woods to work off all this nourishment!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Use Tripod to Understand GenXers </font></center></b>


<font size =3>





<img src=tripod1.gif width=242 height=118 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



He's the one with the nose-ring who calls you by your first name, uninvited. <P>

She's the one who shaves (her head). <P>

More and more of them are showing up in the workplace. One will soon be in your office, interviewing for a job, or across the table, negotiating a merger.<P>

Generation X seems strange to all of us who aren't part of it. The nickname refers to people roughly between the ages of 18 and 35. Their generation may be best defined by technological progress and information. <P>

They grew up on video games and MTV; they grew up alongside personal computers.<P>

They're used to dealing with sensory overload.<P>

Today, they're in college and in the work force, and the effect is being felt throughout the business world. <P>

These are people who, generally speaking, don't have the ingrained respect for authority that their elders had. For one thing, they've seen their parents' work situation change utterly. When Gen-Xers were little, their parents believed corporate loyalty would be repaid with pensions and carefree retirement. <P>

Now that Gen-Xers are in the work force themselves, they see their parents struggling to re-learn  skills for a workplace in which layoffs are the norm and transportable job skills are a prerequisite to success.<P>

Gen-Xers aren't going to be caught off balance. Many of them are busily learning and sharing the skills they'll need to survive in the fairly harsh work environment they've inherited.<P>

Though I'm using the common nickname here, this generation doesn't like being labeled and neatly pigeonholed any more than those that went before them, from the Boomers, to the Woodstock Generation to the Me-Generation. After all they are as different from one another as they can be, even though they have certain characteristics in common.<P>



One site where those of us who work with Gen-Xers can find clues to understanding them is <a href="http://www.tripod.com">Tripod</a>: Tools for Life.  The "Tools for Life" may also be useful to us Non-Xers. <P>

This is how Tripod describes itself:<P>

"Jobs don't last. Careers don't last! Health is a struggle rather than a natural fact. Skill lets you travel farther than money will -- a lot farther. Saving money? You know you have to, but how? Too often, community is found in places other than where we live."<P>

These are serious people who try to face life's challenges with a sense of humor. Their site is divided into sections titled Work & Money, Politics & Community, Living & Travel, Planet Tripod, and the Daily Scoop. 	<P>

Under Work & Travel, for example, you can read articles about looking for work, dealing with work, working for yourself, skill building, saving money, and managing and investing money.  Solid stuff, to be sure, but presented with a light touch. You'll also find book reviews, interviews, surveys, Tripod's Career Safari, the Resume Builder, and a Budget Calculator. <P>

"<a href="http://www.tripod.com/work/archive/tulgan.html">X Nuggets</a>," is a series of columns "on the role of the transition generation of 18-to-34 year-olds in the ongoing workplace revolution" by Bruce Tulgan, author of "Managing Generation X." You should have a look, whether you want insight into your fellow workers or advice and counsel for your own career.<P>

The site is amusingly designed, but without the mind-boggling graphics that can obscure good writing on otherwise useful and informative sites, such as <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/">HotWired</a>. <P>

Tripod also sends out a regular email <a href="http://www.tripod.com/service/newsletter/">newsletter</a> with information about new additions to the site. More information is available at the site.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Readers Digest Helps You<BR>Stay At Home and Dine Out </font></center></b>


<font size =3>






<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



Many years ago, I read about a stunt by some famous chef or other. I think it was the late great Pierre Franey who wrote so wonderfully for the New York Times, or his equally stellar colleague, Craig Claiborne. In any case, it was someone of that caliber.<P>

This chef went into ordinary American homes and created a meal from whatever he found available in the pantry and the refrigerator. Although I can't remember the details, I remember my pleasure at the creative brilliance with which the chef took things like iceberg lettuce, ketchup, canned tuna, maybe even Spam (!?) or Miracle Whip and made one wonderful--or at least edible--meal after another. <P>

To this day, I remember that experiment whenever it's a day or so after I should have gone to the grocery store. I stand in front of the kitchen cabinet and try to figure out what I can assemble the odds and ends into that everyone will eat...and enjoy. You see, I'd do anything to avoid going out of the house on a foraging mission so late in the day.<P>

<img src=digest.gif width=184 height=98 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

I was really pleased when I came across the brand new <a href="http://www.readersdigest.com">Reader's Digest Online</a> interactive web site, because there I thought I'd found the Web version of this mind-stretching exercise I experience from time to time.<P>

The section titled "What's in the Pantry" invites you to check the things you have in your pantry, and claims the search engine will return recipes you can use for dinner. "Don't order out again!" reads the blurb. "Tell us what's left in your cupboard, and we'll give you fast, delicious recipes."<P>

Yes! <P>

I was a little over-excited I guess. I didn't come down to earth right away, even when I noticed that the list was fairly general: chicken, leafy greens, pasta, eggs, beans, etc. I scrolled down the list, checking boxes, then clicked on  the bar at the bottom of the screen. The search engine worked away for a while, then returned a list of 90 recipes, each using at least one of the ingredients I'd checked. Problem was they all had lots of other ingredients that I didn't have. I guess there were a couple, such as cheese risotto, that I could have made without leaving the house, but I was disappointed.  <P>

I clicked on a recipe or two anyway. They're simple, well organized, and include a photograph and nutritional information as well as clear instructions. After my initial chagrin, I found several of the recipes sounded good, and I expect I'll try 'em out.<P>

Each recipe is presented as an introduction, followed by a series of steps, each on a screen by itself. At the bottom of the right-hand column (if you are using a browser with frames), you can click on the words preview and print. The whole thing is then presented as a single column. <P>

Take my advice and select the whole thing, cut and paste it into your word processing program, and reformat it, if you want to print it. As formatted on this site, a simple recipe takes up several pages, which isn't useful if you plan to save it in your recipe clippings file for future reference.<P>

This is not the only recipe site you should keep in your permanent bookmark file, or even the best among those available. Still, it's fun, and the basic idea, though flawed, is a good one. <P>

The rest of the <a href="http://www.readersdigest.com/*TEMPLATE=/rd/editorial/htp/index.htp@session=fmw45)">Reader's Digest At Home</a> site, with sections such as <a href="http://www.readersdigest.com/:o555*TEMPLATE=/rd/editorial/htp/by.htp@session=fmw45@cat=by@p_node=o555@FROM_WHERE=by">Backyard</a>, <a href="http://www.readersdigest.com/:o545*TEMPLATE=/rd/editorial/htp/hp.htp@session=fmw45@cat=hp@p_node=o545@FROM_WHERE=hp">Home Projects</a>, <a href="http://www.readersdigest.com/:o575*TEMPLATE=/rd/editorial/htp/rx.htp@session=fmw45@cat=rx@p_node=o575@FROM_WHERE=rx">Your Health</a> and <a href="http://www.readersdigest.com/:o585*TEMPLATE=/rd/editorial/htp/ht.htp@session=fmw45@cat=ht@p_node=o585@FROM_WHERE=ht">How-To Library</a>, contains all those sorts of useful articles and directions for projects that "the little Book" is famous for.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Gene Mapping Site<BR>Offers Hereditary Clues</font></center></b>


<font size =3>






<P><I>"The Human Genome Project is expected to produce a sequence of DNA representing the functional blueprint and evolutionary history of the human species."</I><P>
--Gene Map Web Site, National Center for Biotechnology<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

<P>This one is wa-a-ay over my head, thought I, when I ran across the Web site of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/science96/">The Human Genome Map</a>.

<P>But it looked intriguing. After all, it's about us -- human beings -- and how too complicated can that be?

<img src=genomemap.gif width=207 height=314 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

<P>Well, to start with I had to go to my dictionary and look up Genome. Webster's defines it as: "one haploid set of chromosomes with the genes they contain." Haploid. Right.

<P>(If you want to more of a definition, I suggest you go to the site, open a second window on your Web browser to connect to <a href="http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster">Webster's online</a>, and then switch back and forth while puzzling it out).

<P>To most of us, surfing this site will be like picking up a graduate level textbook in an unfamiliar subject. But if that were the whole story, I wouldn't be writing this article. 

<P>You see, in addition to lots of big words, the site has hyperlinks to all kinds of information about hereditary diseases -- one of the things you get from genes.

<P>Apparently there has been a lot of controversy among top scientists about whether this even ought to be on the Internet, available to all and sundry. Much of it is apparently raw data, and scientists are notoriously sensitive about releasing data that might change, 

<P>"Progress in understanding is best achieved by the free exchange of knowledge and ideas," writes David R. Bentley in the October 25, 1996, "<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/science/content/current/#special">Genome Issue</a>" of Science Magazine. The title of his article " Genomic Sequence Information Should Be Released Immediately and Freely in the Public Domain," contains his argument in a nutshell. 

<P>A lot of it is incomprehensible to the non-scientist. Even those of us who can remember that RNA and DNA are somehow arranged in a double helix; that tens of thousands of genes carrying human traits such as hair color, intelligence and all are strung together like beads into twenty-some chromosomes; that females have two X chromosomes and males an X and a Y; will find the actual gene maps mystifying. With their mysterious alphanumeric labels they seem to be all in code -- which they are.	

<P>That's fine and dandy, you say, but so what? What's it got to do with me? What would a normal, non-scientist find of interest at this esoteric site. The answer is that anyone with concerns about the various diseases and conditions in which genetics play a role, should have a look at this site. These range from Alzheimer's to Cystic Fibrosis, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/SCIENCE96/gene?HD">Huntington's Disease</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/SCIENCE96/gene?IDDM1">Juvenile Onset Diabetes</a>, to obesity and Wilson's disease. 

<P>So leave all the numbers and arguments to the scientists and proceed to the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/SCIENCE96/genelist">Featured Genes</a> page. There you'll see a table with of inherited disorders in one column, alphanumeric gene labels in the second and the number or letter of the chromosome on which the gene appears in the third. This plain chart masks a wealth of information for people who live under the threat of inherited disorders or who fear for their families or loved ones.

<P>For example, click on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/SCIENCE96/gene?AD3">AD3</a>, the gene associated with a  form of Alzheimer's. There you'll find a simple description of the disease, an image of the brain abnormalities associated with it, a picture of Ronald Reagan who has Alzheimer's, and 800-numbers and web addresses for the <a href="http://www.alz.org">Alzheimer's Association</a> and the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center. For scientists, there are links to further information, such as that in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database.

<P>Similar information, links and images are on the other sites: some attractive, such as Mary Tyler Moore, International Chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International; some less so, such as a cross section of the brain of a patient with Huntington's disease. 

<P>So don't be put off by the lofty academic appearance of this site. There's something here for everyone.

<center><b><font size =6>"How Can You Profit<BR>From The Internet?"</font></center></b>

<P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


It's a question everyone asks and a "seminar" I attended recently promised the answer.<P>

With about 50 others who gave up their lunch hour, I found myself among listening to an earnest young entrepreneur offering the opportunity to be rich beyond our wildest dreams.<P>

After reeling off incredible (but true) statistics of the Internet's phenomenal expansion, our seminar leader explained that making money on the Web was like shooting fish in a barrel. "Here's the barrel," he said. "Here are the fish. And when you come to our workshop, we'll give you the gun!"<P>

Pushing aside visions of being splashed by raw fish guts and cold water, I listened with growing interest. <P>

<img src=imall.gif width=250 height=250 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

Our speaker was attractive and expensively dressed. He told us stories about his parents, his children, his own business success. He had already made lots of money. Now he wanted to help others get rich.<P>



He wanted to tell us about "<a href="http://www.imall.com">iMALL</a>" on the Internet: a virtual mall in cyberspace with 40 to 50 million potential customers every day of the year, 24 hours a day.<P>

All we had to do to make our fortune was sell classifieds and Web sites. iMall's professional staff would take care of all the technical details. We didn't even have to have a computer. Just open the envelopes and deposit the checks. We could make all the money we'd ever need.<P>

If we went to his workshop; the instructors would show us how to sell to folks everywhere who are all eager to get on the 'Net. <P>

Kapow! Splash! Kapow!<P>

All this would be revealed for only $3,000 but the workshop for this entire region would only have room for 40 people. A $500 deposit today would reserve my place. I wouldn't have to worry about being shut out. I had to act now!<P>

Was I persuaded? <P>

Well, another member of the audience told me "I don't think I'll throw my deposit into the plate... but my bad knee? Suddenly the pain is gone. I can walk again. I want to come forward and witness, to touch the hem of his garment, to shout Hallelujah!, to let people know I've been saved ...Perhaps I'll take out a classified, under Personals: Announcements: Healed!"<P>

Though I didn't sign up, I did log onto the Internet when I got home and had a look at iMall. It boasted 6.7 million "hits" in September and (if true) that's pretty darn impressive.<P>

The design is appealing. I used "<a href="http://www.imall.com/search/search.shtml">Power Shopping</a>" to search their database for food and it returned dozens of sites, selling everything from Amish noodles to nuts and berries from the Pacific Northwest.<P>

The sites I encountered were attractive and easy to navigate. Many of them even had online order forms. I bookmarked several, especially <a href="https://www.imall.com/imall/Specialty_Shops/jakehouse/jakehouse.html">JakeHouse</a>, which sells Christmas greenery and <a href="https://www.imall.com/stores/wldabtor/wldabtor.html">Wild About Oregon</a>, which had a special on fiddlehead ferns (a Northwestern delicacy).<P>

I was actually looking for a specific site that had been mentioned at the seminar as an example of a typical Internet marketing success story. I thought we were told <a href="http://hot.presence.com/">Hot Hot Hot</a> -- "The 'Net's coolest hot sauce shop."-- was an iMall success story.<P>

I was surprised not to find it with the Power Shopping search.<P>

I cranked up AltaVista, and there it was: not on iMall's server at all. In fact, it turns out to have been designed by a group of former NASA consultants who now design web pages as part of <a href="http://www.presence.com/presence/history/">Presence Information Design</a>. Since HHH's just about to celebrate its second birthday this fall, it may in fact be the oldest revenue producing site on the Web.<P>

No mention of iMALL at all. Besides, iMALL just got started this year....I must have misheard. But if they get 40 people to sign up for that workshop at $3,000 each ... well, I reckon someone will profit from the Internet.<P>
